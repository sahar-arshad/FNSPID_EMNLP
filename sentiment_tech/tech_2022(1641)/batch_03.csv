2022-12-14 00:00:00+00:00,Alphabet (GOOGL) Bolsters Waymo Efforts With Latest Move,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alphabet-googl-bolsters-waymo-efforts-with-latest-move,,,"Alphabet’s GOOGL self-driving unit Waymo, which has been running well on the streets of San Francisco, CA on the back of its Early Rider program called Trusted Tester, has now applied for a final permit in California at the California Public Utilities Commission.

With the help of this final permit, Waymo will be able to sell its self-driving car rides in San Francisco.

Notably, the latest application by Waymo might take months to get approved.

The latest move bodes well for the company’s deepening focus on making its autonomous vehicles popular in San Francisco.

Recently, Waymo started welcoming people to hail a ride in a self-driving Jaguar I-Pace. Booking for pickups is available via the Waymo One app.

Waymo’s arrival in San Francisco marks its very first expansion outside Phoenix, AZ.

Expanding Waymo Efforts
The recent step is in sync with the company’s strengthening efforts toward expanding its operations and fleet and making the vehicles more rider-friendly.

The company is also gearing up to make its ride-hailing vehicles fully driverless on the streets of San Francisco.

Further, Waymo in Bellevue marks Alphabet’s second Waymo expansion outside Phoenix, AZ.

Waymo launched a rider-only service in downtown Phoenix, where it has been operating its autonomous vehicles with a company specialist seated in the driver's seat until now. The service in downtown Phoenix will be confined to a specific area, which is constrained by Interstate 17 on the west and south, Camelback Road on the north and 44th Street on the east.

Waymo plans to roll out the driverless robotaxi service to regular passengers and expand its operating area eventually in downtown Phoenix.

Apart from these efforts, Alphabet’s partnership with Geely, a China-based automotive company, remains noteworthy. Per the terms of the deal, Geely’s electric mobility brand, Zeekr, will design and develop electric vehicles for Waymo, into which Waymo Driver will be integrated.

The vehicles will be introduced on the roads of the United States first. With the Geely partnership, Waymo will expand its Waymo One fleet.

The above-mentioned endeavors will help Alphabet further penetrate the booming autonomous driving space.

According to a Fortune Business Insights report, the global autonomous car market is expected to reach $11.03 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 31.3% between 2021 and 2028.

Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the worldwide driverless vehicle market is expected to see a CAGR of 18.06% between 2021 and 2026.

We believe that Alphabet’s growing prospects in this promising market will help it win investors’ confidence in the days ahead.

Coming to the price performance, Alphabet has lost 34% on a year-to-date basis against the industry’s decline of 36.1%.
Intensifying Competition
Given the upbeat scenario, not only Alphabet but companies like Intel INTC, Amazon AMZN and Baidu BIDU are also making every effort to capitalize on the growth prospects in the autonomous driving space.

Intel is gaining from the low power consumption of Mobileye chips and the ability to create maps for self-driving systems. The company plans to introduce a pilot program for autonomous taxis and ride-hailing services in Munich and Tel Aviv in 2022.

In April 2022, the company gave a sneak peek at its robotaxi ride by rolling out a video of a 40-minute autonomous car ride around Jerusalem.

In addition to this, Mobileye’s partnership with German electric mobility unit Benteler EV Systems and Beep to develop and deploy self-driving, fully electric shuttles in the United States by 2024 remains noteworthy.

Amazon’s buyout of Zoox, a developer of autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, remains a major positive. The company’s launch of its first self-driving robotaxi strengthened its position in the autonomous driving space.

Currently, the company is gearing up to test its robotaxi in California. It has applied for a permit in California to test-drive its vehicles.

Zoox intends to open an engineering office and operations facility this year, which will act as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing.

Meanwhile, Baidu is gaining from the strong momentum of Apollo Go Robotaxi service across China on the back of its increasing availability in several cities and a growing number of rides.

Apollo Go is available in 10 cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Changsha, Cangzhou, Yangquan, Wuzhen Water Town and Wuhan.

Nevertheless, Alphabet’s growing autonomous driving initiatives are likely to help it stay ahead of the curve.

2022-12-14 00:00:00+00:00,INSIGHT-Energy politics cloud Mexican bid to join U.S. semiconductor rush,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/insight-energy-politics-cloud-mexican-bid-to-join-u.s.-semiconductor-rush,,,"By Dave Graham
MEXICO CITY, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Mexico's hopes of reaping an investment windfall from a U.S. drive to boost North American semiconductor production risk foundering on companies' concerns over energy supply, overdependence on fossil fuels, and a lack of financial incentives.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in September a $52.7 billion U.S. bill known as the Chips Act would also create ""significant opportunities"" for Mexico in the energy and water-intensive semiconductor industry.
But according to interviews with over a dozen people privy to investment discussions, if Mexico does not move quickly to improve power transmission networks and renewable energy access, as well as craft competitive incentives, it may lose out.
To create those jobs, the country must allay business fears over electricity supply sparked by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's campaign to give market control to Mexico's cash-strapped, fossil-fuel dependent national energy companies.
His pursuit of ""energy sovereignty"" by helping utility Comision Federal de Electricidad and state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos while limiting privately-funded renewable output has flummoxed manufacturers trying to lower their carbon footprint.
""Mexico's current energy policy is severely undercutting the country's ability to attract new investment, especially when it comes to strategic sectors such as the semiconductor industry,"" said Neil Herrington, senior vice president for the Americas at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Lopez Obrador's office did not reply to requests for comment for this story.
Used in industries from telecoms, defense and carmaking to computing, semiconductors hit the headlines during the COVID-19 pandemic when supply dried up, causing serious production bottlenecks in global manufacturing.
Unlike the United States, Mexico has yet to spell out what inducements it will offer firms to help North America reduce reliance on semiconductor hubs like Taiwan in light of protracted uncertainty in U.S.-China relations.
""The government has done almost nothing on attracting investment and incentives,"" said Roberto Arechederra, economy minister of the opposition-run western state of Jalisco, whose capital Guadalajara is known as Mexico's Silicon Valley.
Lopez Obrador, a leftist resource nationalist, says conditions for investors are ""unbeatable"", and points to foreign direct investment headed for its best year in nearly a decade.
But gross fixed investment remains 11% lower than when he was elected in mid-2018, official data show.
Officials, executives and lawmakers say without a better power grid, the Mexican semiconductor push will struggle. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm had in January already warned Mexico's treatment of energy firms could hamper growth.
""You can't do stuff like that if you want to be a team player,"" said Henry Cuellar, a Democratic congressman who chairs the U.S.-Mexico Interparliamentary Group. ""Especially in being part of a North American supply chain. It's all inter-related.""
Mexico has vowed to present nearshoring incentives by the end of February, and Economy Minister Raquel Buenrostro said last week a planned business corridor in southern Mexico could become a center for semiconductor investment.
States like Jalisco, home to a major Intel Corp INTC.O facility, are offering their own incentives like tax breaks and cheap land, said minister Arechederra.
Much of the impetus for cooperation on semiconductors originated in Mexico, executives say.
In June 2021, Carlos Salazar, then-president of Mexico's Business Coordinating Council, pitched the idea to U.S. Commerce chief Raimondo on a visit to Washington, he told Reuters.
Pledges to strengthen supply chains followed, and in August 2022 Mexico held a conference targeting semiconductor investment with firms including Intel and Skyworks Solutions Inc SWKS.O, a major employer in the border city of Mexicali.
Josep Marce, Skyworks' vicepresident of operations in Mexico, urged the country to seize the window of opportunity.
That means Mexico needs to keep investing in energy and water infrastructure, and do so sustainably, he told Reuters, pointing to clients' pledges to help tackle global warming.
While industry giants such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW and Intel have announced multibillion dollar investments on the U.S. side of the border, Mexico has yet to unveil major projects that could supply those factories.
""The United States is thinking regionally, Mexico is still thinking as one country,"" said Luis Manuel Hernandez, head of Mexican manufacturing export industry group Index. ""If we want to be at the big table, we need to take different decisions.""
GOLDEN AGE?
In July, tensions over energy boiled over into a formal dispute with United States and Canada, who argue Mexico is discriminating against their companies.
On Monday, Mexico's government said it wanted the spat resolved to give companies confidence to invest in the country.
Lopez Obrador says past, corrupt governments rigged the energy market to favor private interests at the state's expense.
In Jalisco, national energy policy has put on hold seven private renewable power projects - five solar and two wind - encompassing $1.1 billion in total investment, according to figures from the state's energy agency.
Businesses are taking note, especially in carmaking.
Julian Eaves at CW Bearing, a Chinese-owned automotive supplier in central Mexico, said firms want to leverage the country's location and competitive labor costs.
But winning new business depends on firms showing customers how they will lower global emissions -- a goal government policies are hindering, he said.
""This is a potential golden age for Mexico,"" said Eaves, CW's director of operations and manufacturing for North America. ""But it hasn't evolved to meet market requirements.""
Francisco Fiorentini, executive vice president of industrial park developer PIMSA in Mexicali, estimated that if government policy was not inhibiting power supply, foreign investment in the state of Baja California could have been up to 45% higher.
Mexicali became a warning beacon for investors in 2020 when Lopez Obrador canceled a largely completed billion-dollar Constellation Brands brewery there after holding a referendum against the plant, arguing it jeopardized water supply.
Hernandez of Index said Baja California and Chihuahua, another border state closely integrated with the U.S. economy, had during the past three years lacked about 1.8 Gigawatts of combined power supply to capitalize on existing demand.
Mexico has made progress working with academia to accelerate training of engineers and analyzing where U.S. firms could convert factory floors to focus on assembly, packaging and testing of semiconductors, said Monica Duhem, who until October oversaw efforts at the economy ministry to lure investment.
But though the president would privately reassure businesses that investing in Mexico was worthwhile, his frequent public denunciations of energy firms fed doubts, she said.
""Multinationals said to me: 'What's your strategy on transitioning to renewable energy?'"" Duhem recalled.
There are signs policy is shifting.
Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said recently Mexico needed to invest $50 billion to double its renewable power capacity by 2030 as he discussed investment in semiconductors with executives in the border city of Tijuana.
""If you're not producing with clean energy,"" he said, ""you won't be able to export to the United States.""

2022-12-13 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Launches Its Best High-End Graphics Card in Years,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-launches-its-best-high-end-graphics-card-in-years,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has long struggled to compete with rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the priciest segment of the graphics card market, where performance is king. AMD's RX 7900 series graphics cards still fall a bit short of NVIDIA's best, particularly in games that make heavy use of ray tracing, but the gap is smaller than it's been in a long time.
The best value, but not the best performance
Prior to the launch of AMD's RX 7900 series, PC gamers who wanted the absolute best performance and cutting-edge features had two choices: The $1,199 RTX 4080 or the $1,599 RTX 4090, both from NVIDIA. Because these cards are new and in short supply, real-world prices are much higher. As it stands today, an RTX 4090 will set you back more than $2,000 if you buy from Amazon.
AMD's RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX undercut NVIDIA on price, with suggested prices of $899 and $999, respectively. The company reportedly has more than 200,000 of these cards available for launch, so it's possible real-world prices won't be dramatically higher than suggested prices.
The first reviews of AMD's new cards are in, and the main takeaway is that the top-tier RX 7900 XTX is a potent entry in the high-end graphics card market. AMD still can't touch the far more expensive RTX 4090 in terms of pure performance, but it does provide a solid alternative to the RTX 4080.
There's one caveat here: Ray tracing is still a weak spot for AMD. In video games that don't use ray tracing, by using the highest settings at a 4K resolution, the reviewer website Tom's Hardware found that AMD's RX 7900 XTX edged out the pricier RTX 4080 by a few percentage points overall. That's a good result given AMD's card is priced $200 lower.
But in titles that do use ray tracing, NVIDIA's RTX 4080 takes a commanding lead. In fact, NVIDIA's last-gen RTX 3090 Ti beats out AMD's new cards by a sizable margin.
AMD's new graphics cards aren't going to win over gamers who want the absolute best performance no matter the cost, and they aren't going to win over gamers who view ray-tracing performance as important.
But for anyone who wants to be in the ballpark of the best performance, doesn't care all that much about ray tracing, and is unwilling to pay extreme prices for an NVIDIA graphics card, AMD's RX 7900 series should be very appealing.
A good sign for 2023
While AMD is still unable to match the performance of NVIDIA's most expensive card, the fact that the company got as close as it did with the RX 7900 series is a positive sign. As both NVIDIA and AMD fill out their graphics card lineups in 2023 by launching cards at lower price points and going after the higher-volume portions of the market, AMD should be in a good competitive position.
Since ray tracing is so computationally demanding, it matters a lot less for lower-end cards. Outside of ray tracing, AMD's RX 7900 series puts on a show. NVIDIA's ray tracing advantage will be much less meaningful in the mainstream graphics card market, so AMD should be able to trade blows with whatever NVIDIA puts out.
A possible spoiler is Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). The company entered the discrete graphics card market earlier this year, focusing on mainstream cards with prices topping out at $349. Intel's cards are somewhat hobbled by software issues, but the company is making progress on that front. It will be a three-horse race at lower price points, which is probably not a good thing for AMD.
NVIDIA is still the king of the cost-is-no-object portion of the graphics card market, but AMD has put up a strong showing with its RX 7900 series. With Intel in the mix as well, 2023 is shaping up to be the most competitive year for the graphics card market in a long time.

2022-12-13 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) Gains But Lags Market: What You Should Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-gains-but-lags-market%3A-what-you-should-know-3,,,"Intel (INTC) closed the most recent trading day at $28.73, moving +0.14% from the previous trading session. The stock lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.73%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.31%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.01%.
Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's largest chipmaker had lost 5.47% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.58% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.09% in that time.
Investors will be hoping for strength from Intel as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Intel is projected to report earnings of $0.23 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 78.9%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $14.5 billion, down 25.76% from the year-ago period.
Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $1.97 per share and revenue of $63.51 billion. These totals would mark changes of -63.99% and -18.6%, respectively, from last year.
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Intel. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.
Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.2% higher. Intel currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
Digging into valuation, Intel currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 14.6. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 14.6, so we one might conclude that Intel is trading at a no noticeable deviation comparatively.
It is also worth noting that INTC currently has a PEG ratio of 1.95. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Semiconductor - General was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.01 at yesterday's closing price.
The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 93, which puts it in the top 37% of all 250+ industries.
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

2022-12-13 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Intel, Broadcom, and AMD Stocks Popped This Morning",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-broadcom-and-amd-stocks-popped-this-morning,,,"What happened
News headlines this morning are dominated by the U.S. Department of Labor's announcement that inflation in November was up ""only"" 7.1% over a year ago -- good news, given that most economists were predicting 7.3% inflation.
Investors are responding positively, with semiconductor stocks in particular benefiting today. That's probably due to hope that decelerating inflation will convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates only 50 basis points at tomorrow's meeting, rather than the 75 basis points that have characterized the past several hikes.
Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) gained 3.8% through 10 a.m. ET on Tuesday, and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) rose 3.9%, while Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) led the chips sector higher with a 5.5% gain.
So what
Semiconductor stocks would benefit from lower interest rates at the federal level. But that's not what we're getting. We're probably getting (in the best case, I suspect) is another 50-basis-point hike in interest rates on Wednesday. This will slow the economy less than a 75-point hike, but will still slow the economy and raise the cost of debt -- and both Intel and Broadcom carry a lot of debt; AMD less so..
Nor is this the only worry semiconductor investors have today.
The Chinese government is about to announce plans to give its semiconductor industry $143 billion in new subsidies for production, as Reuters just reported. Beijing has two aims with this move: First, to counteract U.S. technology restrictions on exports of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China. And second, to respond to the Biden Administration's giving about $77 billion in subsidies to semiconductor manufacturersin the U.S.
Now what
All this taxpayer money being poured into semiconductor makers means companies' costs will fall as the two governments do much of the heavy lifting. And that will boost production -- and profits -- for semiconductor companies.
Some $220 billion combined in subsidies in just the U.S. and China alone is likely to encourage production of more semiconductors. But with the supply of chips shifting from deficit to oversupply already -- even before the subsidies arrive -- such increased production could result in overproduction. This could cause the price and profit margins on chips to fall.
And the competition over which country can subsidize semiconductor production the most isn't likely to remain limited to China and the U.S. As companies in these two countries gain market share and drive prices down for everybody, governments in Japan, South Korea, and Europe will likely feel compelled to respond with subsidies for their own companies, snowballing the effect of rising production and falling profit margins.
So there's rising potential for a global semiconductor glut, driving down profit margins, potentially for years. If so, then investors should start thinking about exiting the semiconductor sector, or at the very least gravitating toward chip companies that have higher profit margins -- so they'll have more room to sacrifice margins and still remain profitable when margins start coming down.
Right now, Broadcom's gross margins are the highest of the three at a robust 75%, while Intel's margins are weakest at 47%. And the fact that Broadcom's valuation is also the cheapest of the three, at 13.4 times forward earnings, is yet another reason to favor Broadcom over either AMD or Intel.

Shares of JPMorgan have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (+13.9% vs. +4.2%). In fact, JP Morgan’s third-quarter 2022 results show positive effects of higher rates and solid loan demand as well as robust trading performance, while a worsening macroeconomic outlook was a headwind.
The Zacks analyst believes that opening new branches, strategic buyouts/investments and global expansion and digitization efforts will keep driving financials. Higher rates and a steady rise in loan demand will keep aiding net interest income (NII). Yet, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and higher mortgage rates are likely to make fee income growth tough. Steadily rising expenses remain a key issue.

2022-12-12 00:00:00+00:00,This Stock-Split Stock Sees Unstoppable Growth Ahead,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-stock-split-stock-sees-unstoppable-growth-ahead,,,"Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE: BAM) recently completed a unique stock split. It was announced as a 3-for-2 stock split. However, instead of receiving additional shares of the same company for those they owned, investors got one share of its asset manager for every four of the company they already owned.
Brookfield completed this split so that its investors would have direct exposure to its asset management business's dividend income and growth. CEO Bruce Flatt recently discussed the growth it has already locked up at a recent industry conference.
Locked-in growth for the next few years
Brookfield believes it can grow its asset management business's fee-related earnings (FRE) at a 15% to 20% annual rate. It has high confidence in that view because most of that growth is already locked up. CEO Bruce Flatt pointed out:
Our FRE growth targets are already locked in for '23, '24, and almost '25. Like this business doesn't happen overnight. It's a very long-tail business. The funds are raised over periods of time and they're deployed over three or four years.
Brookfield's FRE has grown 20% over the past year to $531 million in the third quarter and $2.1 billion over the last 12 months.
Meanwhile, it ended the quarter with $39 billion of additional committed but uninvested capital across its strategies. That money will earn about $390 million of annual fees once Brookfield deploys it. The company also has $88 billion of uncalled fund commitments -- capital it will get to deploy in the coming years as it secures investment opportunities. Those funds will drive further FRE growth.
It just completed the first close on its fifth flagship infrastructure fund and sixth flagship private equity fund, raising $21 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively; it plans to hold additional closings. Brookfield also completed fundraising on its fourth flagship real estate fund, raising $17 billion. Finally, it's about 85% through raising money for its 11th flagship opportunistic credit fund, which it expects will exceed the prior fund's $16 billion capital raise.
Thanks to the visible FRE growth as it deploys all this capital, the company believes it can grow the dividend payment on the asset management shares it split off at a 15% to 20% annual rate. That will enable investors to collect a higher-yielding and fast-growing passive income stream.
Focus on the longer term
Because Brookfield's past fundraising has locked in its growth for the next few years, it's now focused on securing growth several years down the road. For the most part, that means doing more of the same. Institutional investors want core and ""core plus"" (higher-risk, higher-reward) products focused on real assets like real estate and infrastructure. They also want to invest in opportunistic products, especially in infrastructure.
In addition, Brookfield will continue to launch funds focused on new opportunities. A big emphasis will be on three megatrends. As Flatt noted, ""trillions and trillions of capital has to go into digitization, deglobalization, and decarbonization."" The company capitalized on that third theme earlier this year by launching its first energy transition fund with its listed renewable energy affiliate Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP). That fund quickly raised $15 billion of capital, half of which Brookfield Renewable has already committed to deploying across various transactions. The company had previously stated that it believes energy transition could be a $200 billion business in the future.
Meanwhile, it's investing in the digitization and deglobalization themes via its infrastructure funds. For example, through its listed infrastructure affiliate, Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC) (NYSE: BIP), Brookfield agreed to fund half the $30 billion cost of two semiconductor fabrication facilities that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is building in the U.S. That deal will help Intel onshore more production capacity to further digitize the U.S. economy. Brookfield could eventually launch dedicated funds focused on those themes.
Big-time growth ahead
Brookfield Asset Management already has double-digit fee-related earnings growth lined up for the next few years, powered by investment funds it raised in the past. Because of that, its newly split-off asset management stock will be able to grow its dividend at a 15% to 20% annual clip. Meanwhile, the company is already working hard at locking in growth beyond that time frame. That seemingly unstoppable growth makes it a great option for investors seeking high total return potential.

Yet in spite of these near-term headwinds, the long-term outlook for the semiconductor industry remains bright. Based on a report from Fortune Business Insights, the global semiconductor industry is expected to more than double in size from $527.9 billion to $1.38 trillion between 2021 and 2029. This means chipmakers have the potential to be fantastic long-term investments.

However, not all chipmakers are created equally. With the 2022 bear market reducing tech stock valuations, two semiconductor stocks stand out as no-brainer buys in 2023. Meanwhile, one of the most popular semis on the planet looks entirely avoidable in the new year.
Semiconductor stock No. 1 to buy hand over fist in 2023: Intel
The first chipmaker that's a surefire buy in 2023 is industry stalwart and Dow Jones Industrial Average component Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
As with most semiconductor companies, inflation and supply chain issues have taken their toll on Intel in 2022. But in addition to these concerns, Intel's share price has been weighed down by chief competitor Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) chipping away at its share of central processing units (CPUs) sold in personal computers, mobile devices, and data center servers. While these are all tangible headwinds, none of them are particularly concerning over the long term or at risk of derailing Intel's turnaround strategy.
Let's start by addressing the elephant in the room. Yes, AMD is taking market share from Intel and has been doing so for the past three years. While it would be ideal for Intel not to lose share to AMD, the important thing to note is that the percentage of share lost remains relatively small.
According to data from Mercury Research, AMD controlled 13.9% of the desktop CPU market in the third quarter and 17.5% of data center server share. That means Intel still accounts for greater than 80% in these categories. In other words, these segments will continue to be cash cows for Intel.
Another important growth driver for Intel is its foundry segment. Earlier this year, the company broke ground on two chip-manufacturing plants in Ohio that come with an aggregate price tag of $20 billion. What's worth noting is that President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law in August. This law provides almost $53 billion to the semiconductor industry in subsidies for manufacturing facilities and various research grants. This certainly incentivizes Intel to bolster its domestic production capacity.
Lastly, don't overlook autonomous vehicle company Mobileye Global, which Intel acquired for $15.3 billion in 2017. Mobileye debuted via initial public offering in late October and now carries a $25.5 billion market cap. More importantly, Intel remains the majority shareholder of a company (Mobileye) that grew sales by 38% in a challenging third quarter.
With its share price cut in half in less than three years, Intel is ripe for the picking by opportunistic investors.
Semiconductor stock No. 2 to buy hand over fist in 2023: Broadcom
The second semiconductor stock investors can confidently buy hand over fist in 2023 is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO).
The chief concern among Broadcom skeptics appears to be the growing likelihood that a recession will reduce chip demand for Broadcom and perhaps shrink its backlog. Even if this outcome were to materialize, it would be a short-term speed bump for a company with a mountain of catalysts.
The biggest driver for Broadcom is the 5G revolution. For much of the past decade, wireless download speeds weren't meaningfully improved. But with telecom companies steadily upgrading their wireless infrastructure, 5G speeds are now a reality. This means an ongoing device upgrade cycle for consumers and businesses should take place through mid-decade. Broadcom generates most of its revenue from selling wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones.
Something else to add to the above is that owning a smartphone and having wireless access have evolved into basic necessities. Not even a recession would be likely to cause a significant uptick in wireless service cancellations.
Broadcom's backlog is also a positive. The company entered fiscal 2022 (the company's fiscal year ends in late October) with a record $14.9 billion worth of orders and, according to CEO Hock Tan, was booking orders well into 2023. If the U.S. economy were to slow in the upcoming year, Broadcom would be able to lean on its backlog to ensure anywhere from 12 to 24 months of highly predictable operating cash flow.
Want another reason to be excited about Broadcom? Look to its data center operations. As more businesses shift their data into the cloud in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for access and connectivity chips used in data center servers should grow. There's a real chance this ancillary operating segment could outpace wireless chip growth in smartphones.
Income investors are going to love Broadcom as well. Since 2010, Broadcom's quarterly payout has grown by almost 6,500% to $4.60. This works out to a 3.5% yield for a fast-growing company currently valued at just 13 times Wall Street's forecast earnings in 2023.

The semiconductor stock to avoid like the plague in 2023: Nvidia
But not every semiconductor stock can be a winner. Although it's been one of the top chipmakers to have in your portfolio for well over a decade, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) can be comfortably left on the shelf in 2023.
To be perfectly clear, I'm in no way saying Nvidia is a stock to forever avoid. There are certainly catalysts that merited Nvidia's greater than 8,000% return since the Great Recession bottom in March 2009. In particular, Nvidia accounts for close to 20% of the global graphics processing unit (GPU) market and approximately 80% of discrete graphics cards, which are GPUs operating separately from the processor. GPUs account for the lion's share of Nvidia's profits.
However, one of the biggest issues for the company is that many of its fast-growing segments have absolutely hit a wall. For instance, cryptocurrency valuations have tanked since November 2021. When the value of digital currencies declines, demand for GPUs to mine cryptocurrency tends to fall in lockstep. To boot, non-fungible token (NFT) transactions have fallen off a cliff, thereby minimizing demand for metaverse innovations and blockchain-based gaming. That's not particularly good news for the company's Omniverse Platform.
Nvidia's gaming segment has also gone from boom to bust in the blink of an eye. With the pandemic seemingly put in the rearview mirror in a number of developed countries, people aren't spending as much time gaming at home anymore. When coupled with a weakening U.S. economic outlook, we've seen gaming revenue plunge from $3.62 billion in the company's fiscal first quarter of 2023 to just $1.57 billion in the fiscal third quarter.
Nvidia is also facing headwinds in the world's No. 2 economy, China. In September, the U.S. ordered chipmakers to halt exports of advanced microchips to China. Although Nvidia has developed a slower GPU that meets the new export guidelines, it's uncertain if this slower GPU will generate the same revenue as the faster A100 GPU. The potential loss of revenue from China could be significant.
Finally, Nvidia's valuation hasn't properly accounted for all of the macroeconomic and company-specific headwinds it's contending with. Despite its share price halving since hitting an all-time high on Nov. 22, 2021, Nvidia commands a forward-year price-to-earnings ratio of 40. That's incredibly rich for a company with no forecast sales growth in fiscal 2023 and perhaps high-single-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2024, assuming the U.S. doesn't enter a recession.
With so many other phenomenal deals to choose from in the tech space, Nvidia becomes an easy semiconductor stock to avoid in 2023.

It's the world's largest producer of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers, it's firmly profitable, and it pays consistent dividends. But if you had invested $3,000 in Intel on the first trading day of 2015, your investment would only be worth about $2,300 today.
If you had invested $3,000 into Intel's rival Advanced Micro Devices instead, your investment would be worth roughly $78,000. A $3,000 investment in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Intel's top competitor in the foundry market, would also have blossomed into nearly $11,000. So why did Intel underperform its industry peers by such a wide margin?
Image source: Intel.
Losing the process lead to TSMC
Intel is an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) that manufactures most of its own chips at its first-party foundries. By comparison, ""fabless"" foundries like AMD outsource their production to third-party contract chipmakers like TSMC. For decades, Intel manufactured the world's smallest and densest chips by adhering to Moore's Law, a prediction from its co-founder Gordon Moore that the number of transistors within the same area of silicon could double every two years.
Intel formalized that two-year cadence as its ""tick-tock"" model in 2007. With every ""tick,"" it shrank its chips to a smaller node (which is currently measured in nanometers). With each ""tock"" the following year, it upgraded the chip's microarchitecture.
But starting in 2012, the gaps between Intel's tick and tock launches became longer as it struggled to manufacture smaller chips. In 2014 TSMC started to install ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems -- which are used to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers -- to produce more advanced chips for Apple and other chipmakers.
Instead of following TSMC's example, Intel didn't aggressively expand its EUV fleet even thought it had been one of ASML's top investors back in 2012. As a result, TSMC eventually overtook Intel in the ""process race"" to manufacture smaller, denser, and more power efficient chips in 2020. That victory also enabled TSMC's client AMD to launch more advanced chips than Intel. It also maintained a more stable supply of chips as Intel grappled with product delays and chip shortages.
Faced with all those challenges, Intel's share of the PC market plunged from 82.2% to 63.3% between the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2022, according to PassMark Software, as AMD's market share nearly doubled from 17.8% to 34.6%.
Losing the mobile market to Arm
Intel's other glaring failure was its loss of the mobile CPU market to Arm-based chipmakers like Qualcomm and MediaTek. Instead of licensing the power-efficient Arm architecture, Intel stuck with the same power-hungry x86 architecture it used for its PC and server chips.
Intel was so confident in its x86 architecture that it actually sold its own Arm-based chipmaker, Xscale, to Marvell in 2006. It also refused to produce mobile CPUs for Apple's first iPhone, which launched in 2007, because it believed Apple could never sell enough iPhones to justify its own development and production costs.
Intel introduced its own Atom chips for mobile devices in 2008, but they were less power efficient than Arm chips and suffered some compatibility issues with apps developed for Arm devices. In 2014, Intel started to aggressively subsidize its Atom shipments with billions of dollars in ""contra revenues,"" which included big rebates for OEMs, but it eventually abandoned that futile and loss-leading effort in 2019. As a result, Intel largely missed the big shift from PCs toward mobile devices.
An inability to maintain stable leadership
As Intel grappled with all those challenges, it kept shifting gears under three different CEOs within just four years. In 2018, Brian Krzanich -- who was widely blamed for Intel's loss of its process lead to TSMC, its costly mobile mistakes, and the ""diworsification"" of its business -- resigned due to an inappropriate relationship with an employee.
Krzanich's successor, his former CFO Bob Swan, was ousted in early 2021 after being criticized for prioritizing cost-cutting measures, buybacks, and divestments over reclaiming the process lead from TSMC. Swan also briefly considered going fabless and outsourcing Intel's production to TSMC. He was replaced by Pat Gelsinger, who steered Intel in the opposite direction and doubled down on upgrading the company's plants, buying new EUV systems from ASML, and catching up to TSMC in the process race by 2024 or 2025. It's trying to spin all those plates as the growth of the PC market stalls out in a post-pandemic market.
Therefore, Gelsinger needs Intel's investors to brace for slower revenue growth and rising expenses for the foreseeable future as it tries to rectify its previous mistakes. That's why analysts expect Intel's revenue and earnings to decline in both 2022 and 2023 -- and why its stock still can't be considered a bargain at 16 times forward earnings.

2022-12-09 00:00:00+00:00,Taiwan Semiconductor's Arizona Fab Could Mean Big Wins for 2 Other Chip Stocks,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/taiwan-semiconductors-arizona-fab-could-mean-big-wins-for-2-other-chip-stocks,,,"There's plenty of worry out there about what would happen to the global economy if China ever made a more aggressive military push to take back the island of Taiwan. Amid this worry, many companies and government organizations have been pushing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) -- far and away the largest chip foundry on the planet and a recent addition to Warren Buffett's stock portfolio -- to diversify production into other countries.
Lo and behold, Taiwan Semi just announced a second fab (a chip manufacturing facility) in the state of Arizona, over a year before its first facility there is complete. The total investment in the two fabs will be in the ballpark of $40 billion.
Image source: Getty Images.
This sounds like fantastic news for Taiwan Semi, as well as for chip designers Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which will be among the first customers of the new fabs down in the southwestern desert. But two lesser-known names could be the best way for investors to profit: Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) and ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML).
Lots of silicon, but a lot of equipment to fill a fab with first
Taiwan Semi said its first fab will begin cranking out silicon wafers (those big circular discs you see being held by someone in a lab suit above) in 2024, using an enhanced version of its 5-nanometer manufacturing technology (the nanometers referring to the size of the transistors within a chip, with smaller sizes representing more powerful chips). The second fab will start production in 2026 using 3-nanometer tech. Together, the company said it could produce 600,000 silicon wafers a year at max capacity.
For reference, Taiwan Semi's 5-nm and 3-nm manufacturing processes create 300-millimeter wafers (just shy of 12 inches in diameter). Each wafer thus has 113 square inches of surface area (high school geometry here: 𝞹 x 6"" radius squared), meaning Taiwan Semi could produce nearly 68 million square inches of silicon wafers every year. Sound like a lot? It is. But bear in mind some 14.7 billion square inches of wafers will be shipped in 2022 alone (according to industry association SEMI). That number is expected to increase by about a mid-single-digit percentage over the next few years.
At any rate, though Taiwan Semi's $40 billion investment will add little to the total global chip production capacity, it's still an incredibly high-value project. These days, the most advanced chips require incredibly complex manufacturing equipment to produce. That's where Applied Materials and ASML come in. As Taiwan Semi constructs its two new fabs, it will be filling up those facilities with advanced machinery from its longtime partners Applied and ASML, with some pieces of equipment (specifically, ASML's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines) costing a couple hundred million dollars apiece.
In other words, new fabs like the ones being built in the Grand Canyon State mean more growth for Applied Materials and ASML now while Taiwan Semi shareholders wait for that new output to go live.
Another boom in chip demand is coming
In 2022, global chip sales (the actual end product, not the wafers themselves) are expected to be around $600 billion. That's up from just over $400 billion in 2019 before the pandemic. The booming demand for silicon-based devices isn't going away anytime soon, though. Analyst and industry estimates now point toward global chip sales surpassing $1 trillion no later than 2030.
It won't be a straight-uphill growth trend. For example, the value of chips sold is expected to dip slightly in 2023. However, big-ticket consumer goods like automobiles and home appliances are joining the digital era and will look a lot more like your smartphone in the coming years. Something similar is happening in the industrial world, where equipment of all sorts is getting hooked up to a network connection. 5G network infrastructure construction is ongoing, as are data center build-outs to support artificial intelligence and other high-end computing in the cloud.
Besides supporting new fabs in Arizona, Applied Materials and ASML will also be involved in the construction of other sites like Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) planned mega-fab in Ohio. Dozens of other facilities, like the other 17 fabs that Taiwan Semi owns in Taiwan and China (and one small fab in Washington state), will also need upgrades. Fab equipment also gets old and needs replacing, which also means ongoing sales for Applied and ASML, not to mention ongoing service and software fees.
Taiwan Semi, Intel, and others will get some government assistance via legislation like the U.S. CHIPS Act during this boom in capital spending. However, it remains unknown how profitable these companies will be along the way -- or how profitable they'll be once this boom is all said and done.
Fab equipment sales, though, tout high margins and cost what they cost, regardless of consumer and business end-demand for chips (which impact manufacturer profit margins). As these machines get more complex, the price tag on them goes up too, which is boosting Applied's and ASML's margins.
Data by YCharts.
As of this writing, Applied Materials and ASML shares trade for a respective 14 and 40 times trailing-12-month earnings (or a respective 20 and 25 times trailing-12-month free cash flow). Both had a tough year in 2022 due to supply chain issues and shifting government restrictions on sales to China, but both have managed to continue growing anyway. With years of boom time ahead for the chip fabrication industry, shares of these two companies look like a solid value -- and one of the best ways to profit from the coming explosion in fab spending.

These top investors know that historically, every Nasdaq bear market has been followed by a bull market and proven to be a good buying opportunity, making the present a good time to buy shares of companies with promising long-term outlooks.
Here are two top Nasdaq stocks that billionaire money managers have been buying the dip on during the current market sell-off.

1. Bill Miller-T. Rowe Price
It's hard to find an investor with a better track record than Bill Miller of Miller Value Partners. Miller previously ran the Legg Mason Value Trust, where he beat the S&P 500 for 15 years in a row between 1990 and 2005. Miller is a skilled value investor and has recently been successful with some bold calls, like being an early investor in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). One of Miller's newest buys during the latest quarter is an interesting one -- asset manager T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ: TROW).
Shares of the investment manager are down about 35% year to date, as a declining stock market has both decreased the value of T. Rowe Price's assets under management and led to some outflows for the 85-year-old firm. But T. Rowe Price stands to benefit as the market rebounds -- its assets under management will increase, and it will gain more inflows.
Miller likely recognized this and has already benefited from the market's resurgence over the past two months, as shares of T. Rowe are up about 20% from Miller's reported purchase price of $93.53. Shares still look appealing after this rally, as they trade at just 14 times earnings and yield 3.8%.
T. Rowe Price is a Dividend Aristocrat that has increased its annual dividend for 36 years and counting. It has a potentially lucrative growth opportunity in target date retirement funds, where it is one of the industry leaders, and it could see outsized upside as growth stocks rebound since it is heavily exposed to growth.
With a reasonable valuation and a time-tested dividend track record, investors could do a lot worse than follow Miller's lead into T. Rowe Price as it climbs back as the market rallies and pays investors a generous dividend in the meantime.
2. David Einhorn-Intel
It's hard to find a less-loved stock than Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) nowadays. The one-time blue chip company is down 43% year to date, and perhaps worse, investor perception is that it has fallen behind its competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) in key markets within the semiconductor space.
But a value investor like Einhorn is likely looking at Intel's depressed valuation and seeing a bargain. During the third quarter, Einhorn's Greenlight Capital bought back into Intel, which it had owned earlier this year but sold during the second quarter. Einhorn may have bought back in because he felt that the stock fell to a level where it was trading below its intrinsic value. After this year's sell-off, Intel stock is cheap, trading at just nine times earnings. Shares yield nearly 5%.
The silver lining amid the bad news is that Intel recognizes that things need to change. Management is planning cost-cutting measures that it says will save the company $8 billion to $10 billion by 2025. The company spun off Mobileye (NASDAQ: MBLY) in order to focus on its core business and is repositioning itself as a foundry for other chip companies. Intel is in the early stages of this turnaround plan, and while the capital-intensive process will burn cash in the near term, the company projects that by 2025, spending will moderate while the company will achieve double-digit revenue growth.
While this is a long way off, it seems Einhorn is willing to buy the stock now while things look bleak and will wait to be rewarded if and when Intel's turnaround bears fruit. While we don't know if Intel will be able to achieve this, the low valuation and large dividend yield help to lower the risk of this potentially lucrative investment.
We can all learn from billionaire money managers like Miller and Einhorn. They know that the time to buy is when fear is in the air, and they are taking advantage of the current Nasdaq market to buy shares of these blue chip stocks at discounted prices.
In Miller's case, he stands to be rewarded with his T. Rowe Price investment when the broader market turns around, while Einhorn could see significant returns in Intel over the long term if the company can execute on its turnaround plan. Both investors enjoy a decent margin of safety by investing in these beaten-down stocks at inexpensive valuations, and both will also add to their returns with significant dividends in the meantime.

This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.19%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.01%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.19%.
Coming into today, shares of the world's largest chipmaker had gained 0.42% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 8.91%, while the S&P 500 gained 4.7%.
Intel will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Intel to post earnings of $0.23 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 78.9%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $14.5 billion, down 25.76% from the prior-year quarter.
Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $1.96 per share and revenue of $63.51 billion. These totals would mark changes of -64.17% and -18.6%, respectively, from last year.
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Intel should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.
The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

2022-12-07 00:00:00+00:00,Mobileye beats revenue estimates in first quarterly report since IPO,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mobileye-beats-revenue-estimates-in-first-quarterly-report-since-ipo-0,,,"Adds earnings comparison, updates shares
Dec 7 (Reuters) - Mobileye Global Inc MBLY.O beat estimates for revenue and earnings on Wednesday in its first quarterly report after going public in October, as the Intel Corp INTC.O unit benefited from strong demand for its self-driving technology from carmakers.
Shares of the company were up about 2% at $31 in premarket trading, after it also forecast a revenue range for the current quarter that came in well above expectations.
A push to incorporate assistive-driving capabilities to bolster safety features in cars has led to greater adoption of self-driving technology, helping companies such as Mobileye.
Total revenue at Mobileye grew 38% to $450 million in the third quarter ended Oct. 1. Analysts were expecting revenue of $447 million, according to Refinitiv data.
Net loss, however, widened to $45 million from $26 million. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 15 cents per share, above analysts' estimates of 12 cents, according to Refinitiv.
It forecast fourth-quarter revenue of between $527 million and $545 million. Analysts were expecting revenue of $483.7 million for the quarter.
Mobileye, which counts BMW, Nissan, Volkswagen, among others as its customers, listed on the Nasdaq on Oct. 26 after raising $861 million in an initial public offering. Its stock has risen 45% from the IPO price of $21, valuing the company at $24.45 billion.

2022-12-07 00:00:00+00:00,This Hot Growth Stock Is Still a Buy After Enormous Gains,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-hot-growth-stock-is-still-a-buy-after-enormous-gains-4,,,"When one thinks of artificial intelligence hardware stocks, the first that usually come to mind are advanced semiconductor giants such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, or Intel.
However, one tech company that incorporates all three of those companies' chips into its advanced server platforms is absolutely trouncing their stocks this year. Though the Nasdaq Composite is still down by 26.1% year to date and the iShares Semiconductor ETF is off by 29.1%, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has rocketed to a 97.3% gain.
Here's how Super Micro did it, and why the good times may continue.
QQQ Year to Date Total Returns (Daily) data by YCharts.
A multiyear transformation coming to fruition
It's hard for any technology stock to rise during a year like this, so one would have to suspect that something unusual must be going on at Super Micro.
That's exactly the case. After the discovery of accounting issues in 2017 and 2018 caused a crisis of confidence, Super Micro stock was sold off to a cheap valuation. However, the company's standing in the industry never diminished, and its energy-efficient server designs remained in favor with top tech firms. Eventually, its accounting troubles -- which involved the timing of revenue recognition, not fabricated sales or profits -- were resolved.
During that downturn, Super Micro developed a growth plan that involved a shift from supplying server components to selling its own full systems, as well as ""total IT"" solutions. These comprehensive solutions consist of complete rack systems containing servers, storage, software, security, and services, each optimized for different applications such as high-performance AI, 5G telecom, edge computing, or accelerated storage.
Super Micro had also previously manufactured its server solutions only in Silicon Valley. But in the last couple of years, it built a new plant in Taiwan to supply Asian customers more cost-efficiently. And because the Taiwan campus has lower costs, the servers coming out of it are able to appeal to cost-sensitive cloud customers -- a market Super Micro hadn't penetrated before.
In addition to lower-cost manufacturing, Super Micro's designs emphasize two incredibly important features: a plug-and-play ""building block"" architecture and extremely energy-efficient designs. The building-block feature allows customers to swap out parts or components within server and storage systems to upgrade them rather than having to replace entire systems, saving them tons of money over the long term.
Similarly, in the wake of energy prices' recent upward surge, Super Micro's energy-efficient designs are more appealing to data center operators. Indeed, there has been no bigger issue this year for data center operators than energy costs, and that's helping Super Micro take lots of market share.
After crushing guidance in 2022, another strong projection for 2023
As Super Micro's strategy has come to fruition this year, its revenue and profit growth have accelerated. Last quarter, revenue grew 79% year over year while its adjusted (non-GAAP) gross margins expanded by 5.4 percentage points to 18.8%, leading to adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) growth of 255% to $3.42.
Yet despite Super Micro's eye-popping year-to-date gains, the stock actually still looks cheap, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 10.3.
While that type of valuation often means investors expect a reversion to the mean, management has guided for continued growth in its fiscal 2023, which ends in June 2023. Management now expects adjusted EPS of between $9 and $11.30 for the fiscal year, up from $5.65 in fiscal 2022. Yet the share price is now in the neighborhood of just $83.
So, Super Micro trades at much less than 10 times this fiscal year's guidance. But what's especially encouraging is that management has a track record of repeatedly under-promising and over-delivering. For instance, in the summer of 2021, management guided for just $3 in adjusted EPS in 2022, but wound up delivering EPS of $5.65, despite all the well-documented macroeconomic headwinds.
In fact, as recently as last quarter, management forecast at least $7.50 in EPS for fiscal 2023 before raising its guidance range to $9 to $11.30 with the early November release of its latest quarterly results.
SMCI has bigger ambitions
CEO Charles Liang has been saying for a couple of years that he envisions Super Micro becoming a $10 billion revenue business, potentially as soon as 2024. The company certainly looks to be on its way to achieving that -- its trailing-12-month revenue doubled to $6 billion over just a couple of years. Furthermore, in its recent earnings releases, Liang has stated an even more ambitious goal: to reach $20 billion in revenue over the medium to long term. With that in mind, and given its market cap of just $4.4 billion, there could still be material upside in this market-beating stock, even after this year's robust gains.
Liang and his team have backed up their projections over the last couple of years with results, so I wouldn't doubt the ability of this company to reach those levels. Liang is also well-incentivized to achieve those goals. As the company's founder, he owns a hefty 13.9% of Super Micro's stock. Moreover, in 2021, his compensation package was changed to just a $1 salary, with 1 million stock options to be awarded in tranches based on revenue targets up to $8 billion and stock price targets ranging from $45 to $120. With the stock trading at $83, there are still more targets for Liang to hit.
It's not too late to join the SMCI party, as long as servers remain in demand and energy costs remain a concern. Those look like pretty safe bets in 2023 and beyond.

And because the Taiwan campus has lower costs, the servers coming out of it are able to appeal to cost-sensitive cloud customers -- a market Super Micro hadn't penetrated before. Similarly, in the wake of energy prices' recent upward surge, Super Micro's energy-efficient designs are more appealing to data center operators.","Similarly, in the wake of energy prices' recent upward surge, Super Micro's energy-efficient designs are more appealing to data center operators.

2022-12-07 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Corporation (INTC) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-corporation-intc-is-attracting-investor-attention%3A-here-is-what-you-should-know-2,,,"Intel (INTC) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned +0.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.7% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Intel belongs, has gained 10.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.23 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -78.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.96 points to a change of -64.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.92 indicates a change of -2.1% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -10%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Intel.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Intel, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.5 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -25.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $63.51 billion and $61.66 billion estimates indicate -18.6% and -2.9% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $15.34 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.1%. EPS of $0.59 for the same period compares with $1.71 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.49 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.99%. The EPS surprise was +73.53%.
Over the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.
