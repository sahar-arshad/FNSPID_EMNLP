NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. and European stocks slid on Wednesday as the outlook for rate hikes sullied sentiment, while bond yields rose after euro-zone gross domestic product beat expectations, adding to bets of a more hawkish European Central Bank.
Trading was choppy as investors awaited the ECB meeting on Thursday and U.S. consumer price data on Friday that will highlight the dilemma investors face as they juggle how much central banks tighten policy and its impact on inflation.
The White House said it expected the headline inflation number on Friday to be ""elevated."" Economists expect annual inflation to be 8.3%, according to a Reuters poll.
Investors are worried about the economic outlook and its effect on results. Citi Research analysts cautioned that Intel Corp INTC.O could pre-announce weaker-than-expected earnings for the second quarter. Intel's shares fell 4.1%.
Target TGT.N had roiled markets on Tuesday when the retailer cut its profit margin forecast after reporting a much steeper drop in quarterly profit in May than expected. Other companies will follow and challenge second-quarter results, said Philip Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes.
""The market is rolling over here and will at a minimum recast that 3,800 level that we saw in early May over the course of the next couple of months, and it may go a little bit below that,"" he said. He called the recent rally a dead-cat bounce.
The S&P 500 almost confirmed a bear market when it slid more than 20% from its record closing peak on Jan. 3 to an intraday low of 3,810.32 on May 20, but the benchmark closed higher.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX closed down 0.57% as concerns about growth weighed on banking shares, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.64%.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 0.91%, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 1.11% and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 0.74%.
Data showed the euro zone economy grew much faster in this year's first quarter than the previous three months, despite the war in Ukraine, the European Union statistics office said, as it revised earlier estimates sharply higher.
Investors raised their bets on ECB rate hikes, and money markets priced in 75 basis points of rate hikes by September.
German and U.S. Treasury yields rose after the euro area GDP data beat expectations, adding to bets of a more hawkish ECB.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR was up 6.1 basis points to 3.031%.
Germany's 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro area, rose to a new high since 2014 at 1.368%.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development slashed its growth outlook to 3% this year from 4.5% forecast in December. The OECD also raised its inflation estimates, though it said there was a limited risk of ""stagflation.""
The euro hit a seven-year peak against the yen, getting a lift from the upward revision to first quarter growth. Against the dollar, the euro EUR= was up 0.15% to $1.0715.
The dollar index =USD rose 0.107% and managed to hit a fresh 20-year high against the yen. The yen weakened to hit 134.47 per dollar, its softest since Feb. 27, 2002.
Asian stocks strengthened overnight, with Chinese stocks seeing some relief from easing of COVID-19 restrictions, but sentiment was volatile and European indexes fell soon after opening.
Japan's economy shrank slightly less than initially reported in the first quarter, as private consumption remained resilient and companies rebuilt inventories.
Oil prices rose about 1% as U.S. crude hit a 13-week high despite a rise in domestic crude inventories, as supplies looked likely to tighten with China easing lockdowns and Norwegian oil workers planning to strike.
U.S. crude futures CLc1 rose $2.70 to settle at $122.11 a barrel and Brent LCOc1 settled up $3.01 to $123.58 a barrel.
Gold inched up in choppy trade as concerns over economic growth boosted the metal's safe-haven appeal.
U.S. gold futures GCv1 settled up 0.2% at $1,856.50.
Bitcoin BTC=BTSP fell 2.94% to $30,200.98.

2022-06-08 00:00:00+00:00,Why Intel Took the Chip Sector Down Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-took-the-chip-sector-down-today,,,"What happened
Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) were trading down by 5.25% as of 2:06 p.m. ET Wednesday.
The chip stock fell following the release of a negative note from a Citibank analyst that was based on his takeaways from a semiconductor industry conference hosted by Bank of America earlier this week. Apparently, the tone of Intel's presentation was enough to make the already-pessimistic analyst even more cautious about Intel stock, at least in the near term.
So what
On Wednesday morning, Citi analyst Christopher Danley wrote that his ""bear case"" scenario for Intel appeared to be taking shape. Danley already had a neutral rating on the stock, and he did not downgrade it to a sell. He also maintained his $45 price target on it. What he did, though, was reduce his revenue and earnings estimates for the company for the quarter and the year, citing the cautious tone of Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner at the conference.
In Danley's view, Zinsner's comments indicated that the current quarter is turning out to be more challenging than anticipated, and Intel had already given conservative guidance on its first-quarter earnings call. A big part of Intel's business involves chips for personal computers, sales of which have weakened as people in much of the world try to put the pandemic behind them and as inflation bites into consumer discretionary purchases.
""We're going to go through some choppiness for sure in the near term as everyone else will as well,"" Zinsner said at the conference, ""and you know what we've got to do is kind of keep our heads down and drive the business, execute to the plan and things will have a good outcome for us.""
Of course, while analysts mostly focus on the next quarter and the next 12 months, Intel is aiming for a larger and longer-term turnaround story. Under new CEO Pat Gelsinger, not only is the company ramping up efforts to catch up to its rivals on leading-edge chipmaking, but it's also planning to become a foundry that third parties can outsource chip manufacturing to. These huge moves won't pay off in the near term, but rather over a span of three to five years. Therefore, shareholders may have a while to wait before they can see signs of more tangible progress.
Now what
It was curious that one cautious analyst note that was specific to Intel seemed to drag down share prices across the entire semiconductor sector. While Intel used to be a bellwether for the industry, that isn't really the case anymore.
For one thing, Intel has lost its lead in cutting-edge production. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) surpassed it a few years ago, allowing Intel's competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) to leap ahead by using TSM's foundry services. AMD has been gaining market share at Intel's expense, so it's a bit difficult to distinguish what is really an industrywide issue and what's an Intel-specific issue when Intel gives a negative outlook.
Speaking of Taiwan Semi, that company actually held its annual shareholder meeting Tuesday night, and management reiterated its outlook for 30%-plus growth this year amid a tight market. Apparently, whatever is ailing Intel isn't affecting TSM. That could either be due to TSM's technological lead, its exposure to a broader array of chips, or both. While sales of PCs and smartphones may be soft this year, demand for high-performance computing chips and automotive chips is apparently still incredibly strong.
Either way, while Citibank's note may be bad news for Intel, I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate it to the rest of the industry. Therefore, Wednesday's action may be opening up buying opportunities elsewhere in the chip sector.

June 8 (Reuters) - The Dow and the S&P 500 index slipped in choppy trading on Wednesday, pulled lower by shares of Intel after a bearish brokerage report, while the Nasdaq was propped up by gains in Tesla and Apple.
Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with industrials .SPLRCI, real estate .SPLRCR and consumer staples .SPLRCS down between 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively.
Intel INTC.O fell 3.8% and was the biggest drag on the blue-chip and benchmark indexes after Citi Research analysts cautioned that the chipmaker could pre-announce weaker-than-expected earnings for the second quarter.
Altria MO.N, which was also a big drag on the S&P 500, slid 6.7% after a report that Morgan Stanley cut the tobacco company's stock to ""underweight"" on competition concerns.
The energy sector .SPNY was among the gainers, as Brent crude LCOc1 hovered near $122 a barrel. The sector has soared 65% this year and is on track for a bumper 2022. O/R
""Investors are concerned with where energy prices are headed. All you're seeing is people rearranging some positions and to some extent waiting for a better indication that perhaps inflation will come off in recent times,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments.
""You are just going to see more choppiness, there isn't really any breakthrough news in the market, both in terms of earnings and economics.""
Against the backdrop of rising borrowing costs, focus this week will be squarely on consumer price index data due on Friday.
A hot reading would likely spook markets already worried about how the U.S. Federal Reserve will balance growth and inflation as it withdraws its pandemic-era policy support to the economy.
The benchmark S&P 500 index .SPX has climbed 9% since May 20 after falling as much 20.05% so far this year. It was last down 12.9% for the year. The blue-chip Dow .DJIis down 9% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC has shed 22%.
The CBOE volatility index .VIX was last trading at 24.20 points, above its long-term average of about 20 points.

The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 28.08 points, or 0.23%, at 12,203.31, boosted by a 4.3% rise in Tesla Inc TSLA.Oshares.

The stock market is in turmoil, and investors are gravitating toward less risky investments. Growth stocks, in particular, have been pulverized by the market. However, the best blue-chip stocks to buy are an attractive option for investors to limit their downside risk and gain big over the long term.
Blue-chip stocks belong to companies that boast an excellent track record in terms of fundamentals and market returns. These companies are fundamentally sound and have well-established businesses which often offer dependable earnings. Moreover, these companies may also provide dividends, adding to their attractiveness.
7 Cheap Growth Stocks That Won't Stay That Way for Long
However, one of the main problems with blue-chip stocks is that they often trade at lofty valuations, which aren’t within reach of the average investor. With the market bear run at this time, there are plenty of blue-chip stocks that could be scooped up and diversify your portfolio.

U.S. telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) has had it incredibly tough in getting investors behind its stock. After spinning off its media-related assets into Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD), it has gone from being a telecom operator to a media conglomerate to a telecom operator.
AT&T’s recent efforts have allowed the company to effectively unlock cash flow to pay down debt. Management expects to produce close to $20 billion in annualized free cash flows, and roughly 40% of that will accrue to dividends. The rest will be used to pay down its sizeable debt load. AT&T boasts a tremendous dividend yield of 5.2%.
5G and fiber markets will be a key growth driver for the business. Its fiber penetration rate came in at a tremendous 37%, with close to 691,000 net additions during the first quarter. The firm plans to invest $24 billion into its 5G and fiber capabilities this year and 2023. The demand for bandwidth will increase exponentially in the coming years, and the pandemic has accelerated the trend.
Volkswagen (VWAGY)

Unilever (NYSE:UL)  is a consumer goods giant with a rock-solid brand portfolio with robust pricing power. Due to rampant inflation and geopolitical issues, its stock has been taking a hammering of late. Investors seem to be spooked by the current economic headwinds and have unfairly punished UL stock.
The market is concerned over the company’s exposure to Russia which is an ill-founded assumption. Its business in Russia represents just 1% of its total sales. It has the leverage and brand equity to tackle the inflationary pressures and maintain strong margin and sales growth. Also, the stock trades at historically low valuations and offers a spectacular 4.34% dividend yield. Hence, UL stock is ripe for picking.

2022-06-07 00:00:00+00:00,Apple Announces M2 Chip: What Investors Need to Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-announces-m2-chip%3A-what-investors-need-to-know,,,"Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is underway for 2022, and the company has announced several new software enhancements for its users. One announcement in particular is of interest to Apple shareholders: the new M2 chip, an update to the M1 that launched a couple of years ago for iPads, Macs, and MacBooks.
Here's what you need to know as an investor.
Image source: Getty Images.
The ""next-generation of Apple M-series silicon""
Apple has just released the M2 chip, the successor to the M1 chip that was announced at WWDC in June 2020. The new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops will feature the M2 chip, with other laptops, desktops, and tablets featuring the new electronics components later. The new laptops will be released starting in July.
The M2 is a sizable leap in performance over the M1, which is now found throughout most of Apple's lineup of tablets, laptops, and computers. The M2 has 20 billion transistors, 25% more than in the M1. The M2 also packs 100 gigabytes per second of memory bandwidth, 50% more than the M1. Basically, the M2 offers better performance to power consumption than its predecessor and many competing processors do.
A basic understanding of the semiconductor business model
Apple isn't a semiconductor company, but it has brought an increasing amount of chip design in-house in recent years -- a move other tech giants have taken, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Google's Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). Why would companies like Apple want in on the semiconductor business?
Semiconductor companies are essentially electrical engineering companies. Designing chips -- especially the most advanced circuitry used in high-end smartphones, tablets, computers, and data centers -- is one of the most complex engineering processes around. Once a design is complete, it's usually patented and becomes intellectual property (IP). From there, most semiconductor companies monetize their IP work in two basic stages: licensing and royalties.
Rather than purchase a finished chip, chip designs can be purchased on a license agreement. These are essentially blueprints for semiconductor circuitry, for a complete chip, or chips as part of a larger computing system. The purchase of these licenses allows a company to customize the chips to their particular needs. In the case of Apple, its M-series chips are based on designs from ARM Holdings, one of the largest chip licensors in the world -- and the company that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) attempted to acquire from ARM's current parent, Softbank (OTC: SFTB.Y), last year.
The second phase of chip design monetization is a royalty agreement. This is a payment made whenever a chip is manufactured with an IP license in it. It's typically a percentage of the selling price of the chip -- or, in Apple's case, what an internally developed and used chip would have cost should it sell on the market. The royalty fees can be negotiated, especially for a large company like Apple that uses a massive amount of circuitry.
Apple's chip design business strategy
Besides the M2 and the M1 it is succeeding, Apple has been bringing an increasing amount of chip IP in-house. It's been customizing chips for its iPhones for years, and in 2019 it acquired Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) smartphone modem business -- which it is using to end its longtime reliance on mobility chip leader Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM).
For the consumer, Apple's custom silicon helps it produce best-in-class devices. Though this tech giant already generates nearly $400 billion in annual revenue, there's still a lot of market share up for grabs if it can woo users to its ecosystem of devices.
But this isn't just a story of rising sales. The final bill for tech IP licensing and royalty payments can get hefty for companies that make and sell a final product. By bringing design work and customization in-house, a lot of money can be saved for an operation like Apple that churns out tremendous volumes of hardware. This vertical integration of tech design and device sales has helped Apple become one of the most valuable companies on the planet. Rather than being burdened with rising fees, Apple can use its clout to negotiate favorable deals. The result is a tech hardware behemoth that generates lucrative operating profit margins in the upper-20% to low-30% range.
Returns for investors in dividends and buybacks
So what's the revamped M2 laptop chip to Apple investors? Continued slow but steady growth for Apple's business over the long term. More importantly, though, the M2 and Apple's expanding library of in-house chips can help it save money -- which translates into Apple's big returns of excess cash to shareholders by way of a dividend and share repurchases.
Through the first half of its 2022 fiscal year, Apple has paid out $3.62 in dividends per share, a 17.5% increase over the previous year, and spent $43 billion in share repurchases, about the same as through the first half of fiscal 2021. Developments like the M2 can help Apple further boost its payout to investors over time.

2022-06-07 00:00:00+00:00,Ginkgo Bioworks Is Chasing a $4 Trillion Opportunity,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ginkgo-bioworks-is-chasing-a-%244-trillion-opportunity,,,"A few years ago, McKinsey did a study and concluded that synthetic biology (""syn-bio"") will have a massive impact on the world economy over the next decade or two, affecting $4 trillion in plastics, fuels, medicines, and many other verticals. Those are some eye-opening estimates, particularly since the leader in synthetic biomanufacturing, Ginkgo Bioworks (NYSE: DNA), currently has a market cap of $6 billion and trades for a little over $3 a share.
Should you invest in Ginkgo Bioworks now? Or is it too early?
Image source: Getty Images.
Syn-bio is taking computer programming into biology
Ginkgo was founded by four MIT students (and one of their professors) in 2009. The professor, Tom Knight, has worked at MIT for decades and was an early computer enthusiast. His master's thesis at MIT involved the creation of a ""mini-computer"" in 1972.
In Professor Knight's opinion, we are reaching the end of Moore's Law. Back in 1965, the co-founder of Intel, Gordon Moore, predicted that processing speeds for computers will double every 18 months. And Moore was right. Integrated circuits got smaller and smaller, and more of them could be packed on every chip. As a result, computers got faster, smaller, and more powerful, over and over again.
Now chipmaking is in the realm of nanotechnology -- moving atoms around. To take the next step requires a new focus. As Knight put it in an interview with Forbes magazine:
If you really want to put atoms precisely where you want them (which is what we're going to have to do in order to reach the next level of technology) the people who are good at that are not the physicists. The people who are good are the chemists. And the chemists get to make molecules where every molecule is the same, where every atom in that molecule is precisely located. They are the people who are going to be able to control the placement and function of atoms in this new realm.
So Knight went back to school, learning all he could about molecular biology. With the unlocking of human DNA, it became possible for biologists to not only read DNA but to start programming it like we do with computers. And that's when Ginkgo Bioworks was born.
Here's how co-founder and CEO Jason Kelly describes the technology:
It's kind of like a little machine that runs on digital code, very similar to a computer, except in this case the code -- instead of zeros and ones, it's A's, T's, C's, and G's. The cell reads that code, and it does all the things that a cell does in our body -- or a bird's body or bacteria in a river. They're all running on that digital code. We can read that code with DNA sequencing and can write that code with DNA synthesis or DNA printing. If you can read and write that code and you have a machine that'll run it, that's programming. So synthetic biology is programming cells like we program computers, by changing the DNA codes inside them.
DNA manufacturing
Ginkgo's TAM (total addressable market) is so ginormous because DNA is the code for the physical world. So the company sees markets in healthcare ($500 billion to $1.2 trillion), food and agriculture ($800 billion to $1.2 trillion), consumer goods ($200 billion to $700 billion), and energy ($200 billion to $300 billion) opening up to the company over the next couple of decades.
Ginkgo has a DNA foundry where it engineers cells to perform certain tasks. It's a manufacturing platform that allows any company to manufacture new and improved cell lines. In healthcare, you might use Ginkgo's platform to create antibodies or gene therapies. In industrials, Ginkgo can help by creating renewable chemicals, or sustainable building materials. The possibilities are almost endless, from haircare and skin products to making veggie burgers taste like meat.
Of course, companies could opt to do this development in-house. But Ginkgo's platform automates this manufacturing, making it five to 10 times cheaper than the status quo (doing it by hand). So if creating a cell now costs you $100, Ginkgo can get it done for $10 to $20.
And the company estimates that its automated platform will produce cell lines even more cheaply in the future. By 2025, what would cost you $100, Ginkgo will produce for $1.
The numbers suggest the future might be amazing. Ginkgo reported $438 million in revenues over the last year. And its revenue growth in the most recent quarter was 281% over the year-ago quarter.
What makes Ginkgo's model particularly attractive is that the company doesn't just get paid for its manufacturing -- it also gets future royalties from any new cell line. In the case of a syn-bio start-up, Ginkgo might take equity instead of royalties. Ultimately Ginkgo will have its fingers in a lot of pies across the syn-bio value chain.
Is it too early?
Right now, of course, Ginkgo is unprofitable, and the stock market has no appetite for risky high-growth names. So while there was a lot of excitement when Ginkgo shares hit the market, the stock has been crushed, down more than 60%.
DNA data by YCharts
There's been no bad news to precipitate the drop -- it's just the market we are currently in. And while it's definitely early in Ginkgo's story, the company's technology is actually pretty far along. Unlike a lot of biotech companies, Ginkgo has huge revenue numbers. And its sales growth is outstanding.
In my opinion, the cheaper price makes Ginkgo shares more interesting, not less. This is a fast-growing biotech stock with a huge potential upside. Risk-tolerant investors might want to open a small position now and take advantage of this market sell-off.

2022-06-06 00:00:00+00:00,"As Apple upgrades its software, developers hunt for headset hints",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/as-apple-upgrades-its-software-developers-hunt-for-headset-hints-0,,,"By Stephen Nellis
June 6 (Reuters) - As Apple Inc AAPL.O rolls out its usual stream of upgrades to operating systems for its iPhones, iPads and Macs at its annual software developer conference Monday, analysts and developers will be scouring between the lines for any hints about how a future mixed-reality headset might work.
That headset is likely to use cameras to pass a view of the outside world into a high-resolution display that can overlay digital objects on physical surroundings and could arrive in March of next year, said Anshel Sag, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. Such a device would be Apple's first entry into a new category of computing device since the Apple Watch shipped in 2015 and would put it in direct competition with Meta FB.O, which has disclosed plans for a mixed-reality headset code named ""Cambria"" to be released this year.
But neither Sag nor other developers and analysts interviewed by Reuters expect a sneak peek at the headset on Monday.
Instead, they will be looking for buried hints about the future device such as improvements in how Apple's devices process augmented reality scenes. They will be on the lookout for small surprises in so-called ""spatial"" features in which devices understand how they are being used in three-dimensional space, said Andrew McHugh, who co-founder of an app called Vivid that lets users virtually step inside their videos and photos. Apple has previously rolled out features such as spatial audio for its wireless headphones, where sounds change as users turn their heads.
While a headset is unlikely on Monday, Apple might announce an updated version of its Mac Pro computer, which is aimed at users such as developers who need a lot of computing power and is the last machine in Apple's lineup to use a central processor from Intel Corp INTC.O. That machine would likely feature a powerful processor made up of multiple Apple Silicon chips fused together with advanced packaging technology, said Ben Bajarin, head of consumer technologies at Creative Strategies.
The Apple Store was offline on Monday morning, a move that in the past has been followed by new products being added to the site.
Analysts expect some of the day's biggest takeaways to be updates to core products like the iPad. Bloomberg reported that Apple plans to overhaul the device's operating system to make it better for working with multiple apps and a keyboard. Such a move would reflect the fact that higher-end iPads have processor chips that are as powerful as Apple's Mac computers, but also features that those Mac computers do not have, such as touch screens and cellular data connections.
""For years, Apple pointed to the iPad as the computer for everyone. Now it feels increasingly like the Mac is the computer for everyone. If that’s the case, where do you take the iPad?” said Tom Mainelli, group president for consumer and device research at IDC.
Mac sales grew 23% to $35.2 billion the Apple's most recent fiscal year, powered by a combination of increased purchases of laptops for working from home and its introduction of its own line of Apple Silicon chips to power the machines. Bajarin said Apple might roll out new features designed to make Macs easier to use in corporate environments in a bid to takeaway market share from PC makers who rely on Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Windows operating system.
“I do think we’re on the cusp of an outbreak of Macs in enterprise,” Bajarin said.
Bloomberg has reported that Apple might release a new version of its MacBook Air laptop, one of its top-selling models for students and most office workers, with a new chip called the M2, though some analysts like Bajarin believe Apple might save the debut of that model for later in the year when the company typically introduces products aimed at consumers.

2022-06-06 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: What You Should Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-stock-sinks-as-market-gains%3A-what-you-should-know-0,,,"Intel (INTC) closed the most recent trading day at $43.34, moving -0.12% from the previous trading session. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.31%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.05%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.14%.
Heading into today, shares of the world's largest chipmaker had lost 2.05% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 3.62% and lagging the S&P 500's loss of 1.38% in that time.
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Intel as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Intel to post earnings of $0.70 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 45.31%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $18.02 billion, down 8.2% from the prior-year quarter.
Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.53 per share and revenue of $75.55 billion. These totals would mark changes of -35.47% and -3.17%, respectively, from last year.
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Intel should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Intel is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Intel has a Forward P/E ratio of 12.3 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 11.89.
It is also worth noting that INTC currently has a PEG ratio of 1.64. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Semiconductor - General industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.1 as of yesterday's close.
The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 160, putting it in the bottom 37% of all 250+ industries.
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

2022-06-06 00:00:00+00:00,"As Apple upgrades its software, developers hunt for headset hints",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/as-apple-upgrades-its-software-developers-hunt-for-headset-hints,,,"By Stephen Nellis
June 6 (Reuters) - As Apple Inc AAPL.O rolls out its usual stream of upgrades to operating systems for its iPhones, iPads and Macs at its annual software developer conference Monday, analysts and developers will be scouring between the lines for any hints about how a future mixed-reality headset might work.
That headset is likely to use cameras to pass a view of the outside world into a high-resolution display that can overlay digital objects on physical surroundings and could arrive in March of next year, said Anshel Sag, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. Such a device would be Apple's first entry into a new category of computing device since the Apple Watch shipped in 2015 and would put it in direct competition with Meta FB.O, which has disclosed plans for a mixed-reality headset code named ""Cambria"" to be released this year.
But neither Sag nor other developers and analysts interviewed by Reuters expect a sneak peek at the headset on Monday.
Instead, they will be looking for buried hints about the future device such as improvements in how Apple's devices process augmented reality scenes. They will be on the lookout for small surprises in so-called ""spatial"" features in which devices understand how they are being used in three-dimensional space, said Andrew McHugh, who co-founder of an app called Vivid that lets users virtually step inside their videos and photos. Apple has previously rolled out features such as spatial audio for its wireless headphones, where sounds change as users turn their heads.
While a headset is unlikely on Monday, Apple might announce an updated version of its Mac Pro computer, which is aimed at users such as developers who need a lot of computing power and is the last machine in Apple's lineup to use a central processor from Intel Corp INTC.O. That machine would likely feature a powerful processor made up of multiple Apple Silicon chips fused together with advanced packaging technology, said Ben Bajarin, head of consumer technologies at Creative Strategies.
Analysts expect some of the day's biggest takeaways to be updates to core products like the iPad. Bloomberg reported that Apple plans to overhaul the device's operating system to make it better for working with multiple apps and a keyboard. Such a move would reflect the fact that higher-end iPads have processor chips that are as powerful as Apple's Mac computers, but also features that those Mac computers do not have, such as touch screens and cellular data connections.
""For years, Apple pointed to the iPad as the computer for everyone. Now it feels increasingly like the Mac is the computer for everyone. If that’s the case, where do you take the iPad?” said Tom Mainelli, group president for consumer and device research at IDC.
Mac sales grew 23% to $35.2 billion the Apple's most recent fiscal year, powered by a combination of increased purchases of laptops for working from home and its introduction of its own line of Apple Silicon chips to power the machines. Bajarin said Apple might roll out new features designed to make Macs easier to use in corporate environments in a bid to takeaway market share from PC makers who rely on Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Windows operating system.
“I do think we’re on the cusp of an outbreak of Macs in enterprise,” Bajarin said.
Bloomberg has reported that Apple might release a new version of its MacBook Air laptop, one of its top-selling models for students and most office workers, with a new chip called the M2, though some analysts like Bajarin believe Apple might save the debut of that model for later in the year when the company typically introduces products aimed at consumers.

2022-06-06 00:00:00+00:00,Investors Heavily Search Intel Corporation (INTC): Here is What You Need to Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investors-heavily-search-intel-corporation-intc%3A-here-is-what-you-need-to-know,,,"Intel (INTC) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Over the past month, shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -2.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Intel falls in, has lost 3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.70 per share, indicating a change of -45.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.53 points to a change of -35.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.69 indicates a change of +4.6% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +137.2%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intel is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Intel, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $18.02 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -8.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $75.55 billion and $78.72 billion estimates indicate -3.2% and +4.2% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $18.35 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.7%. EPS of $0.87 for the same period compares with $1.39 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.18%. The EPS surprise was +8.75%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

2022-06-03 00:00:00+00:00,Apple Was the Worst Stock in the Dow Friday,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-was-the-worst-stock-in-the-dow-friday,,,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped close to 350 points on Friday, despite a better-than-expected jobs report. For the week, however, the Dow Jones finished higher by nearly 165 points as volatile trading continued.
No stock in the Dow saw a bigger percentage drop than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which fell nearly 4% today after several analysts warned about slowing App Store revenue growth. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) was the day's second-biggest loser on a percentage basis, finishing the day more than 3% down.
Although ADP reported yesterday that private payrolls in May added the smallest number of new jobs since the COVID-19 recovery began, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today that nonfarm payrolls added 390,000 jobs last month. That was much stronger than the 328,000 jobs that most economists had been expecting. The conflicting data is nothing new, as investors struggle to try and figure out where the economy could land over the next six to 18 months.
Slowing App Store growth at Apple
Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty warned today that App Store revenue growth may have started to slow in May, hinting that services revenue at Apple could come in weaker for the current quarter than many had initially thought. Huberty pointed to data from a company called Sensor Tower that showed just 4% revenue growth in May on a year-over-year basis.
""While we believe Apple user spending is more resilient at all stages of the economic cycle, which positions Apple better than other consumer hardware peers, a deceleration in App Store growth likely points to fading consumer spending on goods/services that accelerated during the pandemic,"" Huberty wrote in a research note.
Image source: Getty Images.
App Store revenue is a big component of the company's services revenue, which made up more than 20% of net sales in the tech giant's most recent quarter.
Huberty projects that App Store revenue could fall by as much as $560 million from her initial forecast, which could hit her services revenue forecast for the current quarter by more than 3%.
Huberty's note is the second warning this week from analysts. Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani also noted yesterday that the 4% growth is weaker than the 9% year-over-year App Store revenue growth Apple saw in April.
""We had expected growth to accelerate as comps became easier, so the slowdown is somewhat surprising, especially as China saw a large deceleration when we were anticipating some uplift from the ongoing lockdowns,"" Daryanani wrote in a research note.
Still, even though App Store revenue growth might be slowing, both Huberty and Daryanani are bullish on the stock. Huberty has an ""overweight"" rating on Apple and a price target of $195. Daryanani also has an ""overweight"" rating and price target of $210. Apple closed the day at $145 per share, implying substantial upside to both of the analysts' price targets.
Why Apple could bounce back
The analysts are right to suggest that Apple could face some near-term headwinds. Consumer spending could slow in the face of higher prices and as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, which increases the cost of consumer debt and adds financial strain to consumer's finances. But I would still expect Apple to be a good long-term pick.
It's one of the largest companies in the world and has a strong financial position -- just last quarter it generated more than $28 billion of operating cash flow.
Apple will also likely be a good name to hold in the midst of high inflation. Although many of its flagship products are partial to consumer spending trends, the Apple brand is so powerful that it has the ability to raise prices and pass those onto the consumer without too much pushback. Eventually, supply chain issues will also hopefully clear, presenting a tailwind for the stock.

Top Analyst Reports for Broadcom, Intel and Union Pacific
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc., Intel Corp., and Union Pacific Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
 
You can see all of today's research reports here >>>
Broadcom shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the past year (+23.6 % vs. +13.8%) on the back of strength in networking and server storage segments. Networking is riding on strong adoption of Broadcom's next-gen merchant switching and routing solutions by hyperscalers, enterprises and service providers. Aggressive adoption of its next-generation server storage solutions by hyperscalers is expected to drive top-line growth.
Broadcom expects fiscal third-quarter networking and server storage revenues to grow more than 25% and 60% on a year-over-year basis, respectively. An upbeat third-quarter fiscal 2022 guidance is encouraging. Recently announced VMware acquisition will aid prospects over the long term. However, increasing competition, along with high debt levels, are persistent overhangs.
(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)
Intel shares have declined -13.0% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry's decline of -25.1%. The Zacks analyst believes that the Client Computing Group is expected to suffer due to component shortage. Production delays pertaining to 7 nm ramp up remain a concern. A strained Sino-U.S. trade relationship, imposition of fresh lockdown restrictions in some markets, forex woes and high debt burden remain other concerns.
However, despite short-term headwinds, the company expects demand to pick up in the second half of the year. The company is riding on prospects of the Internet of Things and Mobileye businesses. Mobileye growth should be driven by design wins amid recovering automotive industry. Recovery in the enterprise business of the data center segment is a positive. Intel is developing more integrated solutions that will likely be competitive on a cost per watt basis while offering customized solutions for bigger firms.

Union Pacific shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (+0.6 % vs. -4.4%). The company raised its dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP upped its quarterly dividend by a further 10%. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front. Management anticipates share repurchases in 2022 to be in line with the 2021 levels of $7.3 billion.
The Zacks analyst believes that the company's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. Uptick in freight revenues (up 17% year over year in first-quarter 2022) as economic activities pick up the pace is an added positive.
However, escalation in fuel costs (up 74% in the March quarter) as oil prices moved north induced a 16% rise in the operating expenses. High debt/EBITDA ratio and tepid automotive demand are further concerns. Increased capex may also be bothersome.

It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-06-03 00:00:00+00:00,Why Advanced Micro Devices Rose 19.1% in May,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-advanced-micro-devices-rose-19.1-in-may,,,"What happened
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) surged 19.1% higher in May, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
The 19.1% gain came after a 21.8% decline in April. Still, there is a case to be made for more upside, since May's rally was powered by strong earnings that defied the skepticism voiced by some analysts during the prior month.
So what
In the first quarter, which was reported in early May, AMD's revenue surged 71% to $5.89 billion, with non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $1.13, up 117%. Both figures handily beat analyst estimates. AMD management gave strong guidance as well, with the recent acquisition of Xilinx boosting numbers.
There was a fair amount of consternation around the health of the consumer going into the quarter, but AMD's computing and graphics segment, which is focused on PCs, still grew 33% year over year. Of course, that segment was overshadowed by its enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom division, which notably makes the Epyc server processors. That segment was up 88%, powered by Epyc chip sales, which more than doubled.
Traditionally the smaller of the two segments, AMD's enterprise segment reached $2.5 billion in revenue, closing in on the client and graphics segment at $2.8 billion. Given the momentum in the data center segment more broadly across tech, it would not be surprising to see the enterprise segment overtake the client and graphics segment at some point soon.
Also helping matters was $559 million in revenue from Xilinx, which was acquired during the quarter. Had Xilinx been around for the entire quarter, it would have made more than $1 billion in revenue, or about 16% of the company's new total going forward.
On the conference call with analysts, CEO Lisa Su did point to some ""softness"" in parts of the PC market, but also noted AMD is gaining market share while focusing on the high end of the market, which remains strong. So, its PC chip-related sales shouldn't suffer that much. Additionally, she emphasized not all parts of the market were soft, as the data center appears to be booming with no letup in sight.
Excluding the contribution from Xilinx, management still guided for a mid-30% organic growth rate in the core chip business for the full year, up from a 31% guide in the prior quarter. The change was primarily due to increased demand for server chips.

Now what
After a big valuation reset in the first half of the year, AMD has come bouncing back with many other tech stocks. AMD's stock is now back up to trading around 40 times trailing earnings and less than 25 times this year's earnings estimates. That's not unreasonable for a company growing at a mid-30% organic growth rate, and AMD shares are still down about 33% from all-time highs set last November. Shares may have very well been ahead of themselves then, but not much has changed with the business, which remains strong.
While things could change if there is a bad recession, AMD's stock price is now much more reasonable, even after the May surge.

2022-06-03 00:00:00+00:00,The 3 Best Long-Term Stocks to Add to Your Q2 Buy List,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-3-best-long-term-stocks-to-add-to-your-q2-buy-list,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
We went looking for the best long-term investment stocks as our topic for today. So far, 2022 has shown us that even some of the most robust shares can be vulnerable to volatility on Wall Street.
The market continues to suffer the effects of high inflation, tightening monetary policy, and fears of a looming economic downturn. As a result, the NASDAQ 100 index has fallen 22.3% for the year to date (YTD), while the S&P 500 index has dropped 12.8%.
Yet, the recent slowdown also provides an excellent opportunity to pick such great stocks up while they’re on sale. For instance, according to Capital Group, “The S&P 500 Index has typically dipped at least 10% about once a year, and 20% or more about every six years, according to data from 1950 to 2019… The average return in the first year after each of these declines was 54%.”

In other words, large companies generally have a well-established history of rebounding quickly. As the positive moves last week have shown, a similar recovery could be here soon.
With that information, here’s a closer look at our three long-term stocks to buy in June:
Ticker Company Current Price
GM General Motors Company $38.87
INTC Intel Corporation $44.84
MRK Merck & Co., Inc. $90.00

Purchasing the vehicle also entitles customers to a special charging program, providing either a credit for home installation of a charger or unlimited charging at public stations for two years. Wall Street will be paying close attention to how EV sales may contribute to the top line in the coming months.
So far in the year, GM stock has lost a third of its value. Shares are trading at 5.04 times forward earnings and 0.40 times trailing sales. The 12-month median forecast stands at $58.50.
