2022-09-28 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia Stock Has Grown 2.5x In Less Than Five Years- Here's Why,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-has-grown-2.5x-in-less-than-five-years-heres-why,,,"Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock price rose more than 2.5x from $48 in 2017 end to around $125 currently, primarily due to favorable changes in its sales. During this period, the company witnessed a strong 206% rise in revenues, and despite a 19% drop in its P/S multiple and a 5.4% rise in the outstanding share count, the company’s stock price has rallied. Further, over the same period, the S&P 500 returned around 40%, meaning that NVDA stock has managed to strongly beat the index since 2017-end.
In our interactive dashboard, Why Nvidia Stock Moved: NVDA Stock Has Gained 159% Since 2017, we break down the factors behind this move.
(A) NVDA’s Total Revenue has grown 206% from $9.7 billion in FY 2018 to $29.7 billion on an LTM basis
NVDA’s total revenue hovered between $10 billion to $12 billion from FY ’18 to FY ’20, but demand has picked up since the pandemic and sales have risen strongly to $26.9 billion in FY ’22, and currently stand even higher at $29.7 billion (NVDA’s fiscal year ends in January).
Nvidia is a major player in the GPU market, with its sales being driven by gaming processors and data centers.
Nvidia’s largest segment is the graphics segment, bringing in $15.9 billion as of FY ’22, making up around 59% of the company’s total sales.
For additional details about NVDA’s revenues and comparison to peers, see Nvidia (NVDA) Revenue Comparison
(B) Revenue per share (RPS) increased 191% from $4.06 in FY 2018 to $11.79 currently
NVDA’s revenue rose from $9.7 billion in FY 2018 to $29.7 billion currently, while the outstanding share count rose from 2.4 billion in FY 2018 to around 2.5 billion currently.
Due to this, RPS has jumped almost 3x from $4.06 in FY ’18 to $11.79 currently.
(C) Price-To-Sales (P/S) multiple for NVDA rose strongly from 13.1x in 2017 to 46.4x by 2021 end, but has pulled back to 10.6x currently, lower than its 2017 level
NVDA’s P/S multiple rose strongly to around 46.4x by late 2021, on the back of rising investor expectations surrounding increased demand for its graphic processors, leading to a rise in the company’s sales.
However, due to the current geopolitical tensions and increased economic uncertainty weighing on the broader markets, the P/S multiple has pulled back, currently standing at around 10.6x.

2022-09-28 00:00:00+00:00,Investors Heavily Search Intel Corporation (INTC): Here is What You Need to Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investors-heavily-search-intel-corporation-intc%3A-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-1,,,"Intel (INTC) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -16.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -9.9% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Intel belongs, has lost 18.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.34 per share, indicating a change of -80.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.3% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $2.24 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -59.1%. This estimate has changed -0.9% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.61 indicates a change of +16.2% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Intel.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Intel, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.57 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -18.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $66.2 billion and $68.23 billion estimates indicate -15.2% and +3.1% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $15.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22%. EPS of $0.29 for the same period compares with $1.28 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -14.51%. The EPS surprise was -57.97%.
Over the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-09-28 00:00:00+00:00,Intel: Value Stock or Value Trap?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel%3A-value-stock-or-value-trap,,,"Semiconductor stocks have suffered mightily as the economic slowdown has shifted consumers’ focus to necessities rather than spending on technology products. Affordable food, clothing, and shelter become critically important during high inflationary periods with mortgage rates reaching their highest levels since the financial crisis in 2008.
The semiconductor industry is very cyclical, making the current market environment more treacherous for these equities. Still, the decline in Intel INTC has been somewhat monumental. Investors have seen rival Advanced Micro Devices AMD grow up and rip away market share from Intel right in front of their eyes over the last five years.
This poses the question, at current levels is Intel still a value stock, or is it now a value trap?
Let’s take a closer look at INTC’s fundamentals and outlook to get a more elaborate answer to the question.
Performance
Intel stock has tumbled -47% year to date, almost double the S&P 500’s -24% decline. However, this has been the case for the Semi-General Market as a whole with Intel’s Zacks Subindustry down -48% YTD, with AMD down -52%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
 Despite the current unfavorable market environment for semiconductor stocks, Intel’s fall began some years prior. From the above chart, we can see the astonishing performance comparison to AMD. Over the last five years, AMD is up an impressive 434% vs. INTC’s subpar -29% decline.
The price-performance chart also symbolizes AMD taking market share from Intel as they began competing for PC and server chips. AMD surpassed Intel in terms of market cap during the second quarter, which was well noted by investors and analysts, intensifying concerns that Intel is now a value trap.
Intel posted poor earnings during the second quarter, which gave way to AMD officially passing INTC in terms of market cap. INTC missed second-quarter earnings expectations by 58% with earnings of $0.29 a share. This represented a 78% decrease from Q2 2021 with GAAP revenue down 22% as well.
Outlook
Third quarter earnings are expected to be down -80% from the year prior at $0.34 a share, based on Zacks estimates. Third quarter sales are also projected to fall-19% at $15.57 billion.
Year over year INTC’s annual earnings are projected to drop -59% in 2022, but its FY23 earnings are expected to grow 16%. Top line growth is expected in FY23 with sales up 3% at $68.23 billion but this year’s sales are expected to be down 15%.
During its second-quarter earnings release, Intel mentioned its Client Computing, Datacenter, and AI Groups were largely impacted by continued adverse market conditions. The company did highlight that its Network, Edge Group, and Mobileye units achieved record quarterly revenue.
CEO Pat Gelsinger said second-quarter results were below company standards and that Intel must and will do better for its shareholders. Intel recently launched its 13th-Gen chip and expanded its developer cloud to have a better chance at competing with rivals AMD and Nvidia NVDA.  
Valuation
Trading around $27 a share, INTC has a forward P/E of 11.9X, which is still above the industry average of 10.6X. This is below the high of 16X over the last five years and near the median of 12.1X.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Despite the low P/E, EPS estimate revisions have continued to trend down for INTC over the last 60 days. One thing that is favorable for INTC is its low forward EV/EBITDA at 4.81X vs the market average of 11.8X as shown in the above chart. This indicates Intel has an impressive balance sheet with access to cash and a strong total debt-to-asset ratio. This is also the lowest Intel’s EV/EBITDA has been over the last 20 years.
The low EV/EBITDA is critical for Intel during economic uncertainty in the semiconductor industry.
Bottom Line
Unfortunately for Intel and its shareholders, the stock looks more like a value trap even at current levels. INTC currently lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in correlation with the declining earnings estimate revisions and tough economic environment for semiconductor stocks. The Semiconductor-General Industry is currently in the bottom 15% of over 250 Zacks Industries. Increasing competition which has been evident in the loss of market share to AMD has also continued to weigh on Intel’s stock.
This is not to say that Intel can’t eventually turn things around and regain its footing as a semiconductor power. INTC has a low EV/EBITDA and strong cash flow to help with the process. For now, investors may want to be cautious of INTC stock.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-09-28 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Stocks That Just Went on Sale,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-stocks-that-just-went-on-sale-4,,,"While it's impossible to absolutely time a bottom in the markets, when the market is down, economic news is the scariest, and you feel least like buying, history has shown that tends to be a great long-term opportunity.
High-multiple growth stocks fell hard late last year as interest rates rose, but cheaper, dividend-paying cyclical stocks have plummeted more recently, as investors fear that central banks and geopolitical events may put the economy into recession.
However, even high-quality cyclical names with staying power have become really cheap, with compelling shareholder returns when adding up their dividends plus share repurchases -- like the the following three stocks.
KLA
The semiconductor sector is coming off two and a half boom years, but some now fear a bust as the global economy slows. Consumers who stocked up on computers and phones during the pandemic probably have a relatively new device, and recent estimates for this year's PC sales have been particularly bad.
However, looking past this year at the long-term growth of chip-heavy applications such as artificial intelligence, autonomous EVs, and the Internet of Things, a rebound should eventually occur.
KLA (NASDAQ: KLAC) is one of just a handful of companies that dominate the semiconductor equipment space. It's far and away the leader in inspection and metrology equipment, which inspect logic and memory chips for imperfections at each step of the chipmaking process.
In this downturn, KLA's price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple has fallen to a lowly 13.9, a valuation only seen last in the 2014 and 2018-2019 chip downturns.
Yet even in 2019, which was a pretty nasty semiconductor recession, KLA's revenue growth decelerated but didn't go negative. Operating income dipped slightly, as KLA kept investing in research and development and sales. After that soft year, growth reaccelerated.
KLA's financial metrics have been pretty stable relative to other equipment-makers, generating cash in good times and bad. That could be because as chips get denser and transistors are deposited on silicon at ever tinier distances, it requires more metrology.
So even in down years, leading chip designers still invest in the next node to stay competitive. This year, we're seeing foundries become highly competitive. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Samsung are investing to try to catch Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), which took the lead in terms of leading-edge production capabilities several years ago. Helped by the CHIPS Act and other subsidies, these companies are likely to keep investing to catch up, even in the soft part of the cycle.
KLA has also stepped up its repurchases recently, with a $3 billion accelerated repurchase program that was completed near the June lows, retiring a high-single digit percentage of its stock. The stock can be bought near those price levels today.
Thanks to those repurchases, KLA should see accelerated EPS growth coming out of this cycle, when revenue and profits eventually reaccelerate.
Bank of America
Another cyclical stock that has taken it on the chin is Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). Ever since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, CEO Brian Moynihan has positioned Bank of America to withstand the next big downturn. Pursuing a ""smart growth"" strategy, Bank of America has methodically pursued steady, if not spectacular, growth, while focusing on prime customers.
Although it is diversified with sales and trading and investment banking segments, BofA's revenue mix skews more toward plain vanilla lending relative to other big Wall Street banks. In addition, Bank of America's national scale allows it to pay less on deposits than other smaller banks and upstart competitors.
The combination of a lending focus, high-quality borrower base, and low deposit rates positions Bank of America perfectly for this environment. Interest rates have gone up very quickly this year, so BofA will see its net interest income rise rapidly along with it. Net interest income is the spread between interest charged on loans, mortgages, and other loans products minus the rate BofA pays out to depositors. While the company had already forecast a strong year of net interest income last quarter, larger-than-expected interest rate increases since then are likely to improve upon those prior projections.
Meanwhile, recession fears have knocked down BofA's P/E multiple to just 9.7. While a bad recession could impact earnings, charge-offs are very low right now, as consumers still have lots of savings leftover from the pandemic. Moynihan's ""smart growth"" strategy is likely to pay off, so perhaps the bank can see its multiple rerate higher on the other side of a downturn. If we avoid a recession, this stock could really take off.
Pioneer Natural Resources
Oil prices have fallen recently, nearing the prices at which they started the year. However, Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD) should have no trouble minting profits even at these lower prices, thanks to its prime acreage in the low-cost Midland Basin of the Permian Shale in Texas.
In fact, Pioneer has more than 20 years of high-quality oil inventory with breakeven prices below $40 per barrel. That's the largest sub-$40 U.S. inventory position of any shale driller. Furthermore, Pioneer has a rock-solid balance sheet, with just $3.1 billion in net debt. For reference, the company generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow last quarter alone.
With that solid balance sheet, Pioneer is paying out most of its cash flow to shareholders, consisting of a fixed dividend of $4.40, yielding about 2.14% at this valuation. However, Pioneer also pays out a variable dividend with the remaining 75% of its free cash flow after the fixed. On top of that, the company is even repurchasing a bit of stock. On a trailing basis, the stock has yielded 9.74%, but last quarter, when oil prices were high and Pioneer realized sales at $110 per barrel, the total dividend amounted to 16.7% on an annualized basis.
Oil prices are of course lower now, but given Pioneer's low-cost asset base, low debt, and still-solid dividend, it's another top-quality, resilient stock that has recently gone on sale.

2022-09-28 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Takes Competition Head-On, Launches New GPU",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-nasdaq%3Aintc-takes-competition-head-on-launches-new-gpu,,,"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is taking its rivals head-on with the launch of the new ARC A770 GPU (graphics processing unit). At the Intel Innovation conference, the semiconductor giant said that the ARC 770 GPU would be available from October 12 at a retail price starting at $329. The pricing of the new GPU is at par with rival Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) comparable offering. Intel also announced a new Unison app and 13th-generation desktop processors.
Notably, Intel has lost market share due to the delay in new product launches and “prior product missteps,” noted Benchmark analyst Cody Acree. However, the analyst stated, “Intel’s leadership is putting in place processes and methodologies that are currently working to correct mistakes of the past and place the company on a new footing of increased competitiveness in both design and manufacturing processes.”
What is the Prediction for Intel stock?
Intel stock has corrected by over 46% year-to-date, and these new launches could support its comeback. However, Acree highlighted that the industry is in a cyclical correction, reflected by a slowdown in consumer demand on account of macro headwinds. The analyst maintains a Hold recommendation on INTC stock.
Along with Acree, most analysts remain sidelined on INTC stock. It has received four Buy, 16 Hold, and nine Sell recommendations for a Hold consensus rating on TipRanks. Meanwhile, analysts’ average price target of $38.55 implies 43.4% upside potential. 
While analysts maintain a Hold, hedge fund managers sold 1.3M INTC stock last quarter. However, insiders bought INTC stock worth $501.1K. Intel stock sports a Neutral Smart Score of six out of 10 on TipRanks.  
Bottom Line: Lower Demand a Hurdle
Weakness in consumer demand due to macro and geopolitical headwinds will likely hurt chip makers in the short term. Meanwhile, DigiTimes, a daily journal for the tech industry, reported that major clients of Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) are downwardly adjusting their orders amid the slowdown. 
All of these indicate that the chip makers could struggle to lift sales in the near term. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, here is a summary of how top chip makers stack up on TipRanks’ valuable datasets.
The data reveals that only AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has an Outperform Smart Score on TipRanks, implying it is most likely to beat market averages.

2022-09-28 00:00:00+00:00,Is iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) a Strong ETF Right Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-ishares-msci-usa-value-factor-etf-vlue-a-strong-etf-right-now-4,,,"The iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) made its debut on 04/16/2013, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.
A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency, market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns.
There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Because the fund has amassed over $7.35 billion, this makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Value. VLUE is managed by Blackrock. This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index.
The MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index is based on a traditional market capitalization-weighted parent index, the MSCI USA Index which includes U.S. large and mid capitalization stocks.
Cost & Other Expenses
For ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.
Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.15% for this ETF, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.52%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
For VLUE, it has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector --about 25.30% of the portfolio --while Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, At&t Inc (T) accounts for about 4.81% of total assets, followed by Intel Corporation Corp (INTC) and Ford Motor Co (F).
VLUE's top 10 holdings account for about 27.17% of its total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF has lost about -23.62% so far this year and is down about -17.26% in the last one year (as of 09/28/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $82.69 and $114.92.
The fund has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 27.03% for the trailing three-year period, which makes VLUE a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 155 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
IShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.
IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) tracks Russell 1000 Value Index and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) tracks CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $47.39 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $90.16 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Value.

Sept 27 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O plans to expand the Intel Developer Cloud to allow customers to try a range of new chips before they hit the market, a move it hopes will lure more application developers to use its processors, the company said on Tuesday.
Chip companies are increasingly enabling software and hardware developers to test out chips virtually in the cloud before they are shipped to save time.
A strong software developer ecosystem is increasingly becoming a competitive edge for semiconductor hardware manufacturers. It is one reason many artificial intelligence researchers say they use Nvidia Corp chips for AI computing work, because its CUDA software platform has a large user base.
""In some ways Intel is the biggest software company that you've never heard of,"" said Nick McKeown, who leads Intel’s Network and Edge group, adding that there are over 20,000 software developers at Intel. ""What we’ve done in the past is tend to do the software that just enables the low level silicon to shine, but it's kind of invisible.""
He said Intel is trying to make the developer cloud easier to use and also trying to hook the next generation of developers to make applications for Intel chips.
To that end, four years ago Intel hired Ria Cheruvu, a child engineering prodigy who joined the company at 14 with a bachelor's degree in computer science from Harvard. Cheruvu said young developers face a lot of pain points in understanding the technology and experimenting with them, and that the developer cloud was helping to address some of the issues.
Intel on Tuesday at its developer conference also unveiled its 13th generation Intel Core desktop processor to help improve gaming experiences and the Intel Geti platform to help customers develop and use AI for computer vision.

2022-09-27 00:00:00+00:00,Micron Earnings Preview: Can the Semiconductor Giant Get Back on Track?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-earnings-preview%3A-can-the-semiconductor-giant-get-back-on-track,,,"Semiconductor stocks tend to be cyclical in nature. Although they are the backbone of technology, chips go through major cycles alongside the economy and demand for electronics.
With inflation continuing to rise, it is no surprise that many semiconductor companies such as Micron Technology MU, Intel INTC and Advanced Micro Devices AMD have all seen their stocks be crushed by weakening consumer demand. Consumers are reluctant to spend on technology products during high inflationary periods.
Micron is one of the largest makers of memory chips in the world, with its offerings in PCs, smartphones, and other devises. Micron is also expanding into other areas like data centers, electric and connected vehicles, 5G, artificial intelligence, and more. Trading 50% off its highs, it will be important to see Micron’s demand outlook for semiconductor memory solutions.
Micron stated last quarter that industry demand had weakened, but CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said he was taking actions to moderate supply growth in fiscal 2023. Mehrotra went on to say that long-term secular demand for memory and storage are well positioned to deliver strong cross-cycle financial performance.
Performance
Micron stock is down -46% year to date. Despite the large decline over the last year, Micron shares are up a respectable +33% in the past five years with the benchmark at +51%. Micron has also outperformed the Semi-Memory Market over this time span with its Zacks Subindustry at +28%.
Micron has also posted positive earnings surprises for 10 consecutive quarters.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Outlook
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MU’s fiscal Q4 earnings is $1.45 per share, which would represent a considerable -40% decrease from Q4 2021. Sales for Q4 are also expected to decline 16% at $6.92 billion. Estimates for the period have continued trending down over the past two months, with full year earnings estimates for this year and FY23 trending down as well.
Year over year, MU is projected to post 37% earnings growth in 2022, but FY23 earnings are expected to decline -46%. Top line growth is expected to be up 12% in FY22 but decline -15% in FY23 to $26.18 billion.
Despite the trend of beatings earnings expectations, Micron shares have stayed submerged in volatility with the company’s mention of weakening demand being noted by investors during MU’s fiscal third quarter. The current quarter will be no different and the company’s guidance will be more closely monitored than usual under uncertain economic conditions.
Valuation
Currently trading around $50 a share, MU has a forward P/E of 10.8X. This is much lower than its high over the last five years of 29.8X and near the median of 8.1X.
Despite Micron’s forward P/E indicating the company trades at a discount relative to its past, the uncertain economic environment, particularly for technology stocks has seen MU’s estimate revisions continue to decline.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
 Bottom Line
Rising inflation has severely impacted the demand for chips in regard to the business outlook for new products and expansion for semiconductor memory technology. MU currently lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in correlation to current chip demand and downward earnings estimate revisions.
Perhaps an earnings beat, and more importantly, better than expected FY23 guidance could help get MU stock back on track.

2022-09-27 00:00:00+00:00,Qualcomm Stock Is a Buy but Not Because of Its Automotive Segment,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-is-a-buy-but-not-because-of-its-automotive-segment,,,"Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM) first automotive-investor day has brought attention to the company for something other than smartphones. The chip designer has diversified into non-smartphone products. While much of its previous effort has focused on the metaverse, Qualcomm is now making its mark on the automotive sector.
The question for stockholders and prospective investors is, how will the automotive pivot drive the stock? Let's take a closer look.
Qualcomm's automotive-investor day
Qualcomm gained attention in the automotive sector when it announced a ""breakthrough automotive processor"" in 2016. However, 2022 may be the year that puts the Qualcomm automotive segment on the map. After launching the Qualcomm Digital Chassis in January, the company has followed up with the recent investor day.
Its digital chassis applies 5G, telematics, location, and other technologies combined into a set of cloud-connected platforms. This manages a car's communications within a digital cockpit, as well as driver assistance and autonomous-driving functions.
With such functionality, Qualcomm now estimates the size of its design-win pipeline at $30 billion, an increase of more than $10 billion since its recent earnings report. Additionally, Qualcomm believes its total addressable market will grow to $100 billion by 2030, and it has projected its automotive revenue-growth accordingly.
QUALCOMM-PROJECTED AUTOMOTIVE REVENUES
Fiscal 2022 $1.3 billion
Fiscal 2026 $4 billion
Fiscal 2031 $9 billion
Source: Qualcomm.
The investor conundrum
For what it's worth, I'm a Qualcomm shareholder who's optimistic about its segments, including automotive. In a few years, I believe the digital chassis will boost the investment case for buying and owning this semiconductor stock.
The problem is that Qualcomm has not yet reached that point. In its fiscal third quarter (which ended June 26), automotive brought in $350 million in revenue. This amounts to approximately 3% of the company's revenue.
By comparison, handsets made up about 56% of the company's revenue and grew by 59% year over year, faster than automotive, which grew 38%. Still, Qualcomm expects an eventual slowing in the handset market. Once 5G upgrades slow, it looks increasingly likely that automotive and other segments will drive more growth.
However, with the upgrade cycle in 5G, handset growth has remained rapid. This led to 36% revenue growth in Q3 for Qualcomm overall and a 53% increase in net income as Qualcomm kept the growth of costs and expenses in check.
Additionally, investors may not appreciate the company's current valuation. Despite its growth, Qualcomm stock trades at only 11 times earnings. This is lower than every major chip company except for Intel. But unlike Intel, Qualcomm is a technical leader, indicating significant undervaluation in the stock.
Consider Qualcomm stock, but not yet for automotive
Qualcomm is a high-growth chip stock at an excessively low valuation. This situation could mean that it's time to buy Qualcomm stock. Moreover, after its automotive-investor day, Qualcomm's future looks promising in the automotive sector as smartphone chipsets presumably become a less prominent revenue driver.
However, investors looking for an automotive driver for revenue may not find it in Qualcomm just yet. While it should become an increasingly significant player in the automobile sector, Qualcomm stock will likely be more heavily tied to its other segments for the foreseeable future.

2022-09-27 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Is My Top Tech Stock Buy Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-is-my-top-tech-stock-buy-right-now,,,"2022 has been an ugly year for tech stocks, even for those companies that are fast-growing and profitable. The market has become hyper-focused on valuations, and the growing risk of a recession. The U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate posturing has ensured that anxiety runs high right now.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is a gem in the semiconductor industry and one of the stocks that is being wrongfully taken out with the garbage. Not only is this a fast-growing business, but the company is also profitable and those profit margins are rising. If you can stomach the current turbulence and plan on holding for at least a few years, this is a top tech stock to consider buying right now. Here's why it tops my list.
A new emerging market leader
Long considered the second fiddle to Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), AMD's suite of semiconductors has been building momentum for over a decade now. The company made some hard decisions during the Great Recession of 2008-09. Instead of limping along with an integrated chip design and manufacturing business model, AMD decided to offload its fab segment (it became the company now known as GlobalFoundries) and go all-in on design work.
That has given AMD the resources to steadily eat into Intel's lead in processors, a lead that even current Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has admitted might get slimmer in the next couple of years. This is occurring not just for processors used in consumer electronics like PCs and laptops, but also in the highly lucrative and fast-growing enterprise market, which encompasses cloud computing infrastructure.
As AMD has built up its momentum, it's swung from frequently unprofitable a decade ago to highly profitable today. It's used this newfound profitability to help fund multiple acquisitions, including enterprise server start-up Pensando early this year. The mega-merger with Xilinx (the leader in field-programmable gate arrays) early in 2022 also opened up a new front against Intel and gives AMD another way to bundle its hardware orders together for customers seeking ways to consolidate purchases to save a little money.
AMD could also pick up some more market share in the video gaming realm too. Long-time gaming GPU leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) unveiled its new generation of high-end graphics cards late in September (the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090), and the price tag is being decried as ""too steep"" by many gamers. AMD was ready with an alternative, previewing its own new GPU lineup (the RX 7000 series) at a competitive price. We'll get more details from AMD in November on how its gaming efforts did. While these GPUs may not boast the same raw computing power Nvidia does, many enthusiasts might choose to switch to AMD if the price is right.
Changing of the guard could take years
This steady changing of the guard could take years, and bring lots more upside for AMD shareholders. In its battle against Intel, in particular, AMD could have a serious edge. Intel has ceded lots of market share in recent years and is having its own struggles now with a lack of resources. The company wants to bet on manufacturing, an expensive and very long-term undertaking. But money is a finite resource. Building new chip fabs might simply be leaving too little moola for Intel to keep pace with AMD's engineering teams.
This isn't just a story of AMD stealing lunch from its peers. The semiconductor industry is undergoing rapid change and expansion right now. Estimates point toward global chip demand reaching $1 trillion a year by 2030, some 60% higher than global sales today. That would be welcome news for Intel shareholders too, and for all chip stocks in general for that matter. But AMD could have the most to gain with its broadly diversified components, many of which now tout technological superiority over peers.
The proof AMD is a good buy right now might simply be in the immediate-term numbers. While Intel is projecting a sizable decline in revenue in 2022, AMD anticipates robust 60% year-over-year growth. Granted, a significant amount of this is attributable to the Xilinx takeover, but not all of it. AMD's progress stands on its own two feet. Before Xilinx was in the fold, AMD was projecting 31% growth this year.
As of the end of June, AMD had $6 billion in cash and short-term investments, offset by debt of $2.8 billion. And in spite of its enduring growth, shares have been clobbered by over 50% this year. The stock now trades for 32 times enterprise value to trailing 12-month free cash flow. For a company that is benefiting from both growing revenue and rising profit margins, and with years of industry expansion laying ahead of it, this looks like a reasonable valuation.
This assumes, of course, you're not bothered by near-term stock market uncertainty, and are looking for a chip stock to buy and stash away for at least a few years. If that's the case, I think AMD is worthy of a ""top stock to buy now"" title.

2022-09-26 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-Italy and Intel pick Veneto as preferred region for new chip plant - sources,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-italy-and-intel-pick-veneto-as-preferred-region-for-new-chip-plant-sources-0,,,"By Giulio Piovaccari and Giuseppe Fonte
ROME, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Mario Draghi's outgoing government and Intel INTC.O have picked the town of Vigasio in the northeastern Veneto region as their preferred site for a new multibillion-euro chip factory in Italy, two people familiar with the matter said.
Intel's investment in Italy is part of a wider plan announced by the U.S. chipmaker last March to invest as much as 80 billion euros ($77.5 billion) over the next decade in building capacity across Europe.
With an initial investment worth some 4.5 billion euros expected to rise over time, Intel has said the Italian plant would create 1,500 jobs plus an additional 3,500 jobs across suppliers and partners, with operations to start between 2025 and 2027.
The Italian factory would be an advanced semiconductor packaging and assembly plant, using new technologies to weave together full chips out of tiles.
Asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, the sources said that the parties had detailed a comprehensive agreement in early September, but no public announcement would be made before the outcome of Sunday's general election.
A spokesperson for Intel did not comment as negotiations are ongoing and confidential. Draghi's office also declined to comment.
Located near Verona, on the strategic Brenner motorway and railway, Vigasio is the preferred option from a shortlist of two sites which also includes one in the northwestern Piedmont region.
Among other reasons, the site is well connected with Germany and in particular with the city of Magdeburg, where Intel will build two factories, one of the sources added.
Intel and the government had also initially considered sites in the Lombardy, Apulia and Sicily regions.
Draghi's close aides aim to enter into behind-the-scenes negotiations with their likely successors to avoid any risk the deal might be challenged by Italy's new government, the people said, adding the choice for the site is highly sensitive politically.
Opinion polls have all predicted that Giorgia Meloni's nationalist Brothers of Italy group will emerge as the leading party on Sunday and share power with its allies the League, headed by Matteo Salvini, and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia.
The sources declined to provide further details, but Reuters has previously reported that Rome is ready to fund as much as 40% of Intel's total investment in Italy.
The state contribution to Intel's investment programme is something that must necessarily be shared with the next government before any deal is eventually formalised, one of the sources said, adding Draghi could let the next government make the announcement.
To boost domestic chipmaking, Rome is also in talks with French-Italian STMicroelectronics STM.PA, Taiwan chipmakers MEMC Electronic Materials Inc and TSMC 2330.TW, and Israeli Tower Semiconductor TSEM.TA, which Intel bought earlier this year.

2022-09-25 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia's New Lovelace Chip Is Bad News for Jay Powell,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidias-new-lovelace-chip-is-bad-news-for-jay-powell,,,"Last week, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) unveiled its new RTX graphics chips based on its ""Lovelace"" architecture. The chips have some impressive performance metrics, making an exciting leap forward in performance over the prior Ampere generation.
The downside for gamers? The highest-end RTX Lovelace 4090 graphics cards will retail for $1,599, and the 4080 cards will go for a lower range, between $899 and $1,199. That's far more expensive than the prior Ampere 3080 generation released two years ago, initially priced at $699.
CEO Jensen Huang fielded questions from concerned consumers at the conference, defending the new price, given Lovelace's high-performance specs. But Huang also pointed to a more troubling reason for the high price -- and it could have adverse consequences for the broader technology sector, the economy, and the stock market.
""Moore's Law is Dead""
In response to critics, Huang declared, ""Moore's Law is dead...A 12-inch wafer is a lot more expensive today.""
For those who don't know, Moore's Law is named after former Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) co-founder Gordon Moore, who posited that the number of transistors chipmakers can fit onto a silicon wafer doubles every 12 to 18 months. The result is that chips either become twice as powerful for the same price or equally as powerful for half the cost every one to two years.
But these days, the cost to produce more powerful chips is going up. While the short term has seen lots of inflation due to rising material and freight costs, as it has for many other goods throughout the economy, this is, theoretically, a temporary and fixable phenomenon.
But the semiconductor sector is experiencing another factor that makes this cost inflation perhaps more permanent.
It comes down to physics. Chipmakers have miraculously been able to pack transistors just four nanometers apart in this year's most advanced chips, including the Lovelace GPUs. In the years ahead, they could be three, two, or maybe even one nanometer apart.
However, as transistor densities have increased and the space between transistors gets smaller and smaller, it has become more and more challenging to pack all those transistors in cost-effectively. Chip manufacturing is complicated, and the more densely packed a chip is, the tougher it is to produce without imperfections.
That's why Intel has had a difficult time in the last few years, even losing its process lead, starting with its 10nm chip a few years ago. That is driving up the capital intensity of chipmaking while also lengthening the time a wafer must go through all process steps.
Basically, as transistor distances run up against the laws of physics and the capabilities of today's semiconductor production tools, the process is getting harder. And a harder process is a more expensive process.

Implications for semiconductors and the economy
Obviously, we are living in a period of disconcerting inflation after many years of low and stable inflation. Besides globalization, a key factor that has helped put a lid on inflation is the effect of technology. As technology progresses, it becomes a deflationary force, enabling businesses and customers to be more efficient.
But that disinflationary force is largely predicated on Moore's Law, in which computing power becomes cheaper every year. Thus, if Moore's Law is truly ""dead,"" that could take away a key helper in limiting inflation.
Recently, markets have been in turmoil as inflation coming out of the pandemic has skyrocketed. Its persistence is now forcing central banks to tighten their policies very quickly, sending stocks plummeting. And with developed economies now bringing some manufacturing back to their own countries from lower-cost countries due to geopolitical concerns -- especially in the chip sector -- that's another deflationary force that's going away.
If Moore's Law just so happens to be slowing down at the same time, the helpful effects of technology-enabled efficiency could be going away, too. That could mean more inflation, higher interest rates, and lower valuations for stocks and bonds.
The good news -- maybe Moore's Law isn't ""dead"" but aging
While Moore's Law may be ""dead"" in that it suggests a doubling of power performance every year, Nvidia's Lovelace chips offer superior price performance to the prior Ampere generation. Recent specs place Lovelace's processing capability per unit of power between two and four times that of the prior generation.
So, with the 4080 chips priced between 28% and 72% more than Ampere and the 4090 priced 130% more than Ampere, customers are still getting more value per dollar spent on these chips -- the relative improvements just aren't doubling with each generation. But it's still an improvement on a per-dollar basis.
In addition to packing more transistors onto each wafer, chipmakers are also developing new techniques -- like using new materials, such as the more conductive cobalt over traditional copper wire -- to improve performance. Another way is through advanced packaging techniques that shorten the distance between chips or parts of a chip, which can also help boost power performance beyond the transistor count. In fact, current Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger believes that new ""chiplet"" architectures closely packaged can continue extending Moore's law, apparently in disagreement with Huang.
So the disinflationary forces of technology are still here. However, investors should realize this helpful disinflation may occur more slowly now. Your PC, mobile device, or, in Nvidia's case, graphics card should still become more powerful each year -- but maybe you shouldn't expect a huge leap every two years or to pay the same price for twice the power.

2022-09-25 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-Italy and Intel pick Veneto as preferred region for new chip plant - sources,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-italy-and-intel-pick-veneto-as-preferred-region-for-new-chip-plant-sources,,,"By Giulio Piovaccari and Giuseppe Fonte
ROME, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Mario Draghi's outgoing government and Intel INTC.O have picked the town of Vigasio in the northeastern Veneto region as their preferred site for a new multibillion-euro chip factory in Italy, two people familiar with the matter said.
Intel's investment in Italy is part of a wider plan announced by the U.S. chipmaker last March to invest as much as 80 billion euros ($77.5 billion) over the next decade in building capacity across Europe.
With an initial investment worth some 4.5 billion euros expected to rise over time, Intel has said the Italian plant would create 1,500 jobs plus an additional 3,500 jobs across suppliers and partners, with operations to start between 2025 and 2027.
The Italian factory would be an advanced semiconductor packaging and assembly plant, using new technologies to weave together full chips out of tiles.
Asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, the sources said that the parties had detailed a comprehensive agreement in early September, but no public announcement would be made before the outcome of Sunday's general election.
A spokesperson for Intel did not comment as negotiations are ongoing and confidential. Draghi's office also declined to comment.
Located near Verona, on the strategic Brenner motorway and railway, Vigasio is the preferred option from a shortlist of two sites which also includes one in the northwestern Piedmont region.
Among other reasons, the site is well connected with Germany and in particular with the city of Magdeburg, where Intel will build two factories, one of the sources added.
Intel and the government had also initially considered sites in the Lombardy, Apulia and Sicily regions.
Draghi's close aides aim to enter into behind-the-scenes negotiations with their likely successors to avoid any risk the deal might be challenged by Italy's new government, the people said, adding the choice for the site is highly sensitive politically.
Opinion polls have all predicted that Giorgia Meloni's nationalist Brothers of Italy group will emerge as the leading party on Sunday and share power with its allies the League, headed by Matteo Salvini, and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia.
The sources declined to provide further details, but Reuters has previously reported that Rome is ready to fund as much as 40% of Intel's total investment in Italy.
The state contribution to Intel's investment programme is something that must necessarily be shared with the next government before any deal is eventually formalised, one of the sources said, adding Draghi could let the next government make the announcement.
To boost domestic chipmaking, Rome is also in talks with French-Italian STMicroelectronics STM.PA, Taiwan chipmakers MEMC Electronic Materials Inc and TSMC 2330.TW, and Israeli Tower Semiconductor TSEM.TA, which Intel bought earlier this year.

2022-09-25 00:00:00+00:00,"3 Ideal High-Yield Dividend Stocks for Retirees That Can Turn $350,000 Into $1 Million by 2030",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-ideal-high-yield-dividend-stocks-for-retirees-that-can-turn-%24350000-into-%241-million-by,,,"This year has served as an unpleasant reminder that the stock market doesn't move up in a straight line. Since the year began, the benchmark S&P 500 and growth-centric Nasdaq Composite have each fallen into a bear market with peak declines of more than 20%. To boot, the U.S. economy has delivered back-to-back quarters of gross domestic product declines on the heels of historically high inflation.
In other words, it's a worrisome time for investors -- and especially retirees who can't afford to lose their principal investment.

But when trouble looms on Wall Street, historically, so does opportunity. That's because every major stock market correction has eventually been cleared away by a bull market rally. This means that in spite of heightened volatility in the short run, it's the perfect time for aged investors to pounce.
What follows are three ideal high-yield dividend stocks for retirees that have the potential to turn an initial investment of $350,000 into $1 million by 2030.
Walgreens Boots Alliance: 5.62% yield
The first perfect high-yield dividend stock that can generate a 186% return for aged investors by 2030 is pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA). Walgreens has been paying a consecutive dividend for more than 89 years and has increased its base annual payout for the past 47 years.
What typically makes healthcare stocks such a genius investment is their defensive nature. No matter how poorly the U.S. economy or stock market perform, there's always going to be demand for prescription drugs, medical devices, and healthcare services.
However, the COVID-19 pandemic proved to be one of the few exceptions to this rule, at least for Walgreens Boots Alliance. Because Walgreens is reliant on foot traffic into its stores, the lockdowns associated with the pandemic hurt its sales and bottom line. Like other retailers, it's also contending with historically high inflation and the negative effect that can have on consumer spending.
And yet, there are numerous reasons to be excited about Walgreens' prospects as it enacts a multipoint turnaround strategy designed to boost its operating margins, organic growth rate, and customer loyalty.
To begin with, management noted at the end of fiscal year 2021 (the company's fiscal year ends on Aug. 31) that it had surpassed $2 billion in annual cost savings a full year ahead of schedule. But it's not the company's cost-cutting that's going to raise eyebrows. It's where management is aggressively pulling levers.
One area where Walgreens Boots Alliance is sparing no expense is with its various digitization initiatives. Even though the company will continue generating most of its revenue from its brick-and-mortar stores, the pandemic has demonstrated the value of having a more prominent online presence. Walgreens has invested heavily in its direct-to-consumer platform, which should lead to healthy organic sales growth.
What's more, Walgreens Boots Alliance has partnered with (and become a majority investor in) VillageMD. The duo has opened 120 co-located, full-service health clinics, as of May 31, 2022, with a goal of opening 1,000 clinics in over 30 U.S. markets by the end of 2027. Offering physician-staffed clinics differentiates Walgreens' clinics from its competition and should drive repeat business.
Valued at roughly seven times Wall Street's forecast earnings for 2023, Walgreens has a safe floor to go along with its promising upside and rock-solid 5.6% yield.
Innovative Industrial Properties: 7.04% yield
A second ideal high-yield income stock that has the capacity to turn a $350,000 investment into a cool $1 million over the next eight years is cannabis-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE: IIPR). Over the past five years, IIP, as Innovative Industrial Properties is more commonly known, has grown its quarterly payout by 1,100%.
Just 20 months ago, marijuana stocks were all the rage on Wall Street. With Democrats taking narrow control of Congress and Joe Biden winning the presidency, the expectation was for sweeping federal cannabis reforms. Unfortunately, no reforms have taken shape and pot stocks have been pummeled as a result.
However, individual states maintain the right to legalize and regulate marijuana. Around three-quarters of all states have given the green light to medical cannabis, which provides more than enough opportunity for a company like IIP to profit.
Innovative Industrial Properties' business model is just like any other REIT... except for the cannabis focus. As of early September, IIP had purchased 111 medical marijuana cultivation and processing facilities spanning 8.7 million square feet of rentable space in 19 states. Although acquisitions are IIP's primary source of growth, it does have a modest organic growth component built in that allows for inflationary rental increases to be passed along to its tenants each year.
What makes REITs so valuable for retirees is the predictability of their operating cash flow and their dividends. As of the end of June, 99% of IIP's rents were being collected on time. Meanwhile, REITs are required to pay out a majority of their earnings as a dividend, which is what allows them to avoid normal corporate income-tax rates.
Another big catalyst for IIP is the lack of cannabis reforms at the federal level. Innovative Industrial Properties has benefited immensely from its sale-leaseback program, which involves purchasing facilities from multi-state operators for cash and immediately leasing them back to the seller. Because access to basic financial services is limited for cannabis companies, IIP has turned this lack of reform on Capitol Hill into a positive catalyst that bolsters its long-term rental portfolio.

Intel: 4.96% yield
The third ideal high-yield dividend stock for retirees that can turn $350,000 into $1 million by 2030 is semiconductor behemoth Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Intel's roughly 5% yield is the juiciest payout its shareholders have ever received.
Like most cyclical stocks, Intel is taking it on the chin at the moment. A combination of economic weakness, high inflation, and employees returning to the office has slowed personal computer (PC) sales and data center spending -- at least temporarily. To boot, Advanced Micro Devices has been chipping away at Intel's mobile and server central processing unit (CPU) market share.
While this would appear to be a less-than-ideal scenario for Intel, a deeper dive points to an inexpensive cash-flow juggernaut that has multiple catalysts on the horizon.
First, concerns about Intel's loss of market share look to be an overreaction. According to second-quarter market share data from Mercury Research, Intel maintains desktop PC, mobile, and server market share in the neighborhood of 75% to 86%. Even if AMD were to continue slowly chipping away at Intel's PCU market share, the sheer growth potential of mobile devices and data-center servers should allow Intel to steadily grow its sales and generate abundant cash flow.
Intel is also a prime beneficiary of the CHIPS and Science Act, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden last month. The CHIPS Act will provide $52.7 billion in subsidies to chip designers and manufacturers, with the goal of boosting chip production, innovation, and hiring within the United States. Intel, which is spending $20 billion to build two manufacturing plants in Ohio, could eventually up its presence to eight total factories with federal aid.
Sometime soon, we should also witness the spinoff and initial public offering (IPO) of autonomous vehicle company Mobileye, which Intel acquired in 2017 for $15.3 billion. Mobileye delivered 41% year-over-year sales growth in the most recent quarter, with annual run-rate revenue of $1.84 billion. The expectation is for Mobileye to command a valuation of $30 billion for its IPO. In short, Intel looks to have made a wise acquisition.
Despite short-term headwinds, Intel has the catalysts needed to nearly triple the initial investment of retirees by the end of the decade.

2022-09-24 00:00:00+00:00,This Stock Is Your Ticket to an $80 Trillion Market Opportunity,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-stock-is-your-ticket-to-an-%2480-trillion-market-opportunity,,,"While there's currently a lot of uncertainty about the near-term direction of the global economy, the long-term outlook is crystal clear. The economy is on track to keep expanding in the decades ahead, driven by population growth and the continued rise of the middle class. That means it will need a lot more infrastructure to support its growth.
According to an estimate by Swiss Re, governments worldwide will need to invest a staggering $80 trillion through 2040 on infrastructure to support continued economic growth. They can't fund that burden alone, which will likely lead them to continue seeking out private investments. That plays right into the strategy of Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP), a leading global infrastructure investor.
Filling in the funding gap
Governments and utilities have historically made the most investment in infrastructure. However, governments around the world are facing significant deficits and burgeoning debt, limiting their ability to invest in infrastructure. That's leading them to turn to private investors to help them fund global infrastructure investment.
Brookfield has several ways to capitalize on this opportunity, including:
Acquire operating infrastructure businesses from governments. These transactions provide governments with capital to invest in new infrastructure.
Bid on concessions to build and operate infrastructure. These deals allow governments to transfer capital requirements to third-party investors.
Participate in government-supported infrastructure investments. These investments enable governments to incentivize investors to build infrastructure supported by tax credits and other incentives.
The company has the financial flexibility to capitalize on opportunities as they emerge. Its parent company, Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE: BAM), has a long history of raising capital from institutional investors for infrastructure investments.
Its latest infrastructure investment fund raised about $25 billion from investors. Brookfield Infrastructure often co-invests with these funds, enabling it to capitalize on larger-scale opportunities.
Meanwhile, the company has plenty of internal financial flexibility, thanks to a top-tier balance sheet, retained earnings, and an active capital recycling program of selling mature assets to invest in higher-return opportunities.
An extensive track record of working with governments
Brookfield has a long history of partnering with governments in building critical infrastructure. For example, Brookfield has won contracts to build electricity transmission lines in Brazil to support that country's energy needs, including developing additional renewable energy-generating capacity. The company will often sell the finished projects to other investors and reinvest the proceeds into new developments.
The company will also acquire concessions to operate key infrastructure from governments and other investors. Brookfield has invested in several toll-road concessions in India, Chile, and Brazil. These investments have included spending money to expand several toll roads to support more traffic. It has also recycled the capital from some of these investments to fund additional infrastructure investments.
Brookfield will also take advantage of investment opportunities in projects supported by tax credits. It recently agreed to partner with chip-giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) to build two manufacturing facilities in Arizona. Brookfield is investing up to $15 billion for a 49% stake in the Intel plants.
That move will free up some of Intel's financial flexibility so it can maintain and grow its dividend while making additional manufacturing capacity expansions. The investment came shortly after the U.S. government passed the Chips Act, providing $52 billion of incentives for the semiconductor industry. Congress is also considering passing additional legislation to create tax credits for semiconductor investors in the U.S.
A great infrastructure stock to buy for the long haul
That combination of opportunity and financial flexibility leads Brookfield to believe it can organically grow its funds from operations by 6% to 11% per share each year. Meanwhile, acquisitions could drive even faster growth. That should support 5% to 9% annual growth for its nearly 3%-yielding dividend.
Those factors position the company to potentially produce double-digit total annual returns for years to come. That makes it a lower-risk way to capitalize on the $80 trillion global infrastructure investment opportunity.

2022-09-23 00:00:00+00:00,This 5% Yield Dog Is About To Have Its Day,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-5-yield-dog-is-about-to-have-its-day,,,"It's been a brutal year for tech stocks, and one of the hardest hit names in the sector has been Intel Corporation (INTC). And unfortunately, things seem to be getting worse lately - not better.
Case in point: Intel stock is down more than 40% year-to-date, with a decline of almost 20% coming in the last month or so after very disappointing Q2 results at the end of July.
By comparison, the Nasdaq composite is down ""only"" 26% on the year and 11% in the last 30 days.
With returns like this, there are really only two ways to view the chipmaker as it trades at the lowest levels since 2015... Either Intel is crazy cheap after these declines, or investors who are bargain hunting in INTC are just plain crazy.
If you're interested in the case for Intel, as aggressive as it may be, one strategy in particular is worth reviewing: The so-called ""Dogs of the Dow"" approach, where the highest yielding stocks in the storied Dow Jones Industrial Average are the ones with the biggest upside in the year ahead.
And with a yield of 5.0% at present after its fall from grace, Intel may be a dog that is about to have its day.
Every Dog Has Its Day
It's hard to even imagine what the market environment was like at the end of 2021, back before the Russian invasion of Ukraine and volatility sparked by rampant inflation and rising interest rates. But let's take a trip down memory lane for a minute and review where we were in Q4 of last year.
Big picture, the S&P 500 index had just tallied a tremendous gain of more than 28% to end 2021, and the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yielded roughly 1.5% as of Dec. 31.

But not all companies in this index logged a great year. Within the Dow, some of the worst-performing stocks were IBM (IBM), Amgen (AMGN) and Merck (MRK). The latter two actually finished 2021 in the red, and if not for a late charge in December, IBM would have been in the same boat.
In the risk-off environment of 2022, however, the story has been quite different. Because this year, all three of those laggards have outperformed the market significantly.

What's more they offer generous dividends on top of that as I write:
IBM - 5.2%
Amgen - 3.4%
Merck - 3.2%
This may seem like cherry picking. And I'll admit, there are often exceptions to this phenomenon of last year's losers going on a tear. But the strategy of investing in last year's lagging but high-dividend Dow components has been around for many years now - with the term ""dogs of the Dow"" popularized way back in 1991 by Michael B. O'Higgins in his book, ""Beating the Dow.""
Knowing that, let me make the case for why poor performer Intel may be a dog that's about to have its day in 2023.
The Case for Intel
Let's admit a few things up front: Supply chains continue to be a mess for Intel, its branded chips are seeing lagging demand as competitors sharpen their knives and the stock's fundamentals are ugly with its recent earnings miss and lowered guidance this summer.
But here's the thing: Even with gutted forecasts that now predict a mere $2.30 in earnings per share this year instead of $3.60, the dividend of $1.46 annually is not just safe but a near sure thing. And at a current yield of 5.0%, with a long history of dividend growth, this income stream is pretty darn attractive right now.

Furthermore, Intel's CEO told Wall Street things are turning around, saying ""We do think we're on the bottom."" The exec also didn't mince words and owned up to internal ""execution"" instead of just blaming the economic environment. That's clearly a wake-up call to staff, and a sign that excuses aren't acceptable.
Finally, a lot of the negativity around Intel is misplaced as investors have been sweating the decline in free cash flow without looking at where that money is going. INTC has teamed up with Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP) to construct $30 billion in new chip fabrication facilities here in the U.S., and is committing $100 billion globally on new facilities. In an era of chronic supply shortages as well as a focus on ""strategic autonomy"" with bringing chips onshore to reduce reliance on America's trade partners like China, these investments will almost certainly pay off.
There are many reasons a ""dogs of the Dow"" approach works, and each stock's story is unique. But generally speaking, the strategy encourages investors to stake out a position in a high-yield stock that is well established but has just fallen on hard times to lag the market lately - because if you're patient, these stocks almost always turn around.
That sounds just like what's happening at Intel. So investors willing to look past current challenges and bank on the future could be richly rewarded with both outperformance in shares as well as a 5% dividend yield that will grow alongside earnings.
Bank on Dividend Megatrends in 2023 ... and Beyond!
It's crucial to do individual analysis of stocks to ensure you have the right investments in your portfolio. But it's also important to identify big picture trends that provide significant tailwinds to increase the likelihood of your success.
The ""dogs of the Dow"" approach is one such strategy that makes Intel worth considering. Another is the movement towards onshore manufacturing, which my colleague Brett Owens recently wrote about in even greater detail.
But the biggest payoff of all will come from a much more foundational strategy in 2023 and beyond...
... a reliance on the dividend megatrend that is reshaping Wall Street!
With runaway inflation and rising rates, we've seen the ""risk off"" trade come into full force. That means the big small-cap and tech stock winners of yesteryear are just a memory, and rock solid stocks with bulletproof balance sheets are the only way to go.
At Contrarian Outlook, we're experts in identifying the opportunities in this kind of environment. While day-trading millennials were betting their whole paycheck on bitcoin or GameStop, we were looking for reliable long-term investments that deliver 7%+ yield and 15%+ upside in shares like clockwork.
