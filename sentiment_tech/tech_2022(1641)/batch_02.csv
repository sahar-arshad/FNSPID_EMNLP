2022-12-22 00:00:00+00:00,INTC February 2023 Options Begin Trading,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intc-february-2023-options-begin-trading,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the February 2023 expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new February 2023 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $24.00 strike price has a current bid of 73 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $24.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $23.27 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $25.68/share today.
Because the $24.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.04% return on the cash commitment, or 25.82% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $24.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $26.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.27. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $25.68/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $26.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.19% if the stock gets called away at the February 2023 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $26.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $26.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.95% boost of extra return to the investor, or 41.98% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $25.68) to be 38%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

By Ankika Biswas and Johann M Cherian
Dec 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes dropped on Thursday after fresh data underscored strength in the U.S. economy and aggravated concerns over the Federal Reserve's continued policy tightening.
Losses in rate-sensitive megacap growth stocks such as Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O pulled technology .SPLRCT and consumer discretionary shares .SPLRCD lower.
The final estimate of third-quarter U.S. GDP revealed gross domestic product increased at a 3.2% annualized rate, above the previous estimate of 2.9%.
Meanwhile, a Labor Department report showed the number of Americans filing for state unemployment benefits increased to 216,000 last week, much below economists' estimate of 222,000, indicating a still tight labor market.
""The GDP data beat a lot of expectations. There are concerns that the economy is not giving up too easily and it's putting up a fight that will likely require the Fed to remain hawkish and keep interest rates higher for longer,"" Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York, said.
Wall Street's main indexes marked their biggest daily gain so far in December on Wednesday, with help from upbeat Nike IncNKE.N and FedEx CorpFDX.N quarterly earnings, as well as improving consumer confidence and easing inflation expectations.
Fears of a recession following the U.S. central bank's prolonged interest rate hikes have weighed heavily on equities this year, with the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX set for annual declines of 19.7%, its worst such performance since the 2008 financial crisis.
The Fed struck a hawkish tone last week at its policy meeting by saying that it expects interest rates to remain higher for longer, sparking a selloff across stock markets.
The bets for a 25-basis point hike to 4.5%-4.75% in February by the Fed remained largely unchanged at around 70% following the data on Thursday, although expectations for the terminal rate inched up to 4.89% by May 2023. FEDWATCH
At 9:50 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 331.19 points, or 0.99%, at 33,045.29, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 50.70 points, or 1.31%, at 3,827.74, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 197.23 points, or 1.84%, at 10,512.14.
Micron Technology Inc MU.O slipped 3.2% after the chipmaker forecast a bigger-than-expected second-quarter loss, sparking declines in peers.
Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O and Intel Corp INTC.O were down between 3.0% and 5.1%, pushing the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX more than 3% lower.
CarMax Inc KMX.N slid 8.6% to the bottom of the S&P 500 after the used-vehicles retailer paused share buybacks following an 86% plunge in quarterly profit.
AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc AMC.N slumped 12.5% after the world's largest cinema chain said it would raise $110 million through a preferred stock sale.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 5.83-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded no new 52-week highs and nine new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 27 new highs and 180 new lows.

2022-12-22 00:00:00+00:00,3 Ridiculously Cheap Dividend Stocks That Yield More Than 3%,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-ridiculously-cheap-dividend-stocks-that-yield-more-than-3,,,"Buying dividend stocks that are trading at low earnings multiples can set investors up to earn recurring income while also potentially benefiting from capital gains in the future. While undervalued stocks can sometimes be value traps, that isn't the case with these quality investments.
Novartis (NYSE: NVS), Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (NYSE: CM), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are solid stocks with great yields to consider buying right now.
1. Novartis
Swiss drugmaker Novartis is a top healthcare company that has generated close to $7 billion in sales this year just from two products alone -- Cosentyx and Entresto. And with $24.3 billion in revenue during the first nine months of the year, the company isn't overly dependent on those products. Good diversification is part of the reason the stock makes for a solid dividend investment.
Currently, Novartis pays a yield of 3.7%, which is two full points higher than the S&P 500 average of 1.7%. What's encouraging is that even with such a high yield, the healthcare stock's payout ratio remains modest at just 34% of earnings. This means that Novartis has room to increase its dividend in the future, something that it has been doing for 25 years in a row.
Novartis is also an attractive investment to buy and hold because the company is forecasting some modest and consistent growth. Through 2026, it's projecting that its sales will rise by 4% annually as it counts on 20-plus products that have the potential to be blockbusters (generating peak revenue of at least $1 billion).
Trading at just 9 times earnings, the stock is an incredibly cheap buy given the attractive growth and dividend income it offers investors; the average S&P 500 stock trades at a multiple of 19. Novartis is also the only stock on this list that has generated positive gains this year as its shares are up around 3%.
2. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
Dividend-hungry investors can collect an even better yield from the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), whose stock pays 6.2% annually. That's a remarkably high payout for a bank stock. And considering that CIBC is a top chartered bank in Canada, there isn't a whole lot of risk here.
At around 50%, the bank's payout ratio isn't high, and it has been increasing its dividend payments since 2011. But its overall streak of paying dividends goes back more than 150 years to 1868 when it made its first dividend payment. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 8 is incredibly low and offers investors terrific value.
While bank stocks could be risky buys heading into a possible recession next year, CIBC's low multiple gives investors a good margin of safety, potentially limiting the downside risk for the stock in the near term. And in the long haul, CIBC is an excellent stock to invest in as the business is highly profitable, generating a strong profit margin of 28% over the trailing 12 months.
3. Intel
Tech stock and chipmaker Intel is another high-yielding investment that can make for a solid buy right now. Investors are wary of the company's efforts to build out its foundry business as that will come with added costs and could put pressure on the dividend. Earlier this year, the company announced it would be committing $36 billion to produce chips in Europe and that its investment will increase to more than double that over the course of a decade.
Given the strong need for capital, Intel is arguably the riskiest dividend stock on this list. But its payout ratio of 45% remains modest. Concerned investors, however, will point to the company's negative free cash flow of $13.3 billion over the past 12 months as a problem.
But during that time, the company's changes in working capital (e.g., changes in receivables and inventory) resulted in an outflow of more than $10 billion. Those are items that can and will fluctuate over the course of business, and that means those outflows could eventually turn into inflows.
Plus, with $22.6 billion in cash and short-term investments on its books (as of the end of September), the company has strong financial resources to help fund its growth and to help buy time for the cash flow situation to improve. Intel's dividend costs the company approximately $1.5 billion each quarter.
Strong demand in the chip market and Intel reporting solid operating profits of around 12% should give investors confidence in the business in the long run. Management also increased the dividend by 5% earlier this year -- a move that likely wouldn't have happened if the company had been concerned about the safety of its payouts.
Intel is a bit of a contrarian investment, but with a yield of 5.4% and a P/E of only eight, it could be an underrated dividend stock to buy right now.

Dec 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were set to open lower on Thursday as fresh data underscored strength in the U.S. economy and aggravated concerns over the Federal Reserve's continued policy tightening.
The final estimate of third-quarter U.S. GDP revealed that gross domestic product increased at a 3.2% annualized rate, above the previous estimate of 2.9%.
Meanwhile, a Labor Department report showed the number of Americans filing for state unemployment benefits increased to 216,000 last week, much below economists' estimate of 222,000, indicating a still tight labor market.
""Third-quarter GDP estimate has been revised up much more than it was expected and is giving the futures a reason to decline ... if the economy is too strong, the Fed may have to raise rates by more than what was expected,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth, Connecticut.
""You combine that with the weekly initial unemployment claims, it just fuels the talk of the Fed having to be more restrictive in their policy.""
Wall Street's main indexes marked their biggest daily gain so far in December on Wednesday, with help from upbeat Nike Inc NKE.N and FedEx Corp FDX.N quarterly earnings, as well as improving consumer confidence and easing inflation expectations.
Fears of a recession following the U.S. central bank's prolonged interest rate hikes have weighed heavily on equities this year, with the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX set for annual declines of 18.6%, its worst such performance since the financial crisis of 2008.
The Fed struck a hawkish tone last week at its policy meeting by saying that it expects interest rates to remain higher for longer, sparking a selloff across stock markets.
The bets for a 25-basis point hike to 4.5%-4.75% in February by the Fed remained unchanged at 71.4% following the data on Thursday, although expectations for the terminal rate inched up marginally to 4.88% by May 2023. FEDWATCH

Micron Technology Inc MU.O slipped 4.3% in premarket trading after the chipmaker forecast a bigger-than-expected second-quarter loss, sparking declines in peers.
Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O and Intel Corp INTC.O were down between 0.7% and 1.8%.

2022-12-21 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Corporation (INTC) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-corporation-intc-is-a-trending-stock%3A-facts-to-know-before-betting-on-it-3,,,"Intel (INTC) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -11.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.5% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Intel belongs, has lost 1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.20 per share, indicating a change of -81.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $1.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -64.4%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.90 indicates a change of -2.9% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.6%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intel is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Intel, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.5 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -25.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $63.51 billion and $61.66 billion estimates indicate -18.6% and -2.9% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $15.34 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.1%. EPS of $0.59 for the same period compares with $1.71 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.49 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.99%. The EPS surprise was +73.53%.
Over the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-12-20 00:00:00+00:00,Could Intel's Pain Become This Dividend Stock's Gain?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/could-intels-pain-become-this-dividend-stocks-gain,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is enduring a painful year. Because of worsening economic conditions, the semiconductor manufacturer's revenue tumbled 20% in the third quarter, while its earnings plummeted even further. That's putting pressure on its financial profile as the company strives to fund its ambitious expansion program while maintaining its high-yielding dividend.
This painful situation led Intel to seek outside-the-box ways to finance its growth to maintain its balance sheet strength and investor payout. It did that by unveiling a first-of-its-kind semiconductor co-investment program, with Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) signing on as the first participant. Intel's pain looks to be Brookfield's gain.
Getting creative to ease its financial pain
Intel has an ambitious expansion plan to grow its chip-making capacity in the U.S. It's investing upwards of $30 billion to build two leading-edge chip factories in Arizona. It also plans to spend more than $20 billion to build two more factories in Ohio. On top of that, Intel is investing heavily in several other capital projects worldwide.
While the company generates lots of cash and has a cash-rich balance sheet, deteriorating market conditions are making it harder for the company to fund its expansion and dividend while maintaining a strong financial profile. The company sees its full-year net capital spending coming in at $21 billion on a non-GAAP basis and projects that its adjusted free cash flow will be negative-$2 billion to $4 billion. That's causing the company to burn through cash as it also funds its dividend, which has totaled nearly $4.5 billion over the first nine months of the year. As a result, its cash, equivalents, and short-term investments have fallen from $29.3 billion toward the end of last year to $22.6 billion in early October. Meanwhile, debt has risen from $33.5 billion to $37.2 billion.
This situation led Intel to strike a funding partnership with Brookfield for its two plants in Arizona. They will jointly invest up to $30 billion, with Intel funding 51% and Brookfield financing 49% of the cost. That arrangement will enable Intel to protect its cash and debt capacity for other investments while allowing the company to continue growing its dividend.
A perfect fit for Brookfield
Intel's need for a funding partner came at the perfect time for Brookfield Infrastructure. The company has nearly completed its current backlog of capital projects, which includes the Heartland Petrochemical Complex in Canada and the second phase of its electricity transmission line build-out in Brazil. It was able to replenish its capital project backlog with this deal. The company's total equity commitment will only be about $500 million, with the rest sourced from its institutional partners and non-resource debt that the company has already secured. Brookfield can finance the equity portion with retained cash flows and the proceeds from its capital recycling program. It will fund most of that equity closer to the project's commissioning in 2024.
The investment also aligns with Brookfield's thematic approach to capitalize on the digitalization and deglobalization megatrends. The funding partnership will help Intel onshore some of its manufacturing capacity. It will also support increased digitalization by supplying the country with more semiconductors.
Finally, the investment should produce attractive returns for Brookfield. It's partnering with a highly creditworthy counterparty in Intel, and it isn't assuming any technological risk. It will receive 49% of the revenue generated from these facilities, which should be relatively stable because of growing semiconductor demand. According to an estimate by IDC, global chip revenues should reach $1 trillion by 2030, up from its projection of $638 billion for this year. That aligns with its strategy of investing in assets that produce predictable cash flow.
This investment puts Brookfield in an even stronger position to deliver organic growth at or above its 6% to 9% target range over the next few years. The company should have no problem delivering on its objective of expanding its 4.4%-yielding dividend at a 5% to 9% annual rate.
An ideal investment for Brookfield
Intel's financial troubles couldn't have come at a better time for Brookfield Infrastructure. It was able to capitalize on Intel's need for a funding partner to replenish its capital project backlog. The investment aligns with the company's thematic approach while positioning it to earn attractive returns. That further bolsters the company's growth profile, which should enable it to continue increasing its attractive dividend.

2022-12-20 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Has a $39 Billion Graphics Opportunity,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-has-a-%2439-billion-graphics-opportunity,,,"The graphics card market had been a two-horse race for many years. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been at it since the company was founded in 1993, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) entered the market with the acquisition of ATI in 2006. It's been Nvidia and AMD battling each other since then, with Nvidia generally coming out on top in terms of market share.
This year brought a third player into the mix: CPU giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Intel is not new to the graphics business -- many of the company's PC CPUs include integrated graphics chips, and the company briefly sold stand-alone graphics cards in the late 1990s. But as video games have exploded in graphical complexity, and as graphics cards have found applications outside of gaming, Intel has largely been stuck on the sidelines.
A strong but messy start
Intel is on the sidelines no more, although there was some sloppy execution along the way. Intel's first graphics card, the Arc A380, targeted the low end of the market and initially launched in China. Gaming performance wasn't particularly good or consistent, and issues with software drivers only made things worse.
It turns out that Intel had attempted to take a shortcut on the software side, using its integrated graphics software as a foundation. That software couldn't provide adequate performance, leaving Intel playing catch-up as it readied the launch of its mid-range Arc A750 and Arc A770 graphics cards. Rumors emerged that Intel was scrapping the whole effort as it struggled to bring competent products to market.
Intel did eventually launch those graphics cards, and they received generally positive reviews. Tom's Hardware called the Arc A770, priced at $329, a ""potent mainstream competitor,"" praising its performance for the price. Software was still a problem at launch, particularly for older games, but Intel has made strides to fix its mistakes.
Intel was forced to abandon its goal of shipping 4 million graphics card units this year as software issues pushed back launch dates, but the company is in a good position to be a major player in the mainstream graphics card market in 2023 and beyond.
A massive opportunity
Jon Peddie Research expects the market for discrete graphics cards to grow to $39 billion by 2026, up from just under $32 billion over the past 12 months. The market is in flux right now -- demand for PCs has plunged, and excess inventories of last-gen graphics cards have triggered board partners to cut way back on orders. Unit shipments were down nearly 32% year over year in the third quarter as a result.
Even in a tough market, Intel has priced its cards aggressively enough to make a splash. The company only competes in the mid-range -- the A750 and A770 are priced at $289 and $329, respectively -- but that's where the most popular graphics cards live. According to Steam's hardware and software survey, the top seven most-used graphics cards on the platform are mid-range cards from Nvidia. By focusing on the mid-range, Intel is going after a high-volume portion of the market.
If AMD's experience trying to win at the high end of the market is any indication, Intel may never even make a real attempt. AMD's latest high-end graphics cards represent its best effort in years, but they still fall short of Nvidia's products, particularly when it comes to ray tracing performance. If Intel does make a run at the high end, it's probably not going to happen anytime soon.
Even if Intel sticks to mid-range and low-end graphics cards, a big chunk of the $39 billion market will be up for grabs. The company's relationships with PC OEMs certainly give it a leg up, and its software will only improve over time. Intel is on a path to becoming a solid player in the graphics card market, generating billions of dollars in revenue each year.

In 2023, stock market uncertainties will worsen, rewarding investors who seek cheap dividend stocks.
The bigger their discount to their fair value, the more margin of safety the company offers. Companies that pay dividends prioritize cash flow first. Management will allocate cash flow to shareholders, rewarding them with a high dividend yield.
Finding cheap dividend stocks is critical for another reason. By the time the Federal Reserve meets for the second time in 2023, the central bank will set a Fed Funds rate of over 5%, that 5% still trails real borrowing costs.
For example, mortgage rates and loans to small businesses will exceed 6%. In addition, the consumer price index, which measures inflation, is 7.1% year over year. Despite negative real returns, investors should expect the Federal Reserve will achieve a long-term inflation rate of 2%.
Investors have these seven ridiculously cheap dividend stocks to consider.
BNS Bank of Nova Scotia  $47.47
BTI British American Tobacco $41.08
F Ford Motor $11.74
INTC Intel $26.95
LYB LyondellBasell Industries $80.62
MED Medifast $116.83
WBA Walgreens Boots Alliance $39.55
Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)

Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS) stock fell after the company posted higher provisions for credit losses. The bank booked PCL of CA $529 million, up from CA $168 million last year.
Scotiabank regularly stress tests its portfolio. It builds multiple stress scenarios for economic factors like unemployment. Investors should not expect the bank to raise its loss estimates in the near term, but it’s still one of the best cheap dividend stocks to buy now.
The company is investing in technology and analytics to increase its efficiency. It is focused on its existing clients to sustain its business growth.
In the mortgage sector, Scotiabank noted that its average customer has higher FICO scores. This is a scoring system that lenders use to measure credit risk.
Beyond one year, investors should forecast interest rates falling. The Bank of Nova Scotia will benefit when rates fall. Its balance sheet is structured to take advantage of asset repricing.
British American Tobacco (BTI)

British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) boosted investor confidence when it announced its revenue growth for FY 2022. BTI expects revenue will grow by between 2% to 4%.
Chief Executive Officer Jack Bowles said that its transformation is accelerating. Its businesses are driving strong volume, revenue and market share growth.
By 2025, BTI will post revenue of $6.07 billion. The company is benefiting from price tiers across its portfolio of brands. It enjoys resilient volume demand globally. This includes Europe and the Middle East.
BTI stock should continue its uptrend as dividend payouts increase in the coming years. The company has a history of posting strong operating cash conversion.
In the U.S., demand trends should rebound. Previously, the post-Covid environment hurt demand. Thanks to its growing premium share and robust brand, British American will post profit growth in this country and remain one of the best cheap dividend stocks out there.
Ford Motor (F)

Ford Motor (NYSE:F) is pinning its growth aspirations on its electric vehicles. Ford has increased the price of the F-150 Lightning. The base price is now more than $15,000 above the original pricing.
Ford wants to encourage customers to consider the higher-end Lightning. It did not raise the prices of the higher trims. The company faces higher supply costs. It needs to pass the inflation-driven cost increases to customers.
Shareholders, who get paid a dividend that yields 5%, can bet that demand will not change from its target customers. As inflationary pressures recede in the coming months, the Fed will stop raising interest rates.
Perceptions of an interest rate drop will drive automobile demand higher. The abrupt drop in F stock creates a rare chance for value investors to get shares at a discount.
Ford positioned its product line-up to embrace the widespread adoption of EVs. This should lift long-term profitability and its share price.
Intel (INTC)

Investors are dumping shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) out of fear. This is misguided. The semiconductor of PC processors has an attractive product line-up.
Last year, it released Alder Lake CPUs, offering customers good prices for high performance. More recently, Intel updated the chip with Raptor Lake for even more performance gains.
Intel has a clear product line-up through 2024. Emerald Rapids will handle every workload type. In 2024, it will release Sierra Forest, a power-efficient product. On the data center side, Intel will end its market share loss.
The company has two major products on the way. In its network business, it will gain market share. In the graphics business, Intel entered the market with a discrete card. It does not need a high-end GPU. It only needs an affordable, mainstream card that customers want.
Intel is lowering its expenses. Its operating expense will fall from $22 billion to around $20 billion in 2023. As revenue stabilizes and costs fall, investors will find INTC stock attractive.
LyondellBasell Industries (LYB)
Source: Flagmania / Shutterstock.com
LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) is a specialty chemicals firm. Its acquisitions and its joint venture in China are positive catalysts for growth.
LyondellBasell will improve the competitiveness of its assets in Europe. It has the flexibility to consume energy at more attractive price levels. In addition, it will find energy sources that use less CO2. In the year-to-date period, energy costs in Europe are $1.8 billion higher compared to 2020.
The increasing risks of a recession in 2023 will require the company to increase its revenue in countries on the rebound. For example, China normally imports 40% of its needs in polyethylene. Once the country manages through the Covid pandemic, expect LyondellBasell to report better sales in China.
Medifast (MED)
Source: Hananeko_Studio / Shutterstock.com
Medifast (NYSE:MED) is a nutrition and weight loss company. The company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $1.64 a share on Dec. 8, 2022.
In the third quarter, Medifast posted revenue of $390.4 million on non-GAAP EPS of $3.32 a share. It expects revenue of up to $1.59 billion for the year. Markets took the lowered revenue and EPS guidance in stride. MED stock is trading in a $112 – $118 range.
The client retention disruption is a temporary headwind. Medifast said it surveyed those customers who left. They cited inflation and uncertainty around the economic future as reasons for leaving.
The company has many new programs in place and is implementing more. The company will optimize its compensation plan with coaches. As coaches acquire more clients, everyone will benefit.
Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)

Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is the second-largest pharmacy store chain. To do its part in minimizing the spread of the flu and Covid, it is offering testing at over 5,000 pharmacies. The offer should drive more foot traffic, helping to increase same-store sales.
Last year, Walgreens invested $5.2 billion in VillageMD to deliver primary care. It will connect the unit with CareCentrix, an in-home care business. This enhances the customer experience. It gives them control over their health, encouraging customers to utilize all of Walgreen Boots health care services.
The drug store has 200 colocated facilities. By 2025 to 2026, it will have around 600. The asset-light model will lead to higher operating margins. The Telehealth service, which includes a virtual pharmacy, will set Walgreens apart from other drugstore firms.
To increase shareholder value and strengthen its balance sheet, Walgreens Boots raised $1.0 billion. AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) bought its shares. It may use the proceeds to pay down its debt.

2022-12-19 00:00:00+00:00,"Unusual Options Activity in Apple, Home Depot and 8 Other Stocks",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/unusual-options-activity-in-apple-home-depot-and-8-other-stocks,,,"Many investors brush off unusual options activity, but others like to “follow the flow.” When large investors — like hedge funds for example — make big moves in the options world, it shows up in a very interesting way. We refer to this as “unusual options activity” and it serves as a way to see what the big investors are doing. 
Luckily there’s a leaderboard of options activity for both calls and puts and it helps us track all of the outsized volume. 
There’s actually a leaderboard for ETFs too. 
With that in mind, let’s look at the stocks that stuck out the most on the call side and the put side. 
Apple (AAPL)
Starting with the biggest of them all, we have Apple (US:AAPL). The stock recently hit a one-month low, but it still commands a market cap in excess of $2.1 trillion. 
Perhaps because it’s hitting new recent lows, someone appears to be loading up on protection. That’s as a series of put-buying hit the tape on Friday, Dec. 16th. 
That’s as more than $50 million in premium was paid for the January 2023 $170 puts, which were more than $30 in-the-money. At the same time, $15.5 million was paid for the January 2023 $230 puts. 
That said, there was an absolute flurry of heavy options activity in the January puts, so it could be part of a more complicated spread. Let’s also not forget that it was “quad-witch” expiration on Friday and a lot of this action could be a result of that. 
Gilead Sciences (GILD)
Coming in at No. 1 on the unusual options leaderboard this week, Gilead Sciences (US:GILD) made a splash as one bullish trader was lighting up the January 2023 $62.5 calls. Over a span of several purchases, they bought almost $12 million worth of the calls, which expire in just over one month from now. 
With the stock trading at $88 at the time, this was a deep-in-the-money play. At the same time, someone was busy buying even more than that, gobbling up millions of dollars worth of the $65 calls that expired on Dec. 16th. 
Merck (MRK)
Showing up as No. 2 on this week's leaderboard, Merck (US:MRK) turned a few heads as select healthcare stocks continue to perform well. 
That’s as someone paid more than $15 million for the January 2023 $90 calls. At the time, Merck stock was trading near $111 a share, putting these calls deep-in-the-money. 
The trade came on Dec. 13th, just one day before the stock hit new all-time highs. This looks like a bullish bet on the trend continuing, potentially into year-end. 
Home Depot (HD)
Home Depot (US:HD) comes in at No. 3 on this week’s leaderboard. That’s after a bullish put trade hit the tape on Dec. 15th. Shortly after noon, $4.4 million in put premium was collected by selling the February $290 puts, while shares were trading near $325. 
About 20 minutes before that, the same puts were sold, collecting more than $2.57 million in premium. In total, almost $7 million in premium was collected for this trade. 
Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)
Often overlooked for Nvidia (US:NVDA), Intel (US:INTC) and other more well-known semiconductor companies, investors seem to forget Taiwan Semiconductor (US:TSM) is worth more than $400 billion. 
Further, Warren Buffett has been a buyer of this stock.
With just two days until expiration, someone scooped up almost $5 million in the Dec. 16th $65 calls. The calls were deep-in-the-money, with shares trading above $80 at the time. 
Morgan Stanley (MS) 
Morgan Stanley (US:MS) is the only bank stock that made the list and comes after someone made a long-dated bullish bet. 
That’s as one trader bought $3.19 million worth of the January 2025 $95 calls. Those calls were slightly out-of-the-money with Morgan Stanley trading at $92.65 at the time, and expire in more than 760 days. 
Phillip Morris (PM)
Phillip Morris (US:PM) came in at No. 7 on this week's leaderboard after one trader made a bullish put trade. 
With shares trading at roughly $100, one trader sold $2.62 million worth of the March $90 puts. 
Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)
Like Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb (US:BMY) recently hit new all-time highs this month, but the stock has pulled back hard over the last few weeks. Shares have fallen about 10% while declining in 8 of the past 10 sessions. The two “up days” in that stretch came on gains of just 0.01% and 0.08%, respectively. 
One trader believes that pullback is an opportunity on the long side. 
On Dec. 15th, they sold $569,000 worth of the February $72.50 puts, which were slightly out-of-the-money as BMY stock was trading at $76. 
A day later, someone bought almost $170,000 worth of the $75 calls expiring on Jan. 6th, so they are looking for a bounce as well. 
Walmart (WMT)
Like Bristol-Myers Squibb, traders are looking for a bullish opportunity in Walmart (US:WMT) after the recent pullback. 
That’s as one trader collected $510,000 in premium for selling the September $125 puts. These puts were far out-of-the-money and currently expire in more than 120 days. 
Coca-Cola (KO)
Last but not least, we have Coca-Cola (US:KO), which also had bullish put selling taking place this week. 
Someone sold over $518,000 worth of the March $65 puts. Expiring in about 90 days, these puts were slightly in-the-money.

2022-12-18 00:00:00+00:00,"Got $5,000? 3 Stocks to Hold for the Next 20 Years",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/got-%245000-3-stocks-to-hold-for-the-next-20-years-3,,,"The world has changed a lot over the last 20 years. It seems inevitable that it will continue evolving over the next two decades. While it's impossible to know exactly what the future might look like, we can see certain long-term trends emerging that give us a glimpse into what's ahead. We're witnessing companies bringing their businesses into the digital age, the economy transitioning energy sources, and the reversal of globalization.
Investors who plug into these megatrends by investing in stocks poised to capitalize on them should do very well over the next couple of decades. A great way to start is by investing $5,000 or so across American Tower (NYSE: AMT), Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP), and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB). Here's why that move could pay big dividends in the coming years.
Plugged into the data megatrend
American Tower is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on owning and leasing data infrastructure like cell towers and data centers. Data usage is growing rapidly as businesses undergo digital transformation initiatives to bring more of their business processes online. Likewise, consumers are using more data as they stream videos and other content at home and on the go. As a result, companies need more infrastructure to store and transmit data at faster speeds.
This trend should allow American Tower to add more tenants and sites to its global tower portfolio and expand its data center business. These drivers should enable American Tower to grow its cash flow and dividend at healthy rates.
American Tower currently offers a dividend yield of nearly 2.9%. It has grown that payout at a double-digit rate for over a decade. Given the growth ahead, it should have plenty of power to continue increasing its payout. Add that income to its earnings growth, and American Tower could produce market-crushing total returns over the next 20 years.
Powered by three megatrends
Global infrastructure operator Brookfield Infrastructure has positioned its business to capitalize on three megatrends: Digitalization, decarbonization, and deglobalization. The company sees a $1 trillion investment opportunity to upgrade global data infrastructure over the next five years.
The world needs to replace copper wires with fiber to increase network speeds, build more wireless infrastructure to support 5G network upgrades, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence, and add significantly more data center capacity. Brookfield has invested billions of dollars in building data infrastructure platforms to capitalize on those opportunities.
Brookfield has also made several investments around the decarbonization theme. It sees opportunities to help companies decarbonize their operations and assist people with reducing their energy consumption. It also has a large-scale natural gas infrastructure business to help supply the world with more of that lower-carbon fuel.
The company is also investing heavily in the deglobalization theme. Persistent supply chain issues are leading more companies to onshore manufacturing capacity. Brookfield recently pledged to invest up to $15 billion to help Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) build two new semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the U.S. as the country seeks to onshore chipmaking capabilities. That deal will help Intel fund its large-scale manufacturing capacity expansion program.
Brookfield sees tremendous investment opportunities across these megatrends. They should enable the company to grow its cash flow at a 6% to 11% annual rate over the long term. That should support 5% to 9% yearly growth in its 3.5%-yielding dividend.
Fueled by the energy transition
Energy infrastructure giant Enbridge is in an excellent position to capitalize on the energy transition theme. The company has steadily shifted its focus to lower-carbon energy sources like natural gas and renewables over the years.
It has an extensive backlog of capital projects to continue expanding in those areas. It's building several offshore wind farms in Europe. Meanwhile, it recently acquired an onshore renewable energy developer in North America. On top of that, it continues to expand its extensive gas infrastructure, including investing in an export facility.
That backlog has Enbridge on track to grow its cash flow per share at a 5% to 7% annual rate through at least 2024. Meanwhile, it has increased visibility into its post-2024 growth prospects after securing several large-scale projects this year. Those growth drivers should enable Enbridge to continue expanding its 6.9%-yielding dividend, which it has done for 28 straight years.
Megatrend-driven growth
American Tower, Brookfield Infrastructure, and Enbridge have aligned their businesses to capitalize on at least one megatrend. Because of that, they should be able to grow for decades to come. That makes them great stocks to buy and hold for the ultra-long term.

2022-12-16 00:00:00+00:00,Digging Deep to Find Value: Stocks to Consider for 2023,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/digging-deep-to-find-value%3A-stocks-to-consider-for-2023,,,"W
e are at that time when looking back at the year that was will become a very popular thing to do for fund managers and the like who will measure their performance against stock indices and averages. The problem this year is that averages are misleading. As the year has gone on, the spread of performance between sectors and styles of stocks has grown to the point where the average of them tells us just about nothing.
The best performing SPDR Sector ETF by far is energy (XLE), which has returned 54% so far this year, as compared to the worst performing, consumer discretionary (XLY), which has lost 33%. That massive spread is why looking at the performance of any average is limited in its usefulness. Even within those sector averages, there are distortions, too. The big losses in XLY are driven mainly by its two biggest components, Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) which, combined, make up nearly 37% of the fund and which have dropped 49% and 54%, respectively. That drags the sector down, more than negating some small positive years from stocks like McDonald’s (MCD).
With the exception of energy stocks, what sector or industry a company operates in has not been a major factor in how their stocks have performed. What has mattered is how high their P/E, or earnings multiple, was coming into the year. Sky-high P/Es, based on assumptions of strong growth, are really no more, certainly when it comes to established businesses.
All of this matters to investors because it makes one of the more popular year-end strategies questionable at best. Many investors look at underperformers from the year and invest in these on the basis that, in markets, everything eventually returns to the mean. That strategy will not be as effective as it has been in the past. If a stock has fallen to below an average multiple because an industry is out of favor it will probably bounce back, but if it has dropped from an earnings multiple of, say, ten times the average to five times, it may never regain that 10x level. That isn’t to say that stocks like AMZN and TSLA can’t bounce back next year -- they certainly can, but it will probably be based on earnings growth that outstrips now-reduced expectations rather than an expansion of the adjusted multiples.
So, what investors should be looking for as this year ends are not necessarily the worst performers of the year, but underperformers with P/Es that are already below average. Or, to put it another way, good old-fashioned value.
That brings in an old strategy known as the “Dogs of the Dow”, which identifies the best value in the group of stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average based on those that have the highest dividend yield. It may seem strange to look for opportunity based on yield at a time when the Fed is raising interest rates, thereby reducing the value of a stock’s yield, but the whole point of the strategy is that it ignores what is happening now and assumes that things will change before too long. It is, in many ways, the ultimate contrarian strategy. Like any strategy, though, it is best applied selectively.
According to the website Dogsofthedow.com, the top ten dogs right now are as follows:
And there are a few there that stand out to me, both as possibilities and as stocks that may be value traps.
Starting with the negative, Verizon (VZ) may have the highest yield in the Dow, but in current circumstances it may not represent the best value. One could argue that the telecoms industry is one that will do well whatever economic conditions next year brings, but their problems are not really based on their industry, but more about their competitiveness within it. That can be seen by the fact that VZ is down 23% YTD, whereas its competitor, AT&T (T) has gained over 6% this year. The problem is that VZ lost their network superiority, and that will take a long time to fix, so a recovery next year looks unlikely.
On the positive side, there are a couple of stocks on this list that do offer serious upside. Two of the “old tech” names there, Intel (INTC) and Cisco (CSCO), have been dragged down by pessimism around tech, but that has been about adjusting inflated P/Es more than anything, and they don’t fit that description. If anything, at 8.4 and 17.2, respectively, their P/Es look low in an environment where companies are expecting to expand IT spending, whatever the state of the economy.
Others that appeal to me include Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), with a P/E of 7.8 and Chevron (CVX) which, despite huge gains this year still appears on the list and has a P/E of 9.6.
Overall, the lesson when looking back at the year is that investors should be careful about using simplistic analysis. The variation in performance, both between and within sectors, has been so great that lumping things together will give a false impression. However, digging a little deeper and looking at stocks individually will reveal that there is some value to be found.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-12-16 00:00:00+00:00,Alphabet (GOOGL) Bolsters Waymo Efforts With Latest Move (Revised),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alphabet-googl-bolsters-waymo-efforts-with-latest-move-revised,,,"Alphabet’s GOOGL self-driving unit Waymo, which has been running well on the streets of San Francisco, CA on the back of its Early Rider program called Trusted Tester, has now applied for a final permit in California at the California Public Utilities Commission.

With the help of this final permit, Waymo will be able to sell its self-driving car rides in San Francisco.

Notably, the latest application by Waymo might take months to get approved.

The latest move bodes well for the company’s deepening focus on making its autonomous vehicles popular in San Francisco.

Recently, Waymo started welcoming people to hail a ride in a self-driving Jaguar I-Pace. Booking for pickups is available via the Waymo One app.

Waymo’s arrival in San Francisco marks its very first expansion outside Phoenix, AZ.
Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus
Alphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote
Expanding Waymo Efforts
The recent step is in sync with the company’s strengthening efforts toward expanding its operations and fleet and making the vehicles more rider-friendly.

The company is also gearing up to make its ride-hailing vehicles fully driverless on the streets of San Francisco.

Further, Waymo in Bellevue marks Alphabet’s second Waymo expansion outside Phoenix, AZ.

Waymo launched a rider-only service in downtown Phoenix, where it has been operating its autonomous vehicles with a company specialist seated in the driver's seat until now. The service in downtown Phoenix will be confined to a specific area, which is constrained by Interstate 17 on the west and south, Camelback Road on the north and 44th Street on the east.

Waymo plans to roll out the driverless robotaxi service to regular passengers and expand its operating area eventually in downtown Phoenix.

Apart from these efforts, Alphabet’s partnership with Geely, a China-based automotive company, remains noteworthy. Per the terms of the deal, Geely’s electric mobility brand, Zeekr, will design and develop electric vehicles for Waymo, into which Waymo Driver will be integrated.

The vehicles will be introduced on the roads of the United States first. With the Geely partnership, Waymo will expand its Waymo One fleet.

The above-mentioned endeavors will help Alphabet further penetrate the booming autonomous driving space.

According to a Fortune Business Insights report, the global autonomous car market is expected to reach $11.03 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 31.3% between 2021 and 2028.

Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the worldwide driverless vehicle market is expected to see a CAGR of 18.06% between 2021 and 2026.

We believe that Alphabet’s growing prospects in this promising market will help it win investors’ confidence in the days ahead.

Coming to the price performance, Alphabet has lost 37.3% on a year-to-date basis against the industry’s decline of 36.5%.
Intensifying Competition
However, Alphabet which currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), faces stiff competition from the companies like Intel INTC, Amazon AMZN and Baidu BIDU. These are also making every effort to capitalize on the growth prospects in the autonomous driving space.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Intel is gaining from the low power consumption of Mobileye chips and the ability to create maps for self-driving systems. The company plans to introduce a pilot program for autonomous taxis and ride-hailing services in Munich and Tel Aviv in 2022.

In April 2022, the company gave a sneak peek at its robotaxi ride by rolling out a video of a 40-minute autonomous car ride around Jerusalem.

In addition to this, Mobileye’s partnership with German electric mobility unit Benteler EV Systems and Beep to develop and deploy self-driving, fully electric shuttles in the United States by 2024 remains noteworthy.

Amazon’s buyout of Zoox, a developer of autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, remains a major positive. The company’s launch of its first self-driving robotaxi strengthened its position in the autonomous driving space. Zoox also operates an engineering office and operations facility in Seattle. The facility acts as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing.

Currently, the company is gearing up to test its robotaxi in California. It has applied for a permit in California to test-drive its vehicles.

Meanwhile, Baidu is gaining from the strong momentum of Apollo Go Robotaxi service across China on the back of its increasing availability in several cities and a growing number of rides.

Apollo Go is available in 10 cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Changsha, Cangzhou, Yangquan, Wuzhen Water Town and Wuhan.

es, believe it or not, quantum computers exist and are changing the path of the future - leading towards rapid innovation and serving to disrupt everyday life.
Quantum computing is rapidly approaching commercial viability. And when it does, it will have an enormous impact on our lives, accelerating advances in emerging technologies, such as EV batteries, biotechnology and artificial intelligence, in ways that are unimaginable today.
Just last month, IBM (IBM) announced that it has built a new quantum computer dubbed Osprey with 433 qubits, which is triple the number of data processing elements compared to last year. The company also announced improvements made to Osprey’s predecessor, Eagle, which extended the lifespan of calculations.
If those last few sentences sounded like a foreign language, you aren’t alone. In this week’s World Reimagined, we are going to look at quantum computing, what it is, how it is evolving, and how to invest in this game-changing technology. 
What Is Quantum Computing?
Quantum computers are based on quantum mechanics, a highly complex concept that gave headaches to even the most brilliant minds, such as Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger (whose cat wasn’t too fond of his research). To appreciate quantum mechanics, we need to first look at classical mechanics, which is basically the physical laws governing the world as we experience it. 
Classical mechanics describe things like what happens when you put your foot on the accelerator pedal or why your coffee mug lands on the ground when it rolls off your desk. More importantly, in classical mechanics, an object can only be in one place at a time; your coffee mug is either on the table or on the floor. It cannot be in both places at the same time.
In quantum, which is all about the world of things smaller than an atom (subatomic), stuff gets seriously weird. Subatomic particles are theoretically able to be in two places at the same time, before they are observed, leaving the actual position of the particle to be a probabilistic combination of all its possible positions – back to poor Schrödinger’s cat. This magical ability to be in multiple places at once is referred to as quantum superposition, and I’d argue is likely what makes Santa’s big night possible. 
The second key concept in quantum mechanics is entanglement. In a nutshell, if I know something about the probabilistic positioning of one subatomic particle, that tells me something about the probabilistic positioning of another subatomic particle with which the first is entangled. Think of it like two dancers listening to the same music, which represents their entanglement. They are dancing in separate rooms to choreographed routines while the music plays. Without being able to hear the music, if I know which step one is doing, I know which step the other is doing.
How Can Computers Use Quantum Mechanics?
So how is this useful in computing?
Traditional computers are based on bits, which store data either as a “0” or a “1.” A quantum computer instead uses quantum bits called qubits, which are made up of charged particles called ions. These qubits can take on multiple states simultaneously, rather than being limited to just “0” or “1.”
When bits can exist in multiple states at the same time instead of just “0” or “1,” they can perform multiple calculations simultaneously, whereas classical computers can only perform one calculation at a time. Think of this as akin to being able to multitask versus doing one thing at a time. Using superposition and entanglement, quantum computers can perform calculations in ways that are impossible for classical computers. Thinking back to IBM’s recently announced 433-qubit Osprey, consider that a 275-qubit quantum computer can consider more states than there are atoms in the universe. 
The History of Quantum Computing 
In 1980, physicist Paul Benioff proposed a quantum mechanical model of the Turing machine, which launched the field of quantum computing, and in 1986, Nobel Prizewinner Richard Feynman developed a model for quantum computation, called a quantum circuit; I think we can all take comfort in knowing that the man who won the Nobel prize for his work on quantum electrodynamics also said, “nobody understands quantum mechanics.” 
In 1998 Isaac Chuang, Neil Gershenfeld and Mark Kubinec built the first quantum computer capable of performing computations. In the decades since then, significant progress has been made in the field of quantum computing, and quantum computers are now able to perform a wider range of tasks and are on track to upend many disruptive fields of technology. 
In October 2019, Google’s Sycamore quantum computer performed calculations more than 3 million times faster than could be done on IBM’s Summit, which is considered the world’s fastest computer. IBM fought back and claims to have reduced the gap and occasionally been able to have beaten Sycamore, but progress continues. In December 2020, a group at the University of Science and Technology of China claimed to have built a quantum computer that implemented a type of Boson sampling on 76 photons. The authors of the report claim that this computer was able to do in 20 seconds what would take a supercomputer 600 million years. 
Quantum Computing Today 
Progress is still going strong. In October, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Nobel Prize in physics to three scientists, Alain Aspect, John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger, for their research on quantum information sciences. Recently Google’s Sycamore quantum processor was used by a consortium of researchers from Caltech, Google, Fermilab, MIT and Harvard to generate and control what is equivalent to an Einstein-Rosen bridge, or more commonly referred to as a wormhole, delighting Star Trek fans everywhere.
There are several companies that are currently working on developing quantum computers or aspects of quantum computing, including Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Baidu (BIDU), IBM, Google, Honeywell (HON), Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), Quantum Computing (QUBT) and Toshiba (TOSBF),  as well as private companies such as D-Wave Systems, Atom Computing, QC Ware and PASQAL. In 2021, IonQ (IONQ) was the first quantum technology start-up in history to go public, becoming the first publicly traded, pure-play quantum computing company. In March 2022, Rigetti Computing (RGTI) went public on Nasdaq, following a merger with Supernova, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).
These companies are using a variety of approaches to building quantum computers, including superconducting qubits, trapped ion qubits and photonic qubits. While quantum computers are still in the early stages of development, many believe that they have the potential to revolutionize fields such as medicine, finance and materials science by providing a much faster and more powerful way of solving complex problems.
For example, as the world moves further towards renewable energy, the need for energy storage in the form of batteries increases. To improve batteries, we need to be able to test them, and battery cell simulations can happen a lot faster than real-world testing, accelerating innovation. Their computing power would enable machine learning that could make the kind of artificial intelligence (AI) we see in SciFi movies a reality.
One problem that quantum computing introduces concerns cybersecurity, which is today built mostly on math-based cryptography. Today’s systems work because the math problems providing protection are so complex that classical computers cannot solve them within a useful amount of time. The “Quantum Threat” is that quantum computers will make these security systems obsolete. Some believe that this could become a reality somewhere between 2025 and 2030. Arqit Quantum (ARQQ) looks to address this problem by providing a quantum encryption platform-as-a-service. 
Going Mainstream 
Quantum is no longer on the fringes. According to The First Annual Report on Enterprise Quantum Computing Adoption from Zapata, quantum has moved to the core of the analytics agenda with quantum naysayers now a minority. Zapata surveyed 300 leaders at large global enterprises with estimated 2021 revenues of over $250 million and estimated computed budgets of over $1 million.
74% of respondents agreed that “those who fail to adopt quantum computing solutions will fall behind.”
69% of enterprises adopted or were planning to adopt quantum computing in 2022.
S. respondents were first in quantum adoption, followed by Canada and China.
28% of global enterprises on the path to quantum adoption are investing over $1 million in quantum computing.
For those still unsure that they understand what this is all about, 96% of respondents said they need more than 10 minutes to explain quantum computing to a friend at a party.
In 2021, IDC estimated that the market for quantum computing services could grow to $8.6 billion by 2027, up from $412 million in 2020, representing a compound annual growth rate of over 50%. Boston Consulting Group forecasts the potential value creation from quantum computing to be in the range of $450 billion to $850 billion by around 2040.
How to Invest in Quantum Computing
As investors fled higher-risk assets over the past year, small-cap quantum stocks have taken some hits, making them more attractive these days from a valuation standpoint. Most of the bigger players have also seen their share prices decline, but not as much as the smaller cap players. Aside from the aforementioned companies, investors can also consider the Defiance Quantum ETF (QTUM) launched in September 2018, which seeks to track the total return performance of the BlueStar Quantum Computing and Machine Learning Index. The index tracks the performance of the largest and most liquid companies in the global quantum computing and machine learning industries.
The Bottom Line 
The massive leap in processing capabilities that comes with quantum computing will make possible a world that today is the stuff of science fiction. It will bring the ability to process enormous amounts of data incredibly fast, a total game-changer in machine learning and will allow simulations that are unimaginable today. It will make possible an entirely new level of AI that could accelerate advances in genomics, disease management and renewable energy technologies – just to name a few – helping us live longer, healthier lives in a world in which the cost of energy is rapidly falling towards zero, and that is a world reimagined.

2022-12-15 00:00:00+00:00,Is Intel Stock a Buy Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-intel-stock-a-buy-now-1,,,"Share prices of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have gained some momentum since hitting a 52-week low on Oct. 13, which seems a tad surprising when you consider that the chipmaker posted woeful results at the end of October revealing a huge drop in the company's revenue and earnings. It seems investors remain optimistic that Chipzilla's fortunes could turn around sooner than later.
Let's look at the possible reasons investors may be optimistic about Intel.
Intel may finally have an answer to AMD's client processors
It is no secret that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has been clawing away at Intel's dominance in the x86 processor market, but Chipzilla turned the tables to some extent last quarter. Mercury Research estimates that Intel's share of the desktop and notebook processor markets increased in the third quarter of 2022.
More specifically, Intel gained 3.1 percentage points of market share in desktop central processing units (CPUs) in Q3 over the prior-year period, ending the quarter with a total share of 86.1%. Its market share of notebook processors was up 6.3 percentage points year over year to 84.3%.
It is not surprising that Intel was able to arrest AMD's growth in the client CPU market. Chipzilla's 13th-generation Raptor Lake processors, which went on sale in October of this year, reportedly outperform AMD's offerings in important areas such as pricing, gaming performance, content creation, specifications, and value for money.
That's even though Intel's processors are made with a refined version of its 10-nanometer (nm) Intel 7 process chips. AMD's latest Ryzen 7000 processors, on the other hand, use 5nm chips. Chips based on a smaller process node should ideally perform better since they pack transistors more closely, leading to more computing power and less energy consumption. But it seems Intel found some alternative using its latest architecture.
Moreover, Intel is expected to push the envelope further in 2023 with the launch of the Meteor Lake client CPUs, which will reportedly be based on a 7nm process node. So Intel may be able to keep AMD at bay in client CPUs next year if it manages to stick to its product roadmap. That could give some respite to Intel's client computing group (CCG), which reported a terrible third quarter.
The segment's revenue fell 17% year over year to $8.1 billion in the third quarter. With sales of personal computers (PCs) and tablets expected to drop at a slower pace of 2.6% in 2023 following a 12.8% drop this year, Intel's CCG business could fare better next year. That would bode well for Intel's top line, as CCG produced 53% of the company's total revenue last quarter.
Intel continues to lose ground in a critical market
While Intel's progress in client CPUs should give investors a reason to be optimistic, the semiconductor giant continues to lose share in an important market: server processors. Mercury Research estimates that Intel's share of server processors fell 7.3 percentage points year over year to 82.5% in the third quarter.
The bad news for Intel is that AMD could keep gaining market share at a fast clip in the server processor market in 2023 following the launch of its fourth-generation Epyc chips, which have already gained impressive traction among customers. Intel is set to launch its next-generation Sapphire Rapids server processors on Jan. 10 following several delays. It remains to be seen if the processor could turn the tide for Intel, as the delays have already given AMD an upper hand in the server processor market.
Additionally, the launch of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) Grace server processors next year poses another challenge to Intel's dominance in this space. That's because Nvidia's Grace server processors are reportedly based on a 5nm process node, which means that they would be more powerful and use power more efficiently -- at least in theory -- than Intel's Sapphire Rapids architecture, which is based on a 10nm process node.
Intel's data center revenue fell a steep 27% year over year in the third quarter to $4.2 billion thanks to its market share losses to AMD. Nvidia's foray into this niche could make it difficult for Intel to turn its fortunes around in this segment, and that could weigh on the company's ability to sustain its recent stock market rally.
Is the stock worth buying?
Analysts are expecting a big improvement in Intel's performance next year. Its top line is expected to contract by 4% to $61 billion in 2023 following this year's estimated decline of 15%. Adjusted earnings are expected to drop 4% to $1.88 per share following a steep 64% drop in 2022.
If Intel continues to do well in client processors and turns its fortunes around in the server space with its new chips, then it could live up to analysts' expectations and the stock could head higher. But if the execution problems that plagued the company return and it keeps losing market share, investors are likely to press the panic button again, which is why new investors should be cautious about buying this semiconductor stock.

2022-12-14 00:00:00+00:00,Time to Buy AMD or Intel Stock for 2023?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/time-to-buy-amd-or-intel-stock-for-2023,,,"Semiconductors were some of the hardest-hit equities this year and investors are surely wondering if these stocks will rebound in 2023. Among chip stocks, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Intel INTC are names that will draw interest.
The two companies have battled for market share in the industry becoming somewhat fierce competitors. AMD had momentarily and monumentally passed Intel in terms of market cap earlier in the year.
Let’s see which stock may be geared to have a stronger performance going forward.
Performance
Before we dive into growth prospects and value let’s take a look at the recent and historical performance of AMD and Intel stock.
Intel is down -45% year to date to slightly outperform AMD’s -52% but both have noticeably lagged the S&P 500’s -17% and the Nasdaq’s -28%. Over the last decade, AMD’s total return is an astonishing +2,559% to crush INTC and the broader indexes.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
AMD’s total return is the same as its direct price performance as the company doesn’t offer a dividend at the moment. This makes AMD’s decade performance all the more impressive as Intel’s price performance is only +36% in the last 10 years without its dividend. 
The decade chart is symbolic of AMD taking market share from INTC, but past performance doesn’t always guarantee future success which has ironically been true with these two stocks.
Valuation & Growth
Trading around $67 per share and roughly 56% from its 52-week high, AMD has a P/E of 20.5X. In comparison, INTC trades 49% off its highs at $28 a share and 14.7X earnings.
From a valuation standpoint, both stocks are starting to look attractive relative to their past. However, Advanced Micro Devices stands out here too. AMD trades well below its absurd decade high of 5,985X and at a 49% discount from its median of 47.9X. When comparing this period, INTC trades nicely beneath its decade high of 16.7X but 15% above its decade median of 12.8X.
Pivoting to growth, AMD’s earnings are now expected to jump 25% to $3.49 a share in 2022. Fiscal 2023 EPS is projected to rise 1% to $3.52. However, earnings estimate revisions have declined for both FY22 and FY23 over the last 90 days.

Sales are projected to pop 43% this year and rise another 4% in FY23 to $24.59 billion. FY23 sales would represent a stellar 265% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $6.73 billion.
Turning to Intel, earnings are forecasted to decline -64% this year to $1.97 per share. Fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to drop another -3% as the company looks to stop the bleeding from several lackluster quarters earlier in the year. Earnings estimates for FY22 and FY23 have also declined for Intel as well.

On its top line, Intel’s sales are now projected to fall -18% this year and another -3% in FY23 to $61.66 billion. This is also a -14% decrease from 2019 pre-pandemic sales. However, Intel’s stock appears to have mostly priced in its dismal outlook and is at its cheapest levels in years in terms of stock price.
Dividends
Intel’s dividend didn’t make much of a difference in the total return decade chart comparison with AMD but in the current market environment, it is certainly more helpful. This is an obvious edge to Intel as AMD does not offer a dividend to compete with INTC’’s solid 5.08% annual dividend yield.

Bottom Line
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC) stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). From a performance and valuation perspective, AMD appears to still have an edge over its competitor. The same can be said for AMD’s growth prospects, although in the near term, operating conditions will be tougher for most companies.
To that note, Intel does have the advantage of rewarding patient investors with its generous dividend. Both stocks are starting to look attractive at their current levels and holding shares could start to pay off next year. The possibility of a 2023 rebound could largely depend on their fourth-quarter earnings reports and the ability to offer better-than-expected guidance.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.
