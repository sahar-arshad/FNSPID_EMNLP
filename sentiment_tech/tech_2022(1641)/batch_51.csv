2022-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,China conditionally approves AMD's $35 bln deal for Xilinx,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/china-conditionally-approves-amds-%2435-bln-deal-for-xilinx-0,,,"Adds background, detail
SHANGHAI, Jan 27 (Reuters) - China's market regulator has conditionally approved semiconductor group Advanced Micro Devices Inc's AMD.O $35 billion all-stock deal for peer Xilinx XLNX.O, it said on Thursday.
The regulatory approval from Beijing brings the purchase, which was first announced in October 2020, closer to completion.
In a public notice, China's State Administration for Market Regulation said it will approve the deal on condition that AMD and Xilinx do not force tie-in sales of products or discriminate against customers that buy one set of products but not another.
The regulator added that the newly merged entity must also ensure ""the flexibility and programmability of Xilinx FPGAs"" and ""that their development methods are compatible with ARM-based processors"".
It must also make sure that its GPUs and FPGA products sold to China are interoperable with products in the China market.
The merger comes as both AMD and Xilinx compete against Intel Corp INTC.O to penetrate the market for data center chips.
Washington and Beijing have at times brought pending mergers in the chip sector to a halt by withholding regulatory approval.
In March 2021, Applied Materials Inc AMAT.O abandoned its planned $2.2 billion purchase of Japan's Kokusai Electric Corp, citing a lack of regulatory approval from China.
In December U.S.-listed chipmaker Magnachip Semiconductor Corp MX.N announced it would terminate a $1.4 billion buyout plan from Chinese private equity firm Wise Road Capital following a probe into the deal from Washington's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

2022-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,"Top Stock Market News For Today January 27, 2022",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-stock-market-news-for-today-january-27-2022,,,"Stock Market Futures Mixed Following Federal Reserve Policy Update
Stock market futures are mixed during today’s early morning trading. This is likely as investors digest the latest statements from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Now, among the key takeaways from the FOMC meeting would be its decision to hold interest rates at near-zero for now. Even so, there remains a focus on withdrawing pandemic-era policies amidst rising inflation. This is evident from the following statement from the Fed. “With inflation well above 2% and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.”
Now, the current move by the Federal Reserve is not all that surprising. This is because policymakers have and continue to reiterate that ending the central banks’ asset purchase program is their first priority. On this front, the FOMC affirms that it will likely complete the process by early March. By extension, we could see the first interest rate hike within the next two months. For one thing, increasing interest rates would help to address the current issue with inflation. This would primarily raise borrowing costs and reduce demand for goods in general.
For today, investors could be closely watching how these updates weigh in on earnings in Big Tech in the stock market today. As of 7:24 a.m. ET, the Dow & S&P 500 are declining by 0.26%, and 0.09%, while Nasdaq futures are trading higher by 0.15%.

Apple Earnings On Tap After Closing Bell Today; Reportedly Making Bold Push Into Fintech
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the next FAANG member reporting quarterly earnings figures today. With the consumer tech titan coming under the microscope today, investors will likely be tuning in to AAPL stock today. Accordingly, Wall Street is currently expecting Apple to report an earnings per share of $1.88 on revenue of $118.7 billion. Now, to begin with, these figures are commendable even after accounting for the company’s massive operations. However, after a solid two years of strong iPhone sales amidst the pandemic, things appear to be normalizing for Apple. According to a statement to its component suppliers, the demand for iPhone 13’s is weakening. Because of this, the focus could be on Apple’s iPhone revenue this quarter.
Aside from its earnings, Apple does not seem to be slowing down in the least bit on the operational front. According to sources from Bloomberg, the company is planning to test out new fintech services. This would see small businesses being able to accept digital payments directly from iPhones. In other words, Apple could be looking to turn iPhones into payment terminals. More importantly, the report suggests that all this will be done without additional hardware through near-field communication (NFC) tech.
Should all this be the case, Apple would be stepping up to the plate against firms like Block (NYSE: SQ). Regardless of how you look at it, Apple seems to be having an exciting week. With that in mind, investors may want to consider taking a closer look at AAPL stock now.

Tesla Posts Strong Earnings And Reveals Plans To Rev Up Autonomous Vehicle Tech And Production Efforts
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) reported positive numbers in its fourth-quarter earnings yesterday. After the closing bell, the company reported earnings of $2.52 on record quarterly revenue of $17.72 billion. Notably, this would be well above estimates of $2.36 and $16.57 billion respectively. In detail, the electric vehicle (EV) goliath saw its total revenue soar by 65% year-over-year. Over the same period, its automotive revenue is currently looking at sizable gains of 71%. Also, Tesla’s net income is up by a whopping 760%, totaling $2.32 billion.
Despite all of this, TSLA stock ended the post-market trading hours in the red. For the most part, this would be due to CEO Elon Musk’s latest update on Tesla’s operation. According to Musk, the EV firm will likely remain “chip-limited” this year and lack any new models in 2022. Furthermore, he also notes that Tesla’s factories have been and still are running below capacity. The reason for this is supply chain issues becoming a “main limiting factor,” in Musk’s words.
While all this may appear to be negative, the company has also been holding its ground. Throughout 2021, Tesla hit record production figures and is looking to expand beyond its 600,000 units per year manufacturing capacity. After considering all of this data, investors looking for long-term buys could be eyeing TSLA stock.

Jan 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open higher on Thursday, helped by gains in megacap tech-focused firms a day after hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve weighed on markets.
Netflix Inc NFLX.O jumped 4% in premarket trading as billionaire investor William Ackman amassed a new stake in the streaming service company worth more than $1 billion.
Tech-heavy Nasdaq futures NQcv1 rose 0.4%.
Apple AAPL.O, Microsoft MSFT.O, Meta Platforms FB.O and Alphabet GOOGL.O gained nearly 1% each, with the iPhone maker set to report results after markets close.
U.S. two-year yields, which are sensitive to interest rate expectations, rose to their highest levels since February 2020 after the Fed on Wednesday indicated a rate hike in March and reaffirmed plans to end its bond purchases that month before launching a significant reduction in its asset holdings. US/
Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned inflation remains above its long-run goal and supply problems are bigger and more long-lasting than previously thought.
Traders priced in nearly five rate increases by December after the Fed announcement, after previously fully pricing for four.
""Market has priced in the rate hikes, (but) they've not completely priced in the quantitative tightening, because we don't know what it's going to be and we don't know the impact,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.
Adding to investor concerns were festering geopolitical tensions in Ukraine. The U.S. said on Wednesday it had set out a diplomatic path to address Russian demands in eastern Europe, as Moscow held security talks with the West and intensified its military build-up near Ukraine with new drills.
The S&P 500 index nosedived in the previous session reversing all its early gains amid volatile trading, flirting with a correction for its third straight session.
The bellwether index would have to close 10% or more below its record closing high reached on Jan. 3, to confirm it entered correction territory. It ended the session 9.3% below that level on Wednesday.
Latest data showed the U.S. economy grew by 6.9% in the fourth quarter, far ahead of economists expectations of 5.5% growth.
Meanwhile, the fourth-quarter earnings season is in full swing with analysts expecting earnings from S&P 500 companies to grow 24.4% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv, as of Wednesday.

Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. First, let me say welcome to Dave, who is joining us for his firstearnings call Many of you know Dave well and know his track record of successfully driving shareholder value. We're very excited to have him join our team.
I also want to take a moment to thank George for his many contributions during the critical period in the company's transformation. Everyone here at Intel wishes him all the best in his future endeavors as he begins his planned retirement in May. Q4 was a tremendous finish to a transformational year where we beat expectations on both the top and bottom line. We exceeded our guidance for the quarter by over $1 billion on the top line, finishing with our best quarter and our best full-year revenue ever.
We had a record quarter for DCG, where we grew 20% year on year and where we continue to be the partner of choice for cloud and data center customers. We expect that our Xeon shipments in December alone exceeded the total server CPU shipments by any single competitor for all of 2021. We had a record year for our client business. And in Q4, we outperformed our plan and delivered another $10 billion quarter, highlighting again that the PC is more essential than ever.
Continuing our momentum as the market leader in ADAS and AV solutions, Mobileye grew more than 40% year on year in 2021, delivering a 14th consecutive year of revenue growth. And finally, IOTG had another $1 billion quarter to cap a record year as the need for compute at the edge continues to grow. Supporting these record results, our manufacturing network continued its superb execution throughout the year. As an IDM, we were able to rapidly adjust to support customers' mix changes, often with a normal lead time, and manufactured more than 2 million wafers.
We broke ground on two new fabs in Arizona three months ahead of schedule as part of the largest overall manufacturing expansion in Intel's history and all while managing a challenging COVID environment and focusing on the safety of our employees, suppliers, and partners. We also took several in a series of key steps to shape our business. To begin with, we've recently completed the first close of the sale of our NAND business on time, a critical step in optimizing our portfolio in line with our new strategy. Second, we began unfolding our plan to find innovative ways to sustainably unlock shareholder value with the announcement of our intent to take Mobileye public in 2022.
Third, just last week, we announced our new manufacturing site in Ohio, which will support our future growth and advances our plan to create a more geographically balanced, resilient supply chain. While there is a lot left to do, we're building momentum, and we intend to continue our laser focus on execution, innovation, and growing the business. Finally, Q4 was a sacred moment for the entire technology industry as we led the 50th anniversary celebration of the Intel 4004, the chip that changed the world. Microprocessor technology sparked by the Intel 4004 allows us to stay connected during the pandemic.
It has opened up new ways to work and learn. It has removed geographical boundaries and changed almost every aspect of our lives. We are committed to accelerate this impact for the next 50 years as the insatiable need for compute that started with the 4004 continues to drive the value of Moore's Law. At IDM, we outlined a long-term path toward more than 10x density improvement in packaging and a 30% to 50% area improvement in transistor scaling.
As the steward of Moore's Law, we remain committed to keeping it alive for the next decade and beyond. Looking across the industry, 2021 was dominated by two recurring themes, unprecedented demand, and ecosystem supply constraints. The strong demand we saw throughout 2021 continued in Q4, and markets remained robust across all our businesses. We expect this trend to continue as the digitization of everything, driven by the four superpowers of AI, pervasive connectivity, ubiquitous compute, and cloud-to-edge infrastructure leads to an era of sustainable growth.
2021 marked the best year in a decade for the PC industry, with third parties reporting a growth rate of approximately 15%, driven by higher PC density, shorter replacement cycles, and increased market penetration. In Q4, we also saw the strong recovery in the channel as increased supply led to a record sell-through for Intel, and we started to see inventories return to pre-pandemic levels. The data center market was strong across all geographies in Q4, led by the enterprise where the market continued to recover from COVID lows. We expect the data center, network, and edge markets to continue to have robust growth as hyperscalers lay out multiyear cloud capex investment plans.
The ongoing need for data privacy and security drives additional edge and on-prem deployments. 5G network and edge build-outs are scaling and workloads like AI continue to expand. This unprecedented demand continues to be tempered by supply chain constraints as shortages in substrates, components, and foundry silicon has limited our customers' ability to ship finished systems. Across the industry, this was most acutely felt in the client market, particularly in notebooks, but constraints have widely impacted other markets, including automotive, the Internet of Things, and the data center.
As we predicted, these ecosystem constraints are expected to persist through 2022 and into 2023, with incremental improvements over this period. The industry will continue to see challenges in a variety of areas, including specialty and overall foundry shortages, substrates, as well as third-party silicon. While constraints will remain, our IDM 2.0 strategy affords us a superior position to navigate this environment. With control over our manufacturing network and supply chain, we are able to react to rapid changes in demand that help solve challenges for our customers, suppliers, and partners.
Equally important as an IDM, we remain more resilient to foundry price increases as only a minority of our volume is produced by third parties. Turning from the ecosystem to Intel. We made incredible progress over the last year improving our execution in technology development, manufacturing, and product leadership. With unprecedented transparency, we laid out an ambitious path to deliver five process nodes in four years and regain process performance parity by 2024 and unquestioned leadership by 2025.
We are shipping Intel 7 in volume today. And as I was able to say last quarter and can reaffirm today, we remain on or ahead of schedule for Intel 4, 3, 20A, and 18A against the timelines we laid out in July. Our manufacturing execution continued to improve. And in Q4, as we ship a record number of servers and we have more than a 30% year-on-year reduction in 10-nanometer wafer costs, we had record quarterly increase in our substrate capacity with our vendors, and we accelerated our pace of innovation with a record number of PDK releases and new product introductions in our factories.
Finally, as part of our strategy to use both internal and external manufacturing, we signed multiple long-term supply agreements ranging from foundry partners to substrates to equipment suppliers that will support the growth of our business for years to come. In particular, we announced the deepening of our ASML partnership and our leadership position with the second generation of EUV High-NA. In client, we had another $10 billion quarter, and 2021 was our sixth straight year of revenue growth. We feel great about our position within the sustainably larger client market, and we had all-time record shipments with customers like Dell.
We have a great product lineup starting with Tiger Lake, which has now shipped over 100 million units, making it the fastest-ramping notebook in our history. We are extending our leadership position further with products like our 12th generation Alder Lake, the fastest client processor ever, which is now shipping to over 140 customers in 30 countries around the world. As our first performance hybrid product, it features the highest-performance CPU core Intel has ever built, as well as the efficient cores optimized for power. It leads the industry transition on DDR5 and PCIe 5 to enhance gaming and creator experiences.
The Alder Lake family will scale across every PC segment from ultra-thin and light laptops to enthusiast desktops, where we've now set new overclocking records to mobile gaming, where the Core i9-12900HK, the world's best mobile gaming processor, is up to 40% faster than the prior generation. Following on the success of Alder Lake, we will continue to build momentum later this year when we expect to introduce Raptor Lake, which is already booted in our labs. In addition to leadership products, we are also driving platform innovations. And at CES, we unveiled our third-gen Evo platform.
This new generation includes features like intelligent collaboration to optimize remote work and learning experiences, as well as Thunderbolt 4 and WiFi 6E. With no legacy WiFi interference, WiFi 6E will enable incredible performance with low latency, the biggest WiFi advancement in 20 years. We are further reinvigorating the PC ecosystem with technologies like Screenovate, which provides a seamless multi-device and screen-sharing experience, which will begin rolling out on select Intel Evo platforms starting later this year. Driven by the strong product and platform lineup, we feel confident in our ability to compete and drive growth going forward.
Our Data Center Group had its best quarter ever as customers continued rebuilding their confidence in choosing Intel. Enabled by our IDM advantage, Ice Lake servers shipped more than 1 million units, equal to the amount we had shipped in the prior three quarters combined. All of our OEMs are currently shipping systems, and all of our major cloud customers have announced instances, including our third instance with Amazon Web Services. Going forward, our road map only gets better, and we expect to ship initial SKUs of Sapphire Rapids to select customers in Q1.
Sapphire Rapids will offer significant performance improvements across a range of workloads, including AI, where we are targeting up to 30x total gain for Xeon. This demonstrates that a general-purpose CPU with built-in AI acceleration can solve even more customer use cases that once necessitated GPU acceleration. Customers remain excited about Sapphire Rapids, and it has been chosen, along with HPE, to power the new Kestrel supercomputer. Built for the U.S.
Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Kestrel will accelerate discovery of renewable power. Once completed in 2023, Kestrel will have more than five times greater capability than NREL's existing system with approximately 44 petaflops of peak performance. Beyond the core data center, we continue to build on our leadership position from the network to the edge with our comprehensive portfolio of hardware and software solutions. We are leading the transformation of the network where Xeon and FlexRAN software are used in almost all DRAM commercial deployments.
We are driving AI inferencing adoption at the edge with our OpenVINO software and partners like BMW Group and Samsung in the factory and medical environments. And we are extending the IPU ecosystem and accelerating the creation of fully programmable network by collaborating on new FPGA-based IPU solutions with Inspur, Ruijie Networks, and Silicom. In our discrete and accelerated graphics business, we are starting the year very quickly. Alchemist, the first product in our Intel Arc Discrete Graphics lineup, is now shipping to customers with more than 50 new mobile and desktop designs, including with Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, and others.
Our Arc family of products will scale from mainstream up to the performance graphics segment and will be available in the market later this quarter. In high-performance computing, our Ponte Vecchio GPU is already sampling to customers. With 100 billion transistors, Ponte Vecchio has our highest compute density ever and along with Sapphire Rapids will power the two exaflop Aurora supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory. There are over 100 HPC applications running on Ponte Vecchio, which, enabled by one API, provides a unified and open programming model across CPU and GPU.
We are working with numerous partners and customers, including Atos, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Quanta, and Super Micro to deploy our HPC-tuned CPUs and GPUs in their latest systems. Our IFS business continues to see strong and enthusiastic customer support. We have a strong pipeline of potential customers, and IP development with the ecosystem is progressing well. We are shipping for revenue on our packaging solutions, and we continue to expect customer test chips in our factories on our Intel 16 process this year.
Innovations like RibbonFET and PowerVia are proving to be very attractive features to potential customers, and the Intel 18A design kit has now been released to three RAMP-C customers. Overall, we are ahead of where I thought we'd be, and I am thrilled with the progress of our IFS team. In mobility, Mobileye continues to be an industry leader in both ADAS and AV, and we recently hit a significant milestone shipping our 100th million EyeQ SoC. At CES, we gave a glimpse of the future with the EyeQ Ultra, which will do the work of 10 EyeQ 5 SoCs in a single package and was designed to deliver the optimum power and performance for a fully self-driving vehicle.
In Q4, we also introduced our first autonomous on-demand service in Paris in collaboration with the RATP Group. Paris is the latest in a list of locations where Mobileye is piloting autonomous vehicle test fleets, including New York, Munich, Detroit, Tokyo, Israel, and China. Looking ahead, we still expect to launch commercial robotaxi services in Munich and Tel Aviv in 2022. As we announced in December, we are working to take Mobileye public to unlock shareholder value.
We are making good progress, and we'll share more as we go through the year. You'll hear a lot more about how we are rearchitecting our business for growth as part of our upcoming Investor Day. We will lay out details on how we are leveraging our core strengths to accelerate our plans and how we are uniquely positioned to create value. We'll give you the proof points you should expect to see in 2022 that show that we are on track for our long-term plan, all backed up by the transparency and accountability that our new reportable segments will provide.
Let me close by saying again that Q4 was an incredibly strong finish to a great 2021. And I believe that, with growing markets, our strong product road map, and our increasingly solid execution, 2022 will only be better. In fact, just in the past 24 hours, we were pleased to see the ruling from the general court in Europe and their decision to overturn the EUR 1.1 billion fine. The semiconductor industry has never been more competitive than it is today, and we look forward to continuing to invest and grow in Europe.
At the same time, here in the U.S., we were very excited to see the progress on the Chips Act with the House introducing their version of the bill yesterday. The President and other members of the administration have been clear on the importance of this transformational investment, and it's encouraging to see the strong bipartisan and bicameral support as we continue to work together to address the long-term impacts of the semiconductor shortage, restore U.S. leadership in this critical industry and rebalance the global supply chain. With that, let me turn it over to Dave.
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. First, let me say how happy I am to be part of Intel. It's a really exciting time, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to support Intel's transformation and plans for growth. I think we have a great opportunity to drive compelling returns and shareholder value, which all starts with the plans that we will lay out for you at Investor Day in February.
Q4 was a record quarter, delivering a stronger-than-expected finish to another record year. Both DCG and IOTG achieved record quarters, with CCG, IOTG, and Mobileye delivering full-year record revenue. Q4 revenue was $19.5 billion, exceeding our guidance by $1.2 billion. The revenue beat was broad-based, led by stronger-than-expected enterprise and government demand in data center, desktop PC strength, and better-than-expected notebook demand.
Gross margin for the quarter was 55.4%, exceeding our guidance by 190 basis points due to strong flow-through on higher revenue. Q4 EPS was $1.09, $0.19 above our guide due to strong operational performance. For full year 2021, we achieved record revenue of $74.7 billion, up $1.2 billion from our previous guidance and up 2% year over year. 2021 gross margin was 57.7%, and EPS was $5.47, up $0.37 year over year.
We generated $11.3 billion of free cash flow in 2021, approximately $1 billion lower than prior expectations as higher net income was offset by Q4 working capital fluctuations. Now, turning to our business units. CCG delivered record annual revenue, its sixth straight year of revenue growth, up 1% year over year and up 6% when excluding the modem and connected home divestitures. For the quarter, revenue was $10.1 billion, up 5% sequentially on strong commercial demand.
Platform ASPs were up 15% year over year on a richer mix, driven by strong demand for our highest-performing platforms and industrywide constraints leading our customers to prioritize limited components to higher-end systems. Operating profit was down 3% year over year on increased spending to further strengthen our product and platform road map. The Data Center Group delivered a record $7.3 billion in revenue for Q4, up 12% sequentially and up 20% year over year on strong enterprise and government demand. Full-year revenue was down 1% due to a slower-than-expected recovery earlier in the year, as well as competitive pressure, partially offset by stronger enterprise and government and communications service provider demand.
Platform ASPs were up 3% sequentially and 4% year over year on improved mix to our highest-performing products. Operating profit in Q4 was down 17% year over year primarily due to the previously disclosed Intel federal-related one-time charge and 10-nanometer product ramp. Full-year operating profit was down due to lower revenue, with an increased mix of 10-nanometer products, Intel 4 start-up charges, and increased investment in our product road map. IOTG achieved record Q4 and full-year revenue.
Q4 revenue was $1.1 billion, up 36% year over year on broad-based strength, led by the industrial and retail segments. Full-year revenue was $4 billion, up 33% year over year as the business saw a strong recovery from COVID-related impacts. Operating profit for the year was $1 billion, up 110% year over year. PSG delivered $484 million in Q4 revenue, up 15% year over year and up slightly quarter over quarter as industrywide supply constraints continue to severely limit revenue growth.
Full-year revenue was $1.9 billion, up 4% year over year. Operating profit was $51 million, up 19% year over year. If not for the external supply constraints, we believe the PSG business would have delivered over $500 million in additional revenue in 2021. Mobileye reported Q4 revenue of $356 million and $1.4 billion for full year, up 43% year over year.
Full-year operating profit was $460 million, up 91% year over year. Before moving on to Q1 guidance, I want to briefly discuss changes to our non-GAAP reporting beginning in 2022 that we touched on in our Q3 earnings. First, in an effort to more closely align with our semiconductor peers and allow for more consistent comparability between periods, we'll be removing stock-based compensation and all gains and losses related to our ICAP portfolio from our non-GAAP results. Despite this change, we'll continue to closely evaluate stock-based compensation to ensure we're in line with industry benchmarks and optimize ICAP investments to advance our strategy and maximize ROI.
Second, we're modifying our segment reporting to align with our revised organizational structure and business strategy. Moving forward, we will report results under the following business units: Client Computing, which includes our historical CCG business plus workstation revenue; Data Center and Artificial Intelligence, which includes our data center CPU products plus our PSG business; Networking and Edge, which includes our IOTG business plus our networking-focused products previously included in DCG; Accelerated Computing and Graphics, which includes all discrete graphics products; Mobileye, which is unchanged from our prior segmentation; and Intel Foundry Services, which includes revenue from our wafer and packaging offerings. This new reporting structure enables transparent accountability relative to how well we are managing and executing against the six business units that will be further communicated at Investor Day in February. Moving to our Q1 outlook.
We continue to see strong demand across all our businesses, and note that Q1 includes the impact of an additional 14th week. We expect results to be tempered by continued industrywide component constraints, normal seasonality, and PC notebook inventory burn as OEMs work through inventory imbalances created by ecosystem constraints that have limited their ability to ship systems in certain segments. We expect Q1 revenue of $18.3 billion, down 1% year over year but up 2% when adjusting for an approximately $600 million one-time corporate revenue item recognized in Q1 '21. As we signaled in our Q3 call, gross margin will be impacted by our 10-nanometer product ramp and increased process technology investment.
The aforementioned one-time corporate revenue item in Q1 '21 will also impact the year-on-year compare. We are forecasting gross margin of 52%, EPS of approximately $0.80, and a tax rate of approximately 15%. Note that we will provide full year 2022 guidance and more details on our long-term financial model as part of our Investor Day on February 17. We hope to see you there in person for a full day of presentations and Q&A sessions with our most senior leaders.
Finally, I want to thank George for his three years at Intel, delivering outstanding results and making many of the changes necessary to begin our transition to a growth company. And now let me hand it off to George to say a few words.
George Davis -- Prior Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Dave. I want to close my finalearnings callwith sincere thanks to our Intel employees who amaze me every day and for the privilege to have served as your CFO. And I could not be more delighted that Dave is taking over, knowing all the incredible strengths he brings to the role. Thanks all.
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, George. With that, let me turn the call back over to Tony to get to your questions.
Tony Balow -- Vice President, Investor Relations
All right. Thank you, Dave. Moving on now to the Q&A. As is our normal practice, we would ask that each participant ask only one question.
Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first caller.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the results, and thanks for letting me ask the question. Pat, it's great to see a second quarter of year-over-year growth in DCG and an acceleration over the calendar third quarter.
But if you look underneath the covers, there's sort of two stories at play. Enterprises coming back extremely strong. But if you look at the cloud part of the business, I think this is the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines. And so, I guess there's two parts to my question.
One, when do you see a return to year-over-year growth in cloud? And two, to the extent that the investment community has a bias that everything eventually ends up in the cloud, what is kind of your long-term view of the sustainability of this enterprise demand?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Hey, thanks, John, and thanks for the comments on a great finish to a great year. So, as we look at the DCG business, we just say we started out behind early in the year digestion. And we've sort of been catching up and building momentum in the cloud piece of that business all year long.
And we do see that momentum carrying into next year. So, that creates some of the year-on-year quarterly compares that you described. E&G, really a tremendous second half and a really strong Q4 for that business where we have higher market share and have seen just a great environment. what we're hearing from our customers is that the momentum in E&G continues in the next year with very strong backlog positions, and it would have been even stronger had it not been for other supply constraints and match sets that we see.
And as you may have heard me talk about before, we don't see everything going to the cloud. We see this balance of on-prem and cloud-based delivery. And cloud continues to grow faster than on-prem, but workloads continue to grow on-prem. Also, we expect to see an acceleration of edge-based -- and I spoke about this at our innovation conference, where the big story as we get out to two or three years from now is going to be accelerating edge growth.
And that's an area that Intel has a very strong position in the edge, very high market share, leadership platforms in 5G in inference and AI. So, overall, we expect to see it very balanced across our portfolio. We do see strength to see growth in our cloud business next year, continued sustainability of E&G. But the real story over the next couple of years we see as explosive edge growth.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question, and congrats on the strong end of the year. And thank you to George, and congrats to Dave. So, with all that out of the way, Pat, I want to talk about the PC market.
I know you've been one of the more optimistic folks on that. And the fourth-quarter results showed a little bit of evidence as to why you're optimistic. But you also talked about some interesting inventory dynamics in there, where channel inventory was rising. Can you talk a little bit about your expectations for this year? Again, not front-running the Analyst Day too much, but the expectations for growth for the year and a little bit more on how you reconcile inventory rising with shortages still persisting?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thank you. And 2021 was really good, if not great year, for the PC. And I think most of the forecasts now are coming in estimating about 15% growth last year.
As we're seeing IDC Canalys modest growth in the market next year. So, as you've heard me -- and I think this matches exactly what Sacha said yesterday -- we'll just say a structurally larger market for us for next year and a couple of percent growth in that. So, we see that we will be able to have continued growth in our client business. And obviously, with a stronger and stronger product line, we see ourselves in a very good position for our client market share.
Now, the inventory position is one where we have just been at historically low inventories for an extended period of time, just racing to catch up with demand. And so, we would say that some of this is just getting to inventory levels that are even approaching what we consider normal for a business of this size and one that's managing these still significant supply constraints at different areas, power controllers, display led controllers, other aspects of substrates and different component pieces. So, a lot of these challenges have really led to, I'll just say, supply issues throughout the customer base. So, as we go to next year, we hope to see some of those starting to moderate and turn to a more normal behavior in the industry, in particular, the channel inventory levels, the ones that were essentially zero, right, for almost all of the year.
And now we're starting to see just a little bit of build back in that area, which particularly, for our channel and distribution partners, sort of for the first time, giving them something to sell for the whole year. So, a lot of response positively there. Overall, we still see that the PC is now becoming this essential part in increasingly work from home, learn from home environment, Windows 11, a strong upgrade cycle being introduced by that. So, a lot of good tailwinds and a great product line.
It's going to be a great year for us in the client space.
Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Thanks, Pat.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the capital spending a little bit. And again, I don't want to tread on material you're going to cover at the Analyst Day.
But the footprint in Ohio, the various comments that you've made about not being able to foresee having too much capacity in the next couple of years, as you think about that, how much of that is your existing x86 business versus foundry and other opportunities? And any sense for the capital spending you felt through this year, how much of that is going to be buildings versus equipment?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Joe. And I'll kick it off and ask Dave to comment as well. Overall, we would just say that supply constraints, we just have a lot of catching up to do in building out the capital footprint.
And some of that is catching up. Some of that's building for the new process technologies are five of those in four years. But it also is leveraging the smart cap strategy that we've laid out, where, boy, I lost for having a free shell today that we could be ramping into. We simply have to build some more shell capacity.
And then we'll be determining where is the best use and how to fill that as we start to build out those shelves. Everything that we've described, our Arizona build-out, our Ohio build-out, we do expect that that will be satisfying both our internal products, as well as creating capacity corridors for our foundry business as well. At Analyst Day, we'll be shaping that with more clarity. And Dave will be giving updates on a number of the capital aspects at the foundry -- for foundry, as well as for internal capacity there.
So, Dave, what else might you add?
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. First of all, thanks, Pat. And I just did want to say thanks for joining the call, and I'm really happy to be part of Intel. We have an exciting opportunity in front of us, and I couldn't be more excited to be a part of IDM 2.0.
I think there's a lot of opportunity to create a lot of shareholder value. In fact, one of the areas we're doing that right now is increasing the dividend 5%. So, it's great to my first quarter to have --
Joseph Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Dividend raise.
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. On the capex -- on the capex front, Joe, obviously, as Pat mentioned, we'll give you a lot more granularity in terms of '22 and beyond in terms of capex. But if you look back at the 2021 capex split, it was roughly 60% equipment, 40% space build-out. So, that's at least the ratio last year.
Of course, it might evolve over time, but it gives you kind of a rough magnitude of the numbers.
Joseph Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Stacy Rasgon -- Bernstein Research -- Analyst
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to dig into your inventory comments again. So, I know you're talking -- you're saying you're building inventories, but your PC volumes were down 18% year over year.
The PC market wasn't down 18% year over year. So, it doesn't feel like you're building inventory. If anything, it feels like inventory is bleeding out. So, for your parts only.
So, how do we square that circle? What's going on there?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
You want to address that, Dave or George?
George Davis -- Prior Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Maybe I'll just comment a little bit on it. When we do a year-over-year comparison, obviously, Q4 of last year was a huge quarter for CCG, particularly with the consumer and entry SKUs. And so, what we've seen really starting with the second half, in particular, for 2021 is a rotation out of the consumer and entry area into the -- what we call our big core notebooks and our desktop, which desktop had really dropped off.
And now we're seeing kind of a strong recovery there. So, if we think a little bit about the growth of CCG year over year, we certainly look to be growing lower than the TAM. But if you take into account the fact that we -- you look at our exit of modem and our exit of Home Gateway and the impact that that had on a year-over-year comparison, that's about 6 points of growth. And then the customer's decision to go vertical on -- a large customer decided to go vertical, that's about another 6 points.
So, the overall growth, the pattern is a little different because of the mix year over year. But the growth relative to the TAM, when you take into account these changes, is much more in line with the overall growth of the industry.
Stacy Rasgon -- Bernstein Research -- Analyst
OK. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, on Intel foundry services, it appears that the team is off to a good start.
It looks like a lot of good early engagements. If I'm a potential IFS customer and I start my design today, realistically, right, I'm not expecting my chip design to be ready for manufacturing conservatively for at least two years because that's just how long the design cycle times are for these leading-edge chips. And it seems consistent with your prior commentary on IFS customers more focused on your 20 and 18A nodes, which is kind of 2024, 2025 time frame. So, if I think about the real big capex outlay to support IFS, my assumption is that it's probably not until 2024 or maybe even 2025 time frame.
Is that kind of the right way to think about it that most of the capex spend for IFS is probably two to three years delay and more of the capex spend over the next two, three years is to support growth of the core compute businesses?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Your comments sort of dimensionalize it almost right. The key thing, to augment what you said, is that to be able to put the capital in place in '24, '25, you have to be building the shells in '22, '23. So, that's what we've -- and why, for instance, the Ohio announcement, we said, hey, we are building shells so that we can fill it with our products and with foundry customers as well.
But clearly, when we get to Intel 3, as well as Intel 18A ramps for foundry customers, those capital investments, most of that being back-end-loaded, right, when you're putting equipment in place, really ramp up in '24 and '25. But we've got to start building the shell capacity for those in '22 and '23. Your other comments, we do expect some of the Intel 16 customers that some of those products will start ramping next year. So, we do expect some of those design starts that are already underway today to start giving us some revenues for our foundry offerings on Intel 16 in '23.
We would expect Intel 3 to start contributing in '24 and Intel 18A in '25 and beyond. So, it's sort of that nice ramp. But we've also said, ""Hey, we already have packaging customers, and those revenues have already started in Q4 of this year. And obviously, some of the services, some of these are paid for services as well.
So, those will start contributing even before then. But overall, the world wants more capacity. The world is looking for leading-edge foundry capabilities. We've seen very strong interest from many different sectors.
And I'll just say, across whether it's leading-edge, high-performance computing, mobile customers, industrial customers, and clearly, automotive customers, a very broad swath of customers who are interested in the Intel foundry services and great momentum that we're seeing.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question, and thank you to George, and welcome to Dave. I actually had a near- and longer-term question on gross margins. So, in the near term, I'm wondering, the 52%, how does this kind of evolve through the year? I know you're not trying to give a specific number right now. But what are the puts and takes and kind of the key drivers? Is this the floor or ceiling or kind of the average level that we should be thinking about? And then longer-term impact, how do we reconcile that your main competitor who is kind of just fabless is pretty much at the same gross margins without having to spend any of the capex that Intel plans to spend? When can Intel start using the pricing power in the markets where you have very large incumbency? Thank you.
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
OK. Let me start, and Pat can certainly provide us color around pricing. So, you're right that we are going to provide a lot more details around the year at the Investor Day and give you actually some perspective over the longer term. But I think I can help you think through a little bit about the trend based on the following commentary.
So, in our third-quarterearnings callthat Pat and George were representing Intel, we said that we had to make investments, both in terms of newer process technologies and the start-up costs associated with that and we needed to ramp 10-nanometer. And that was going to put pressure on gross margins. And they create -- they presented a range of somewhere between 51% and 53% was the gross margin level that we would need to operate at while we were getting ourselves caught up from a technology perspective. So, we're in that range for their guidance, the 52%.
And we feel very good about 51% to 53% range for the year. So that's -- so when you look at this number, it can bounce around a little bit. But the 51% to 53% range we've given, we feel real confidence around for the time being. Now after that, as we get back to a leadership position in terms of technology and in terms of products, of course, there's absolutely opportunity to improve upon that.
And we will, I think, provide you good evidence of that at the Investor Day in February. So, that should give you some incentive to come.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
And a couple of comments on the longer-term margin picture. As we said, leadership products, when we get to process leadership, right, and the nice cadence for those process technologies, those will become nicely accelerants. And we said that we will see our margins recover in the latter part of the five-year window that we gave guidance on our lastearnings call So, we do see those as contributors, and we'll see our margins rise over time as a result.
Additionally, we do expect our long-term margins to be a composite of our foundry business, which will be on the lower end of the margin range that we'll operate the company in and combining that with the higher end of our leadership products as those occur. So, we'll be giving a better characterization of that at the -- at our investor meeting as well. Further, we'd say, over time, we think we have a structurally superior margin model for our business where I think everybody is seeing acute inflation and foundry costs and others in the industry where our factory network will give us a lot more opportunities to create a more balanced cost structure that others in the industry will not be able to accomplish. So, overall, we see great margin outlook, great cash flow, and free cash flow opportunities over the horizon, and we'll characterize those much more carefully as part of our investor meeting.
But we see the advantages of our business model over anybody else in the industry to be quite substantial for supply, for margin creation, for cash flow generation. And all of these will come together in a very powerful way.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi. Your line is open.
Chris Danely -- Citi -- Analyst
Hey, thanks, guys. So, you're spinning out Mobileye to maximize shareholder value, which I think everybody likes. Have you given any thought or is there any possibility of spinning out Altera to maximize shareholder value as well?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thank you for the question. The Mobileye spinout, things are progressing smoothly. We'll give updates on that as appropriate as we go out over time.
And as we said, it will be a partial spin, so we still see continuing and substantive value creation for Mobileye having a high relationship with Intel. So, we'll be updating on that as things progress there. I won't say that's the last one that we'll consider for such moves. We see this as a formula for value creation that may have other areas that could benefit from such approaches from the Intel family as we look to the future.
And we said this is a model for value creation that we think is a powerful one and one that we'll be exercising in the industry, but we have no other specifics to talk about at this time. But keep showing up, we're going to have lots of good things to talk about.
Chris Danely -- Citi -- Analyst

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Thanks a lot. Pat, I had a question about how you think about DCG and your server share. And obviously, Sapphire Rapids is going to be a lot more competitive. But Gen was also going to be ramping kind of right on top of it.
Is there kind of a line in the sand that you think of that you won't let share go below x percentage? Can you just talk big picture about how you think about market share in server? Is there a threshold over which you'd use price to get more competitive? Thanks.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thank you. And overall, we do see that the product line is getting more competitive. Sapphire Rapids will be a stronger product.
But we're already seeing that the product line is getting more competitive with Ice Lake. And our Q4 numbers on Ice Lake were very good. And we see the Q4 equaled all of the shipments of the first three quarters of the year. So, Ice Lake is an improvement.
Sapphire Rapids gets better. We do expect that there's going to be a bit of to and fro with the competitive alternatives where they'll deliver a product, we'll deliver the next product. And as you've heard me say, we are on a path to sustained unquestioned leadership into this area. It's going to take us a few generations until we're unquestionably in a leadership position, but we believe our product teams, our packaging teams, and our process technologies, our factory capacity, all of these give us the tools to create leadership products.
And then we combine that with our platform leadership and our software technologies, we have a path to unquestioned leadership over time. Obviously, we believe we're going to have a superior cost structure, as we've already touched on, given that many of our server products come from our factories. So, we're going to be in a better margin and cost position, and capacity. We think we have a lot of tools to address market share over time.
And we're going to dimensionalize the business a bit more as part of our Analyst Day coming up.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is open.
Matt Ramsay -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Just following up on the Data Center Group. The revenue very strong, but the operating margin, I think, was down 10 points year over year.
And I wanted to dig into that a little bit. The slides and the release mentioned an Intel federal charge, if you guys could quantify that. But the bigger part of the question is now with the Ice Lake ramp, there's a lot more volume in DCG that's going on to the 10-nanometer node. And my question, Pat, is do we need to evolve the product set to where we get to Granite Rapids, and we get off of 10-nanometer before we see margin improvement in DCG? Or is there going to Sapphire Rapids in a tiled approach with smaller tiles while still on 10? Is that enough for the margins to recover? Thanks.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Do you want to start that, Dave?
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I'll start. Yes. So, I mean, just in the strict walk of the operating margins of the DCG business. So, it's -- some of the things I talked about in terms of the aggregate story around gross margins, there's the ramp of 10-nanometer for the data center space.
There's higher start-up costs associated with new process technologies, so that's certainly driving it. We also had a one-time charge in our E&G business for a federal charge that also negatively impacted the operating margins. And then lastly, as we talked about, we are continuing to ramp up our investment in terms of product technology in R&D. And so, we had some increased opex investment that also drove it.
But all of this is kind of executing to the plan that Pat laid out a quarter or so ago. And so, this is all part of where we wanted to be at this point to drive the future of the company.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And I'd say, over time, we absolutely expect that we're going to improve the operating margin of this business again. And we haven't ramped the new node for five years in our data center business. And that's something that -- it's an embarrassing thing to say on the one hand.
And obviously, as a result, we've been in an area that we shouldn't have had operating margins that high in this business. It's just been that we've been running on very mature nodes well past the time that a normal cycle should be. And now we're aggressively ramping 10. We're also starting to ramp the cost of 7 and 4 as well.
So, all of these taken together, I think you're seeing a very unusual period in the gross margins and operating margins of this business. We fully expect that this is a very healthy business for us long term. And as we're going through the cycle of new process technologies, investments in the business, nothing here is surprising to us. And you can expect that over the long term this is a great business for Intel as we ramp leadership process technologies with unquestioned leadership products, we're going to do well here.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko. Your line is open.
Srini Pajjuri -- SMBC Nikko Securities -- Analyst
Thank you. Dave, a question on gross margins, actually, a clarification. If I take your, I guess, the fourth-quarter result, 55%, and then add back the federal charge, and then you're guiding to 52% for Q1, that's roughly 5 to 6 points of drop. So, I'm just wondering what are some of the puts and takes that impacting, if there are any? I mean, I see the headwinds that you talked about, but I'm wondering if there are any tailwinds or mix-related impacts as well.
Thank you.
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes, sure. So, definitely, the federal charge not repeating itself in the first quarter is certainly helpful. And there are a couple of mix benefits that we're seeing. But the charges associated with ramping 10-nanometer, particularly in the data center space, and the start-up costs on Intel 4 are predominantly what's driving the reduced gross margins.
But again, it's exactly where we thought we would be in the first fiscal quarter. I mean, this is the number that we were planning to drive the business to. And ultimately, the ROI on all the investments we're making that drive headwinds in the gross margins for the first quarter will turn around and drive a very good ROI down the road.

Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is open.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Hi. Thank you. Pat, I just wanted to check in on the expansion plans that you have. How much of that is dependent on the Chips Act passing and also from other incentives? And I asked that because I was listening to your presentation, I guess, earlier in the week at the Ohio site.
And you did make a comment there urging attendees to make sure that they weigh into the standard they can to get the act passed. So, I just was wondering how much of that of the expansion plans are dependent on the act here, as well as in Europe, some government incentives. Thank you.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, thank you for that question. It's one I hoped would be raised in the call. So, thank you for that. And I'll just say overall, I mean, it was just a fabulous day in Ohio, right? The enthusiasm we've gotten.
And as I said at the event, we're -- we help put silicon into Silicon Valley. We established the Silicon Forest in Oregon, the Silicon Desert in Arizona, and now the Silicon Heartland. And the enthusiasm we've gotten from the leadership there, the governor, the congressional leaders, and being able for this farm kid from Pennsylvania to stand on stage in the White House and say now it's my pleasure to introduce the president of the United States of America, just surreal. So, just a fabulous day for Intel, our nation, and our industry.
Obviously, with the Chips Act going on the floor of the house, we're highly encouraged. And I spoke to Speaker Pelosi at length on this subject just yesterday as there you expect it will be debated on the floor next week. And hopefully, following what we expect will be passage in the house, a reconciliation process. So, I'd say everybody is now more optimistic on this coming across the line in the near future.
Now, obviously, I think we and others have viewed the passage of this as an accelerant for our investment plans. And as I've said very clearly, hey, we're going to build a site in Ohio. It could either be small or it could be big and fast. And with the passage of the Chips Act, it's going to be bigger, and we're going to build it out faster as a result.
And we think that's good for our company. Even more important, it's good for our nation as we rebuild a resilient, globally balanced supply chain. And the events of just yesterday, getting the bill on the House floor, I think, is a very, very good sign for all that will get us across the line. But even more so, right, we see acts in Europe that are gaining momentum as well in the EU Chips Act as well.
And we've been quite involved in that domain, and we hope to see our expansion plans accelerate in Europe as well. So, overall, all of these things will simply benefit the industry, but it certainly will accelerate our investment plans as it makes us more competitive globally to be for our products, but even more so for our foundry business as well. So, thank you for that question. And with that, let me -- again, I do want to say thank you to Dave joining us for the first time.
George, thank you again for your support, for the years that you've contributed in this critical period of the company. And I do want to remind you of the strategies. We're going to build the team, improve the execution. As we look back in 2021, we've made tremendous progress across all areas that we've laid out.
We still do have a lot of work to do, but we're focused, energized and momentum is building. And I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we continue on this amazing journey. And Investor Day is coming up. We're going to lay out the strategy.
We've got a lot to say. And this is a great business. We finished a great year. Thank you all for joining us today.

2022-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,5 Green Flags for ASML's Future,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-green-flags-for-asmls-future,,,"Last year, shares of the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) soared 63% as the global chip shortage highlighted the importance of its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems.
These massive systems, which only ASML produces, cost about $150 million each and are used to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. The world's top foundries -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Samsung, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) -- all use ASML's EUV systems to manufacture their smallest and densest chips.
ASML's monopolization of the EUV market, along with its dominance of the broader market for older lithography systems, made it a linchpin of the global semiconductor market and a top beneficiary of the global chip shortage. As a result, ASML's stock hit an all-time high of $895.93 a share last September -- which valued the company at 57 times forward earnings.

Unfortunately, that high multiple also left ASML exposed to rising inflation, which reduces the value of its future cash flows and earnings. The threat of higher interest rates, which need to kick in to tame inflation, also caused investors to rotate toward more conservative investments. Those headwinds caused ASML's stock price to drop nearly 30% from its all-time high.
But after that steep pullback, ASML's stock looks like a compelling investment again. Let's examine five green flags that suggest the stock will stabilize and continue to rise over the next few years.
1. ASML has robust revenue growth
ASML's revenue rose 33% to 18.6 billion euros ($21 billion) in 2021. That marked its strongest growth in four years.

The market's demand for lithography machines ebbs and flows, but ASML usually still grows through cyclical slowdowns.
For example, ASML's growth decelerated significantly in 2019 as the smartphone and memory chip markets stagnated. However, it offset that slowdown by selling lithography machines to other end markets.
ASML's business is cyclical, but its current growth cycle won't cool off until TSMC, Samsung, Intel, and other foundries install more of its systems to resolve the ongoing chip shortage. Last month, Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger predicted the shortage would last until at least 2023. Therefore, analysts still expect ASML's revenue to rise 19% in 2022 and 12% in 2023.
2. ASML has constantly expanding margins
ASML has plenty of pricing power in the high-end lithography market because it doesn't face any meaningful competitors.
It's too expensive for new companies to enter the market, and it's too technically difficult for chipmakers to develop their own EUV systems, a process that ASML has perfected over the past three decades. As a result, ASML's gross margins have consistently expanded -- except for a brief contraction during the slowdown in 2019 -- over the past five years.

ASML's gross margins have also expanded with each new system launch. It already sells its EUV systems, which generated 34% of its sales in 2021, at higher margins than its older systems.
It will also sell its newer high-NA EUV systems, which will be used to manufacture the world's smallest 3nm and 2nm chips from 2022 to 2025, at even higher margins. That's why analysts expect ASML's earnings per share to grow 22% in 2022 and increase another 17% in 2023.
4. ASML is confident about long-term forecasts
Last September, ASML set new long-term growth targets during its investor day presentation. It expects to generate 24 billion to 30 billion euros ($33.9 billion) in revenue in 2025.
That represents a big jump from its previous investor day target in 2018, when it told investors that it would generate just 15 billion to 24 billion euros ($27.1 billion) in annual revenue in 2025. It actually hit that range four years ahead of schedule with its 18.6 billion euros in revenue in 2021.
ASML expects to hit the low end of its new guidance even if the chip shortage ends and cyclical demand for new chips cools off. It expects to hit the high end of its guidance -- which implies its revenue will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.7% from 2021 to 2025 -- if the secular growth of the 5G, cloud, data center, automotive, and Internet of Things (IoT) markets sparks a prolonged ""super cycle"" of chip upgrades.
ASML also expects its gross margin to expand to 54%-56% in 2025. That's also significantly higher than its previous gross margin guidance of 50%.
5. The stock looks reasonably valued again
ASML's stock, like many other tech stocks, got a bit overheated last year. But after its recent pullback, it now trades at 35 times forward earnings.
That price-to-earnings ratio might still seem high relative to those of other blue-chip tech stocks, but ASML is also expected to generate double-digit revenue and earnings growth for the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, ASML's control of a crucial semiconductor technology, its impenetrable moat, its unmatched pricing power, and crystal-clear plans for the future all justify that slight premium. That's why I believe investors should start accumulating shares of ASML today even as other tech stocks stumble.

2022-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,US STOCKS-Wall Street firms 1% on boost from tech stocks,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-street-firms-1-on-boost-from-tech-stocks,,,"By Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Devik Jain
Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes opened higher on Thursday on a boost from tech-focused megacap firms a day after hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve weighed on markets.
Leading gains on the benchmark S&P 500 was a 18.4% surge in hard-disk maker Seagate Technology's shares STX.O followed by a 13.5% jump in digital workflow company ServiceNow Inc NOW.N. Both the companies reported better-than-expected quarterly results.
Netflix Inc NFLX.O jumped 7.0% as billionaire investor William Ackman amassed a new stake in the streaming service company worth more than $1 billion.
Apple AAPL.O, Microsoft MSFT.O and Alphabet GOOGL.O gained nearly 2% each, with the iPhone maker set to report results after markets close.
All the 11 major S&P sectors advanced in early trading, with technology .SPLRCT and energy .SPNY posting the sharpest percentage gains.
""We believe the biggest opportunity in markets right now is in dividend growth stocks that have strong balance sheets and cash flows, and can thrive in an environment no matter what the Fed does,"" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group.
The Fed indicated on Wednesday a rate hike in March and reaffirmed plans to end its bond purchases that month before launching a significant reduction in its asset holdings, with Chair Jerome Powell warningthat inflation and supply problems are more persistent than previously thought.
Traders priced in nearly five rate increases by December following the announcement, after fully pricing for four previously.
The S&P 500 hit a three-month low last week as fears over uncertainty around Fed policy tightening hit richly valued growth stocks. Festering geopolitical tensions in Ukraine between Russia and the West have also added to investor concerns.
The S&P 500 index fell in the previous session amid volatile trading, flirting with a correction for its third straight session.
The bellwether index would have to close 10% or more below its record closing high reached on Jan. 3 to confirm it entered correction territory. It ended the last session 9.3% below that level on Wednesday.
""As the market digests (Fed's comments) over the next couple of sessions, they may feel more comfort knowing that quantitative tightening is some ways off and the rate hikes were already known and priced in,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.
At 9:58 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJIwas up 482.60 points, or 1.41%, at 34,650.69, the S&P 500 .SPXwas up 63.50 points, or 1.46%, at 4,413.43, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXICwas up 170.15 points, or 1.26%, at 13,712.27.
Latest data showed the U.S. economy grew by 6.9% in the fourth quarter, far ahead of economists' expectations of 5.5% growth.
Meanwhile, the fourth-quarter earnings season is in full swing. Analysts expected earnings from S&P 500 companies to grow 24.4% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv, as of Wednesday.
Tesla Inc TSLA.O slipped 5.0% after warning that supply chain issues will last throughout 2022, while Intel Corp INTC.O fell 7.1% on a downbeat first-quarter earnings forecast also due to global supply chain problems.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3.90-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.04-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded 16 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 14 new highs and 84 new lows.

2022-01-26 00:00:00+00:00,"Bear Country: Tesla (TSLA), Intel (INTC) Beat but Sell Off",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bear-country%3A-tesla-tsla-intel-intc-beat-but-sell-off,,,"Today, in its statement following the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Fed kept interest rates unchanged at 0.00-0.25%. This comes as no surprise, as the final installments of the taper program, buying fewer and fewer Treasury bonds and mortgage securities, is scheduled to end in March. In a separate note, the Fed also plans to reduce its $9 trillion balance sheet, but not until after interest rate moves have begun.

This is all as expected on Wall Street: markets have been busy over the past few weeks pricing in no fewer than four interest rate hikes in 2022, roughly one every other FOMC meeting. Even still, stocks rolled off session highs not 20 minutes past the Fed statement release. And markets continued to creep lower during Fed Chair Jay Powell’s press conference which followed the FOMC statements, as the 10-year Treasury yield nudged first over 1.8%, pushing toward 1.86% by the time Powell was finished taking questions.

Substantively, there wasn’t anything different emphasized this time around: inflation continues “well above 2%,” with residual supply/demand imbalances from the ongoing pandemic largely responsible; the Unemployment Rate has fallen sharply, with labor demand historically strong, and participation “subdued” by an aging population. Powell said interest rate policy will require “humility” and being “nimble.”

Powell also did not add any reassurances regarding whether this now-near-certain March rate hike will constitute a quarter-point or half-point rise, citing the FOMC will make that decision during its March meeting. In short, he left the door open for increased hawkishness, and this would no doubt be contingent on inflation reads from economic prints over the next six weeks until the next meeting. There is also no suggestion from the Fed Chair that “only” four rate hikes may be in the works for 2022.

Regardless whether the Fed should or should not be more hawkish in its monetary policy going forward, it might be said Powell let slip through his fingers a chance to assure market participants that there will be no reckless advancement of leaping rate hikes and balance-sheet draining. Powell has proven over time to be attuned to economic concerns but perhaps slow to react; in the interest of quashing this narrative about his Fed leadership, it appears he is fine with investors believing he will move higher and faster than earlier anticipated. Markets went from the green to the red by the time of the closing bell.

Tesla TSLA shares fell -5% immediately after its Q4 earnings report hit the tape after the closing bell, even as the EV leader outpaced expectations on both top and bottom lines: earnings of $2.54 per share easily beat the $2.11 Zacks consensus, while $17.72 billion in quarterly sales swept past the $16.07 billion analysts were looking for. Shares have buoyed up a tad ahead of today’s conference call. After a rough patch in its earnings history a couple years ago, Tesla has beaten expectations in nine of the last 10 quarters.

Intel INTC also dropped on its easy Q4 beats this afternoon, with earnings of $1.09 per share on $19.5 billion in revenues well ahead of the 90 cents per share and $18.3 billion analysts were expecting. Guidance for next-quarter earnings was 80 cents per share, which is below the 84 cents in the Zacks consensus. This may go some ways to explain how Intel hasn’t posted an earnings miss since Q3 2013.

Markets were down across the board, save the Nasdaq, which was basically flat. It’s bear territory this winter, and even Fed policy projections aren’t able to put them back into hibernation at this stage. The Nasdaq is -17% from its all-time highs set in November of last year. The S&P 500 is -10% off its most recent highs. The small-cap Russell 2000 has given away all its 2021 gains, and then some.

During a test by Macworld of its newly launched Alder Lake Core i9 has peaked higher in a comparative benchmark. Used in a powerful MSI GE76 Raider laptop, the chip has outperformed M1 Max silicon in a Geekbench review. In the multi-core CPU test, Intel came up trumps by 5% and in the single-core test, Alder Lake was 3.5% better than its Apple counterpart. The differences, although very minute, makes Intel the winner in the races however, the publication was also brought forward a few of the glaring caveats of Intel's silicon.
In the OpenCL benchmark test, a test for the graphics, Alder Lake or Core i9-12900HK took the blow when running its own Iris Xe GPU as M1 Max outperformed its rival by 183%, a clear difference between Apple's 32-core GPU against Intel's 16-core.
While testing for its 3D modeling and multi-threaded tests on CineBench R23, the Intel silicon posted a decent 29% improvement on Apple's M1 Pro but experts believe that Apple's M1 Max would've faired much better in this segment as well.
However, the usage of the high-power chipset has resulted in its own drawbacks. The chip uses a lot of power, which drops the video playback time to a mere 7 hours, one-third of Apple's M series semiconductors.
Along with that, the article also made it clear that the M1 chipset is also more refined, more efficient, and more economic compared to Intel and doesn't require a high-end system to perform.
Despite the final verdicts, Intel's prowess in building semiconductors is expected to revive to some extent in the future renditions of the chipset.

2022-01-26 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) Beats Q4 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-beats-q4-earnings-and-revenue-estimates,,,"Intel (INTC) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.09 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.90 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.52 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 21.11%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this world's largest chipmaker would post earnings of $1.11 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.71, delivering a surprise of 54.05%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.
Intel, which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, posted revenues of $19.53 billion for the quarter ended December 2021, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.70%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $19.98 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Intel shares have lost about 1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -8.6%.
What's Next for Intel?
While Intel has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Intel: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.84 on $17.55 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.66 on $73.56 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor - General is currently in the top 32% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
Amtech Systems (ASYS), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2021.
This provider of equipment for solar panel and semiconductor makers is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.05 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
Amtech Systems' revenues are expected to be $22 million, up 22.4% from the year-ago quarter.

Over the long term, driven by strong demand for its chips from data centers and companies incorporating artificial intelligence, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock will almost certainly outperform the Nasdaq exchange and the S&P 500. In the short term and the medium term, however, there are multiple indications that NVDA stock is poised to be badly damaged by the bursting of the crypto bubble.
NVDA) logo on a microchip"" width=""300"" height=""169"">

In previous columns about Nvidia, I’ve warned that its stock performance could be derailed by a crypto plunge. But recent developments have made me much more certain that cryptos are poised to tumble soon and that the retreat is likely to lower Nvidia’s stock price by a sizeable amount.
What’s more, even if cryptos don’t sink tremendously, new developments have left Nvidia’s revenue from crypto miners poised to tumble.
The Bursting of the Crypto Bubble
Defying the forecasts of crypto bulls, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other prominent crypto names have plunged in recent weeks. In the last three months, Bitcoin itself has tumbled 37%, Ethereum (ETH-USD) has given back 38%, and Cardano (ADA-USD) has slumped 49%. And while I understand that there are many thousands of other cryptocurrencies, some of which have been rallying recently, I doubt whether the jumps of those flash-in-the-pan names will be sustained as the general macro environment for cryptos becomes more bearish.
7 Hot Stocks Poised to Get Even Hotter in Q1
Macro trends are becoming more difficult for cryptos for two reasons. One is that U.S. government stimulus is rapidly fading, while the Federal Reserve is about to tremendously pull back its own accommodations and has already begun the process of doing so. The recent, sharp pullback of the top cryptos in the wake of the stimulus cuts and the inflation surge has left me even more convinced that government stimulus, rather than inflation or concerns about traditional currencies is the primary factor that determines crypto prices.
And the other macro factor that will make the environment more difficult for cryptos is increased government regulation. In the U.S., Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler wants to regulate crypto exchanges this year, while the IRS is also cracking down on cryptos.
And ominously for Nvidia and NVDA stock, the Russian central bank recently urged the country’s government to ban crypto mining. That’s problematic for Nvidia because “Russia is the world’s third-largest player in bitcoin mining, behind the United States and Kazakhstan,” according to CNBC.
Moreover, Kazakhstan’s government could impose new regulations on crypto after mass protests there. Saying the quiet part out loud, Russia’s central bank complained that cryptos hurt its ability to control monetary policy.
I’ve long warned that governments will vehemently oppose cryptos for that reason, and the statement by the Russian central bank validates my thesis. Consequently, I believe that we’ve just seen the tip of the iceberg when it comes to government regulation and stifling of cryptos.
NVDA Stock and Crypto Mining
In an intriguing column, published on Dec. 27, Seeking Alpha contributor EnerTuition explained that the demand for gaming graphics cards by crypto miners has greatly pushed up the average selling prices of Nvidia’s graphics cards. In fact, EnerTuition says that in some cases, the prices of Nvidia’s chips have doubled in less than 18 months, and they blame the increase on crypto miners.
So if crypto prices plunge and crypto miners consequentially stop buying Nvidia’s gaming cards, Nvidia’s overall gaming revenue will probably tumble. And since the revenue of Nvidia’s gaming business came in at $2.94 billion in the third quarter, out of its total Q3 revenue of $7.1 billion, such a plunge would indeed be a big deal for NVDA stock.
Meanwhile, even if cryptos don’t plunge, Nvidia’s sales from crypto miners could be about to tumble. That’s because of a few factors, including the possibility of Russia banning mining and Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) entrance into the gaming card market this quarter. Additionally, the Seeking Alpha contributor points out, Ethereum’s likely imminent switch to a proof-of-stake model will meaningfully undermine demand for Nvidia’s gaming cards.
Nvidia’s revenue from crypto miners looks poised to tumble, meaningfully lowering the company’s top and bottom lines. At that point, investors will probably be able to buy the shares at a much lower price, so it makes sense to wait for awhile longer before hitting the buy button on the shares.

2022-01-26 00:00:00+00:00,"1 Green Flag for AMD in 2022, and 1 Red Flag",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-green-flag-for-amd-in-2022-and-1-red-flag,,,"Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) stock price has declined nearly 20% this year as rising interest rates have caused investors to cash out of higher-growth tech stocks. AMD also faces concerns about slower PC sales in a post-lockdown market, as well as tougher competition from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in CPUs and GPUs, respectively.
AMD is also still slogging through the ongoing chip shortage, which is causing traffic jams at its main manufacturing partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (TSMC), and facing unresolved regulatory challenges for its planned takeover of Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX).
Image source: AMD.
AMD remains a polarizing stock. The bulls believe it will remain ahead of Intel in the CPU race by relying on TSMC's smaller and denser chipmaking technologies, and that it will keep pace with Nvidia by selling cheaper GPUs that provide comparable performance. They also believe it will benefit from the secular growth of the data center, gaming console, and PC gaming markets. The bears believe that it's only a matter of time before Intel catches up to TSMC in the process race and Nvidia chips away at AMD's lower-end market.
AMD's long-term performance favors the bulls, but its short-term performance definitely supports the bears. That probably won't change anytime soon, but investors should focus on two recent developments -- a green flag and a red one -- that provide fresh support to both camps.
The green flag: China could approve the Xilinx deal soon
AMD agreed to buy Xilinx, one of the world's largest producers of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), for $35 billion in an all-stock deal in October 2020. At the time, AMD claimed it would close the deal by the end of 2021. But last month, it postponed the deal closing to the first quarter of 2022.
The deal has been approved in every market except for China. Buying Xilinx would make AMD much more competitive against Intel, which acquired Xilinx's top FPGA competitor Altera for $16.7 billion in 2015.
Unlike CPUs, which are programmed for specific markets, FPGAs can be reprogrammed after being manufactured, which means they can be customized for a much wider range of devices. In data centers, they can complement CPUs by accelerating certain processing tasks.
Therefore, AMD's purchase of Xilinx could complement its Epyc server chips and make it more competitive in the data center market against Intel. However, Xilinx and Intel already hold a near-duopoly in FPGA chips, and letting AMD purchase Xilinx would effectively split the FPGA market between the world's two largest suppliers of x86 CPUs for data centers.
However, AMD still only controls a low-single-digit share of the data center CPU market, according to PassMark Software, so the acquisition should be less controversial than Intel's purchase of Altera -- which was approved in China before the trade and tech wars escalated under the Trump administration.
That's why investors likely breathed a sigh of relief when Dealreporter claimed that China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) was finally getting ready to approve the deal. Investors should take that green flag with a grain of salt, but China's approval of the deal should remove a major roadblock for AMD's fledgling data center business.
The red flag: Piper Sandler downgrades AMD
Meanwhile, a bright red flag appeared when a prolific analyst suddenly downgraded AMD. On Jan. 20, Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar downgraded AMD from ""overweight"" to ""neutral"" while reducing his share price target from $140 to $130 -- which implies an upside potential of less than 10%.
Kumar attributed that downgrade to the potential slowdown of the PC market as fewer people worked from home, with the Xilinx acquisition throttling its near-term earnings growth and ""broader market dynamics"" (such as rising inflation and interest rates) capping the gains of pricier growth stocks.
Those concerns are valid, but I think they're overblown. HP's latest results indicated that robust commercial sales of PCs could offset declining sales of consumer PCs, and AMD previously said the Xilinx acquisition would be ""immediately accretive"" to its margins, cash flow, and earnings per share.
As for rising inflation and higher interest rates, I believe AMD will remain better-insulated from those macro headwinds than other high-growth tech companies because it's still firmly profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. In addition, AMD's stock isn't particularly expensive at 42 times forward earnings -- especially when analysts expect its earnings to more than double in 2021 and grow another 27% in 2022.
Does the good news outweigh the bad news?
I believe the long-awaited approval of the Xilinx deal matters a lot more to investors than Piper's downgrade of the stock. If AMD finally seals the Xilinx deal, it will easily outweigh Piper's near-term concerns about a temporary slowdown in PC sales, acquisition-related costs, and macro-related headwinds.

2022-01-26 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy for 2022: Intel or AMD?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy-for-2022%3A-intel-or-amd,,,"The world can't get enough semiconductors; these little chips make everything work, from cars to phones. Demand is so high that global semiconductor sales grew an estimated 26% from 2020 to 2021 and could stay in high demand. The Semiconductor Industry Association expects the global chip market to grow another 8% in 2022 to become a $600 billion industry.
Within the industry are two popular companies, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), that seem to be following different paths. Shares of Intel are down 10% over the past year, while AMD is up 20%. But which should investors buy in 2022? Both stocks make a solid case, but there can be only one winner.

Making a case for AMD
Intel is the largest semiconductor company globally by revenue and has always been somewhat of a ""big brother"" to AMD, which has had a fraction of Intel's sales at almost $15 billion over the trailing 12 months. AMD on the other hand is rapidly growing; analysts are calling for full-2021 revenue of $16.1 billion, a 65% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, Intel is expected to finish the year with $73.5 billion, 5% less than the prior year. AMD seems to have the growth momentum right now.

AMD's success could be a result of its focus on research and development. It spun off its manufacturing business a little over a decade ago and has focused on developing high-end chips used in PCs, data centers, and other applications that require a lot of computing power. It then outsources the actual manufacturing to other companies.
The semiconductor industry is a constant innovation race, and Intel has had issues bringing new generations of chips to market. It infamously delayed its 10nm chip technology repeatedly, giving competitors a chance to make up ground, and has delayed its next-generation 7nm technology to an expected 2022 launch. Yet, AMD brought its 7nm chip technology to market in late 2020. It has been free to take market share without Intel having an equivalent product on the market.
The company is also trying to acquire Xilinx for $35 billion in stock, which is pending and could close this year. Xilinx is a leading manufacturer of field-programmable gate arrays, integrated circuits that a customer or designer can configure after production. The deal would expand AMD's product portfolio, giving it another area to compete with Intel.
Making a case for Intel
Despite competition pressuring Intel, it remains the gorilla of the industry. Its estimated market share of the PC processor market is still a robust 75%, and its CPU chips are still in an estimated 77% of data centers. Yes, Intel's share has slipped over time, but it had such a stronghold on its markets that it remains a force in the industry.
New CEO Patrick Gelsinger took over in February 2021, and he has Intel on an ambitious turnaround plan to reinforce its presence in the semiconductor industry. Gelsinger's ""IDM 2.0"" vision has laid the groundwork for Intel's expansion of its manufacturing capacity. The company is investing $20 billion to build two new factories (called foundries or ""fabs"") in Arizona and another $20 billion to build two factories in Ohio. The goal is to make Intel a significant source of foundry capacity for the United States.
It's a massive gamble for any company to invest such a large sum of money, but few have Intel's deep pockets. It produces anywhere between $12 billion and $20 billion in free cash flow in a given year, so it can afford these large ventures.

Political forces could help Intel's investment pay off. Semiconductors have become a precious resource because of everything they are used for these days, including vehicles, consumer electronics, and military equipment. However, the world overwhelmingly relies on Asia for semiconductors through manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Intel's plans will take time to play out, and investors will see how it pays off over the years ahead, but having new domestic foundry capacity could bring more business to Intel.
And the winner is...
AMD and Intel offer two very different cases for owning their stock. AMD has the recent momentum, while Intel is an industry giant looking to get its groove back. The stocks also trade at wildly different valuations; AMD is nearly four times as expensive on a price-to-earnings basis, but that's arguably justified because of its growth. Analysts anticipate AMD growing earnings per share 46% per year over the next three to five years, versus just 8% for Intel.

I think Intel is an interesting investment idea over the long term; it's still a titan in the semiconductor industry, and its compressed valuation leaves a lot of room for upside if its foundry plans work out. However, AMD's strong fundamentals stand out, and the stock's recent pullback has allowed investors to buy shares at a more attractive price. For that reason, AMD seems like the better buy right now.

2022-01-26 00:00:00+00:00,Will TSMC's $40 Billion Spending Plan Wreck Intel's Turnaround?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-tsmcs-%2440-billion-spending-plan-wreck-intels-turnaround,,,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC, laid out an ambitious capital spending plan for 2022 in a bid to shore up its manufacturing capacity and meet the booming demand for chips.
TSMC has a capital expenditure (capex) budget of $40 billion to $44 billion for this year, which points toward a huge increase over its 2021 capital spending of $30 billion. What's more, TSMC's 2022 capital expenses are way higher than Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) estimated outlay of $25 billion to $28 billion for this year. This doesn't look like good news for Intel, as there was a massive spending gap between the two companies in 2021 as well, given Chipzilla's capital spending budget of $19 billion to $20 billion last year.
Let's look at the reasons why TSMC's aggressive 2022 plan could hurt Intel and throw a spanner in the latter's turnaround efforts.
Image source: Getty Images
TSMC is expected to spend big on advanced process nodes
TSMC pointed out in its fourth-quarter 2021 results that semiconductor wafers based on the 5-nanometer (nm) and 7nm processes accounted for half of its revenue. The 7nm wafers produced 27% of total wafer revenue, while the 5nm chips accounted for 23%. TSMC also added that wafers manufactured using advanced technologies (which include process nodes sized at 7nm and below) accounted for more than 50% of the company's total wafer revenue.
Not surprisingly, TSMC is expected to spend a huge chunk of its capex on these advanced processes this year. Tom's Hardware estimates that 70% to 80% of TSMC's planned 2022 capex will go toward the development of advanced processes, especially on 2nm and 3nm nodes following the company's heavy spending on developing the 5nm process last year.
This could accelerate TSMC's development of chips based on smaller process nodes, making it more difficult for Intel to fulfill its aim of regaining its technology lead from rivals by 2025. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in July last year that:
Building on Intel's unquestioned leadership in advanced packaging, we are accelerating our innovation roadmap to ensure we are on a clear path to process performance leadership by 2025.
However, TSMC's ambitious 2022 spending plan indicates that achieving process leadership will be easier said than done for Intel.
Intel's comeback may have become more difficult
Chipzilla has recently started gaining ground against the likes of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) thanks to its Intel 7 process, which is based on an enhanced version of the 10nm node. Intel 7 powers its Alder Lake client CPUs (central processing unit) and Sapphire Rapids data center CPUs. The Intel 7 process has helped the company close the gap with AMD's latest generation of Ryzen processors, which are based on a 7nm process from TSMC.
Intel's enhanced 10nm process reportedly has a slightly higher transistor density compared to TSMC's 7nm process, according to third-party reports. The higher density means that transistors on Intel's chips are packed more tightly compared to TSMC's offering, so they have more computing power and are more power-efficient.
That's because electrons need to travel a smaller distance in semiconductors manufactured using a smaller process node, which allows the chip to perform more calculations while generating less heat. So a chip based on a smaller process node can perform better, and that explains why Intel's latest Alder Lake processors have helped it snatch the gaming crown back from AMD. Furthermore, the smaller footprint saves manufacturing costs and consumes less silicon wafer material per chip.
Intel was expected to widen the technology gap with AMD next year with the launch of its Meteor Lake client CPUs and Granite Rapids data center chips in 2023. These chips will be based on the chip giant's Intel 4 process, which is a densely packed 7nm manufacturing node. Intel's 7nm manufacturing node is reportedly denser than TSMC's 5nm process, which means that the former packs more transistors.
But now that TSMC could scale up the deployment of its 3nm chips, which are expected to go into production late this year, Intel faces a tougher challenge. That's because TSMC customers such as AMD could reduce the time to market of more competitive chips that could scupper Intel's resurgence. With Intel's revenue expected to remain flat in 2022 over last year at an estimated $73.3 billion while earnings are expected to decline 30% to $3.69 per share, the chip giant cannot afford to slip up.
So there's a chance that TSMC's massive 2022 spending plan could have a negative impact on Intel and take the wind out of the semiconductor giant's sails at a crucial time, just as Chipzilla's turnaround was gaining momentum.

umors of Intel’s (INTC) death have been exaggerated. Not only is the chip giant alive and kicking, it is deploying it massive cash stockpile to regain its lead in chipmaking technology. The company on Friday announced a whopping $20 billion investment for a new manufacturing facility near Columbus, Ohio.
The company said, for that $20 billion, it will build at least two semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs, on the 1,000-acre site. Construction will begin this year and the plant should be operational by 2025. Intel also retains the option to scale up to 2,000 acres and to support eight fabrication plants. But will investors be patient enough to allow the company time to execute its strategy, especially at a time with rivals rivals AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) are striving in several important chip developments?
This is one of several questions investors will ask when Intel report fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings results after the closing bell Wednesday. While Intel has surpassed the Street’s revenue estimates in eleven straight quarters, weaknesses in the datacenter group and client computing group have pressured the stock. Shares of the chip giant have fallen 6% over the past six months, compared to 3% rise in the S&P 500 index. The stock is down about 11% over the past year, lagging the S&P 500’s 16% gain. Intel on Wednesday must prove the naysayers wrong, while selling the upside potential of its recent manufacturing plants.
For the quarter that ended December, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is expected to earn 90 cents per share on revenue of $18.32 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $1.52 per share on revenue of $19.98 billion. For the full year, earnings are expected to decline 0.37% year over year to $5.28 per share, while full-year revenue of $73.51 billion would decline about 5.6% year over year.
The expected year-over-year of 8.30% and 40% declines in revenue and profits, respectively, are a couple of reasons Intel wants to re-invent itself by investing in $20 billion in the manufacturing plants. This shouldn’t have been a surprise as Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has promised over the past several quarters that Intel would double down on its willingness to boost manufacturing capacity. ""Our expectation is that this becomes the largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet,"" Gelsinger told Time magazine on Friday. ""We helped to establish the Silicon Valley. Now we're going to do the Silicon Heartland.""
As have been the case, however, execution will be critical to the company’s success and the movement of the stock price. In the third quarter, the company reported adjusted EPS of $1.71 per share which not only beat estimates, it also represented a year-over-year rise of 58%. Intel benefited from gross profit margin which expanded by 130 basis points year over year to 57.8%. Q3 revenue was not impressive, coming in at $18.1 billion, or about 1% below consensus estimates. Struggles in the datacenter group and client computing group pressured revenue growth.
The Client Computing Group revenues declined 2% year over year and 4% sequentially. The company also guided for Q4 earnings to come in 11% lower than analysts' expectations. It wasn’t a surprise that the stock was subsequently punished. On Wednesday investors will want to see whether these areas show enough improvement to revive the stock. Intel will also need to adequately respond to questions about realistic expectations for its $20 billion investments in manufacturing capabilities.

Jan 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures jumped on Wednesday following two days of turbulent trading, helped by stellar results from Microsoft, while investors looked to the outcome of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting.
Microsoft Corp MSFT.O gained 3.9% premarket after the Windows maker forecast revenue for the current quarter broadly ahead of Wall Street targets, driven in part by its Intelligent Cloud unit.
Texas Instruments Inc TXN.O rose 4.6% after the chipmaker forecast upbeat current-quarter revenue and said it would sharpen its focus on chips used in the lucrative automotive and industrial sectors.
The strong outlook from both the companies lifted tech-related stocks with Meta Platforms FB.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Google-owner Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O, Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O rising between 2.1% and 3.7%.
The rate-sensitive tech and growth stocks have been roiled over fears of aggressive Fed action to combat inflation. Rising geopolitical tensions around Russia and Ukraine added to investors' woes, with the S&P 500 index .SPX flirting with a correction twice this week.
The policy decision is due at 2 p.m. ET (1900 GMT), where the U.S. central bank is likely to signal the start of an interest rate hike cycle beginning March.
The announcement will be followed by Fed chairman Jerome Powell's news conference, which will be parsed for clues on the magnitude and pace of hikes for the year and strategy for shrinking its roughly $9 trillion balance sheet.
Fed funds futures traders are pricing in a 25 basis point hike in March, in addition to three more rate increases by the end of the year.
""There is a greater chance we meet a confident, yet a comforting Fed,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.
""The Fed hasn't got anything to gain in sending out hawkish messages today: slaughtered equity markets won't help them to get the inflation situation straight.""
The benchmark index is now down nearly 9.2% from its record closing peak on Jan. 3, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC has fallen 13.5% so far this year.
At 6:51 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1were up 386 points, or 1.13%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1were up 67.5 points, or 1.55%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1were up 319.25 points, or 2.26%.
The fourth-quarter reporting season is in full stride, with 79 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 81% have delivered better-than-expected results, according to Refinitiv.
Tesla Inc TSLA.O added 4.3% ahead of its quarterly results after market close, while Boeing BA.N and Intel Corp INTC.O also climbed in the run-up to earnings later in the day.
AT&T Inc T.N rose 1.7% after it beat market estimates for quarterly revenue on strong wireless and streaming demand.
Shares of all major Wall Street lenders gained more than 1% each.

2022-01-26 00:00:00+00:00,Bull Of The Day: Taiwan Semi (TSM),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bull-of-the-day%3A-taiwan-semi-tsm,,,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, aka TSMC TSM, is the world's largest third-party chip fabricator, responsible for manufacturing most of the world's digital chips, and is a part of 85% of semiconductor innovations. Its cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities are unrivaled, working at an atomic level that no other fabricator can match (3nm transistors). Amid this global chip shortage, TSM is the best-positioned and safest way to play this impending 2022 chip rally.
The most trusted tech giants turn to the most reliable semiconductor foundry for manufacturing and innovative needs. TSMC's customers include companies like Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA, Broadcom AVGO, Qualcomm QCOM, and even Intel INTC, which has been unable to keep up with the innovative curve in chip fabrication, which TSMC continues to drive higher. 
TSMC exited 2021 with outstanding annual results that illustrated its ability to drive consistent secular growth in an industry previously known for its cyclicality. This chipmaking powerhouse has achieved an incredible compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.5% and 17.1% on its top and bottom-lines, respectively, since it went public in 1994.
Management is now forecasting that this reliable organic growth (between 15% and 20% CAGR) will continue through 2026. I still view these projections as conservative, considering the accelerating demand for advanced chip technology that the last 2-years of rapid digital adaptation have brought.
In its final 2021 quarterly report in mid-January, Taiwan Semi impressed the markets with December revenues that came in sizably above estimates, catalyzing a 20% rally in less than two weeks of trading. However, TSM shares haven't been immune to recent selling pressures, which have wiped out its fundamentally fueled post-earnings gains.
Now is the time to pull the buy trigger on TSM as analysts drive up estimates and price targets across the board, propelling this stock of the future into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
The Latest Report 
The world's largest semiconductor contractor released its 2021 year-ending earnings, and its stock proceeded to take flight with impressive growth fundamentals fueling its rally. TSM's low-beta shares drove up roughly 20% in less than 2 weeks, touching a fresh all-time high in its post-earnings price action on the highest daily volumes TSM has ever seen as institutions and r/WallStreetBets (WSB) flood into this next-gen champ.
TSMC continues to prove to the investing world that it is so much more than just a third-party chip fabricator, with proven boundless organic growth that never fails to impress analysts' swelling expectations.
TSMC is powering its cutting-edge innovative partners into the next generation of digital advancement. Its high volume 7-to-5 nanometer (nm) chip operations are exploding at an unmatchable pace, now making up 50% of revenues, forcing the world's leading chipmakers to utilize TSMC's unrivaled services to remain competitive.
In fact, the pioneer of advanced chipmaking, Intel INTC, who has fallen behind the innovative-curve in recent years, will be utilizing TSMC's newest 3nm facility in northern Taiwan. Intel's inability to keep up with Taiwan Semi's fabricating abilities signifies a massive tailwind for this global technological backbone and a systemic shift in the industry towards focused business models that leverage niche competitive advantages.
Decades of boundless and consistent growth and a tremendous pull-forward in digital adaptation have accelerated Taiwan Semi's growth trajectory. The best-positioned semiconductor companies are no longer the cyclically-natured commodity-like securities the market had become accustomed to, but secular growth narratives at the heart of this emerging digital renaissance of prolific technological advancement (aka, The 4th Industrial Revolution).
Taiwan Semi's record top and bottom-line fourth-quarter results reflected optimistically on the entire chip sector, and last night's blowout report from Texas Instruments TXN confirms the swelling demand for digital chips across industries. 
The Opportunity In Chips
Chipmakers have been experiencing the same valuation multiple compression that has plagued the broader tech sector since the year began. Investors are pulling profits from the massive rally that semis had seen since the pandemic lows ahead of the Fed's meeting. Soaring interest rates and inflation expectations have catalyzed recent selling pressure along with portfolio rotations out of the most risk-heavy equity sectors.
Many investors have hesitated to add tech back into portfolios, even at discounted levels. Still, there seems to be a common consensus that chip stocks are one of the growth segments worth moving on now. As a result, we see momentum reenter this technological backbone as investors rush to their favorite chip stocks. 
The global chip shortage has had rippling impacts on numerous sectors of the economy, forcing automakers to reduce manufacturing and even completely halt it in some cases. This is an excellent position to be in for chipmakers, where demand outpaces supply (price control). Capital is pouring into this space, and it looks like the demand is only going to grow in this prolifically digitalizing world.
Final Thoughts
TSM represents the best parts of the semiconductor industry (on a rolling basis) as its supports the fabrication of virtually all leading-edge chip innovators. Taiwan Semi has solidified its global positioning as the manufacturing backbone in this new economic era of burgeoning digital demand, no matter what happens within the competitive tech landscape.
TSM is trading at a forward P/E of 22x, which is the most discounted this stock has been since the trough of the pandemic sell-off of March 2022. With a 1.2% dividend yield, reliable cash flows, and a stronghold of a balance sheet (best credit rating in the industry), there is no reason to hesitate on starting a TSM position today. I'm looking at a 12-month price target between $150 and $175.
Good luck out there!
