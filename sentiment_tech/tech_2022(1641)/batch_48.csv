2022-02-11 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia: After the Arm Failure,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia%3A-after-the-arm-failure,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is not going to become a full big brother to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). It is also not going to be buying microprocessor designer ARM Holdings. NVDA stock is currently down 12% year-to-date (YTD).
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
I write it this way so investors will understand that, despite the market’s initial positive reaction to the news, this is a blow. When Nvidia announced the deal in September 2020, shares were trading around $131. The stock has fallen recently as investors anticipated the cancellation. The recent rise is what happens when you stop hitting yourself over the head.
Had the deal gone through, Nvidia would have led AMD in graphics by a country mile and become highly competitive in general microprocessors. Now, it just leads in graphics, but that is enough.
Graphics Are Where it is At
If you bought Nvidia long before the merger announcement, as I did, you’re still in the money. Graphics processors, originally developed for video machines, are at the heart of artificial intelligence (AI). They’re also at the heart of what is called the metaverse, powering a giant AI research supercomputer for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB).
Nvidia’s base business is doing great. It grew by over 50% in fiscal 2021, which ends in January. It is expected to grow even faster in fiscal 2022, which will be reported February 15. Analysts expect revenues of $7.4 billion for the quarter, putting the year’s total over $26 billion. It did just $16.7 billion in business last year.
More importantly, this is profitable growth. Net income last year grew right in line with revenue. Profits are still growing. It is important to note that they’re not growing as fast this year as last year, but margins are still about 26%.
But at the stock’s October peak, people were overpaying. Even now, with the stock opening at $259.16 today, you’re paying 77 times earnings, and 24 times revenue for Nvidia. There is such a thing as too high a price even for the best investments. I still like it, but when I say “look for your buy point”  I mean consider how long you want to hold it. If it is five years, jump in. If it is one month, maybe wait until after earnings.
The Next Steps for NVDA Stock
Nvidia might have fallen further if investors thought it would remain supply-constrained. But the chip shortage is ending. Its manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), is putting $44 billion into capital spending this year. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which is drawing big headlines and needs government help, is only spending $25 – 28 billion this year.
What this means for Nvidia is lower margins looking forward, but bigger sales, thus bigger profits. That is the way Moore’s Law is supposed to work. TSM and Intel are taking the hit from what I call “Moore’s Second Law,” the rising costs of complexity. Nvidia is not.
This also means big things for the tech market generally. It means there will be plenty of chips for new applications, like virtual reality (VR) headsets and haptic suits. There will be plenty of chips for cars and plenty for the metaverse everyone is talking about. Plenty for servers and plenty for clients.
The Bottom Line on NVDA Stock
Past chip cycles were demand-based. Business would slow down as supplies increased, while profits would increase when production slowed.
I think that today we are looking at the reverse. New application spaces open as chip supplies increase, increasing profits. It is when supplies are constrained, as they are now, that the bottom of the cycle is reached.
Mine is not the conventional wisdom. But I’ve been studying the effects of Moore’s Law for over 40 years now. As chip densities improve, change accelerates. It accelerates in every direction, touching software, communications, science, and opening new application spaces.
A lot of things are going to get better from here.

2022-02-11 00:00:00+00:00,Analysts Expect PWV To Hit $55,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-expect-pwv-to-hit-%2455,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Invesco Dynamic Large Cap Value ETF (Symbol: PWV), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $55.04 per unit.
With PWV trading at a recent price near $49.12 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.05% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PWV's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are HCA Healthcare Inc (Symbol: HCA), Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC), and Pfizer Inc (Symbol: PFE). Although HCA has traded at a recent price of $240.01/share, the average analyst target is 20.17% higher at $288.41/share. Similarly, INTC has 20.13% upside from the recent share price of $48.86 if the average analyst target price of $58.70/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting PFE to reach a target price of $60.75/share, which is 20.06% above the recent price of $50.60. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of HCA, INTC, and PFE:
Combined, HCA, INTC, and PFE represent 7.78% of the Invesco Dynamic Large Cap Value ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
Invesco Dynamic Large Cap Value ETF PWV $49.12 $55.04 12.05%
HCA Healthcare Inc HCA $240.01 $288.41 20.17%
Intel Corp INTC $48.86 $58.70 20.13%
Pfizer Inc PFE $50.60 $60.75 20.06%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2022-02-11 00:00:00+00:00,"Cisco, Juniper: Big Earnings From Cloud Players Bode Well For Internet Infrastructure Stocks",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cisco-juniper%3A-big-earnings-from-cloud-players-bode-well-for-internet-infrastructure,,,"Our theme of Internet Infrastructure Stocks – which includes a diverse set of companies that sell hardware and software that underpin the Internet – has outperformed the S&P 500 over the last three years straight, returning about 44% in 2019,  25% in 2020, and 44% in 2021. So will the theme continue to outperform in 2022 as well? Although the theme is down by 11% year-to-date in 2022, compared to the S&P 500 which is down just about 6%, we think it could do well through the rest of the year. Why?
Demand for cloud computing services is soaring, as we’ve seen from the recent quarterly earnings reports from major public cloud players such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This is likely to drive further capacity expansion, which should, in turn, drive higher demand for networking infrastructure products. There is also a possibility that supply chain issues, which proved to be a constraint for much of the industry through 2021, could ease through 2022, helping revenue growth for the stocks in our theme. Moreover, many of the stocks in the theme trade at below-market multiples, and it’s possible that they could find favor if investors rotate into value stocks to play rising interest rates and tighter monetary policy.
Within our theme, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has been the weakest performer, declining by about 16% year-to-date. The stock has seen a sharp decline, given its higher valuation multiple and the company’s recent move to abandon its acquisition of chip designer Arm.  On the other side, Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) stock has fared better than the other stocks in our theme, declining by just about 1% year-to-date.
Below you’ll find our previous coverage of the Internet infrastructure theme where you can track our view over time.
[11/16/2021]With Infra Bill Passed, Which Internet Infrastructure Stocks Should You Pick?
Our theme of Internet Infrastructure Stocks – which includes a diverse set of companies that sell hardware and software that underpin the Internet – has returned about 14% year-to-date, underperforming the S&P 500 which has gained about 25% over the same period. That said, there are a couple of factors that could help the stocks in the near-to-medium term. The $1.2 trillion U.S. infrastructure bill, which was recently signed into law, has earmarked about $65 billion to bring broadband into unserved and underserved areas of the U.S. Around $42.5 billion in grants will be focused on expanding physical access to broadband, including building out fiber optic and other networking infrastructure. This could drive demand for the hardware and software offered by the companies in our theme. Moreover, a broader shift to hybrid and distributed workplaces following Covid-19 and the greater digitization of the economy could also drive demand for faster and more reliable connectivity, helping the stocks in our theme.
Within our theme, Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), a company that sells networking products including routers, switches, and network management software, has been the strongest performer, with its stock up by about 42% year-to-date. On the other side, Lumentum Holdings (NASDAQ:LITE), a company best known for its optical networking products, has been the worst performer, with its stock declining by about 3% year-to-date.
[6/23/2021] Three Reasons Why Internet Infrastructure Stocks Are A Buy
Our indicative Theme of Internet Infrastructure Stocks – which includes a diverse set of companies that sell hardware and software that underpin the Internet – has returned about 14% year-to-date, marginally outperforming the Nasdaq-100 which is up by about 12% over the same period. The theme is also up by a relatively solid 47% since the end of 2019. We think that this theme could outperform going forward for several reasons. Firstly, Covid-19 and the remote working trend are likely to accelerate the pace of digitization of businesses and the economy, translating into higher demand for the products and services provided by the companies in our theme. Moreover, the Biden Administration’s plan to spend $65 billion to bring broadband into unserved and underserved areas of the U.S. is also likely to help. Separately, most of the stocks in the theme are value bets, which could benefit as investors rotate out of highly valued growth names as interest rates rise in the coming years.
Within our theme, Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the strongest performer, rising by about 45% year-to-date, driven by robust demand for its GPUs from data centers and gaming consoles and its recent stock split announcement. On the other side, Lumentum Holdings (NASDAQ:LITE), a company best known for its optical networking products, has been the worst performer, with its stock declining by about 15% year-to-date due to weaker than expected Q3 FY’21 earnings.
[3/18/2021] How Are Internet Infrastructure Stocks Faring?
Our indicative Theme of Internet Infrastructure Stocks – which includes a diverse set of companies that sell hardware and software that underpins the Internet and data centers – has gained about 11% year-to-date, outperforming the S&P 500 which is up by 5.5%. The theme is also up by a solid 43% since the end of 2019, compared to a return of about 23% for the S&P 500. These stocks should stand to gain in the medium to long-term, driven by the increasing digitization of the economy through and post the Covid-19 pandemic.
Within our theme, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been the strongest performer, rising by about 29% year-to-date, driven by robust semiconductor demand, some changes at the top management levels, and stronger than expected quarterly earnings. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has also done well, rising by 22% year-to-date, as demand for DRAM is likely to pick up driven by stronger demand from cloud data centers and personal computers. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock is also up 10% year-to-date, as corporate IT spending is expected to rebound as the Covid-19 pandemic wanes. However, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a relative underperformer remaining largely flat year-to-date, due to its relatively rich valuation and its big rally last year.
Other related sectors that stand to benefit from the digital shift include companies that provide cybersecurity software and wireless equipment and services. Check out our themes on Cyber Security Stocks and 5G Stocks for more details.
[12/8/2020] Internet Infrastructure Stocks
Our indicative Theme of Internet Infrastructure Stocks – which includes a diverse set of companies that sell hardware and software that underpins the Internet and data centers – has gained about 32% year-to-date, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 which is up by about 15% year-to-date. (as of 12/7/2020). We see these stocks as a key play on the increasing digitization of the economy through and post Covid-19. Below is a bit more about how these stocks have fared over the last month.
While Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) remains the biggest winner in our theme, up 131% year-to-date, its performance has been mixed over the last month or so as news related to the Covid-19 vaccines saw investors shift focus to lower growth and value stocks. Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU)  stock, on the other hand, has rallied by 30% over the last month as demand for its DRAM chips is expected to rise significantly next year particularly from cloud data centers, smartphones, and gaming consoles. Although Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been the worst performer in the theme year-to-date due to delays in its next-gen process technology and mounting competition from AMD and Apple’s well-reviewed proprietary chip,  it has done reasonably well over the past month, rising by about 10%. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock has also lagged this year, down by about -7% year-to-date. However, the stock rallied by about 16% over the last month, driven partly by stronger than expected Q1 FY’21 results, with the company continuing to transition to a more software-centric model.
[Updated 10/28/2020] Nvidia, Intel, Lumentum: Is It Time To Buy Internet Infrastructure Stocks?
Our indicative Theme of Internet Infrastructure Stocks which includes a diverse set of companies that sell semiconductor products, networking equipment, and related products that underpin the Internet – has gained about 19% year-to-date, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 which is up by about 5% year-to-date. (as of 10/28/2020). These stocks should benefit from the growing requirement for connectivity and computing power, as the Covid-19 pandemic accelerates the shift online. While Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) remains the strongest performer, up 130% year-to-date, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) have underperformed significantly, and are down by almost 20%.
Nvidia (NVDA) is a semiconductor company best known for its graphic processing units (GPUs) that are increasingly used in servers for machine learning and artificial intelligence. In September, the company said that it would acquire U.K based chip designer ARM which specializes in power-efficient central processing units (CPU). The stock is up 131% year-to-date.
Lumentum Holdings Inc. (LITE) manufactures optical networking products such as tunable transponders, transceivers, and transmitter modules,  lasers, receivers, and modulators. The company also provides components such as 3D sensors that are used on mobile phones, including the iPhone. The stock is up 6% year-to-date.
Micron Technology (MU) is a memory manufacturer that sells DRAM and NAND memory. Although the stock is down -1.7% year-to-date, due to some weakness in memory prices, it’s possible that pricing for DRAM could pick up in the coming quarters, driven by the launch of new video game consoles and higher demand from the server space.
Cisco (CSCO) is a networking major that sells networking software, and products such as switches and routers.  While the stock has underperformed, declining by about -19% year-to-date, it could pick up as data centers start upgrading to the next generation 400G network technology, which improves data capacity significantly.
Intel (INTC) one of the largest producers of CPUs for servers and PCs, has seen its stock drop by about -19% this year, due to delays with its next-generation 7-nm chips and strong competition from rivals such as AMD – which has been broadening its portfolio of CPUs and GPUs targeted at data centers, and Nvidia, which could play a larger role in the CPU space via its ARM deal.

2022-02-10 00:00:00+00:00,INTC April 1st Options Begin Trading,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intc-april-1st-options-begin-trading,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options begin trading today, for the April 1st expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new April 1st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $46.00 strike price has a current bid of 92 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $46.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $45.08 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $49.49/share today.
Because the $46.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.00% return on the cash commitment, or 14.61% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $46.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $51.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.49. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $49.49/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $51.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.06% if the stock gets called away at the April 1st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $51.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $51.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.01% boost of extra return to the investor, or 22.00% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $49.49) to be 29%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-02-08 00:00:00+00:00,Big European nations likely to gain the most from EU chip push,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/big-european-nations-likely-to-gain-the-most-from-eu-chip-push,,,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Foo Yun Chee
STOCKHOLM/BRUSSELS, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The European Commission's plan to make the continent more lucrative for investing in semiconductor factories will likely skew the benefits towards larger countries such as Germany, France and Italy, analysts say.
With billions of euros of public and private investment, along with covering up to 100% of the proven funding gap with public resources, a subsidy race could tilt the balance toward countries with larger resources.
""I don't see how that can be avoided as that's just the nature of the beast ... same as in the U.S. where states give different subsidies to get the companies to build in a given state,"" Gartner chip analyst Alan Priestley said.
Chip manufacturing in Europe has dropped from 24% of global production capacity in 2000 to a current 8%, and chipmaker ASML ASML.AS warned that it could fall to 4% if no action is taken.
U.S. firms now have a 47% market share of the chip industry, followed by Asia, with Europe a distant third, according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association.
The current European chip legislation helps to address that by providing deeper subsidies and state support to grab a 20% share of the global capacity by 2030.
Industry sources pointed to more global collaboration with other regions as the chip supply chain spans the world, otherwise it would cost at least 1 trillion euro for a fully autonomous chip supply chain.
Intel INTC.O, which has been planning to invest as much as $95 billion in Europe over the next decade, said it expects the Chips Act to help its plans to expand its European footprint.
The U.S. chipmaker has been scouting for locations in Germany, France and Italy.
And that exactly is the fear of the smaller countries. They suspect international firms looking at the continent may not consider the smaller ones for setting up factories that cost in excess of $20 billion to build.
Analysts said that while subsidies are a major factor, availability of talent, land and research institutes would also be considered before setting up a factory.
Germany, France and Italy had earlier provided state aide for building competency around microelectronics through Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) with a funding budget of 2 billion euros.
The new legislation will also support smaller, innovative companies in accessing advanced skills, industrial partners and equity finance, and several analysts said those firms may choose smaller countries to set up their operations.
""The presence of a next-generation semiconductor fabrication plant in Europe would have positive spill-over effects, driving investment in European supply chains and act as a magnet for scarce talent,"" ING analyst Jan Frederik Slijkerman said.
EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said investments would also come from a second pan-European IPCEI in chips involving more than 100 participants from about 20 EU countries and focusing on AI processors and edge computing.
Asked about TSMC's 2330.TW interest in building a factory in Europe and possible EU aid, she said: ""Europe is also open for business, also for TSMC.""
TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker which said last month it was still in the very early stages of assessing a potential fab in Europe, declined to comment on the European chip legislation.

WASHINGTON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced that an Australian company that makes chargers for electric vehicles will build a manufacturing facility in Tennessee, while reiterating his commitment to turn the U.S. government's fleet of cars electric.
The new plant will produce up to 30,000 electric vehicle chargers per year and create 500 local jobs, according to Biden and the Brisbane-based company, Tritium.
Biden touted ""an American manufacturing comeback."" Tritium's chargers will ""use American parts, American iron, American steel,"" and will be installed by union workers, Biden said. He said the federal government's fleet of 600,000 vehicles will ""end up being electric vehicles.""
""The benefits are going to ripple through thousands of miles in every direction and these jobs will multiply,"" Biden said, adding the manufacturing plants will lead to a growth in steel mills, small parts suppliers and construction sites throughout the country.
Tritium CEO Jane Hunter appeared alongside Biden at the White House and said Biden's policies ""have contributed to enormous demand"" for Tritium products in the United States. This ""directly led us to pivot and change our global manufacturing strategy.""
Biden also announced that this week, the White House will roll out a state-by-state allocation of $5 billion in funding for electric vehicle chargers.
He used the speech to highlight contributions by U.S. companies involved in manufacturing electric vehicles including Tesla TSLA.O - a company Biden has refrained from naming in the past.
Biden has made rebuilding American manufacturing a key of his economic agenda, including pushing for billions of dollars of public and private investments in the electric vehicle industry. The bipartisan infrastructure bill passed last year provided money for a sprawling network of electric vehicle charging stations across the country.
Biden has said electric cars will be more climate-friendly and affordable for American families, and the White House has set a target of half the vehicles sold in the United States to be electric or plug-in hybrids by 2030.
The Tritium announcement is the latest in recent weeks by major companies announcing investments in U.S. manufacturing and jobs, including Intel Corp INTC.O, General Motors Co GM.N and Boeing Co BA.N. More than $200 billion in investments in domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, electric vehicles, aircraft, and batteries have been announced since 2021.

2022-02-08 00:00:00+00:00,ANALYSIS -Relief and challenges for chipmakers as Nvidia-Arm megadeal collapses,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-relief-and-challenges-for-chipmakers-as-nvidia-arm-megadeal-collapses,,,"By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The chip industry is breathing a sigh of relief over the aborted purchase of ARM Ltd by U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp NVDA.O but the firms and their shareholders are left with challenges the deal would have addressed.
Announced in 2020, Nvidia's plan to buy Britain's Arm from Japan's SoftBank was seen worth up to $80 billion and sparked an immediate backlash.
There were concerns that the deal might violate Arm's status as a neutral player in the hyper-competitive chip sector.
Many analysts warned the deal was ""doomed from the start"", due to anti-competitive regulatory concerns and geopolitical tensions.
This prediction played out on Tuesday as SoftBank shelved the sale citing those very regulatory hurdles, with the transaction drawing scrutiny in the United States, Britain and European Union.
""The whole point about Arm was always that it was the Switzerland of the semiconductor industry, dealing very even-handedly with all of its 500-plus licensees. That wasn't lost on the regulators in the UK, the U.S., EU and China,"" Hermann Hauser, a founder of Arm, told Reuters.
""There's a chip war going on around the world, so many weren't very welcoming of such a key architecture firm going to the U.S.,"" said Greg Roh, head of research at Seoul-based Hyundai Motor Securities.
""Countries are competitively trying to build up their chip industries, and will try to defend against their chip technology moving to another country,"" he said.
Due to their low energy consumption, Arm-based chips were perfectly suited for mobile devices, and the company's technology underpinned the smartphone wave, licensing more and more powerful processor designs to Apple AAPL.O and its rivals.
The merger would have boosted both companies' ambitions to crack the booming data centre sector, which is currently dominated by Intel Corp INTC.O and its x86 architecture.
In April, Nvidia announced plans to release a specialised central processing unit (CPU) chip for data centres called ""Grace,"" based on Arm's architecture. That was viewed at the time as a harbinger of the charge the firms would make together into the sector.
Arm makes instruction set architecture (ISA) which it licenses to a wide range of companies, which use it to make blueprints for chip designs.
Arm dominates the market for smartphone application processors, with customers including Apple and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O.
Nvidia, meanwhile, makes graphics processing units (GPUs) used for high-performance computing applications and gaming.
Stacy Rasgon, who tracks the chip sector Bernstein Research, says that Nvidia is not solely reliant on Arm to fulfil its data centre ambitions.
But he said it would be harder for Nvidia to build out a software ecosystem around those chips on its own, ""so buying ARM would be helpful for that"".
DOWNSIDES TO IPO
With the sale collapsed, Arm said it now aims to go public in 2023 having gone private in 2016 when SoftBank purchased it.
In an interview with Reuters, newly appointed Arm CEO Rene Haas said he is ""excited about the opportunity to be a publicly listed company again.""
But the company itself, together with Nvidia, had as recently as December tried to persuade British regulators that a deal with Nvidia was more favourable than an IPO.
They said going public would steer Arm to focus on short-term profits at the expense of its much needed foray into the server sector, especially as growth in the smartphone industry has slowed.
""While Arm’s licensees such as Apple, Qualcomm, and Amazon have enjoyed skyrocketing revenue growth and profits, as well as soaring market valuations, Arm has lately endured comparably flat revenues, rising costs, and lower profits that would likely present challenges for a 30-year old public company,"" they said in a jointly-issued letter.
Still, there may be a silver lining, said Stewart Randall, who tracks the sector at Shanghai-based consultancy Intralink. He said that while a listed company is beholden to its shareholders, it potentially is also under greater pressure to be innovative and competitive.
""Revenues have grown pretty slowly under SoftBank. I hope this lights a fire under them,"" he said.

2022-02-08 00:00:00+00:00,Big European countries likely to gain the most from EU chip push,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/big-european-countries-likely-to-gain-the-most-from-eu-chip-push,,,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Foo Yun Chee
STOCKHOLM/BRUSSELS, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The European Commission's plan to make the continent more lucrative for investing in semiconductor factories will likely skew the benefits towards larger countries such as Germany, France and Italy, analysts say.
With billions of euros of public and private investment, along with covering up to 100% of the proven funding gap with public resources, a subsidy race could tilt the balance toward countries with larger resources.
""I don't see how that can be avoided as that's just the nature of the beast... same as in the U.S. where states give different subsidies to get the companies to build in a given state,"" Gartner chip analyst Alan Priestley said.
Chip manufacturing in Europe has dropped from 24% of global production capacity in 2000 to a current 8%, and chipmaker ASML ASML.AS warned that it could fall to 4% if no action is taken.
U.S. firms now have a 47% market share of the chip industry, followed by Asia, with Europe a distant third, according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association.
The current European chip legislation helps to address that by providing deeper subsidies and state support to grab a 20% share of the global capacity by 2030.
Industry sources pointed to more global collaboration with other regions as the chip supply chain spans the world, otherwise it would cost at least 1 trillion euro for a fully autonomous chip supply chain.
Intel INTC.O, which has been planning to invest as much as $95 billion in Europe over the next decade, said it expects the Chips Act to help its plans to expand its European footprint.
The U.S. chipmaker has been scouting for locations in Germany, France and Italy.
And that exactly is the fear of the smaller countries. They suspect international firms looking at the continent may not consider the smaller ones for setting up factories that cost in excess of $20 billion to build.
Analysts said that while subsidies are a major factor, availability of talent, land and research institutes would also be considered before setting up a factory.
Germany, France and Italy had earlier provided state aide for building competency around microelectronics through Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) with a funding budget of 2 billion euros.
The new legislation will also support smaller, innovative companies in accessing advanced skills, industrial partners and equity finance, and several analysts said those firms may choose smaller countries to set up their operations.
""The presence of a next-generation semiconductor fabrication plant in Europe would have positive spill-over effects, driving investment in European supply chains and act as a magnet for scarce talent,"" ING analyst Jan Frederik Slijkerman said.
EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said investments would also come from a second pan-European IPCEI in chips involving more than 100 participants from about 20 EU countries and focusing on AI processors and edge computing.
Asked about TSMC's 2330.TW interest in building a factory in Europe and possible EU aid, she said: ""Europe is also open for business, also for TSMC.""

BRUSSELS, Feb 8 (Reuters) - EU countries will find it easier to provide funding for first-of-a-kind factories under a European Commission billion-euro plan set out on Tuesday aimed at boosting its chip industry and cutting the bloc's dependence on U.S. and Asian companies.
The move by the European Union executive mirrors the $52 billion U.S. Chips Act aimed at increasing competitiveness with China and comes as a global chip shortage and supply chain bottlenecks create havoc for car makers, healthcare providers, telecoms operators and others.
The European Chips Act will ""enable 15 billion euros ($17 billion) in additional public and private investment by 2030"", Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement to the media.
""This will come on top of 30 billion euros of public investments already planned from NextGenerationEU, Horizon Europe and national budgets. And these funds are set to be matched by further long-term private investments,"" she said, referring to ongoing EU projects.
Von der Leyen said the bloc will ease its state aid rules, which aim to prevent illegal and unfair subsidies granted by EU countries to companies, for innovative chip factories.
""We are, therefore, adapting our state aid rules, under strict conditions. This will allow - for the first time – public support for European 'first-of-a-kind' production facilities, which benefit all of Europe.""
The chip push comes as EU countries woo U.S. chipmaker Intel INTC.O, which has yet to announce where it will locate a European mega-fab plant, triggering concerns of a subsidy race.
Intel welcomed the EU chip push, urging authorities on both sides of the Atlantic to join forces.
""We are currently considering a significant increase in our European footprint, and we expect that the EU Chips Act will facilitate these plans,"" the company said in a statement.

2022-02-08 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Too Late to Buy AMD Stock?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-too-late-to-buy-amd-stock-0,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) showed that its growth story continues as it released its fourth-quarter and 2021 earnings. Amid outsized revenue and earnings increases, investors reacted by bidding AMD stock higher by 5% in the following session.
That gain serves as the latest growth spurt in a trend that has taken AMD stock higher by nearly 3,600% since Lisa Su became CEO in October 2014. Now, following that considerable growth, prospective stockholders may wonder whether it is too late to benefit from the AMD growth story.
Image source: Getty Images.
AMD's latest advancements
Indeed, the company's latest report speaks to the strength of AMD's product lines. The most recent quarter brought rising sales of its Radeon and Ryzen processors bolstered by record sales of notebooks, strong demand for premium notebooks, and high-end desktop CPUs.
Shipments of these high-end computers, which it powers with Ryzen 5000 processors, grew by double-digit percentages. Additionally, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January, it announced the release of its Ryzen 6000 series notebook CPUs and demonstrated the Ryzen 7000 desktop CPUs it expects to release in the second half of the year.
Furthermore, its pending acquisition of Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX) will make it the ""leading high-performance computing company,"" according to AMD. Su stated on AMD's Q4 2021 earnings call that EPYC processors already power eight of the 10 top supercomputers globally in terms of efficiency. Hence, the deal looks like a natural extension of its existing strengths and should expand its product offerings and customer base.
Also, a study by researchers at the University of Edinburgh found Xilinx's FPGA chip outperformed Intel's on some measures, indicating the Xilinx deal should enhance AMD's competitive edge. This is especially true for the company's data center segment, which doubled revenue over the last 12 months.
Earnings and stock price growth
Such advancements also continue to accrue to the company's overall financials. AMD generated revenue of $16.4 billion in 2021, a 68% increase year over year. In addition, non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) earnings of $3.4 billion surged 118% versus 2020 levels. The increase in gross margins from 45% to 48% during that period, as well as slower growth in operating expenses, boosted net income growth.
Further, AMD appears on track to continue its robust gains, though the revenue growth rate seems poised to slow. Its outlook for fiscal 2022 calls for revenue of around $21.5 billion, which would amount to a 31% gain. Despite that lower revenue outlook and the tech sell-off late last year, AMD stock managed a gain of 41% over the previous 12 months.
AMD data by YCharts.
But even after that gain, AMD continues to maintain an attractive valuation considering its growth. It sells for a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 48. While that is higher than one of its key manufacturers, Taiwan Semiconductor, it remains well below Nvidia's 76 P/E ratio.
Investors must also remember that the semiconductor industry remains a cyclical business. Both the pandemic and rapid growth in areas such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, Internet of Things, and 5G have further boosted demand for chips. As chipmakers have raised production, supplies appear to be achieving a better balance with demand. This could affect chip pricing in the near term as this needed component becomes more available.
Is it too late to consider AMD?
Although AMD has increased considerably over the last few years, its growth story will likely continue. Admittedly, the company could lose some pricing power as manufacturers address chip shortages by increasing production.
However, in addition to its massive growth, it continues to improve its offerings with the release of upgraded processors. Moreover, adding Xilinx should further advance the company's supercomputing capabilities. With a P/E ratio well under that of Nvidia, this chip stock should hold investors in good stead as its growth story continues.

Semiconductor stocks, arguably, remain viable plays in the stock market now. This would largely be in thanks to the strong demand for semiconductor chips. Evidently, a Gartner (NYSE: IT) report notes that semiconductor revenue grew 25.1% globally in 2021, exceeding $500 billion for the first time. One of the reasons that could explain this growth would be the increase in remote-working due to the pandemic. This, in turn, boosted demand for PCs and laptops significantly. Even now, companies are already extending their work-from-home policies as COVID-19 cases in the U.S. remain high. For this reason, semiconductor stocks could continue to benefit.
Last week, we saw Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) announce stellar results for its first quarter fiscal. Notably, the semiconductor company raked in a record revenue of $10.7 billion and earnings per share of $2.98, both of which were up 30% and 41% respectively year-over-year. Elsewhere, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) saw its latest quarter revenue increase by 19% from a year ago, mainly driven by strong demand in industrial and automotive markets. Along this was a net income of $2.14 billion, up by 26% year-over-year. Some would argue that the earnings release from these two semiconductor giants testifies to the solid growth in the semiconductor space.

2022-02-07 00:00:00+00:00,Is Qualcomm Stock a Buy Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-qualcomm-stock-a-buy-now,,,"Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) recently posted strong first-quarter numbers and rosy guidance for its second quarter on Feb. 2. The mobile chipmaker's revenue increased 30% year over year to $10.7 billion, which cleared estimates by $270 million. Its adjusted net income grew 47% to $3.7 billion, or $3.23 per share, which also topped expectations by $0.23.
For the second quarter, Qualcomm expects its revenue to grow 29%-39% year over year, and for its adjusted EPS to rise 47%-58%. Analysts had expected its revenue and adjusted EPS to improve by 20% and 31%, respectively.
Those numbers were rock-solid, but they didn't meaningfully boost Qualcomm's stock price -- which remains down 2% for the year as of this writing. Let's see if investors should pay more attention to this underappreciated chipmaker.

How fast is Qualcomm growing?
Qualcomm operates two main businesses: a chipmaking (QCT) segment, which produces its flagship Snapdragon system-on-chips (SoCs); and a licensing (QTL) segment, which generates licensing revenue and royalties from its massive portfolio of wireless patents.
Qualcomm generated 83% of its revenue from the QCT segment in the first quarter of 2022, and the remaining 17% came from the QTL segment. Here's how those two core businesses fared over the past year:

The QCT business generated 68% of its revenue from the smartphone market during the first quarter. The rest came from its RF front-end chips (13%), automotive chips (3%), and Internet of Things (IoT) (17%) chips.
Qualcomm's smartphone chip sales rose 42% year over year, driven by brisk sales of its Snapdragon SoCs -- which bundle together a CPU, GPU, and baseband modem on a single chipset -- for new 5G devices.
Its RF front-end revenue rose 7% as it sold more 5G and Wi-Fi connectivity modules, and its automotive revenue grew 21% as it sold more chips for telematics platforms, digital cockpits, and advanced driver-assistance systems. Its IoT revenue surged 41% as it sold more connected laptop, edge networking, and industrial chips.
The QTL business, which gives Qualcomm a cut of every smartphone sold worldwide, was previously targeted by defiant OEMs and government regulators, which all claimed its licensing fees were too high. But Qualcomm settled most of those disputes, and that higher-margin business -- which accounted for a third of its pre-tax profits in the first quarter -- continued to expand as it collected fresh licensing revenue from new 5G devices.
Robust revenue growth and expanding margins
Qualcomm's revenue growth is gradually decelerating, but the secular growth of the 5G, connected vehicle, industrial, and IoT markets is enabling it to generate strong double-digit percentage sales growth on top of its double-digit percentage sales growth in 2021. As a fabless chipmaker, Qualcomm faces some supply bottlenecks related to the ongoing chip shortage, but it expects those headwinds to ease in the second half of 2022.
After rising 55% in fiscal 2021, analysts expect Qualcomm's revenue to grow 24% to $41.5 billion in 2022 before decelerating to 8% growth in 2023.
Qualcomm's earnings before taxes (EBT) margins also expanded sequentially and year over year in the first quarter. That expansion was driven by the QCT segment's rising margins, which CFO Akash Palkhiwala attributed to its improved ""revenue scale and operating leverage.""

For the second quarter, Qualcomm expects its EBT margins to dip sequentially -- but still potentially expand year over year -- to 32%-34% for the QCT segment and 70%-74% for the QTL segment.
Based on these expectations, analysts expect Qualcomm's adjusted EPS to grow 35% in 2022 and increase 7% in 2023. Those are solid growth rates for a stock that trades at just 18 times forward earnings.
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which is expected to grow at a much slower rate than Qualcomm for the foreseeable future, trades at 15 times forward earnings. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), which is also growing at a slower clip than Qualcomm, trades at 21 times forward earnings.
Qualcomm also consistently returns its free cash flow to investors through buybacks and dividends. It's reduced its number of outstanding shares by 24% over the past three years, and pays a decent forward yield of 1.5%. That tight financial discipline should make Qualcomm an attractive ""safe haven"" stock as rising interest rates slam the tech sector's frothier growth stocks.
Is it the right time to buy Qualcomm?
Qualcomm is one of the few tech stocks I'd recommend buying in this volatile market. Its growth engines are still firing on all cylinders, it's gradually expanding into new markets, its margins are expanding, and it trades at a discount to many of its semiconductor peers. It might not be as exciting as the market's other high-growth stocks, but I'm fine with adding a little boredom and stability to my portfolio to cope with this unpredictable market.

2022-02-03 00:00:00+00:00,"If You Invested $10,000 in ASML in 2010, This Is How Much You Would Have Today",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/if-you-invested-%2410000-in-asml-in-2010-this-is-how-much-you-would-have-today,,,"ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) is the world's only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems. The semiconductor market's most advanced chip foundries -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Samsung, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) -- all use the Dutch company's $150 million EUV systems to etch circuit patterns for their smallest and densest chips.
ASML doesn't face any competitors in this crucial market because it perfected the complex technology over the past three decades. It's also far too expensive for other lithography companies to enter this high-end market.
Image source: Getty Images.
ASML was spun off from Philips (NYSE: PHG) as a public company in 1995. But it only shipped its first experimental EUV system in 2010 -- and it didn't meaningfully ramp up its commercial shipments until 2016.
If you had invested $10,000 in ASML at the beginning of 2010, your investment would be worth over $150,000 today. Let's take a look back at ASML's growth over those nine years, and see why it could still have more room to run.
The birth of a new market
In 2010, ASML shipped 197 lithography systems. Its main competitors in the lithography market were Nikon (OTC: NINOY) and Canon (NYSE: CAJ).
But in 2013, ASML bought Cymer, a San Diego-based lithography technology company, to accelerate its development of its EUV systems. It shipped its second-generation NXE:3300 EUV system later that year, followed by its third-generation NXE:3350 EUV system in 2015.
ASML continued to upgrade its other lithography technologies by buying Hermes Microvision (HMI) in 2016 and Mapper's intellectual property assets in 2018. It also clashed with Nikon in a series of patent infringement lawsuits between 2017 and 2019 -- which was eventually settled by a cross-licensing agreement between the two companies.
ASML still competes against Nikon and Canon in the older deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography systems market, but it's monopolized the high-end market for EUV systems -- which cost significantly more than DUV systems. As a result, BOCI Securities estimates that ASML accounted for 91% of all lithography sales in 2020, compared to just 6% for Nikon and 3% for Canon.
In 2021, ASML sold 309 lithography systems, including 42 EUV systems. Between 2010 and 2021, its annual revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.8%. Its annual gross margin expanded from 43.4% to 52.7%, while its earnings per share rose at a CAGR of 17.9%.
Why ASML still has more room to run
The global chip shortage has caused TSMC, Samsung, and Intel to all ramp up their orders of ASML's EUV systems -- and ASML is shipping them as quickly as it can manufacture them. ASML also plans to gradually roll out its new high-NA EUV systems, which will enable those foundries to manufacture even smaller chips, between 2022 and 2025.
During its investor day presentation last September, ASML predicted it would generate 24 billion euros ($27 billion) to 30 billion euros ($33.7 billion) in revenue in 2025. The midpoint of that forecast implies a CAGR of 9.8% from 2021 to 2025. However, investors should also recall that ASML actually surpassed its 2018 investor day targets four years ahead of schedule -- so it could be sandbagging that long-term guidance again.
The low end of ASML's forecast, which calls for 313 lithography system shipments in 2025 (including 48 EUV and five high-NA systems), implies the market's cyclical appetite for new chips will wane as the leading foundries resolve the global chip shortage. The high end of that forecast, which calls for 452 lithography system shipments in 2025 (including 70 EUV and five high-NA systems), is based on the belief that the secular expansion of newer markets (like 5G, cloud, and artificial intelligence) will support a prolonged ""super cycle"" in chip upgrades.
Both scenarios indicate ASML's business will continue to grow, and analysts currently expect its revenue to rise 20% in 2022 and 12% in 2023. Those stable growth rates, along with ASML's monopolization of a key piece of chipmaking technology, indicate its stock still has lots of upside potential.

The top tech giant Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has consistently grown over the past year. Despite the pandemic and the supply chain issues, the company has been able to expand market share, drive revenue and achieve tremendous growth.

AMD stock is as high as 11% after the company reported blow-out quarterly results. The stock had dipped to $102 last week and went as high as $125 today.
However, the stock is trading much lower than the all-time high of $164 but the company has solid potential to reach there.  
In my previous coverage of the stock, I had mentioned that the stock will rebound if it beats analyst expectations in the results. I have always been bullish about AMD stock and I still think the stock is a good buy for 2022. With that in mind, let’s dig deeper into my investment thesis of AMD stock. 
Stellar Quarterly Results 
The company reported impressive fourth-quarter results. It reported adjusted revenue of $4.83 billion, higher than the estimates of $4.53 billion and the net income stood at $974 million. It earned 92 cents a share and the gross margin went from 45% to 48% from the same period last year.
7 REITs With Major Upside Potential in 2022
AMD is growing the market share in the server and PC market against the rivals. However, the company still has the potential to grow the market share and give stiff competition to rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). 
For the coming year, the company has a strong forecast as the demand for chips used in the data centers is expected to grow. In 2022, the company projected revenue of $21.5 billion, much higher than the estimate of $19.27 billion.
For the first quarter, it expects revenue of around $5 billion, plus or minus $100 million. As the supply chain issues start to resolve, AMD will be in a better position to meet the demands of the users. This will give the company a solid chance to expand in the market.
I believe the company is in the growth stage and has massive potential to report strong revenue and enjoy a high market share in the coming years. 
Xilinx Will Add Power to the Company
The much-anticipated Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) deal has finally gotten approval from the Chinese regulators and this will have a huge impact on the future of the company.
It will introduce a new market and wider user base as the company continues to grow. 2022 revenue numbers will see a contribution from the Xilinx merger and it will push the stock to new all-time highs and the competition with Intel will only heat up further. 
AMD has already set gold standards in the GPU segment and it is focusing on the data center to expand its market share. The merger is a big deal for the company and we will see its strength in the coming years. 
The Bottom Line 
AMD has also made significant new launches including the updates to its GPU lineup that is used for gaming. It is taking a large share of Intel and its profitability is hitting lofty levels. The bullish outlook for 2022 shows that the company is confident in handling supply chain issues and reporting stellar numbers. 
All in all, I believe AMD is a top tech stock to own and the company will continue to expand throughout 2022. It has the right products and the potential to meet the changing demands of the users. This is only the beginning for the company and with the successful Xilinx merger, there is a lot to look forward to. 
Considering the long-term potential of the company, the stock looks undervalued and has a solid chance to soar higher in the coming quarters.
AMD stock could be the one to own this decade.

2022-02-03 00:00:00+00:00,3 Sleeper Stocks to Buy Under Wall Street’s Radar,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-sleeper-stocks-to-buy-under-wall-streets-radar,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Investor confidence suffered a big blow last month. As a result the indices fell into a deep pit and fast. The bearish technical lines triggered and almost instantaneously went to the worst case possible. This is the equivalent of ripping the bandage quickly to shorten the pain period. This left the door open for a fast rebound rally, but we can still find stocks to buy near support.
The bad earnings reactions from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) caused new sympathy damage. This sometimes extends to anything that merely resembles the stocks falling. In this case, FB is so large that it causes a pretty wide ripple effect. Case in point Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) fell 10% after hours, which clearly is an over-reaction.
Today we focus on three stocks to buy that are near support levels. It is also important that they have a healthy business. The idea is to eliminate the guesswork and just gauge the potential upside in the long run. None of these are for the short term, but we will take the rally if it comes.
I usually strive to eliminate events like an earnings release from the immediate future. One of the three today will be reporting soon enough. But I feel like there is enough time to get in and out beforehand. The other two have already delivered their earnings, so we can dissect the value at its own merit. I prefer it when there isn’t a binary event but sometimes it is unavoidable.
There are no experts in the stock markets these days. The main reason is the the short term headline risks that loom. The politicians are busy making the global situation a bit more edgy. Furthermore the central banks are likely to make the fundamental settings a bit more challenging. The Federal Reserve already committed to ending the quantitative easing and starting a quantitative tightening. The European Central Bank is likely to also follow suit soon enough.
7 REITs With Major Upside Potential in 2022
I have relatively strong conviction in the thesis behind the stocks to buy today. However, I will infuse a bit of doubt on purpose to keep me humble. I would not suggest taking full positions all at once to leave room for error. Going all in right now is a bit presumptuous and leaves investors with little recourse under pressure. The three stocks to buy this week are:
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)
eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)
Stocks to Buy: Intel (INTC)
Source: Charts by TradingView
For the past few years I find myself defending this giant too often. While, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) hog the headlines, this is the monster in the field. Intel is twice bigger than the other two in total. Yet for now it can’t bribe investors to like it. Eventually it will come back in style and catch a bid. It reminds me of Ford (NYSE:F) in 2019. Back then it was struggling to hold $7 per share. My bullish thesis then was they were due more respect than they had. Now investors are chasing it even though its stock is three times more expensive.
I am not suggesting that INTC stock will be $150 soon. However, it doesn’t deserve to have a single-digit price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio either. It currently has a trailing P/E of 10 and still can’t find fans on Wall Street. The problem is its lack of pizazz. The evidence of this is the lackluster growth in sales, especially if you compare it to the other two. Eventually, management will figure out a way to recapture investor attention. At least, that is part of my thesis.
Intel has the money and the tech to make a splash. The world is hungry for more tech than ever before, so demand is not a problem. I remember the olden days when “Intel Inside” sticker mattered on my PC. Now I don’t need it for I am just as happy to own an AMD machine. Recently I started shopping for a new computer. And much to my surprise I found myself looking for the “EVO” badge from Intel. Although I do not need it to be there, I am noticing more often.
The bottom line is that Intel has all the tools and opportunities that AMD and NVDA have. Management needs to get off the bench and refocus investors’ attentions on what matters. Owning INTC stock here has very little downside risk. Below $48 per share has been support since 2017. Therefore, it has less froth to shed in case markets suffer another stent lower.
Starbucks (SBUX)
Source: Charts by TradingView
During the pandemic outbreak of 2020 when all business closed their doors, I expected SBUX to suffer much worse consequences. The way that management navigated the toughest conditions ever was impressive. They have earned kudos for a lifetime from me, so SBUX stock is a buy on dips.
It already corrected up to 25% from its summer highs. Most of it was through no fault of its own, just following the indices. The business has no flagrant issues nagging it. I remember days when the critics were selling it because of long lines. Having too many clients is a problem any manager would love to have.
The coffee habit is a way of life, so their clientele are not likely to give up on them. Part of Warren Buffett’s wisdom is to seek businesses with a strong recurring base. The competitive advantage partly comes from humans being creatures of habit. I have friends who will walk through snow to get their Starbucks cup. I am not that discerning so I am fine with my good ole drip at home.
7 REITs With Major Upside Potential in 2022
Fundamentally, SBUX stock is as bulletproof as they make them. Revenues continue to grow except for a blip through a global shut down. The sales and net income now are 15% and 10% larger than in 2019. Clearly there is nothing wrong with the  business, so it comes down to timing. Technically, if it loses $94 per share it could fall another 6% from there. That would place SBUX stock below pre-pan levels.
Stocks to Buy: eBay (EBAY)
Source: Charts by TradingView
If EBAY stock can hold $55 per share, it can rally to $67 in the next few weeks. The upcoming earnings event may cause a temporary disruption to that, but it’s worth the risk. The short-term reaction to earnings is unpredictable. Let the Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) spike on terrible results remind us of that.
This is more of a short-term technical opportunity than the other two. Nevertheless, the eBay business is doing just fine. The company generated $8.2 billion in gross profits last year. Moreover, it has a P/E of 3.5, which is low in absolute terms. This is hardly a scenario where we would be taking on bloat.
eBay lacks the extreme growth attraction, therefore I consider this an active trade. If it rebounds fast before the earnings I’d get out or reduce the risk. The technical setup is enticing enough and the downside risk should be manageable. These days markets are indecisive and they are quick with the flip. Sentiment if fickle and the smallest headline causes panic.

2022-02-03 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Dropped Again on Thursday,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-dropped-again-on-thursday,,,"What happened
It's Thursday, the Nasdaq Composite Index is plummeting -- now down 2.7% -- and it's taking the stock of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) along for the slide. Shares of the semiconductor giant were down 3.6% as of 1:10 p.m. ET today.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
In a note out earlier this week, analysts at TheStreet.com reported that the semiconductor sector is in a slump despite a tight supply of microchips globally, with manufacturers having just five days' supply of chips on hand (versus closer to 40 days' worth as recently as 2019).
Nvidia in particular has been a victim of late, with its stock falling more than 20% over just the last couple of months. And TheStreet warns that it's ""possible for Nvidia stock to fully break down and trade significantly lower"" than that. ""If the stock market goes into a full-blown roaring bear market, then Nvidia is going lower,"" TheStreet's Bret Kenwell said.
That prediction is proving prescient today, as Nvidia shares track the Nasdaq lower step by step -- and are even taking a few extra steps downstairs.
Now what
But one analyst's comments aren't enough to fully explain why Nvidia shares are heading lower. For one thing, Nvidia shares remain richly valued even after their recent slump, costing roughly 70 times earnings, when rival AMD costs less than half that, and Intel can be bought for just 10 times earnings.
Among semiconductor stocks, Nvidia looks almost uniquely vulnerable to bad news at such an elevated valuation. And earlier this week, the U.S. Commerce Department delivered some news that could be considered bad (for semiconductor investors, at least). While the chip supply chain ""remains fragile,"" the Commerce Department said, a survey of more than 150 companies in the semiconductor supply chain showed that the global semiconductor shortage could begin to abate as early as the second half of this year.
Furthermore, the agency foresees vast increases in semiconductor manufacturing capacity at Intel, Samsung, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company coming on line between 2022 and 2025. As new fabs begin churning out more and more chips, prices could plummet as supply begins to catch up with demand as early as a couple of years from now -- throwing into question optimistic analyst forecasts for 25% annualized earnings growth at Nvidia.
And since it's these same growth forecasts that are supporting Nvidia's sky-high valuation, the more that investors question the growth, the more they'll question whether they should be paying so much for Nvidia.

*Stock Advisor returns as of January 10, 2022
Will Healy: AMD doesn't have a fab, whereas Intel does not have that problem. In a lot of ways a company like AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) or Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), they're dependent on TSMC (NYSE: TSM), so if TSM or Samsung fails them, they could be in a lot of trouble, whereas Intel, if they can make their chips and recapture the technical lead, that could be a very powerful value proposition.
Another point to remember is Intel is still huge, they are the second-largest producer in the world. The article I'm going present later is going to touch on this. In terms of production, they are bigger than AMD and Nvidia combined, much bigger in fact.
Actually, Intel and Samsung have been fighting for the lead for the last few years. Intel, they're not what they were, but they're not declining and they may reascend, time will tell. Hopefully, this latest earnings report will give us some insight into that.
Billy Duberstein: You know there's a lot of people that would like to see Intel succeed in this endeavor too. I'm sure all the chipmakers out there don't want to only have one single outsourced fab that can produce their chips, they would probably like to have two or three they can play off of each other. Also, the U.S. government has a pretty big stake in wanting Intel to succeed. I wouldn't count it out, it's just it's going to take years.
Healy: Agreed.
Duberstein: If you want your stock to be going up a lot in a short amount of time, it could happen, there could be some sort of announcement. I'm sure Pat Gelsinger will sound very confident on the call. I'm just a little skeptical this stock is going to move very much until we get more.
Healy: That's the problem with Intel stock is there's just no catalyst right now. Until we see some proof that they've caught up in some areas, I don't really see there being a catalyst, but 10 times earnings, it might be worth of speculative play too, but I wouldn't put a whole lot of money into this right now.

2022-02-03 00:00:00+00:00,7 Stocks to Buy as Panic Selling Hits Wall Street,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-to-buy-as-panic-selling-hits-wall-street,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The recent volatility in the markets appears to be easing a bit. That’s not to say the main driver of it, the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates, won’t continue to have an impact. But with stocks, electric vehicle (EV) and tech plays in particular knocked down so much, so fast? It may be time to decide which stocks to buy, as the dust temporarily settles.
For many of the names pushed lower by rate hike concerns, the sell-off was justified. That is, there was some semblance of sense to their sky-high valuations in a near-zero interest rate environment. As monetary policy starts to make its own “return to normal,” these valuations are unsustainable.
Yet in the case of some reasonably priced names? What played out last month may have been a bit of an overreaction. Pushed to prices that underestimate their respective long-term potential, investors focused on the long-term may want to scoop some of these up, while they remain at opportune entry points.
7 REITs With Major Upside Potential in 2022
So, what are some of the stocks to buy, as the sell-off ends, at least for now? These seven, a mix of growth and value plays, are solid plays for those who can look past near-term uncertainties:
eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)
Ford (NYSE:F)
Fisker (NYSE:FSR)
GAN (NASDAQ:GAN)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI)
AT&T (NYSE:T)
Stocks to Buy: eBay (EBAY)
Source: ShutterStockStudio / Shutterstock.com
While not one of the hardest hit by last month’s tech sell off, EBAY stock has experienced a moderate pullback since the start of January. This is atop the slide in price it experienced during November and December.
In all, at around $58.50 per share today, the online auction marketplace operator is down around 27% from its 52-week high.
Again, with rates rising, it makes sense that tech stocks with high valuations have come down in price. But eBay’s forward multiple is far from frothy. In fact, trading for around 15.4 times projected 2021 earnings, you can say it’s a value play. Sure, it makes sense that this more mature internet stock sports a lower price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple.
Even so, given the moderate level of earnings growth expected this year, and in 2023? Its clearly undervalued. Initiatives like managed payments, a product of it weaning off its former subsidiary PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), as well as stock buybacks, are helping the company deliver earnings per share (EPS) growth that exceeds its single-digit sales growth.
Going forward, eBay may not necessarily go on a hot run once sentiment for shares improves. Yet the ingredients are in place for it to deliver solid returns in the years ahead. You may want to buy it while it remains down from its extended pullback.
Ford (F)
Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com
Ford’s move into EVs has been the main driver for its stock price over the past year. It has also played the main role in this incumbent automaker’s big drop, as investors have made a big exit out of vehicle electrification plays.
Many EV stocks, like Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID), Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have moved up too far, too fast. Adoption of electric cars and trucks may be accelerating. Whether that justifies the rich valuations these three pure plays continue to command remains up for debate.
With F stock, however, valuation is less of a concern. It’s still priced more like an “old school” auto stock, at 11.2x earnings. You are getting exposure to the EV megatrend at a more than fair price. Not to mention, you are getting indirect exposure to RIVN stock as well. An early investor in Rivian, this company owns around 12% of it, a position worth around $7.5 billion.
7 Best Robinhood Stocks to Buy on the Dip
Going forward? It’s still plugging along with bringing out electrified versions of its popular vehicle models. Ford is also rumored to be planning to spin off a small portion of its EV business. A move like this could unlock value for shareholders. At around $21 per share today, down slightly from its recent high, consider this one of the best stocks to buy after the market’s recent correction.

Buying F stock appears to be one of the safer stocks to buy to add EV exposure to your portfolio. But what if you’re looking for something more of the high-risk, high-return variety? With other early stage electric vehicle plays, downside risk may exceed upside potential.
In the case of Fisker stock, though, risk/return appears favorable. It has a $3.5 billion market capitalization at today’s prices (around $12 per share). There’s a lot less potential growth already baked into its stock price. Now, that makes some sense, given the company isn’t targeting six figure delivery numbers within a few years, like Lucid and Rivian are.
Still, even if Fisker finds moderate success with its EV offering, an SUV known as the Ocean, there may be plenty of room to grow its valuation. By comparison, Lucid and Rivian need to hit their ambitious growth goals just to sustain their valuations.
With the market’s lukewarm feelings for FSR stock, and more muted enthusiasm for EV stocks overall, patience may be key. It may take some time for it to re-hit the highs reached during past waves of “EV mania.” There’s of course the risk too that the Ocean is a dud once it makes its debut later this year. Nevertheless, after its sharp drop during the January wave of panic selling, it may be at a price where the odds with this risky EV play are in your favor.
GAN (GAN)

The rate hike sell-off has hit growth stocks across the board. As I mentioned above, EV stocks and more general tech stocks have been hard hit. So too, have online gambling plays. With the big shift from overly bullish to overly bearish, many bargains can be found in this space. But one in particular that’s worth a look is GAN stock.
Not familiar with GAN? That’s understandable. This online gambling doesn’t operate a sportsbook, which explains its lack of name recognition. Instead, it’s a provider of back-end technology for the sportsbooks industry. In a way, with its SaaS business model, you can think of it as sort of like the sports betting industry’s equivalent to Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP).
When sports betting and i-gaming stocks were in vogue, this previously over-the-counter (OTC) listed stock took off, once it uplisted to the Nasdaq Capital Market. Over the past year, though, as investors have become more skeptical about projections of high growth for the industry, shares in this name have tanked.

Following the latest gambling stock rout, this former $30 stock now trades in the high single-digits. Still operating in the red, it doesn’t pop out as a value play on a stock screener. Yet with management confident it can turn this business (currently generating between $125 million and $135 million annually) into a $500 million per year business by 2026, you may want to give it a closer look.
Stocks to Buy: Intel (INTC)

Despite its relatively low valuation, the recent tech sell off, driven by rate hikes, has put pressure on INTC stock. So too, has the chip maker’s latest guidance update. A mixed outlook was met with a negative reaction by investors. However, much like the other value names in tech, this may be another where the market has overreacted.
Why? For starters, while guidance fell below expectations, Intel’s earnings for the December quarter came in ahead of estimates. This may be the first sign that it’s turnaround, which CEO Pat Gelsinger has conceded could take as much as five years, is working. The company’s game plans, which includes it investing $100 billion into new plants, in order to become a major foundry for other chip makers, isn’t without risk.
Yet if it works out, it could enable the company to regain ground lost over the past few years. Along with getting its manufacturing house back in order, Intel’s plan to take its Mobileye unit public, while keeping a majority stake, could boost shares as well. With this unit alone worth $50 billion, it may be able to convey to investors that the company as a whole is worth more than its current $198.8 billion market capitalization.
Just announcing it’s raising its dividend as well, this 3% yielding stock also pays out while you wait for the Intel turnaround to complete. Put it all together, and this is another one of the best stocks to buy after last month’s meltdown.
SoFi Technologies (SOFI)

Before, I’ve recommended to wait and buy SoFi Technologies, if/when a rate hike sell-off sends it down to single-digit prices. A drop on the heels of rising interest rates did happen, yes. But with news of it obtaining a bank charter softening the blow, this fintech stock has managed to stay above $10 per share.
In light of the bank charter development, and the fact the prospect of higher rates has been factored into it? I’ve tweaked my prior take on SOFI stock a little bit. Now that the uncertainty as to whether this digital first financial services firm would become a licensed bank has cleared up, it may have already found its floor.
Sporting a high valuation due to projections of it continuing to grow at a fast clip, you may be surprised I’m bullish. After all, aren’t rising rates going to have further impact on stock market valuations? On one hand, this is true. On the other hand, rising rates may help SoFi more than they hurt it. As it morphs into more of a traditional financial institution, rising rates may be in its favor, as they help make banking more profitable.

Stronger than expected results, plus a faster trip to overall profitability, may help outweigh the risk of multiple compression from rising rates. With this in mind, keep an eye on SoFi as it bounces back from its lows.
Stocks to Buy: AT&T (T)

Still perceived as a “widows and orphans” stock, recent market volatility has only done minimal damage to the price of AT&T shares. However, there has been a recent development that may dampen interest in it for now.
That would be its just-announced plans to spin-off rather than split-off the Warner Bros. Discovery shares it’ll receive, once it merges its WarnerMedia unit into Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA). Investors were hoping for the latter rather than the former. Why? A split-off of shares would’ve limited the extent of “Ma Bell’s” post-divestiture dividend cut.
Going the spin-off route, the T stock dividend is getting a severe haircut. Instead of paying out $2.08 per share in dividends annually, going forward its annual payout will be $1.11 per share. That translates into a drop in its yield from 8.52%, down to around 4.5%.
Income investors are not happy. That’s why shares, after their rebound from December through mid-January, are back below $25 per share. Yet as InvestorPlace’s Louis Navellier recently argued, the heavy amount of attention around its payout means the market is underappreciating its potential as a turnaround play. Both T stock and its spinoff could make comebacks down the road. Trading for just 7.8x earnings, investors buying it after its recent drop could see nice returns, albeit with a lower amount of dividends.
