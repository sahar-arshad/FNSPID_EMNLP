July 29 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes rose on Friday, as positive forecasts from Apple and Amazon pointed to resilience in mega-cap companies to survive an economic downturn, with hopes of a less aggressive monetary policy boosting sentiment.
Apple Inc AAPL.O shares rose 3.4% after the iPhone maker said parts shortages are easing and that demand for iPhones is unceasing despite consumers tightening other spending.
Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O shot up 11.9% after it forecast a jump in third-quarter revenue from bigger fees from its Prime loyalty subscriptions.
""Big tech has been a mixed bag this earnings season, but Amazon proved that the strong can survive even the toughest environments,"" said Laura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
Meanwhile, investor worries of bigger interest rate increases eased a bit on Thursday after data showed the American economy contracted for the second straight quarter.
""The Fed is really between a rock and a hard place because are they going to fight inflation or are they going to cave to slower economic growth,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management.
Gains on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI were capped by Intel Corp INTC.O, which tumbled 10.2% after it cut annual sales and profit forecasts and missed second-quarter estimates as demand for its chips used in personal computers cools.
While the broader S&P 500 technology index .SPLRCT gained 0.9%, chipmakers fell, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX slipping 0.6%. Consumer discretionary stocks .SPLRCD jumped 3.5%.
Toward the end of a power-packed week, all three of Wall Street's main indexes were set for their second straight weekly gain.
Data showed U.S. consumer spending increased more than expected in June as Americans paid more for goods and services, with monthly inflation surging by the most since 2005.
At 9:49 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 28.21 points, or 0.09%, at 32,557.84, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 27.86 points, or 0.68%, at 4,100.29 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 127.98 points, or 1.05%, at 12,290.57.
The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, also know as Wall Street's fear gauge, hit a 3-month low.
The S&P 500 energy sector .SPNY added 3.2%, boosted by shares of Chevron Corp CVX.N and Exxon Mobil XOM.N rose 6.8% and 3.6%, respectively, after the oil majors posted record quarterly revenue on the back of soaring crude prices.
Phillips 66 PSX.N rose 0.2% after the refiner reported a jump in second-quarter profit, boosted by surging demand for fuel and refined products amid tight supplies.
Procter & Gamble Co PG.N fell 5.0% after predicting full-year earnings below analysts' estimates as the consumer goods giant struggles with surging transportation and commodity costs.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.30-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.20-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded one new 52-week high and 32 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 25 new highs and 25 new lows.

2022-07-29 00:00:00+00:00,Intel's (INTC) Q2 Earnings and Revenues Miss Estimates,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-intc-q2-earnings-and-revenues-miss-estimates,,,"Intel Corporation INTC reported weak second-quarter 2022 results, wherein both the bottom line and the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
Quarter Details
The company reported a GAAP net loss of $454 million or a loss of 11 cents per share in the second quarter against a net income of $5,061 million or $1.24 per share in the year-ago quarter. The significant decline was due to a sudden and rapid fall in economic activity that resulted in top-line contraction. Non-GAAP earnings in the reported quarter were $1,181 million or 29 cents per share compared with $5,571 million or $1.36 per share a year ago. The bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 40 cents.
GAAP revenues were $15,321 million, down 22% year over year, owing to softness in the end consumer and educational market demand. In response to supply chain and match-set issues, the company is closely collaborating with customers and suppliers to effectively address their most critical needs. Non-GAAP revenues totaled $15,321 million compared with $18,533 million in the year-earlier quarter. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $17,921 million.

Segment Performance
Intel has reorganized its business segments to better reflect the growth in both large traditional markets and high-growth emerging markets for increased transparency, focus and accountability.

Client Computing Group (CCG, 49.6% of total operating segment revenues) revenues were down 25.2% year over year to $7,665 million. This was impacted largely by global TAM weakness, particularly in consumer, education, and small/medium business markets.

Datacenter and AI Group (DCAI, 30.1%) revenues fell 16.2% year over year to $4,649 million. This was due to OEM inventory reductions, mix-related ASP decline and competitive pressures. The company has a singular focus on regaining performance and TCO leadership across all workloads and use cases from enterprise to cloud.

Network and Edge Group (NEX, 15.1%) revenues improved 10.8% to $2,333 million. This was due to the strength and data center networking products, specifically networking Ethernet and 5G. It began shipping Mount Evans, an IPU the company co-developed, and is now beginning to ramp with a large hyperscale partner.

Revenues from Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group (AXG, 1.2%) were up to $186 million. This was due to the ramp-up of Super Compute and Alchemist discrete GPU products. The energy-efficient blockchain accelerator Blockscale achieved a major milestone in revenue shipments to the company’s lead customers going from tape-in to shipping in less than a year. Mobileye (3%) revenues were up 40.7% to $460 million. Intel Foundry Services (IFS, 0.8%) revenues were $122 million.
Other Operating Details
Non-GAAP gross margin was 44.8%, down 1500 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP research and development and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased to $5.5 billion from $4.6 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin contracted 2,570 bps year over year to 9.2%.
CCG operating income was down 73% year over year to $1,085 million, while DCAI operating income fell 89.8% to $ 214 million. NEX operating income fell to $241 million from $605 million, while Mobileye’s operating income improved to $190 million from $133 million a year ago.
Cash Flow & Liquidity
As of Jun 30, 2022, Intel had cash and cash equivalents of $4,390 million, with $32,548 million of long-term debt. The company generated $6,700 million of cash from operations in the first six months of 2022 compared with $14,149 million in the prior-year period.
Outlook
For the third quarter of 2022, Intel expects non-GAAP revenues to be around $15-16 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin is likely to be 46.5%. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be 35 cents per share.
For 2022, the company expects non-GAAP revenues to be around $65-68 billion, down from prior expectations of $76 billion owing to challenging macroeconomic conditions with high probability of a recession and supply-chain headwinds due to COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. Non-GAAP gross margin is likely to be 49%. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be $2.30 per share.

2022-07-29 00:00:00+00:00,PBF Energy and Southern Copper have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pbf-energy-and-southern-copper-have-been-highlighted-as-zacks-bull-and-bear-of-the-day,,,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – July 29, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares PBF Energy PBF as the Bull of the Day and Southern Copper SCCO as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN and Intel INTC.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
Bull of the Day:
PBF Energy, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has been a substantial beneficiary of higher commodity prices over the past year. PBF had been steadily outperforming the market before pulling back along with the energy sector over the past month. With oil looking to stabilize in the short-term, along with hints from the Fed regarding the potential for slower rate hikes in the future, energy stocks such as PBF are looking to begin the next leg up. The retreat in price over the past few weeks presents investors with a solid buying opportunity.
PBF sports the highest Zacks Growth and Value Style Scores of ‘A’. The company is part of the Zacks Oil and Gas – Refining and Marketing industry group, which ranks in the top 2% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. This group has widely outperformed the market this year, advancing more than 26% while the S&P 500 is in a deep correction.
Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It’s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.
Company Description
PBF Energy is a leading refiner that produces gasoline, diesel, heating oil, jet fuel, and petrochemicals. The company sells its products in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. PBF also provides rail, truck, and marine transportation services. PBF Energy was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in Parsippany, NJ.
Earnings Trends and Future Estimates
PBF has surpassed earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters. The refiner reported Q2 EPS just yesterday of $10.58/share, a 43.75% surprise over the $7.36 consensus estimate. PBF has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 77.97%.
Analysts are in agreement in terms of earnings revisions and have increased their estimates across the board.  For the third quarter, analysts covering PBF have increased their estimates by 123.03% in the past 60 days. The Q3 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate now stands at $3.68, translating to a staggering potential growth rate of 2,966.67% relative to the same quarter last year.
For the full year, analysts have bumped up their earnings projections by 164.11% in the past 60 days. The 2022 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is now $12.73, reflecting anticipated growth of 609.2% relative to last year. Revenues are expected to climb 39.36% to $37.98 billion. Clearly, the growth is there for PBF investors.
Stock Performance & Valuation
PBF shares have advanced over 230% in the past year. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to make this type of price move while the major indices are in a correction. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions. Shares have advanced over 140% this year alone.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. And as we know, PBF Energy has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and PBF continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year. Cautious investors may feel hesitant about investing in a stock that has come this far, but the fact is this elite company is still outperforming.
Despite the impressive performance, PBF remains relatively undervalued, irrespective of the metric used:
Bottom Line
Solid institutional buying should continue to provide a tailwind for the stock price. PBF is ranked favorably by our Style Score Categories with an ‘A’ for Value and ‘A’ for Growth, paving the way for an overall ‘A’ VGM score. This indicates that there’s a strong likelihood that PBF’s outperformance will continue on the heels of strong sales and earnings growth.
Robust fundamentals combined with a strong technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix. Backed by a leading industry group and robust history of earnings beats, it’s not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. This market winner continues to prove its doubters wrong, and investors would be wise to consider PBF as a portfolio candidate if they haven’t already done so.
Bear of the Day:
Southern Copper is engaged in the mining, smelting, and refining processes of copper and other minerals. The company operates internationally in Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Ecuador, and Chile. SCCO is also involved in the production of refined gold, silver, and other materials. In addition, the company operates a host of underground mines that produce zinc and lead. SCCO was incorporated in 1952. Based in Phoenix, AZ, Southern Copper operates as a subsidiary of Americas Mining Corporation.
The Zacks Rundown
SCCO, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Mining – Non Ferrous industry group, which ranks in the bottom 8% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. This group has fallen over 25% year-to-date, widely underperforming the -15% decline from the S&P 500.
Candidates in the bottom tiers of industries can often be solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a poor-performing industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much tougher.
The odds are stacked against SCCO, and the stock is agreeing with this notion. SCCO experienced a climax top back in April and has been in a price downtrend ever since. The share price is hitting a series of 52-week lows and represents a compelling short opportunity as the market continues its volatile start to the year.
Southern Copper is also relatively overvalued, irrespective of the valuation metric used.
Recent Earnings Misses and Deteriorating Forecasts
SCCO has fallen short of earnings estimates in two of the last three quarters. The mining company most recently reported Q2 earnings earlier this week of $0.56/share, missing the $0.95/share consensus estimate by -41.05%. The stock has moved steadily lower since the announcement, even as the market has rallied.
The company has posted a trailing four-quarter average earnings miss of -10.91%. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and SCCO is no exception.
Analysts are in agreement in terms of earnings revisions, and have slashed estimates across the board. For the full year, EPS projections have declined 10.39% to $3.71/share, reflecting negative growth of -15.49% relative to last year.
Declining earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.
Technical Outlook
SCCO is in a sustained downtrend. The stock has plunged below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling in sight. Also, both moving averages have rolled over and are sloping down – another good sign for the bears.
While not the most accurate indicator, SCCO has also experienced what is known as a 'death cross,' wherein the stock's 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. SCCO would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. The stock has fallen nearly 20% this year alone.
Final Thoughts
A deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to print new highs anytime soon. The fact that SCCO is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock's downtrend.
Our Zacks Style Scores depict a weakening outlook for this stock, as SCCO is rated a 'C' in our Growth category. Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of an overvalued SCCO until the situation shows major signs of improvement.

Amazon, Apple Up on Earnings, Intel Takes a Bath
Market indices rallied off yesterday morning's lineup of economic data that in more unforgiving times (say, a month or two ago) might have met the buzzsaw; nowadays, we see grow across the board: the Dow was +332 points on the day, +1.03%, while the Nasdaq grew +130 points, +1.08%. Further, the S&P 500 at +1.21% and the small-cap Russell 200 +1.34% rounded out a positive trading day.
Renowned investor Leon Cooperman recently described a market ""bottom"" as having occurred when trading is impervious to bad news. Well, bad news is what we got ahead of Thursday's open, where Q2 GDP posted a negative headline for the second-straight quarter while jobless claims' 4-week moving average keeps climbing. It's been a rough quarter but a ""so far, so good"" Q2 earnings season — at least ahead of yesterday afternoon's marquee reports:
Apple notched its third-straight earnings beat in its fiscal Q3 results, reaching $1.20 per share for a 6-cent beat (though still below the year-ago's $1.30 per share). Revenues posted a slight beat to $82.96 billion from $81.99 billion in the Zacks consensus. Shares of the world's largest gadget maker were up +3% in after-market trading.
iPhone sales are still the bread and butter of Apple, and these came in better than expected to 40.67 billion units sold in the past three months. Its Services revenue was a tad below expectations at $19.6 billion, while Mac sales dropped -10% on supply constraints and foreign exchange headwinds. But considering its China business only came in -1% in a very challenging quarter, we'd have to see this quarter from Apple as not only being better than expected, but as strong as reasonably expected.
Shares of Amazon bloomed +10% in late trading, even though the company posted a -20 cent loss per share in Q2, as opposed to a 15-cent gain. Revenues came in better than expected, however: $121.23 billion versus $119.67 billion expected. The company took a $6 billion charge in the quarter to adjust for extra labor and capacity, which may explain the bottom-line big miss.
Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud-based profit engine outpaced expectations in the quarter: $19.74 billion surpassed the anticipated $19.54 billion, while Advertising revenue grew +21% year over year to $8.76 billion, above the expected $8.65 billion. Online Stores and Subscribers came in a little short of estimates, but overall results were, just like Apple, better than expected.
Intel, however, is a different story: in an absolute nightmare quarter, the chip-making giant posted earnings of 29 cents per share, less than half the 69 cents expected and more than 4x lower than the $1.28 per share in the year-ago quarter. CEO Pat Gelsinger said the quarter was ""below standard"" and that they ""can and must do better."" It's the company's first miss in more than eight years.
Guidance for Q3 was abysmal, as well: 30 cents per share is expected on the bottom line, less than half the 90 cents in the Zacks consensus, while revenues next quarter, which had previously been expected to reach $18.91 billion, are now guiding to a range of $15-16 billion. The company also posted its worst Data Center revenue, perhaps ever, -16%. Shares were down -10% in late-session trading.
In other news, the Chips Act passed Congress Thursday, which will allot more than $50 billion to semiconductor companies to begin generating chips in the U.S. This is widely seen as not only good for supply-chain initiatives that rely on advanced technology, like automobile dashboards, but a win for national security. It's also seen as a hedge against possible aggression in Taiwan by China.

2022-07-29 00:00:00+00:00,Why Intel Stock Tanked on Friday,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-stock-tanked-on-friday,,,"What happened
Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) were down 10.5% as of 9:44 a.m. ET on Friday after the chipmaker delivered disappointing earnings results following the market close on Thursday.
The stock has fallen 30% year to date and has significantly lagged the return of the S&P 500 index due to competitive pressures. The company is now dealing with soft economic activity, which doubles the blow.
So what
Revenue fell 22% versus the year-ago quarter, which hit the bottom line hard, as non-GAAP earnings per share plunged 79%. CEO Pat Gelsinger cited ""the sudden and rapid decline in economic activity"" as the biggest factor leading to the weak performance, along with execution issues.
During theearnings call management blamed inventory reductions, lower selling prices, and competitive pressures for a 16% year-over-year decline in the data center and AI Group segment.
Investors will have to wait to see whether some of the economic pressures also hit Advanced Micro Devices when it reports earnings results on Tuesday, Aug. 2. AMD has been gaining market share in both the consumer desktop and server markets. Analysts currently project AMD to grow revenue by 59% this year.
Now what
Intel's mention of execution missteps is troubling news for investors. In 2021, Gelsinger became CEO to fix previous execution issues that caused the company to fall behind the innovation curve of its smaller rival.
Intel said it will slow hiring and capital spending to maintain its previous guidance for adjusted free cash flow of negative $1 billion to positive $2 billion for the full year. This may only fuel AMD's momentum, as it remains on offense after recently completing the acquisition of programmable chip supplier Xilinx.

July 28 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O lowered its full-year revenue forecast on Thursday as demand for its chips used in personal computers cools off from pandemic highs, sending shares of the company down 5% in extended trade.
It now expects fiscal 2022 revenue between $65 billion and $68 billion, compared with its earlier forecast of $76 billion, as runaway inflation and the reopening of offices and schools lead people to spend less on PCs.
Chipmakers are also under pressure from a spate of COVID curbs in key PC market China and the Ukraine war that have worsened supply-chain snarls and dragged demand further. Global shipments of PCs are expected to drop 9.5% this year, according to IT research firm Gartner.
Intel draws about half of its revenue from selling the chips that power desktops and laptops.
In the second quarter, revenue at Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG), which supplies PC makers and is the largest contributor to the company's revenue, fell 25% to $7.7 billion.

2022-07-28 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) Q2 Earnings and Revenues Lag Estimates,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-q2-earnings-and-revenues-lag-estimates,,,"Intel (INTC) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.29 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.69 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.28 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -57.97%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this world's largest chipmaker would post earnings of $0.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.87, delivering a surprise of 8.75%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.
Intel, which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, posted revenues of $15.32 billion for the quarter ended June 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14.51%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $19.63 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Intel shares have lost about 22% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -15.6%.
What's Next for Intel?
While Intel has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Intel: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.90 on $18.91 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.46 on $75.03 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor - General is currently in the top 36% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
Another stock from the same industry, Amtech Systems (ASYS), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2022.
This provider of equipment for solar panel and semiconductor makers is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1200%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
Amtech Systems' revenues are expected to be $14 million, down 39.4% from the year-ago quarter.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-07-28 00:00:00+00:00,"Amazon, Apple Up on Earnings; Intel Takes a Bath",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-apple-up-on-earnings-intel-takes-a-bath,,,"Market indices rallied off a morning’s lineup of economic data that in more unforgiving times (say, a month or two ago) might have met the buzzsaw; today, we see grow across the board: the Dow was +332 points on the day, +1.03%, while the Nasdaq grew +130 points, +1.08%. Further, the S&P 500 at +1.21% and the small-cap Russell 200 +1.34% round out a positive trading day.

Renowned investor Leon Cooperman recently described a market “bottom” as having occurred when trading is impervious to bad news. Well, bad news is what we got ahead of today’s open, where Q2 GDP posted a negative headline for the second-straight quarter while jobless claims’ 4-week moving average keeps climbing. It’s been a rough quarter but a “so far, so good” Q2 earnings season — at least ahead of this afternoon’s marquee reports:

Apple AAPL notched its third-straight earnings beat in its fiscal Q3 results, reaching $1.20 per share for a 6-cent beat (though still below the year-ago’s $1.30 per share). Revenues posted a slight beat to $82.96 billion from $81.99 billion in the Zacks consensus. Shares of the world’s largest gadget maker are up +3% in after-market trading.

iPhone sales are still the bread and butter of Apple, and these came in better than expected to 40.67 billion units sold in the past three months. Its Services revenue was a tad below expectations at $19.6 billion, while Mac sales dropped -10% on supply constraints and foreign exchange headwinds. But considering its China business only came in -1% in a very challenging quarter, we’d have to see this quarter from Apple as not only being better than expected, but as strong as reasonably expected.

Shares of Amazon AMZN bloomed +10% in late trading, even though the company posted a -20 cent loss per share in Q2, as opposed to a 15-cent gain. Revenues came in better than expected, however: $121.23 billion versus $119.67 billion expected. The company took a $6 billion charge in the quarter to adjust for extra labor and capacity, which may explain the bottom-line big miss.

Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud-based profit engine outpaced expectations in the quarter: $19.74 billion surpassed the anticipated $19.54 billion, while Advertising revenue grew +21% year over year to $8.76 billion, above the expected $8.65 billion. Online Stores and Subscribers came in a little short of estimates, but overall results were, just like Apple, better than expected.

Intel INTC, however, is a different story: in an absolute nightmare quarter, the chip-making giant posted earnings of 29 cents per share, less than half the 69 cents expected and more than 4x lower than the $1.28 per share in the year-ago quarter. CEO Pat Gelsinger said the quarter was “below standard” and that they “can and must do better.” It’s the company’s first miss in more than eight years.

Guidance for Q3 was abysmal, as well: 30 cents per share is expected on the bottom line, less than half the 90 cents in the Zacks consensus, while revenues next quarter, which had previously been expected to reach $18.91 billion, are now guiding to a range of $15-16 billion. The company also posted its worst Data Center revenue, perhaps ever, -16%. Shares are down -10% in late-session trading.

In other news, the Chips Act passed Congress today, which will allot more than $50 billion to semiconductor companies to begin generating chips in the U.S. This is widely seen as not only good for supply-chain initiatives that rely on advanced technology, like automobile dashboards, but a win for national security. It’s also seen as a hedge against possible aggression in Taiwan by China.

2022-07-28 00:00:00+00:00,September 9th Options Now Available For Intel (INTC),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/september-9th-options-now-available-for-intel-intc,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options begin trading today, for the September 9th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new September 9th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $39.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.85. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $39.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $37.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $39.71/share today.
Because the $39.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.74% return on the cash commitment, or 40.27% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $39.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.78. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $39.71/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $40.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.21% if the stock gets called away at the September 9th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $40.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.48% boost of extra return to the investor, or 38.05% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $39.71) to be 32%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-07-28 00:00:00+00:00,Put All Your Chips on Intel Stock as Funding Bill Moves Forward,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/put-all-your-chips-on-intel-stock-as-funding-bill-moves-forward,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Microprocessor manufacturer Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is likely to benefit from the CHIPS for America Act, also known as the Chips Act, if the U.S. government makes it a law. Besides, INTC stock offers a terrific value now and Intel’s dividend only sweetens the deal.
2022 has been a rough year for America’s chipmakers. However, oftentimes adversity will bring outstanding values in the financial markets. As we’ll see, negative pressure on the Intel share price is really just an opportunity for forward-thinking investors to take a position.
Furthermore, legislators on Capitol Hill seem to be ready to rescue Intel and American semiconductor manufacturers in general. If the government is prepared to chip in, then perhaps there’s hope for an imminent turnaround for Intel.
INTC Intel $39.69
What’s Happening With INTC Stock?
INTC stock has a 52-week high of $56.28, but today the share price is much lower than that. Value seekers ought to be salivating at the chance to get in now, as Intel’s trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is extremely low at 6.6.
7 Dividend Stocks to Buy on the Dip
Among U.S. tech giants, Intel is also a dividend darling. Income-focused investors should be glad to know that Intel pays a forward annual dividend yield of 3.6%.
Granted, not everyone’s ultra-bullish on microprocessor stocks now. In particular, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari lowered his calendar-year 2023 earnings forecasts for chipmakers and semiconductor-equipment stocks by an average of 20%. This reflects the analyst’s concerns about continued deterioration in the macroeconomic environment.
“None of our companies are immune to a slowdown in global GDP,” Hari wrote. His point is duly noted, but the bulls might counter that macroeconomic problems have been factored into the INTC stock price already. That’s why the shares are so cheap right now.
Pro-Chipmakers Bill Moves Forward
Help is on the way: That’s the apparent message from the U.S. Senate as it voted to more forward with the Chips Act. Specifically, the Senate approved a procedural measure that sets the stage for potential votes on the Chips Act in the Senate and House of Representatives.
What’s the bill worth in dollar terms? Senate aides reportedly stated that the Chips Act includes around $54 billion in subsidies for U.S. semiconductor companies. They also said that there’s a four-year 25% tax credit to encourage companies to build plants in the U.S. It’s been estimated that the tax credit is worth roughly $24 billion.
It’s not hard to connect the dots between the Chips Act and Intel’s plans to build a chipmaking factory in Ohio. Intel could potentially spend $100 billion to establish eight fabrication plants in total, and the Chips Act would certainly help Intel achieve this ambitious objective.
What You Can Do Now
There’s no guarantee that the Chips Act will be passed into law. So far, though, there appears to be support in Congress for the bill. President Joe Biden seems likely to sign the bill if it reaches his desk.
Hari’s warning about U.S. chipmakers shouldn’t be ignored. There are macroeconomic factors that investors should keep in mind. Still, INTC stock has already been slammed as Wall Street has considered these factors.
With a little bit of help from Washington, INTC stock could be poised for a comeback. Investors can take a long position while the stock is still bargain-priced.

2022-07-28 00:00:00+00:00,Is iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) a Strong ETF Right Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-ishares-msci-usa-value-factor-etf-vlue-a-strong-etf-right-now-3,,,"The iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) was launched on 04/16/2013, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.
There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.
By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.
Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Blackrock, VLUE has amassed assets over $9.11 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Value. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index before fees and expenses.
The MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index is based on a traditional market capitalization-weighted parent index, the MSCI USA Index which includes U.S. large and mid capitalization stocks.
Cost & Other Expenses
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.15%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.
It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 3.05%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 27.90% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Telecom round out the top three.
When you look at individual holdings, At&t Inc (T) accounts for about 5.82% of the fund's total assets, followed by Intel Corporation Corp (INTC) and Pfizer Inc (PFE).
The top 10 holdings account for about 32.62% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF has lost about -13.54% so far this year and is down about -5.78% in the last one year (as of 07/28/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $88.40 and $114.92.
VLUE has a beta of 1.03 and standard deviation of 26.96% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 155 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
IShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.
IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) tracks Russell 1000 Value Index and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) tracks CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $52.62 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $96.65 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.19% and VTV charges 0.04%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Value.

2022-07-27 00:00:00+00:00,Taiwan chipmaker UMC sees further growth for sector into 2023,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/taiwan-chipmaker-umc-sees-further-growth-for-sector-into-2023,,,"By Sarah Wu
TAIPEI, July 27 (Reuters) - Taiwanese chipmaker United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) 2303.TW said on Wednesday it sees continued growth for the industry into next year, even as soaring inflation and recession fears cool demand for consumer electronics.
""After two very strong years in the semi market - we call it a supercycle - and hitting the recent turbulence and disruption from the market, and after this rising macro uncertainty, higher inflationary cost issues, we still foresee the foundry industry growing in 2023,"" co-president Jason Wang told anearnings call
""It will be more moderate, but it is going to be another growth year.""
UMC, whose clients include Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Germany's Infineon IFXGn.DE, benefited from a global chip shortage that has kept chipmakers' order books full over the past two years.
While companies such as Micron Technology Inc MU.O have recently signalled waning demand for chips, prompting investor concern that the industry may slide into a down cycle, UMC said stable demand in its networking, industrial, and auto segments helped offset softening demand for smartphones and notebooks.
""We foresee our Q3 loading will be full,"" Wang said, as UMC reported a 41.5% year-on-year jump in second-quarter revenue to a record high of T$72.06 billion ($2.4 billion).
""Despite the rising uncertainty of the macro outlook, our view of the 2022 foundry industry growth of 20 percent plus remains unchanged. And our target is to grow in line or higher than the foundry industry.""
Earlier this month, Taiwan's TSMC 2330.TW, the world's largest contract chipmaker, forecast revenue growth for the current quarter potentially at its highest in 10 quarters, citing surging long-term demand, including for chips used in data centres and electric vehicles.
U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O said this month it had informed customers of plans to increase prices for many of its chip products due to rising costs.

2022-07-27 00:00:00+00:00,Semiconductor ETFs in Spotlight Ahead of Q2 Earnings,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/semiconductor-etfs-in-spotlight-ahead-of-q2-earnings,,,"The semiconductor space has been seeing huge investor interest this year amid the weakness in stock prices. Investors are betting that the industry will rebound from the supply-chain hitches and chip shortages that have pushed the stocks lower.

iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH and First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL have plunged nearly 5% each over the past three months. The weak trend might reverse in the weeks ahead as the Q2 earnings season unfolds. Texas Instruments TXN came up with robust results, beating revenue and earnings estimates for the second quarter. It also guided solid revenues for the ongoing quarter, citing easing COVID-19 lockdowns in China. The result is expected to provide fuel to the sector.

Additionally, the bill, designed to encourage semiconductor manufacturing and set for voting this week, will provide a boost to the stocks if passed (read: Bet on Top-Ranked Semiconductor ETFs Amid Surging Sales).

Some other well-known players in the space like Intel INTC, Qualcomm QCOM, NVIDIA NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD will report earnings in the coming days. Let’s delve into the financial picture of the companies that have a higher allocation in the above-mentioned ETFs and the power to move the funds up or down as Q2 earnings unfold. SOXX is largely concentrated on four firms with a combined share of 26.3%, followed by 23.6% for SMH and 15.2% for FTXL.

Per our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Inside Our Earnings Prediction
Intel is slated to release earnings after market close on Jul 28. It has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -9.01%. The stock saw negative earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Intel delivered an earnings surprise of 26.17%, on average, for the preceding four quarters.

Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.63%. The stock witnessed no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter and delivered an earnings surprise of 11.36% in the trailing four quarters, on average. The company is expected to report earnings after the closing bell on Jul 27 (see: all the Technology ETFs here).

NVIDIA, expected to report on Aug 24, has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -0.36%. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 5.30%, on average, over the past four quarters. It saw negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the quarter to be reported.

Advanced Micro Devices has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.66%. Its earnings surprise history is impressive, with the average beat being 18.53% for the preceding four quarters. The stock witnessed no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the quarter to be reported. The company is slated to report earnings on Aug 2 after the closing bell.
Conclusion
Semiconductor ETFs might see smooth trading in the weeks ahead as SOXX, SMH and FTXL have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 or 2. This suggests outperformance in the weeks ahead.

2022-07-27 00:00:00+00:00,"Gartner forecasts chip sales growth to slow down in 2022, fall next year",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/gartner-forecasts-chip-sales-growth-to-slow-down-in-2022-fall-next-year,,,"By Supantha Mukherjee
STOCKHOLM, July 27 (Reuters) - IT research firm Gartner said on Wednesday it expects global semiconductor sales growth to slow down in 2022 and fall 2.5% next year, hurt by weak sales of mobile phones and personal computers.
Rising inflation, and higher energy and fuel costs are putting pressure on consumer disposable income, affecting spending on electronic products such as PCs and smartphones, the research firm said.
It forecast global semiconductor revenue to grow 7.4% in 2022 to $639.2 billion, down from its previous view of 13.6% growth, and compared with growth of 26.3% last year.
For next year, Gartner expects chip revenue to contract to $623.1 billion.
""It could easily be a lot worse than that, but it will probably bottom out next year and then start to recover in 2024,"" Richard Gordon, vice president at Gartner, said in an interview.
Higher demand for smartphones and PCs during the pandemic overwhelmed chip factories, leading to shortages in other industries, increasing prices and delaying production.
However, mobile phone shipments in 2022 are now expected to fall to 1.46 billion units from 1.57 billion.
When millions of cell phones are taken out of the market, the market flips into an oversupply and chip pricing tends to fall dramatically, Gordon said.
Against the backdrop of chip shortage, the European Union and the United States have also announced big subsidy plans to attract chipmakers such as Intel INTC.O to build factories on their shores to reduce dependency on Asian suppliers.
While TSMC 2330.TW, the world's largest contract chipmaker, and chip-gear maker ASML ASML.AS have reported strong results, chipmaker Micron MU.O had warned of a down cycle.
Some global manufactures, including Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, Nokia NOKIA.HE and ABB ABBN.S, said they are seeing an easing of the shortage.
Supply constraints are still there in some sectors, such as in 5G equipment, but that the market should be in better shape in the first half of next year, Gordon said.

2022-07-27 00:00:00+00:00,7 Stocks Trading at a Huge Discount,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-trading-at-a-huge-discount,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Equity markets tend to behave irrationally sometimes. And that can make it easier — or sometimes harder — to find stocks trading at a discount. And I have two strategies to talk about today that can help you find the winners.
Right now, for example, the U.S. employment rate is rising but the other hand, cost inflation is at its highest levels in the last 41 years. The Federal Reserve is therefore compelled to try to bring inflation under control. However, the action is likely to push the economy into recession. Investors are scared and pulling back.
First, investing in blue chip companies with strong fundamentals would be a wise investment decision here. Large-cap value stock can provide some stability during turbulent times. I have selected four large-cap value stocks trading at a discount based on their forward price-earnings multiple.
Second, investors could look at growth stocks with promising stories, as they tend to react more with respect to the market. Therefore, corrections are overdone, so some of these stocks can be a golden opportunity long-term. I have compiled a list of three such stocks.
7 Seriously Undervalued Tech Stocks to Buy Now
So today’s final list of stocks trading at a discount is:
XOM Exxon Mobil $89.63
WMT Walmart $121.98
F Ford $12.54
INTC Intel $38.96
RIVN Rivian Automotive $31.69
RBLX Roblox $38.97
XPEV XPeng $24.39
Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM)

Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock has gained 46% year to date, far better than the S&P 500’s 20% decline over the same period. The company has been gaining on the back of rising oil prices.
Crude oil price spiked to over $120. Further, the Russia-Ukraine war and rising oil demand with a normalizing economy created ample opportunities for the company to grow. In the last 12 months, XOM generated $53.7 billion in cash flow from operations, which is huge. As a result, the company pared down its debt and enhanced shareholder’s value through stock repurchases worth $30 billion through 2023.
XOM has also laid out plans to increase production by 25% in the Permian Basin.
However, oil prices are declining now, which is not good news for the company. Given its break-even price of $41, there’s enough room for the company to still deliver solid results. For Q2 2022, Exxon is expected to post earnings of $3.89 per share, indicating a change of 254% year-over-year.
The company has been sharing its success with shareholders through regular dividend payments for last 100 years. During the period, it has increased its annual dividend payment for 39 consecutive years.
Walmart (WMT)
Source: fotomak / Shutterstock.com
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) enjoys its dominant position as a massive retailer in the United States and across the world.
The company has grown consistently at a rate of 3.4% over the last five years, clocking revenues of over $500 billion annually.
Its large scale of operations and strong distribution capabilities gives it a bargaining power over suppliers. As a result, even during a period of high inflation, WMT is able to offer its products at a discounted rate compared to competitors.
In Q1 2022, its top line surpassed consensus estimates to record revenues of $140.3 billion. Going forward, consensus estimates for topline in Q2 2022 is $148.3 billion, reflecting an year-over-year growth of 5.4%.

The company has a history of paying and raising its dividends over the last 49 years. It has repurchased 19% of its outstanding shares over the past decade.
Ford (F)
Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com
Ford (NYSE:F) has been a victim of shareholder’s negative sentiments since the first half of 2022. A 40% year-to-date price correction of this legacy carmaker seems overdone.
The stock is currently trading at a forward non-GAAP P/E multiple of 6.7x, which is significantly below the peer group average of 11.9x. A subdued growth in sales of company’s core, gasoline powered vehicles and big recalls of its EVs in the recent months have been the primary reason for this discounted valuation.
Its lower price and future growth prospects make it an attractive investment bet.
In June 2022, the company reported to increase its U.S. market share to 12.9% . While the industry’s auto sales were down 11% in the U.S. due to supply constraints, Ford managed to post sales growth of 31.5% led by the strength in F-Series, Explorer and new Expedition and Navigator SUVs.
The company’s F-150 lighting was the bestselling electric truck during the month, and electric vehicles grew 77% year-over-year during the month.
Management aims to deliver 600,000 EVs annually by the end of 2023. This number should increase to over 2 million units every year by the end of 2026.
Intel Corporation (INTC)

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is the world’s largest chipmaker and is known for its superior computer chip architecture. The company commands a 63.5% share of the central processing unit (CPU) industry.
At its current price, it is trading at a forward P/E multiple of 11.6x, reflecting huge discount compared to its peer group average of 17.7x. Given, the company’s strong fundamentals and growth plans, I expect positive returns in the future.
Most recently, INTC launched its new graphic processing unit (GPU), Arc A380, in the Chinese markets. If the product faces any hiccups, it can be fixed before its launch in the U.S. markets.
The company is also ramping up its production facility outside Columbus, Ohio, in an effort to expand geographically. However, it is pending regulatory approvals.

INTC has been distributing shareholder’s value through regular dividend payments. The company has a history of paying dividends over the last 29 years. It has a solid dividend yield of 3.6% versus industry average of 1.5%
Rivian Automotive (RIVN)
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock
Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is currently trading near the lower end of its 52-week range of $19.25-$179.47. The stock is down 69% year-to-date mostly due to worse-than-expected results over the last few quarters.
Supply chain constraints and higher input costs have also put the company under pressure.
As a result, management had to lower down Rivian’s full-year production targets for 2022 from 50,000 units to 25,000 units. Reflecting this, investors have been shying away from the stock. In fact, one of its largest shareholders, Ford dumped around 15 million shares of the company, adding to the negative sentiment.
However, I believe, the stock price correction is overdone. The company is showing significant signs of improvement. In July 2022, the company produced 4,401 vehicles and delivered 4,467 units in the Q2 2022 (four times higher than the last quarter), exceeding analysts’ expectations. Order back log remains strong, with a pre-order book of 90,000 units between R1T and R1S vehicles.
Rivian is taking corrective measures to curtail costs and ramp up production. Management plans to lay off 229 workers from its non-manufacturing unit.
It is also slated to launch a lower-priced SUV R2 and open a new manufacturing facility in Georgia utilizing its available cash of $17 billion.
Roblox Corporation (RBLX)
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com
Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) shares have also been losing their value as its primary consumers, teenagers, are returning to school and indulging in other activities thanks to a normalizing economy.
The supernormal growth enjoyed by the company during the pandemic could not be sustained. Between 2019 to 2021, revenue soared from $508.4 million to $1.9 billion, reflecting a compounded annual growth rate of 94%.
Although the growth has declined from its previous levels, revenues are still expected to rise in the range of 14% next year. This is decent, given an already higher base number.
I believe the negative sentiment in the stock is far too stretched. Year-to-date, the shares of this online gaming platform are down 62%.
The top line increased 39% to $537.1 million in Q1 2022. I also like the fact that Roblox reported free cash flow of $104.6 million for the quarter.

While daily average users have declined in the U.S. and Canadian (-2%), growth is steady in Europe (+20%) and high in APAC region (+94%). Management expects the Asia Pacific region to be the key growth driver in the future.
XPeng (XPEV)
Source: Koshiro K / Shutterstock
XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) stock is rebounding since June 2022, after a deep correction, led by a policy support in favor of EV makers in China.
On July 1, 2022, the company reported encouraging vehicle delivery report. In the second quarter, the company delivered an impressive 34,422 vehicles, exceeded estimates and representing a growth of 98% year-over-year. This is also the highest number of deliveries among emerging automakers in China for the fourth consecutive quarter, according to the company.
The company plans to accept preorders for its new G9 SUV in September. It also plans to release its new City Navigation Guided Pilot after obtaining relevant approvals. The new launches should further propel deliveries.
XPeng Chairman and CEO He Xiaopeng said the company aims to have a flying car in mass production by 2024. XPEV is expected to price the vehicle under 1 million yuan ($157,000), making to affordable so that it can be easily accessed by masses.
For Q2 2022, revenues are expected to be in the range of 6.8 billion yuan to 7.5 billion yuan, reflecting growth of ranging between 81% and 99%.
Given, XPeng’s growth presence in the international markets, especially Europe, its growth should remain robust.

2022-07-26 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-nasdaq%3Aintc-seems-to-use-debt-quite-sensibly,,,"David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?
When Is Debt Dangerous?
Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.
What Is Intel's Net Debt?
The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Intel had US$37.2b in debt in April 2022; about the same as the year before. But on the other hand it also has US$38.7b in cash, leading to a US$1.45b net cash position.
NasdaqGS:INTC Debt to Equity History July 26th 2022
A Look At Intel's Liabilities
We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Intel had liabilities of US$29.3b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$43.9b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$38.7b as well as receivables valued at US$7.86b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$26.7b.
Of course, Intel has a titanic market capitalization of US$160.3b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Intel also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.
On the other hand, Intel's EBIT dived 15%, over the last year. We think hat kind of performance, if repeated frequently, could well lead to difficulties for the stock. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Intel can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.
Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. Intel may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the most recent three years, Intel recorded free cash flow worth 70% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.
Summing Up
Although Intel's balance sheet isn't particularly strong, due to the total liabilities, it is clearly positive to see that it has net cash of US$1.45b. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$9.8b, being 70% of its EBIT. So we don't have any problem with Intel's use of debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Intel you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.
When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt. Readers can access a list of growth stocks with zero net debt 100% free, right now.
