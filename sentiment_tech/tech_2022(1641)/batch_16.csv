2022-09-23 00:00:00+00:00,Should iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) Be on Your Investing Radar?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-ishares-msci-usa-value-factor-etf-vlue-be-on-your-investing-radar-3,,,"The iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) was launched on 04/16/2013, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.
The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $7.74 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.
Why Large Cap Value
Large cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.
Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.
Costs
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.15%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.33%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 25.30% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, At&t Inc (T) accounts for about 4.81% of total assets, followed by Intel Corporation Corp (INTC) and Ford Motor Co (F).
The top 10 holdings account for about 27.17% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
VLUE seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index before fees and expenses. The MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index is based on a traditional market capitalization-weighted parent index, the MSCI USA Index which includes U.S. large and mid capitalization stocks.
The ETF has lost about -20.56% so far this year and is down about -11.66% in the last one year (as of 09/23/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $86.85 and $114.92.
The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 26.96% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 155 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
IShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, VLUE is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.
The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $49.54 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $94.16 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.
Bottom-Line
While an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.

2022-09-22 00:00:00+00:00,November 4th Options Now Available For Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/november-4th-options-now-available-for-intel,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the November 4th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new November 4th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $24.00 strike price has a current bid of 50 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $24.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $23.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $28.09/share today.
Because the $24.00 strike represents an approximate 15% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.08% return on the cash commitment, or 17.68% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $24.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $29.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.28. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $28.09/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $29.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.80% if the stock gets called away at the November 4th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $29.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $29.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.56% boost of extra return to the investor, or 38.68% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $28.09) to be 36%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

In this episode of ETF Spotlight, I speak with Lukas Smart, Managing Director, Head of U.S. iShares Factor Strategies at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. We discuss how investors can use factor ETFs to navigate choppy and uncertain markets.
Minimum volatility investing is back in vogue due to extremely challenging market environment. These ETFs hold up relatively well during market declines but may underperform the broader indexes during strong bull markets. Lukas explains why investors should consider a long-term strategic allocation to minimum volatility.
The iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol U.S.A. ETF USMV selects and weights companies to create a portfolio that has lower volatility relative to the broader market. Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX and Waste Management WM are its top holdings.
Value companies have generally outperformed growth companies during rising rates and inflationary environments.  Investors could consider combining minimum volatility exposure with value to achieve greater diversification benefits.
The iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF VLUE invests in large- and mid-cap stocks with lower valuations based on fundamentals. AT&T T and Intel INTC are its top holdings.
Factor returns have generally proven to be highly cyclical. And timing the market is never easy. Should investor also use multi-factor strategies?
Take a look the iShares U.S. Equity Factor ETF LRGF, which aims to maximize exposure to five factors – value, quality, momentum, low volatility, and small size. Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN are its top holdings.

2022-09-22 00:00:00+00:00,Best Stocks To Invest In Right Now? 3 Semiconductor Stocks To Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/best-stocks-to-invest-in-right-now-3-semiconductor-stocks-to-know,,,"Semiconductor stocks are referring to the shares of companies that design and manufacture semiconductor products, also known as chips. Actually, semiconductors are the building blocks of electronic devices such as computers, mobile phones, and TVs. As a result, chipmakers are among the most important suppliers to the technology industry. They play a key role in enabling manufacturers to miniaturize devices and make them more powerful. Because semiconductors are essential to so many consumer electronics devices, the semiconductor sector is watched closely by stock market investors.
They also tend to be very volatile, as demand for their products can fluctuate rapidly. For these reasons, semiconductor stocks are popular with investors. When looking for semiconductor stocks to buy, investors typically focus on large, well-established companies such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM). These companies have diversified businesses and a long track record of profitability.
While there are many smaller semiconductor companies that may offer more upside potential, they also tend to be riskier. As a result, it is important to do your research before investing in any semiconductor stocks. With this in mind, let’s dive into three top semiconductor stocks to watch in the stock market today.
Semiconductor Stocks To Watch Today

2022-09-22 00:00:00+00:00,How to Play Tesla’s Inevitable Demise,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-to-play-teslas-inevitable-demise,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
[Editor’s note: “How to Play Tesla’s Inevitable Demise” was previously published in June 2021. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]
Fortune favors the bold. Let’s hope fortune favors me when I say it may be time to bet against Tesla (TSLA).
Full disclosure: We own TSLA stock in our Innovation Investor portfolio. How could we not?
Elon Musk & Co. are at the forefront of three of the most disruptive technological shifts in the world today – EVs, solar, and battery storage.
But I’ve been putting some serious thought into finding innovative, disruptive tech companies with the potential for 2X, 5X, or 10X-plus gains.
While Tesla still has the potential for upside, we think there’s a much, much bigger opportunity elsewhere.
I’m growing increasingly bullish on the idea that Lucid Motors (LCID) is about to eat Tesla’s lunch. And as a result, Tesla stock will struggle in the coming years while Lucid Motors stock will roar higher.
It’s a bold claim, I know. I also know the dangers of betting against someone as visionary as Elon Musk, or a company with as much talent as Tesla, or a stock with as much momentum and support as TSLA’s had.
The short-seller graveyard is full of capable folks that got suckered into betting against  Tesla and got absolutely burned along the way.
However, as they say, past performance does not guarantee future results.
While the shorts have been dead-wrong about Tesla stock for years, it may finally be their time to shine.
You see, I’ve been a huge bull on Tesla stock. And I have scored my readers 2,000%-plus returns in the name. So, my sudden bearish stance on TSLA does not come from a place of hate for the company.
Rather, it comes from a handful of unbiased observations that Tesla’s brand equity and perception has been diluted. Not to mention its technology advantages have been narrowed. All set the stage for Tesla to lose significant market share to a newer entrant.
And who might that be? Lucid Motors stock.
Here’s the story.
Behind-the-Scenes Erosion at Tesla
For years, the bull thesis on Tesla has hinged on three critical competitive advantages:
Talent. As an influential visionary, Elon Musk is a top-tech talent magnet. Historically, the smartest engineers on the planet have wanted to work for him and at Tesla. That gave Tesla an unrivaled confluence of talent to build EVs.
Technology. Thanks to its unrivaled confluence of talent and huge head-start in the space, Tesla cars have historically been the best-performing cars in the market. Their market-leading battery technology unlocked longer ranges and faster recharge times.
Brand. Tesla is the only “cool,” sub-$100,000 auto brand in the world. And the company got to that point by developing an aura of exclusivity and uniqueness that made everyone want their cars.
Those advantages are now eroding.
Tesla has actually lost a bunch of talent over the past few years. Some has gone on to work at other auto companies. But most of that talent has actually churned to start their own EV startups, on the idea that they can build cars to rival Tesla cars.
The best-of-the-best of these Tesla-inspired startups? Lucid Motors.
Lucid Motors Brings the Talent
The company is led by Peter Rawlinson, the former chief engineer of the Tesla Model S. Yes. This is the engineering brain behind Tesla’s flagship car – the one that started it all.
Supporting him is an impressive team of former Tesla, Audi, Apple (AAPL), Samsung, Ford (F), Intel (INTC), and GM (GM) execs. We’re talking about folks who helped start Tesla and turn it into what it is today. And on top of that are very influential people behind some of Apple’s hero products, like the iPhone.
This is the most impressive confluence of talent in the EV industry outside of Tesla – and it’s not even close. Lucid Motor’s management team stacks up equally to the titan. And considering the current trend of Tesla losing talent and Lucid Motors gaining it, the latter will have much more talent than Tesla by 2025.
And indeed, with this remarkable engineering and design team behind it, Lucid has developed, tested, and fine-tuned some of the industry’s most impressive technology.
To answer your question, yes, this technology beats Tesla’s EV tech on every key performance indicator.
We’re talking longer driving ranges, more horsepower, denser motors, faster acceleration, tighter control – the works.
Tesla Is Being Surpassed
Over the past 10 years, Lucid has created an entirely in-house Lucid Electric Advanced Platform (or LEAP, for short). It comprises key competitive technological advantages including:
A low-floor, wide-base skateboard EV platform enables the company’s ultra-spacious “Space Concept” interior design and allows for more interior cabin space per square foot of vehicle platform than a Tesla car.
An incredibly power-dense drive unit that yields the most efficient battery in the EV industry with 4.5 miles / kWh (versus ~4 miles / kWh for Tesla Model S), and therefore unlocks farther driving ranges of over 500 miles (that’s on par with Tesla’s new super-premium Model S Plaid version), without compromising on performance.
An onboard boost-charge technology dubbed “Wunderbox” that enables ultra-fast charge rates and bidirectional power delivery, which includes vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-vehicle charging.
This world-class technology platform is backed by 403 patents – over 80% of which are already issued.
In other words, Tesla’s tech no longer stands alone as the best in the industry. Lucid Motors features a technology portfolio that, pound for pound, rivals and even exceeds Tesla’s.
Brand Dilution
Here’s the thing about cars. We don’t all want to drive the same one. Of particular relevance to Tesla, high-income folks want to drive nicer cars. It’s a status symbol of their wealth.
There’s a reason Porsche (POAHY), Maserati, and Lamborghini don’t make $20,000 cars that everyone can afford. They want to maintain premium brand equity. But Tesla has a dream of democratizing of EV ownership. And as a part of that dream, the company is working tirelessly to drive the price of its cars down to $20,000.
On one hand, that’s great because it means Tesla will unlock mainstream EV demand.
But on the other, it’s bad because it means Tesla is diluting its premium brand equity.
After all, there are tons of millionaires out there who simply won’t buy a car that a just-out-of-college kid could afford as their first.
Sure, there’s a difference between the Model 3 and the Model S. But the ostensible difference isn’t that big. (I have to look extra close to discern whether that’s a Model 3 or Model S on the road with me.) And it certainly isn’t big enough to save Tesla from inevitable premium brand equity erosion as its cars get progressively cheaper.
Yet, EV demand in the premium channel isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. If anything, it will only increase – meaning there is a unique and compelling opportunity over the next few years for a new EV brand to eat Tesla’s lunch in the premium channel.
Enter Lucid Motors
Lucid is positioning itself as a so-called “post-luxury” brand that focuses on elegance and modernity over the traditional legacy focal points – opulence and indulgence. The company has designed its cars with this post-luxury vibe in mind. Earthy tones. Sustainable materials. Simple controls. Connected ecosystem. End-to-end customer experience. Tech-forward. Peaceful ambience. These are attributes that consumers place a high value on today. And Lucid Motors knocks them all out of the park. It’s the dream car.
Importantly, for the next few years at least, it will be a car only the rich can afford. And as such, the Lucid Air will be the most in-demand premium EV in the early 2020s…
The Final Word
Lucid Motors has the talent, technology, and brand to not just rival Tesla in the premium EV market but to actually beat it at its own game.
Does that mean Tesla is dead? No. Far from it.
Tesla will grow like wildfire over the next few years, as the company sells a bunch of Model 3 and Y cars all across the globe, expands its solar business, and makes a successful push into the energy storage world.
But at its current valuation, Tesla stock is priced for perfection and then some. I’m growing skeptical that will happen. If it doesn’t, Tesla stock could be stuck treading water for the next few years.
The investment implication?
It may be time to forget TSLA stock. Buy stock in the companies stealing market share from Tesla – like Lucid Motors.
As I said, fortune favors the bold. If we’re right, it could be the most profitable move we’ve ever made.
Be at the forefront of this epic shift in next-gen mobility and make some monster gains.

2022-09-21 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shareholders have endured a 43% loss from investing in the stock a year ago,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-nasdaq%3Aintc-shareholders-have-endured-a-43-loss-from-investing-in-the-stock-a-year,,,"The simplest way to benefit from a rising market is to buy an index fund. But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. Investors in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 45%. That's disappointing when you consider the market declined 16%. We note that it has not been easy for shareholders over three years, either; the share price is down 42% in that time. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 23% in the last three months.
Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns.
In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
Even though the Intel share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It could be that the share price was previously over-hyped.
It seems quite likely that the market was expecting higher growth from the stock. But looking to other metrics might better explain the share price change.
We don't see any weakness in the Intel's dividend so the steady payout can't really explain the share price drop. In fact, it seems more likely that the revenue fall of 5.5% in the last year is the worry. So it seems likely that the weak revenue is making the market more cautious about the stock.
You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).

It's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecasts
A Different Perspective
We regret to report that Intel shareholders are down 43% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 16%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 2% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Intel better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Intel (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

WILMINGTON, Del, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc TWTR.N will question Elon Musk under oath in Delaware next week as part of the litigation in the billionaire's bid to walk away from his $44 billion deal for the social media company.
A Tuesday filing in Delaware's Court of Chancery said Musk's deposition is scheduled for Sept. 26-27 and may stretch into Sept. 28 if necessary.
The two sides are locked in an increasingly acrimonious legal battle that has swept up of some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley and Wall Street.
Subpoenas have being issued to billionaire Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle Corp ORCL.N, Intel Corp's INTC.O former Chief Executive Officer Robert Swan and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who is currently chief executive of Block Inc SQ.N.
A five-day trial is scheduled to begin on Oct. 17 in Wilmington, Delaware.
Each side has accused the other of breaking the April takeover agreement. Twitter wants a judge to order Musk, who is chief executive of Tesla Inc TSLA.O and the world's richest person, to buy the company as agreed for $54.20 per share.
Shares in San Francisco-based company were down slightly in early Tuesday trading at $41.54.

2022-09-20 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Might Be Moving On From Its Gaming GPU Ambitions -- That Wouldn't Be a Bad Thing,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-might-be-moving-on-from-its-gaming-gpu-ambitions-that-wouldnt-be-a-bad-thing,,,"Rumor has it that Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) Arc lineup of video gaming GPUs (graphics processing units) is already being nixed -- just a handful of years after originally being announced and long before any of these dedicated graphics cards ever really took root in the market. The rumor was recently circulated by YouTube poster Moore's Law Is Dead. For sure, it's just a rumor, and Intel has subsequently defended its Arc gaming lineup as safe. Time will tell what happens next.
Before I go into what I think all this means for the company (and the stock), I first want it known that I'm certainly not rooting against Intel. On the contrary; Intel is responsible for advancing much of the computing technology we take for granted every day, and I believe the world really needs this company to succeed.
However, the fact is that times have changed, and the competitive landscape is very different than it was a decade ago. Intel axing its Arc GPUs might not be happy news for gaming enthusiasts, but it could actually be a really good thing for Intel's long-term health -- as well as the health of the tech industry at large. Let me explain.
No low-hanging fruit in computing hardware
Let's not be naive about this. Intel was always going to have a steep uphill battle in the consumer GPU market -- especially for high-end chips that appeal to serious video game hobbyists and professionals. This is a space exclusively dominated by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and they've been at it for years. Even if Intel could design hardware that could compete (and I don't doubt it could with enough financial resources to pour into it), marketing it in such a way that consumers would take a high-end Arc GPU seriously is another story entirely.
Basically, Intel might simply need to cancel Arc because the payoff could take longer than it can afford to wait. Some estimates by industry analysts claim Intel has already lost billions on its Accelerated Computing and Graphics Group (AXG), and I don't think that is an exaggeration. Even simple chip-design work is costly and time-intensive. And you have to add the cost to set up new manufacturing lines to produce new chips because these modern tech building blocks are nothing short of marvels of engineering.
But here's the real rub: Intel just started breaking out the revenue of AXG in 2022, and so far, it's been underwhelming. AXG hauled in $186 million in Q2 2022 (up 5% year over year) and just $219 million in Q1 2022 (up 21% year over year). One might argue that this GPU segment is growing, but bear in mind that this is at a far slower pace than the multibillion-dollar GPU businesses of Nvidia and AMD have maintained for the last few years. Plus Intel has been losing market share in its Client Computing Group (CCG), a catch-all division for consumer-facing PCs and laptops, for quite some time, which makes the recent AXG performance all that more painful.
If that wasn't bad enough, Intel is going to take the same hit from the current downturn in consumer spending that other chip companies are starting to report. And even CEO Pat Gelsinger admitted that the Data Center Group (DCG, Intel's second-biggest moneymaker after CCG) would likely lose market share for at least a couple more years.
If Intel was an asset-light chip-engineering company only, maybe this wouldn't be such a big deal. At the very least, perhaps the company could report lower sales but still salvage its profit margins. But this isn't an asset-light chip-engineering company only; it's a vertically integrated engineering and manufacturing company. Lower chip sales indicate the company is running manufacturing lines that aren't being utilized at an efficient capacity.
In other words, Intel's profitability is about to get a really big haircut. With that being the case, it's time to start trimming the excess. My prediction? Farewell, Arc GPUs, we hardly knew you.
If not GPUs, then what?
GPUs might (or might not) be only the latest casualty. Gelsinger has been cutting loose lots of projects that don't jive with the IDM 2.0 strategy the company announced in early 2021. With extra savings realized from these cuts, Intel is revamping its manufacturing capabilities -- both for itself and for other chip-engineering companies. This new segment is called Intel Foundry Services, or IFS. Yup, another acronym to memorize, which really speaks to the sprawling and unfocused nature of Intel's chip empire in years past.
IFS is currently one of the tiniest business segments, bringing in just $122 million in sales in Q2 2022. But IFS lies at the heart of what Intel wants to do. Historically, the company has focused on producing its own in-house-designed silicon. Opening up its foundries to outsiders will be a big task -- and potentially a game changer for Intel (not to mention the semiconductor industry).
Intel's been busy on this front. It announced new fab investments at existing facilities in Arizona, a new fab complex in Ohio, research and manufacturing facilities across the European continent, and the acquisition of chip fab Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ: TSEM). With tens of billions in expected investment over the next decade, it's no wonder Gelsinger has been praising the passage of the U.S. Chips Act (about $52 billion dedicated to support U.S. chip manufacturing, as well as 25% tax credits for companies that expand operations in the States). It's just in time because Intel could surely use the help with its ambitious plan.
But here's the thing: Chip-manufacturing facilities take years to build and years more to ramp up to full production capacity. Intel will also have a marketing push to make as it tries to woo its semiconductor-design peers. The good news is that the world's demand for chips isn't going to diminish anytime soon. But it's going to be a long journey for Intel to transform itself.
How does all this affect Intel's stock?
This is no cheap stock. Shares currently trade for less than 16 times trailing-12-month free cash flow. However, the current outlook from Gelsinger and company is for adjusted earnings per share to get more than cut in half this year from 2021 and for free cash flow to turn negative. That means a much higher price-to-earnings ratio and nil free cash flow are coming.
This is an evolving story, and perhaps Intel moving on from its gaming GPU ambitions will help the profit picture for the immediate future. In fact, I believe it would be a good thing as Intel tries to support the booming chip manufacturing that will be needed in the decade ahead.
But I wouldn't buy Intel stock given all the present uncertainty -- not yet at least. Give this one some time to develop. There are better chip stock buys out there for now.

INTC stock has lost 43.2% so far in 2022. Further, the macroeconomic hurdles ahead do not point to a quick recovery in the cards.
Intel Is Sailing in Troubled Waters
Intel posted disappointing earnings results for the second quarter of 2022, with both revenue and earnings declining from the year-ago period. The company’s Client Computing and Datacenter and AI Groups businesses have been adversely impacted by sustained adverse market conditions. Citing the sluggish PC market as a concern, Intel also slashed its full-year guidance.
The semiconductor giant has also scaled back the valuation of its self-driving unit Mobileye to $30 billion from an initial valuation of $50 billion.
Furthermore, high inflation levels, weak global economic conditions, and pandemic-led purchases are expected to weigh on global shipment levels of traditional PCs and tablets.
The dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed significantly following the pandemic-led boom. Despite growing digitization trends, sluggish consumer spending on PCs, laptops, and smartphones, along with supply-chain disturbances and chip shortages, has kept the space clobbered.
Meanwhile, this U.S. chipmaker is expected to enjoy additional benefits than some of its rivals, from the recently passed Chips and Science Act. Also, Intel has managed to deliver an earnings beat in almost all the quarters in the last couple of years, except one. If the trend remains in the coming period, INTC stock should get some support.
Is Intel Buy Sell or Hold?
Analysts have mixed feelings about Intel stock. According to TipRanks, Street is neutral about INTC’s stock, which carries a Hold consensus rating based on four Buys, 16 Holds, and nine Sells. Further, hedge funds look apprehensive about INTC stock, as they have sold 1.3 million shares of INTC stock in the last quarter.
Meanwhile, financial bloggers and retail investors look bullish about INTC stock. Financial bloggers‘ opinions are 76% Bullish on INTC stock, above the sector average of 64%. Moreover, retail investors have increased their holdings in the INTC stock by 1.2% in the last 30 days.
Finally, Intel stock’s average price target of $38.55, signals a 30.9% upside potential from current levels.
Conclusion: Tough Times Ahead for Intel
Intel is firing on all cylinders to restore its lost sheen. Notably, the semiconductor giant has an impressive dividend yield of 4.93%, much higher than the sector average of 0.94%. However, the outlook for the chip industry remains cloudy as long as the macroeconomic challenges remain. Therefore, investors willing to hold a position in the stock can wait on the sidelines to get some more visibility about the semiconductor industry’s prospects.

2022-09-20 00:00:00+00:00,Is AMD a Buy?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-amd-a-buy,,,"This has been a bad year for semiconductor stocks following two years of healthy growth when supply was tight and demand was booming. That explains why the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index has lost 35% of its value in 2022.
Reports about high levels of semiconductor inventories and weakening demand have sent shockwaves through this once-high-performing sector. Not surprisingly, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) have borne the brunt of the broader semiconductor industry weakness, losing 47% of their value so far in 2022.
The U.S. government's latest sanctions on sales of artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China have further dented investor confidence in the stock despite AMD's solid results and sunny outlook. However, a closer look at the markets AMD is operating in indicates that it could defy any potential slowdown in semiconductor sales. Let's see why that may be the case.
AMD's market share growth could be its biggest catalyst
Sales of personal computers (PCs) have slowed down this year. As a result, sales of central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) that go into PCs have also taken a hit.
Mercury Research estimates that desktop CPU shipments fell to their lowest level in nearly thirty years in the second quarter of 2022. CPU giant Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) top and bottom lines were hammered thanks to tepid PC shipments. Chipzilla's non-GAAP revenue was down 17% year-over-year in Q2 to $15.3 billion. Its adjusted earnings fell a whopping 79% to $0.29 per share during the quarter as the non-GAAP operating margin declined a massive 25.7 percentage points over the prior year.
AMD's results, however, had a different story to tell last quarter. The chipmaker's revenue from the client processor segment, which includes sales of desktop and notebook processors, jumped 25% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. AMD recorded stronger average selling prices (ASPs) in this segment, which led to an increase of one percentage point in its operating margin over the prior-year period.
The strong performance from AMD's PC-related processor business was a result of its impressive share gains during the quarter. Mercury Research points out that AMD's desktop processor share increased 3.5 percentage points year-over-year to 20.6% in Q2. Notebook market share was up 4.8 percentage points to 24.8% during the quarter.
Simply put, AMD's market share gains are helping it mitigate the negative impact of a tepid end market. This trend could continue, as AMD's Ryzen 7000 series desktop processors are set to go on sale from Sept. 27.
These processors are based on AMD's new Zen 4 architecture, which uses a 5 nanometer (nm) manufacturing node. The new processors may offer a 15% boost in computing speed without any additional power consumption compared to the previous generation processors based on a 7nm node. What's more, they could reduce power consumption by 30% while running the same computing speed as the previous-generation processors.
Even better, AMD has gone aggressive with the pricing. The upcoming top-end Ryzen 7000 processor is priced $100 less than the erstwhile flagship, which was launched toward the end of 2020. All this indicates that AMD's market share growth in the PC processor market is here to stay. That could stay true for a while -- Intel's upcoming Raptor Lake chips, which are expected to hit the market this year, won't bring a big architectural improvement over its existing lineup, and will still be based on a 10nm platform.
It is the smaller process node that allows AMD to price its upcoming chips more competitively and eke out gains in terms of both power and efficiency. After all, it is less expensive to produce smaller chips, as the silicon wafer contains a larger number of physically smaller processors.
A similar scenario is likely to unfold in the server processor market. AMD gained 4.4 percentage points year-over-year in server processors in Q2. It controlled 13.9% of this market last quarter, indicating that it has huge room for growth in this space. AMD's Zen 4 architecture will also power the company's server processors, and could give it a leg up over Intel, whose Sapphire Rapids server processors (based on a 10nm process) will only hit high-volume production in the first quarter of 2023.
In all, share gains in the PC and server markets should help AMD overcome any weakness in semiconductor demand and sustain its impressive growth streak.
Is the stock worth buying?
Trading at 32 times trailing earnings and just 15 times forward earnings, AMD looks like a solid bargain right now. The stock's five-year average trailing price-to-earnings ratio stands at 101, and the forward multiple stands at 39. So investors can get their hands on AMD stock at a very nice discount right now.
What's more, buying AMD at its current valuation looks like a no-brainer given its terrific pace of growth. The company expects to finish 2022 with a 60% increase in revenue to $26.3 billion. The semiconductor stock could sustain such impressive growth in the long run thanks to its share gains in the lucrative markets that it is operating in. That's why investors would do well to accumulate AMD while it is beaten down, since its outstanding growth could give the stock a boost in the long run.

2022-09-19 00:00:00+00:00,Samsung climate inertia is by-product of Seoul's,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/samsung-climate-inertia-is-by-product-of-seouls,,,"Reuters
Reuters


HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Seoul's foot-dragging on climate change is holding back Korea Inc. Last week the country's top conglomerate, Samsung Electronics, unveiled an underwhelming net-zero carbon emissions target. Blame South Korea's power-market monopoly and regressive renewables policies.
    The world's largest chip and mobile-phone maker lags on decarbonisation. Apple, both a rival and a customer, intends to achieve carbon neutrality for its supply chain and products by 2030; Japan's Sony and TSMC in Taiwan recently committed to the same goal by 2040 and 2050 respectively. The $274 billion South Korean group is only targeting emissions from its own operations - and by 2050, a decade later than Intel's similar pledge.
    It's not entirely Samsung's fault. Its semiconductor and components business accounted for 90% of the company’s 17.4 million tonnes of greenhouse gases emitted last year. Most of that is probably from electricity for factories in South Korea, where renewable power is scarce. Solar and wind generated just 26.9 terawatt hours of electricity in 2021, a paltry 4.7% of the total and roughly equivalent to Samsung’s needs.
   One culprit is government-backed Korea Electric Power Corporation, or Kepco, which dominates power generation, transmission and distribution. Despite years of shareholder pressure, the $9 billion utility remains addicted to fossil fuels, which made up over 70% of its total capacity as of June. Some of its power-generating units are even slashing renewable investments, the Korea Times reports, as first-half losses at Kepco balloon to a whopping $7.7 billion.
    The government this year started allowing firms to buy from renewable-energy producers via direct power purchase agreements. Cutting out Kepco is a good step, but companies still must pay the utility incidental and network costs; these can total as much as 45% of current electricity prices, according to environmental group Solutions for Our Climate. Red tape around securing renewable project approvals has also pushed up prices.
    As the country's top exporter, Samsung should be in strong position to lobby for change. The company warned that if it does not meet its corporate customers' demands of using 100% renewable energy, some 25.8 trillion won ($18.5 billion), or a fifth of business-to-business sales, based on 2020 results, are at risk. Yet President Yoon Suk-yeol's administration plans to lower its renewable-energy target for 2030, favouring nuclear power instead. Samsung's corporate heft will be put to test.

CONTEXT NEWS
South Korea's Samsung Electronics on Sept. 15 announced a new environmental strategy that includes a commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in its own operations by 2050. As part of the initiative, it will invest over 7 trillion won ($5 billion) by 2030 in technology that it hopes, for example, will filter out greenhouse gases and capture carbon dioxide generated during chip production.
The company has also joined RE100, a group of global corporations including Apple, Intel and TSMC that are committed to using 100% renewable energy across their own operations.
Separately, South Korea's government wants to lower its renewable energy target for 2030, according to a draft electricity demand and supply plan from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy on Aug. 30. Renewable energy will account for 21.5% of generation capacity by 2030, down from the previous target of 30.2%.

2022-09-19 00:00:00+00:00,We Did The Math DLN Can Go To $70,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/we-did-the-math-dln-can-go-to-%2470,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the WisdomTree U.S. LargeCap Dividend Fund ETF (Symbol: DLN), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $70.33 per unit.
With DLN trading at a recent price near $59.64 per unit, that means that analysts see 17.92% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of DLN's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Comcast Corp (Symbol: CMCSA), Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC), and Lam Research Corp (Symbol: LRCX). Although CMCSA has traded at a recent price of $34.52/share, the average analyst target is 43.16% higher at $49.42/share. Similarly, INTC has 41.36% upside from the recent share price of $29.24 if the average analyst target price of $41.33/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting LRCX to reach a target price of $562.64/share, which is 37.49% above the recent price of $409.22. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of CMCSA, INTC, and LRCX:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
WisdomTree U.S. LargeCap Dividend Fund ETF DLN $59.64 $70.33 17.92%
Comcast Corp CMCSA $34.52 $49.42 43.16%
Intel Corp INTC $29.24 $41.33 41.36%
Lam Research Corp LRCX $409.22 $562.64 37.49%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2022-09-18 00:00:00+00:00,5 Dividend Stocks Yielding Over 5% to Boost Your Passive Income This September,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-dividend-stocks-yielding-over-5-to-boost-your-passive-income-this-september,,,"Stock prices have been under pressure this year as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to combat inflation. That's increasing the income yield on lower-risk investments like bonds and bank CDs. Dividend stock prices are falling as a result, boosting their yields to compensate investors for their higher risk profiles relative to bonds.
For investors willing to take on a bit more risk, many solid dividend stocks are looking more attractive as their prices fall and yields rise. Here are five high-quality companies with dividend yields above 5%. Those higher yields can provide a big boost to an investor's passive income portfolio this September.
Cashing in on the rise of alternatives
Blackstone (NYSE: BX) is the world's largest alternative asset manager. The company collects steady fee-based income as it manages clients' money. It also generates performance-based revenue as its investment funds deliver on their return objectives. Those two sources supply Blackstone with lots of income.
The company returns most of that money to shareholders. It repurchases shares and pays a dividend that varies from quarter to quarter, depending on its earnings. Based on its payments over the past year, Blackstone's dividend yields 5.4%. While that payout will fluctuate in the future, it should continue to rise overall as Blackstone grows its alternative asset business, driven by investors increasingly seeking alternatives to the volatile stock and bond markets.
Firming up its funding plans
Shares of semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have been under enormous pressure this year. Investors have concerns about the company's ability to finance its ambitious manufacturing capacity expansion plan, with some worried it might need to cut the payout to fund its strategy. That has pushed its stock price down over 40%, boosting its dividend yield up to 5.1%.
Intel took a big step toward addressing those concerns by securing Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) as a funding partner for two plants. Brookfield and its partners will invest up to $15 billion, half the expected cost. That will protect Intel's balance sheet, allowing it to fund a healthy and growing dividend. It has a long history of increasing its payout, which seems likely to continue following the Brookfield deal.
A steady pipeline of dividend income
Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) currently pays a 6.1%-yielding dividend. The natural gas pipeline giant supports that payout with a rock-solid financial profile. It generates very stable cash flow backed by long-term contracts and government-regulated rate structures. Meanwhile, Kinder Morgan pays out about half its cash flow via the dividend. That allows it to retain money to strengthen its already solid balance sheet, repurchase shares, and fund expansions.
Kinder Morgan is investing money to expand several pipelines, build a renewable natural gas platform, and develop several renewable fuel hubs. These investments should help grow the company's cash flow, enabling it to continue increasing the dividend, something it has done for the past five years.
A healthy, high-yielding dividend
Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) has an exceptional dividend track record. The healthcare, pharmacy, and retail company has paid a dividend for 359 straight quarters (over 89 years), increasing it for the last 47 consecutive years. That qualifies it as a Dividend Aristocrat and puts it a few years shy of the even more elite class of Dividend Kings.
Walgreens' dividend currently yields 5.6%. The company can easily cover that payout. It produced $2.6 billion of free cash flow over the last three quarters. While that was down over $700 million from the prior year period due to lower volumes and pandemic-related government support, it easily covered its $1.25 billion dividend outlay. That enabled it to retain funds to invest in its continued growth.
A real estate-backed payout
W.P. Carey (NYSE: WPC) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that pays a 5.1%-yielding dividend. The company generates very stable rental income to support that payout. It has a diversified real estate portfolio across the office, retail, industrial, warehouse, and self-storage sectors. It leases these operationally critical properties to tenants under long-term net leases, making the tenant responsible for the variable costs of real estate taxes, maintenance, and building insurance. Most leases feature inflation-linked annual rate escalation clauses. W.P. Carey thus produces steadily rising rental income.
That has helped support W.P. Carey's ability to increase its dividend. The REIT has given its investors a raise every year since its public listing in 1998. Another dividend growth driver is its ability to continue acquiring income-producing real estate. The company has an excellent track record of making accretive deals. Its solid balance sheet allows it to capitalize on its broad mandate to find deals across property sectors worldwide.
Attractive passive income producers
Slumping stock prices have pushed up dividend yields to compensate for their higher risk profiles relative to bonds as the Fed raises interest rates. That's providing investors with the opportunity to lock in higher yields from some high-quality income payers this September. Blackstone, Intel, Kinder Morgan, Walgreens, and W.P. Carey have excellent dividend track records of steadily increasing their dividends. That makes them great options for those seeking to boost their passive income this month.

Although the index mustered a few rallies since then, investors remain leery about any sustained buying of cheap tech stocks because of valid concerns they have about the direction the economy is heading. Still, that could be a mistake.

You might not get the absolute lowest price buying now, but that's a game of luck, not skill, and waiting for a perfect price, and missing out on when the market does turn will severely handicap your returns. Over the past 20 years through the end of 2021, the stock market went up an average of 9.5% a year, but missing just the 10 best days meant your returns would be nearly cut in half to only 5.3% a year.
Many quality tech companies are now trading at prices and valuations not seen in years. The following pair of growth tech stocks also pay dividends that can help soften the blow of any further market downturn while setting up patient investors for fabulous returns in the years to come.
Intel
The market really doesn't like semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) these days, pummeling its stock 43% so far this year as it struggles to bring new chip technology to market. It is jointly investing with Brookfield Infrastructure Partners up to $30 billion in new fabrication facilities. And spending upward of $100 billion on new fabs globally -- which could consume much of Intel's available free cash flow until they come online -- may be worrying the market.
The recent inflation report didn't help matters, either, as prices for just about everything other than a gallon of gas were much higher than expected last month. That means the Federal Reserve is going to keep its foot on the interest rate pedal, likely hiking rates another 75 basis points when it meets next. Because higher interest rates raise the cost of capital for tech companies that use new financing to grow, it creates more uncertainty in the tech space.
Intel, though, is trading at multiples of earnings and sales not seen in more than 15 years. This is too cheap to ignore. Just the facilities it is building with Brookfield are expected to produce a cumulative benefit of $15 billion to free cash flow over the next few years. With a dividend yielding 5% at recent prices, this semiconductor stock should be considered one to buy and hold for years.
Nvidia
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn't a stock you're going to find on many most-loved lists this year, either, as its stock is having an even worse go of it, down 55% this year and off 62% from the highs it hit last November.
Like Intel, the gaming chipmaker is suffering from the general economic malaise and persistent inflation reports, but also from the world of cryptocurrencies, where there were worries about what effect Ethereum's recently successful Merge would have on sales.
Nvidia chips were the ones often used to do the validation work during its proof-of-work phase, but the Merge will now have stakeholders performing proof-of-stake validation, and Nvidia chips tend not to be the ones used for that purpose. It's why the chipmaker's gaming business has been so robust for so long. People weren't only playing video games, many were often validating Ethereum transactions.
Yet Nvidia still has a monumental runway of growth in front of it from its data center business, which recently surpassed gaming as the biggest revenue generator for the company. Second-quarter segment revenue hit $3.8 billion, a 61% increase from last year. And because businesses will necessarily keep migrating their data to the cloud and will need data centers to warehouse it, Nvidia will see sales continue their robust climb.
Nvidia's dividend is admittedly modest with a yield of just 0.1%, and its multiples are not as historically discounted as Intel's, but with Wall Street still expecting the chipmaker to grow earnings 23% annually over the next five years, the stock is discounted enough to make it one to buy and hold for the long term.

2022-09-18 00:00:00+00:00,3 Once-In-a-Generation Buying Opportunities In the Nasdaq Bear Market,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-once-in-a-generation-buying-opportunities-in-the-nasdaq-bear-market,,,"There's little question that 2022 is set to go down as once of the most challenging years for investors on record. Through the first six months of the year, the benchmark S&P 500 produced its worst return since 1970. That doesn't happen by accident. It's a function of historically high inflation, persistent supply chain problems, and a weakening U.S. economy.
Things have been even worse for the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC), which has lost as much as 34% of its value on a peak-to-trough basis since hitting its closing high in November. The magnitude of the Nasdaq's decline has kept the widely followed index firmly entrenched in a bear market.

However, peril on Wall Street often begets opportunity. That's because every significant decline in the major indexes throughout history (including the Nasdaq Composite) has eventually been put into the rearview mirror by a bull market rally. Sometimes, bear markets roll out the red carpet for patient investors and offer once-in-a-generation buying opportunities. What follows are three beaten-down companies that have once-in-a-generation buying appeal for long-term investors.
Intel
The first buying opportunity you may never see again is the chance to load up on shares of semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) below $30.
To be fair, Intel and its semiconductor peers are facing a mountain of headwinds at the moment. Supply chain issues and historically high inflation are doing a number on enterprise demand. Meanwhile, the return of workers to the office has lowered demand for personal computers (PCs).
In spite of these challenges, Intel and its 5.1% dividend yield could be a phenomenal buy for patient investors.
To begin with, rumors of Intel's demise appear to be greatly exaggerated. Based on data compiled by Mercury Research for the first quarter of 2022, Intel held 88.4% of server central processing unit (CPU) market share, along with an 81.7% share of desktop PC PCUs, and a 77.5% share of mobile PCUs (excluding Internet of Things devices). Even with Advanced Micro Devices slightly chipping away at its market share in server and mobile PCUs, it's evident that Intel's top-dog status in processors will continue to be a source of incredible cash flow for the company.
To add to this point, businesses have been shifting data into the cloud at an accelerated pace in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This bodes well for data-center server demand for years to come.
Another significant tailwind for Intel is the recent passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law last month. The CHIPS Act will provide nearly $53 billion in subsidies to chip manufacturers and designers so they can build facilities to produce and hire domestically. As businesses, homes, and cars become more technologically dependent, the need to manufacture semiconductor solutions is only going to climb. That's a key impetus behind Intel's $20 billion investment to build two manufacturing plants in Ohio.
Intel should also benefit from the eventual spinoff and initial public offering (IPO) of autonomous vehicle company Mobileye. Even with a lowered valuation of $30 billion for its upcoming IPO, this would be nearly double what Intel paid for Mobileye ($15.3 billion) five years ago. Mobileye's revenue hit a record $460 million (up 41%) in the second quarter.
Although it's struggling mightily amid economic uncertainty, now is the ideal time to pick up an absolutely dominant cash flow giant like Intel on the cheap.
Planet 13 Holdings
For the second once-in-a-generation buying opportunity, look no further than the U.S. cannabis space -- specifically, small-cap multi-state operator (MSO) Planet 13 Holdings (OTC: PLNH.F), which can be purchased for a little over $1 per share.
In February 2021, marijuana stocks were all the buzz. Democrats narrowly taking hold of Congress following Joe Biden's victory in November appeared to pave the way for cannabis to be legalized at the federal level. But after 20 months in the Oval Office, Biden is no closer to signing marijuana reform bills into law than was his predecessor, Donald Trump. Wall Street has not been happy with the lack of progress on the reform front, and U.S. marijuana stocks have paid the price.
However, a lack of federal reform hasn't stopped individual states from giving the green light to medical marijuana and/or adult-use consumption. Roughly three-quarters of all U.S. states allow cannabis use in some form. With favorability to marijuana steadily improving over decades, federal reform is still likely sooner than later.
What makes Planet 13 such a game-changing stock to buy is its approach to expansion within the cannabis industry. Whereas most vertically integrated MSOs have attempted to plant their proverbial flags in as many legalized markets as possible, Planet 13 has just three operating dispensaries. The thing is, two of these three dispensaries are behemoths and unlike anything the cannabis industry has ever seen.
The company's flagship dispensary is the Las Vegas SuperStore in Nevada, just west of the Strip. This store spans 112,000 square feet (that's bigger than the average Walmart) and offers an unrivaled selection of dried cannabis and high-margin derivatives, such as beverages and edibles. Its other large retail location is in Orange County, California, about 15 minutes from Disneyland. The Orange County SuperStore spans 55,000 square feet, with 30% of this space devoted to selling. These stores focus as much on the customer experience as they do on sales, which is what makes them unique.
In addition to its SuperStore concept, which will be expanding to Chicago, Illinois, next, Planet 13 holds a dispensary license in Florida, which will allow the company to develop an unlimited number of community-based stores that total roughly 4,750 square feet once fully built out. Florida is on pace to be the nation's third-largest market for marijuana sales by 2024.
Planet 13's unique operating model makes it a no-brainer buy for long-term investors in the Nasdaq bear market.

PubMatic
The third once-in-a-generation buying opportunity created by the Nasdaq bear market is none other than small-cap adtech stock PubMatic (NASDAQ: PUBM), which can be bought for less than $20/share.
Investors don't have to look far for evidence that advertisers have pared back their spending amid an uncertain economic environment. Following back-to-back quarters of declines in U.S. gross domestic product, all ad-driven businesses have been whacked by Wall Street -- and that includes PubMatic. But as noted earlier, peril begets opportunity.
One of the biggest factors working in favor of advertising companies like PubMatic is time. Even though recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle, they usually last for only a couple of quarters. By comparison, periods of expansion are measured in years. Simply being patient and holding onto an adtech stock like PubMatic should allow investors to take advantage of the natural growth of the U.S. and global economy over time, as well as the expansion of ad spending.
But PubMatic has more in its sails than just long-term growth trends. For starters, it's a programmatic-ad sell-side platform (SSP), which means its job is to help publishers sell their digital display space. Most SSPs have consolidated over time, leaving few options for publishers to choose from. This makes PubMatic a logical choice as businesses shift their ad dollars from print to digital.
To build on this point, PubMatic has been growing organically at a considerably faster pace than the digital ad industry as a whole. Whereas the digital ad industry is expected to generate 14% annualized revenue growth through 2025, PubMatic's organic growth rate has predominantly stuck between 25% and 50%. Again, it helps being one of the few SSPs for publishers to choose from.
Something else that really stands out about PubMatic is the company's choice to design and build its own cloud-based infrastructure. Instead of relying on a third party to handle its programmatic-ad solutions, PubMatic is set to benefit from economies of scale as its revenue grows. The end result should be higher operating margins than its peers.
If you still need more convincing, consider this: PubMatic ended June with $183 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities to go along with no debt. PubMatic can easily weather economic downturns while continuing to reinvest in its cloud-driven programmatic ad platform.

Shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -20.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -9.1% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Intel belongs, has lost 24.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.35 per share, indicating a change of -79.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.9% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.25 points to a change of -58.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.5%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.61 indicates a change of +15.9% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intel is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
In the case of Intel, the consensus sales estimate of $15.57 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -18.9%. The $66.2 billion and $68.23 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -15.2% and +3.1%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $15.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22%. EPS of $0.29 for the same period compares with $1.28 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -14.51%. The EPS surprise was -57.97%.
Over the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-09-15 00:00:00+00:00,"Traffic, water shortages, now floods: the slow death of India's tech hub?",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/traffic-water-shortages-now-floods%3A-the-slow-death-of-indias-tech-hub-1,,,"By Devjyot Ghoshal and Nivedita Bhattacharjee
BENGALURU, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Harish Pullanoor spent his weekends in the late 1980s tramping around the marshes and ponds of Yemalur, an area then on the eastern edge of the Indian metropolis of Bengaluru, where his cousins would join him catching small freshwater fish.
In the 1990s, Bengaluru, once a genteel city of gardens, lakes and a cool climate, rapidly became India's answer to Silicon Valley, attracting millions of workers and the regional headquarters of some of the world's biggest IT companies.
The untrammelled expansion came at a price.
Concrete replaced green spaces and construction around the edge of lakes blocked off connecting canals, limiting the city's capacity to absorb and siphon off water.
Last week, after the city's heaviest rains in decades, the Yemalur neighbourhood was submerged under waist-deep water along with some other parts of Bengaluru, disrupting the southern metropolis' IT industry and dealing a blow to its reputation.
Residents fed up with gridlocked traffic and water shortages during the dry season have long complained about the city's infrastructure.
But flooding during the monsoon has raised fresh questions about the sustainability of rapid urban development, especially if weather patterns become more erratic and intense because of climate change.
""It's very, very sad,"" said Pullanoor, who was born close to Yemalur but now lives in the western city of Mumbai, parts of which also face sporadic flooding like many of India's urban centres.
""The trees have disappeared. The parks have almost disappeared. There is chock-a-block traffic.""
Big businesses are also complaining about worsening disruptions, which they say can cost them tens of millions of dollars in a single day.
Bengaluru hosts more than 3,500 IT companies and some 79 ""tech parks"" - upmarket premises that house offices and entertainment areas catering to technology workers.
Wading through flooded highways last week, they struggled to reach modern glass-faced complexes in and around Yemalur where multinational firms including JP Morgan and Deloitte operate alongside large Indian start-ups.
Millionaire entrepreneurs were among those forced to escape flooded living rooms and swamped bedrooms on the back of tractors.
Insurance companies said initial estimates for loss of property were ran into millions of rupees, with numbers expected to go up in the next few days.
'GLOBAL IMPACT'
The latest chaos triggered renewed worries from the $194 billion Indian IT services industry that is concentrated around the city.
""India is a tech hub for global enterprises, so any disruption here will have a global impact. Bangalore, being the centre of IT, will be no exception to this,"" said K.S. Viswanathan, vice president at industry lobby group the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM).
Bangalore was renamed Bengaluru in 2014.
NASSCOM is currently working to identify 15 new cities that could become software export hubs, said Viswanathan, who is driving the project.
""It is not a city-versus-city story,"" he told Reuters. ""We as a country don't want to miss out on revenue and business opportunities because of a lack of infrastructure.""
Even before the floods, some business groups including the Outer Ring Road Companies Association (ORRCA) that is led by executives from Intel INTC.O, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft MSFT.O and Wipro WIPR.NS, warned inadequate infrastructure in Bengaluru could encourage companies to leave.
""We have been talking about these for years,"" Krishna Kumar, general manager of ORRCA, said last week of problems related to Bengaluru's infrastructure. ""We have come to a serious point now and all companies are on the same page.""
Thomson Reuters TRI.TO also has major operations in Bengaluru.
""The safety of all employees is always our top priority,"" the company said in a statement. ""While Thomson Reuters employees in Bangalore continue to work remotely throughout the recent flooding, there has been no impact to our operations.""
In the early 1970s, more than 68% of Bengaluru was covered in vegetation.
By the late 1990s, the city's green cover had dropped to around 45% and by 2021 to less than 3% of its total area of 741 square kilometres, according to an analysis by T.V. Ramachandra of Bengaluru's Indian Institute of Science (IISC).
Green spaces can help absorb and temporarily store storm water, helping to protect built up areas.
""If this trend continues, by 2025, 98.5% (of the city) will be choked with concrete,"" said Ramachandra, who is part of IISC's Centre for Ecological Sciences.
CITY IN DECAY
Rapid urban expansion, often featuring illegal structures built without permission, has affected Bengaluru's nearly 200 lakes and a network of canals that once connected them, according to experts.
So when heavy rains lash the city like they did last week, drainage systems are unable to keep up, especially in low-lying areas like Yemalur.
The state government of Karnataka, where Bengaluru is located, said last week it would spent 3 billion Indian rupees ($37.8 million) to help manage the flood situation, including removing unauthorised developments, improving drainage systems and controlling water levels in lakes.
""All the encroachments will be removed without any mercy,"" Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai told reporters. ""I will personally go and inspect.""
Authorities have identified around 50 areas in Bengaluru that have been illegally developed. Those included high-end villas and apartments, according to Tushar Girinath, Chief Commissioner of Bengaluru's civic authority.
Last week, the state government also announced it would set up a body to manage Bengaluru's traffic and start discussions on a new storm water drainage project along a major highway.
Critics called the initiatives a knee-jerk reaction that could peter out.
""Every time it floods, only then we discuss,"" said IISC's Ramachandra. ""Bengaluru is decaying. It will die.""

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.
