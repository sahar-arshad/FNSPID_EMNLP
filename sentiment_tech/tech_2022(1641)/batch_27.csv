2022-07-12 00:00:00+00:00,Is Most-Watched Stock Intel Corporation (INTC) Worth Betting on Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-most-watched-stock-intel-corporation-intc-worth-betting-on-now-0,,,"Intel (INTC) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -1.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Intel belongs, has lost 8.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.74 per share, indicating a change of -42.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $3.48 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -36.4%. This estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.60 indicates a change of +3.4% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.5%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intel is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Intel, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $17.98 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -8.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $75.43 billion and $78.43 billion estimates indicate -3.3% and +4% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $18.35 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.7%. EPS of $0.87 for the same period compares with $1.39 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.18%. The EPS surprise was +8.75%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-07-12 00:00:00+00:00,7 Cheap Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-cheap-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-now-0,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It is hard to believe that there would enough cheap semiconductor stocks to buy to build a list like this. But today that is what we will be doing, in an effort to start building a position for the future.
The semiconductor sector has had better years than 2022 so far. But in all fairness, the whole stock market has struggled since middle of last year. In spite of still-high pessimism levels, I expect improvement in the second half. The bulls have a legitimate shot at taking some control this coming quarter.
And if that assumption is right, these are cheap semiconductor stocks to buy now to capitalize on that recovery.
If the stock market stabilizes, the upside potential in semis will be near the top. Consider this a thoughtful but not exclusive list of options. Also, it is better to leg into full positions in small pieces, since the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is still about 40% above average.
These cheap semiconductor stocks slid fast and hard from their 2021 heydays. This was a direct byproduct of over-exuberance on the way up. Wall Street often overcommits in either direction, thereby creating these extreme situations. But as long as markets are not ready to take another significant leg lower, there should be opportunities among great cheap semiconductor stocks.
Investors need to be moderate with their approach this year. And none of the major semiconductor companies have problems specific to them. They are all suffering from similar extrinsic ailments — mainly the global shortages. But this summer, the shrinkage in demand that central banks are attempting could help.
5 Best Stocks to Buy if You Have $100 to Spend
Now, let’s look at the top cheap semiconductor stocks.
SMH VanEck Semiconductor ETF $203.64
NVDA Nvidia $151.52
AMD Advanced Micro Devices $76.95
INTC Intel $37.20
TSM Taiwan Semiconductor $79.11
AVGO Broadcom $482.86
LRCX Lam Research $402.41
VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)
Source: Shutterstock
I am opening the list with VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), which is a trade on the whole semiconductor sector. This is a liquid ETF that represents a blend of all the cheap semiconductor stocks. The SMH ETF is down 34% on the year.
Since its top holdings are a who’s-who in high-tech semiconductors, few can argue against its fundamental qualities. If the equity markets are higher in the future, then the SMH stock is also a winner. I could have even picked a few more companies from its portfolio today, like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) for example.
Short term, there are technical challenges from resistance zones above. On the way down, the selling was heavy near $221 and $237 per share. There’s a bit a room before we get there, but there are likely to be sellers lurking there. Such battles are opportunities for the bulls to exhaust the bears. They might stall at first, but with rise above after subsequent pushes.
That’s a necessary process to build a better, more moderate base below. These comments are also true for almost the rest of all cheap semiconductor stocks on our list today.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: FP Creative / Shutterstock.com
The next two cheap semiconductor stocks to buy can be interchangeable. They are both momentum stocks and down heavily this year.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has suffered some of the blows that Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has taken this year. As the crypto has corrected 70%, so has interest in Bitcoin mining. NVDA stock benefits on the way up from from that mining theme, but it suffers from its drop too.
Therefore it is important to recognize that there is still extra downside potential from that. While Bitcoin showed strength last week, it’s not out of the woods yet. There is a technical scenario that could suggest another 30% to 40% lower from here. I don’t think that’s likely, but be cautious.
But even then, I don’t believe NVDA stock would follow it down that much.
7 Best Biotech Stocks to Buy in July 2022
The company has done a great job growing, so its fans will defend when it is already this lean. Year-to-date, NVDA is down almost 50% already. The easy damage has already happened, and the bears will need to work much harder to inflict more pain. Without an extraneous headwind, Nvidia stock will stabilize.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Source: Joseph GTK / Shutterstock.com
As mentioned, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock is almost interchangeable with NVDA for today’s purpose. They both catch a heavy influence from the trade in Bitcoin. Also, they like to hog the headlines. That is why both stocks are down about the same, nearly 50%, so far this year.
AMD also has excellent fundamentals under its leadership team. CEO Lisa Su focused the efforts, and now they sport a strong set of financials. The metrics are as impressive on growth, yet lean on the value side. For that reason I prefer AMD to NVDA, because it has less potential bloat.
Under calmer conditions, the positive narrative should win out. Cheap semiconductor stocks will rise if the markets are not struggling.
Technically, AMD stock could struggle near and going into $88 per share. The sellers will try to stifle the progress these. So the general markets will need to stabilize to help AMD’s cause.
Intel (INTC)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is likely my best example of erroneous extremism. It is the cheapest of the cheap semiconductor stocks to buy, and the way Wall Street treats it is the picture-perfect example of disrespect.
It currently has a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 6.3. That’s practically an insult. But for now, the market is not giving it nearly as much respect as it deserves.
This stock suits investors with patience and an appreciation for solid businesses. It has earned better respect than this, but that attention will eventually return. Also INTC stock is not as sensitive to the price of Bitcoin.
7 Best Bear Market Stocks to Buy in July 2022
The only muscle Intel stock really needs to flex is its financial report card. In 2021, it generated almost $80 billion in sales and flowed roughly $20 billion to the net income line. What it lacks in pizazz it makes it up in consistent success. The investment community will fall back in love with it sooner or later, so accumulating some while it’s this cheap make good sense.
Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is an old company that has survived many decades of adverse situations. What is going on now is not likely to kill it. So as long as the indices continue to base, TSM stock will be just fine.
But management will report earnings soon. These events tend to offer a potential of short-term drama from human emotions. The expectations build up so high that they can lead to exaggerated rallies and drops in knee-jerk reactions to earnings headlines. These are temporary, so I’d caution against chasing the initial pop or drop.
Management’s scorecards are as solid as they come. They generate more than $60 billion in revenues and $22 billion in net income. It is hard to argue against this, especially when they have continuously grown the metrics. If the global economies are not going into a long depression, there is legitimate opportunity from here.
In the meantime, I would just be careful around earnings.
Broadcom (AVGO)
Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock bounced well off its 2021 base. This is encouraging, showing that its fans are not too eager to dip into the 2020 ranges. The bad news is that this fact leaves it a bit vulnerable from a low-odds scenario. If the markets suffer another significant drop from here, AVGO stock would have a lot further to fall than normal. The base near $420 per share is strong, but would flip to be a bearish catalyst under heavy selling.
The AVGO technical advantage could extend another 9% before hitting a serious resistance zone.
Then there is the help that its dividend brings. Even though rates are rising, it’s nice to have a stock this strong that can also reward its owners with a 3.4% bonus dividend payout.
7 Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in July 2022
The trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 24.7 is not screaming cheap, but it is not a detriment either. As long as they continue to execute on plans, the buyers will come to it.
Lam Research (LRCX)
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock
The last of my cheap semiconductor stocks to buy is Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX). This one doesn’t make too many headlines, but its financials tell the right story. Lam management grew sales 70% in three years. That’s a thriving business riding a fast wave. The digitization trend is also ongoing and it’s not likely to easy up soon.
The sign of a strong team is growth without bloat. So far, they are doing the first part while delivering $4 billion in cash from operations. There aren’t many problems to threaten LRCX investors’ long term perspective.
But for now, it will face selling resistance this month. This will change in a few weeks, when the buyers have the opportunity to build a positive trend. Then the short-term dips become reasons to buy LRCX stock.

2022-07-12 00:00:00+00:00,Could Intel Stock Help You Retire a Millionaire?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/could-intel-stock-help-you-retire-a-millionaire,,,"The stock market sell-off of 2022 has been brutal on Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), with shares of the chip giant down 27% so far this year.
But Intel has been a top investment over the years, increasing investors' wealth substantially thanks to a mix of stock upside and a fat dividend. For instance, $100,000 invested in Intel stock at the beginning of 2007 was worth just over $390,000 at the end of 2021, assuming the dividends were reinvested.
But now, will a similar investment in Intel stock help you retire as a millionaire after 15 years? Let's find out.
The solid dividend is here to stay
It is evident that Intel's dividend has played a major role in boosting investors' wealth over the years. The good part is that the company looks all set to sustain its fat dividend yield of nearly 4% despite facing near-term headwinds. Intel's revenue, for instance, is expected to remain flat in 2022. Earnings are expected to drop to $3.49 per share from $5.47 per share in 2021.
However, Intel has a forward dividend payout ratio of 41%, which indicates that its earnings this year would be enough to help it sustain its nice yield. More importantly, Intel's earnings are expected to start growing once again from next year. It is also worth noting that Intel's long-term growth forecasts point toward a significant improvement in the company's top and bottom lines, as well as its free cash flow.
More specifically, Intel expects its revenue to increase in the mid- to high-single digits in 2023 and 2024. This is the phase when the company intends to spend aggressively on its infrastructure and research and development to regain its technological lead over rivals, with 35% of its revenue earmarked for capital spending. The company expects neutral adjusted free cash flow during this period.
In 2025 and 2026, Intel expects revenue to increase at an annual pace of 10% to 12%. Margins are expected to increase during this period while operating expenses are set to fall. The company will also dial down its capital investments to 25% of revenue. As a result, Intel expects adjusted free cash flow at 20% of revenue during that period.
Not surprisingly, analysts expect Intel's bottom-line growth to improve after this year's slowdown.
INTC EPS estimates for current fiscal year data by YCharts
The improvement in Intel's earnings means that there is room for an increase in the dividend in the long run. As such, investors looking for a regular income stream in the form of dividends can count on Intel to boost their portfolios in the long run and help them get closer to their dream of retiring as millionaires. But at the same time, it won't be surprising to see the stock step on the gas thanks to the increase in Intel's addressable market.
Intel stock could deliver impressive upside
Intel stock may not have set the market on fire in recent years, but the company can do so in the future thanks to stronger end-market opportunities.
Intel has been getting a huge chunk of its revenue from selling central processing units (CPUs) for computers so far, but that's changing now. In the first quarter of 2022, the client computing group was its largest source of revenue, with $9.3 billion in sales. It accounted for half of the company's top line, but revenue was down 13% year over year.
On the other hand, the data center and artificial intelligence group generated $6 billion in revenue, up 22% year over year. Revenue from sales of edge networking products also increased 23% year over year to $2.2 billion. Additionally, Intel's entry into the discrete graphics card market led to a 21% year-over-year increase in its accelerated computing and graphics revenue to $219 million.
So, there are several growth hotspots that could help Intel stock step on the gas in the long run. As it turns out, the company sees a total addressable market worth $450 billion by 2026, and just $90 billion of that will come from the traditional client computing business. The rest of the markets that Intel is tapping are expected to clock solid double-digit growth in the future.
All this indicates that Intel's growth could accelerate and lead to a healthy upside in the stock price. It won't be surprising to see the stock beat the broader market's returns over the next decade and more. And that, combined with its nice dividend yield, could help investors get closer to their goal of retiring as millionaires.
That's why patient investors with a long-term investment horizon can consider accumulating this semiconductor stock as it's trading at just six times earnings right now.

July 11 (Reuters) - Private equity firm BC Partners Ltd is exploring a sale of Presidio Inc, which could value the U.S. information technology provider at more than $4 billion including debt, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
BC Partners is working with an investment bank for a sale process for New York-based Presidio, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Presidio generated $3.1 billion in revenue and had earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of more than $350 million in 2021, the sources said.
A BC Partners spokesperson declined to comment. Presidio did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Presidio provides secured cloud-based technology to organizations ranging from government agencies to businesses such as Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O, Dell Technologies Inc DELL.N and Intel Corp INTC.O. It has about 8,000 customers worldwide.
Like many technology companies, Presidio benefited from a surge in demand for IT services during the COVID-19 pandemic, as companies invested more to adapt to the remote working environments and boost cybersecurity capabilities.
Presidio has had several private equity owners since it was founded in 2003. Buyout firm American Securities acquired Presidio in 2011 for an undisclosed amount. It sold the company to Apollo Global Management Inc APO.N three years later for about $1.3 billion, Reuters reported at the time.
Apollo took Presidio public in 2017 and BC Partners took it private in 2019 in a $2.1 billion deal. Under BC Partners' ownership, Presidio has acquired several smaller rivals including Irish IT consulting firm Arkphire and Charlotte, North Carolina-based ROVE.
Based in London, BC Partners has $40 billion in assets under management spread across healthcare, financial services and industrials in Europe and North America.

2022-07-10 00:00:00+00:00,"Want $1,000 in Passive Income? Invest $21,625 in These 3 Surprising Dividend Stocks",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/want-%241000-in-passive-income-invest-%2421625-in-these-3-surprising-dividend-stocks,,,"Dividend investors tend to ignore tech stocks. As an industry focused heavily on emerging companies and rapid growth, these enterprises have often chosen to reinvest in themselves rather than distribute cash to shareholders.
However, maturing tech companies have tended to buck this trend, and many offer payouts well above the S&P 500 average yield of 1.6%. A combined portfolio of AT&T (NYSE: T), International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) demonstrates such cash flows. A comparatively modest investment can yield $1,000 in total annual income.
A cash cow yielding 5%
Justin Pope (AT&T): Investing in telecom giant AT&T is like hitting the easy button for dividend investors. It pays a quarterly dividend, adding up to an annual total of $1.11 for shareholders. You'll need to buy an even 300 shares to generate $333 in annual dividend income, a total investment of $6,370 at today's share price.
AT&T is the leading U.S. telecom company, with an estimated 43% of the wireless market. Only a couple of companies, Verizon and T-Mobile, compete with AT&T because the billions of dollars needed to invest in upgrading and maintaining cellular networks each year discourage new companies from entering the industry.
Additionally, smartphones have become central to modern society's way of life, which means that people typically pay their phone bills, regardless of what the economy's doing. It's more a household necessity than a discretionary luxury these days.
AT&T's had a challenging decade, taking on a lot of debt to acquire DirecTV and Time Warner to build an entertainment business. It didn't work out, and AT&T sold and spun off its entertainment assets to become a pure telecom again.
The company received $43 billion from the Time Warner spin-off to pay down debt, and management reduced the dividend payout ratio to just 40% to 43% of estimated free cash flow. Remember that AT&T yields more than 5% despite the cut, and now shareholders can feel great that the dividend is affordable.
Analysts believe AT&T's earnings per share (EPS) will grow by almost 4% annually over the next three to five years. You're going to buy AT&T for that juicy dividend, but getting some growth with it should help fuel future dividend increases while adding to your total returns.
Investors looking for passive income should consider this old-school tech name
Jake Lerch (IBM): If you're looking to maximize passive income, there are certain elements your stock investments should have. It might even help to develop a checklist, to ensure that each stock you own has the necessary ingredients that make up a great passive income stock. Here's mine:
Substantial dividend yield
Low volatility
Significant free cash flow or cash on hand
Reasonable valuation
One tech company that ticks all these boxes is IBM. Let's run through each element.
Dividend yield
IBM pays $1.65 quarterly -- $6.60 per share annually -- good for a 4.8% dividend yield. IBM shares currently trade at $137.50, so 50 shares (a $6,875 investment) will generate $330 in annual dividend income.
Low volatility
Volatility is a measure of price stability. Beta is a mathematical expression of volatility. Stocks with a beta of 1.0 correlate perfectly with the S&P 500 index, while those with a beta of 2.0 would have twice the index's volatility. IBM has a beta of 0.94, meaning the stock trades more or less in tandem with the S&P 500 index. This level of stability is near the sweet spot when looking for stocks that generate passive income.
Significant free cash flow or cash on hand
IBM generates $9.47 of free cash flow per share, or $8.6 billion in total. As of its most recent quarter, the company had $10.5 billion in cash or cash equivalents. However, it does have a significant debt load, with over $57.6 billion in debt. Nevertheless, it's generating enough cash and has enough on hand to continue servicing its debt and paying its current dividend. However, investors should keep an eye on IBM's balance sheet; rising interest rates could force it to cut its dividend if it cannot generate enough free cash flow.
Reasonable valuation
IBM's current price-to-book ratio is 6.5, while its 10-year average is 8.1. This valuation is neither cheap nor expensive, as it hovers between similar legacy technology companies like Texas Instruments (price-to-book of 9.9) and Cisco (4.4).
The one-time chip industry leader that's emerged as a surprising dividend stock
Will Healy (Intel): Intel looks like a counterintuitive choice at first, as its former rivals seem to have eclipsed this longtime industry leader. However, Intel has set a goal of recapturing its lead, and it's showing partial signs of success. According to a Morgan Stanley report, Intel's Alder Lake CPU has caused AMD's revenue to decline by 26%, an indication Intel can still compete in this market.
Meanwhile, Intel's stock has declined amid the tech sell-off. It also faces pressure due to the tens of billions it plans to spend to enter the foundry business and attempt to catch up technologically with the current foundry industry leaders, TSMC and Samsung.
But that stock price drop could highlight Intel's $1.46 per share annual dividend, which now yields 3.9%! Though that yield slightly lags those of AT&T and IBM, an $8,380 investment (about 228 shares) will yield about $333 yearly.
Moreover, Intel has increased this payout most years since 2004, and amid company struggles, it should maintain that pace. In 2021, it generated $11.3 billion in free cash flow, enough to cover the dividend's $5.6 billion cost.
This doesn't mean Intel's struggles have ended. In the first quarter of 2022, it reported $18.4 billion in non-GAAP revenue, a 1% drop year over year. The rising cost of sales and increased operating expenses caused non-GAAP net income to fall 35% during that period to $3.6 billion.
However, the stock sells for a price-to-earnings ratio of six, and it has fallen to less than 1.5 times its book value, arguably making it too cheap to ignore. This is especially true for dividend investors, as payouts will likely continue to rise.
Intel's goal of becoming the chip industry leader still looks like a tall order. However, if it can achieve at least partial success, its income, stock price, and dividend payout should rise significantly over time.

2022-07-09 00:00:00+00:00,2 Reddit Stocks to Buy and Hold for Years,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-reddit-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-for-years-2,,,"Discussions on some Reddit boards are often associated with ""meme stocks"" like GameStop and AMC, which skyrocketed to all-time highs last year as retail investors promoted them as short-squeeze candidates across the social network's subreddits. Its top investing subreddit, WallStreetBets (WSB), currently has 12.3 million members.
But over the past year, many of the so-called ""Reddit stocks"" collapsed as rising interest rates drove investors toward more conservative investments. The term ""Reddit stock"" also became synonymous with low-quality stocks which merely traded on their short-term momentum and short-squeeze potential instead of their fundamental strengths.

However, investors who are familiar with Reddit's WSB community will likely tell you that many of the top stocks aren't throwaway names. In fact, blue-chip tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are still two of the most frequently mentioned stocks on WSB. Both of these ""Reddit stocks"" should remain solid investments for years to come.
1. Apple
Between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2021, which ended last September, Apple's annual revenue more than tripled from $108.2 billion to $365.8 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13%. Its earnings per share (EPS) increased at a CAGR of 19%.
Apple reduced its share count by 38% over the past 10 years with big buybacks, and it's raised its dividends every year after reinstating them in 2012. Its stock has risen 560% over the past decade, and it's generated a total return of about 670% after factoring in reinvested dividends. The S&P 500 generated a total return of 245% during that same period.
Apple's stunning performance silenced the critics who believed the company would languish after Steve Jobs passed away in 2011. Jobs' successor, Tim Cook, continued to expand Apple's ecosystem with new devices (including the Apple Watch and AirPods) and new services (like Apple TV+ and Apple Music) while refreshing its flagship products.
Apple still generates most of its revenue from the iPhone, the most widely used premium smartphone in the world, but it also locked in 825 million paid subscriptions across all of its services in its latest quarter. That sticky ecosystem, along with its $193 billion in cash and marketable securities, should enable Apple to easily expand into newer markets like augmented reality, virtual reality, and connected vehicles in the near future.
When that happens, Apple will likely evolve into a more diversified tech giant, which will generate even bigger returns for its long-term investors. That's probably why Warren Buffett allocated a whopping 40% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio to Apple's stock.
2. AMD
When Lisa Su took over as AMD's CEO in 2014, the chipmaker was considered a distant underdog to Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the CPU and GPU markets, respectively.
However, Su turned around AMD by selling more custom APUs (which merged together CPUs and GPUs) to gaming console makers, rebooted its CPU business with a brand-new architecture, and kept pace with Nvidia by launching a new lineup of affordable gaming GPUs.
AMD's decision to outsource the production of its chips to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) also enabled it to pull ahead of Intel, which still manufactured its own chips, in the ""process race"" to manufacture smaller and denser chips.
As a result, AMD's share of the CPU market rose from a nadir of 17.5% in the third quarter of 2016 to 35.3% in the third quarter of 2022, according to PassMark Software. Intel's share plunged from 82.5% to 64.4%, with losses across the laptop, desktop, and server markets.
Between 2014 and 2021, AMD's revenue rose from $5.5 billion to $16.4 billion, representing a CAGR of 17%. Its adjusted EPS grew at a CAGR of 47%. If you had invested in AMD on Lisa Su's first day as its CEO, you would now be sitting on a multibagger gain of about 2,200%.
But the ride's been much bumpier for recent investors. AMD's stock was cut in half this year as rising interest rates, slowing PC sales, and Intel's ambitious turnaround efforts sparked concerns about its near-term growth.
However, I believe AMD will continue to grow with Lisa Su at the helm, and investors who stick with this resilient chipmaker could be rewarded with even more impressive long-term gains.

2022-07-08 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 3.83% Yield (INTC),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-named-top-dividend-stock-with-insider-buying-and-3.83-yield-intc,,,"In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC), which saw buying by EVP, CFO David Zinsner.
Back on May 3, Zinsner invested $246,014.45 into 5,500 shares of INTC, for a cost per share of $44.73. In trading on Friday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) and achieve a cost basis 16.4% cheaper than Zinsner, with shares changing hands as low as $37.39 per share. It should be noted that Zinsner has collected $0.36/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently down 15.6% on their purchase from a total return basis. Intel Corp shares are currently trading -1.35% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of INTC shares, versus its 200 day moving average:
Looking at the chart above, INTC's low point in its 52 week range is $35.54 per share, with $57.455 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $37.78. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which insider buying was recorded over the last six months:
PURCHASED INSIDER TITLE SHARES PRICE/SHARE VALUE
02/22/2022 Patrick P. Gelsinger CEO 5,600 $44.27 $247,890.72
02/22/2022 Omar Ishrak Director 11,025 $45.11 $497,323.42
05/03/2022 David Zinsner EVP, CFO 5,500 $44.73 $246,014.45
05/02/2022 Patrick P. Gelsinger CEO 5,500 $44.58 $245,183.95
The DividendRank report noted that among the coverage universe, INTC shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics. The report also cited the strong quarterly dividend history at Intel Corp, and favorable long-term multi-year growth rates in key fundamental data points.
The report stated, ''Dividend investors approaching investing from a value standpoint are generally most interested in researching the strongest most profitable companies, that also happen to be trading at an attractive valuation. That's what we aim to find using our proprietary DividendRank formula, which ranks the coverage universe based upon our various criteria for both profitability and valuation, to generate a list of the top most 'interesting' stocks, meant for investors as a source of ideas that merit further research.''
The annualized dividend paid by Intel Corp is $1.46/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 05/05/2022. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for INTC, which the report stressed as being of key importance. Indeed, studying a company's past dividend history can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock fell hard into its June 30 earnings release, with investors betting on lower profits and guidance.
The stock opened June 30 at about $56 per share, a market cap of $62.5 billion, but a price-to-earnings multiple of just 7x. Shares started the year at about $96.
Despite its value price, analyst estimates remain bullish. The company was expected to earn $2.46 per share on revenue of $8.7 billion. There was even a “whisper number,” a hoped-for estimate of $2.50 per share. The company’s 29 analysts were expecting an earnings downturn until 2023, with $7.56 per share of earnings.  That would still give Micron a forward P/E of 7.4x.
Micron wound up earning $2.6 billion, $2.34 per share, on revenue of $8.64 billion.
The numbers were short of analyst estimates. The initial reaction was a drop to $52, but it finished the week up at $59 per share.

Cheap as Chips
Memory chips have the most volatile prices in the semiconductor market.
This has led to extreme boom-and-bust cycles. Micron peaked at $100 in early 2000, then thudded all the way below $5 by the end of the decade. Shares traded below $10 as recently as 2016, on fears of competition from Korea and China.
But CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, recruited after he sold his Sandisk to Western Digital (NYSE:WD), predicted in March that Micron sales could more than double this decade. Its market could grow to $330 billion. Sales in 2021 were $27.7 billion.
7 Best Micro-Cap Stocks to Buy in July
If Mehrotra is right, and I believe he is, Micron looks like a great bargain in today’s market. The risk is that much of Micron’s short-term outlook is based on cloud data centers, where buyers drive hard bargains.
Boom and Bust
Micron is based in Boise, Idaho because the late J.R.R. Simplot, who made his money in potatoes, was an early investor in the 1970s. It still has two U.S. plants, but most of its production now comes from East Asia.
Changing that could take as much as $150 billion, and Micron’s 2021 capital budget was just $10 billion. Micron, which had $8.6 billion in cash at the end of 2021, is a backer of industry subsidies now before Congress. It is offering to expand its Boise plant if the act is passed. The Act has bipartisan support but hasn’t passed, partly because the federal budget is in the way, partly due to arguments over funding unrelated research.
If it is passed, the new capacity will still take years to build out. Micron could then be adding supply to a global glut and it’s pricing, not how many chips Micron makes, that determine its profit.
Those fears would be unfounded if new client demand in the machine internet or the consumer metaverse ramped up. I expect the former to happen, especially in medical devices. But it’s tough to bet on new consumer markets before they establish a “killer app” that can drive demand.
The Bottom Line
Micron is a rare creature — it’s a value stock in a growth industry.
It’s not priced like a value stock because the dividend is nominal, only 10 cents per share each quarter. Instead, Micron supports the stock price with buybacks, whose size varies widely. This leads to volatility in the stock price, even when results don’t merit it.
Stabilizing the stock price would mean raising the company’s dividend, which now costs Micron just $448 million per year. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), whose dividend yields 3.86%, has proven less volatile this year even as growth has reversed. Dividends are what investors want right now. Micron doubling the dividend would raise its cost to $900 million per year but would show confidence in the future and could attract capital.
Without a dividend hike, Micron stock will remain volatile.

2022-07-08 00:00:00+00:00,Why Intel Stock Will Rise Sharply From Here,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-stock-will-rise-sharply-from-here,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Among the most beat-up semiconductor stocks, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is the most disliked one. INTC stock trades at a price-to-earnings and a price-to-sales multiple that value investors will think are too good. By comparison, Intel’s peers, which include Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), are relatively more expensive.
Intel trades at a multi-year discount for a good reason. Since AMD rebuilt its desktop processor architecture, Intel lost its way. After each successive release from AMD, Intel failed to catch up. Late last year, Intel launched the Alder Lake CPU. This platform supports DDR5, a faster memory architecture. It also supports faster PCIe lanes, giving consumers better performance.
Nasdaq’s steep correction scared Intel investors. At these valuations, Intel could rise sharply from here.

Huge Positive Catalyst
Originally set for an early 2021 release, Intel delayed the launch of Arc. The company needed a custom graphics card architecture to widen its addressable market. This schedule miss sparked aggressive stock selling.
7 Best Bargain Stocks to Buy in July 2022
On Jun. 19, Intel officially listed Arc A380 in China for $595, or 3,999 RMB. Intel Arc will have to overclock at speeds of up to 2,450 MHz. The TDP, or energy needed to run the GPU, is only 92 watts.
Intel is playing it safe with this soft launch. China is not a big GPU market for Intel. Instead of taking a risk with a North American launch, it will fine-tune its marketing and pricing in China. More importantly, the chip giant will get feedback from critical customers. It will work out bugs, if any, in the device driver software.
Intel could quickly grow its market share in the U.S. in the coming year. With positive reviews, highly satisfied customers will market Intel Arc on the company’s behalf.
Production Capacity Growth Delay
To hedge against the risk of China invading Taiwan, Intel is smartly widening its manufacturing geography. It planned to build a large chip factory outside of Columbus, Ohio.
Intel said that delays in passing the CHIPS Act would also delay Intel’s factory building plans. In January, Intel said it would spend up to $100 billion to build the plant. It committed to a starting investment of $20 billion.
Intel must get funding approved by Congress. It cannot move forward with its project plan without taking more risks. For example, supply chain disruptions are directly increasing inflation rates. Consumers have lower disposable income, hurting computer chip demand. The Central Bank raised rates to fight inflation, which could lead to a recession. This hurts the sales of PCs. Intel cannot increase demand risks without government support that lowers its costs.
Why INTC Stock Is a Buy
Intel has a superior PC chip architecture. For now, Intel may leverage its advancements by selling as many units of Alder Lake as possible before the downturn.
To broaden its product portfolio, Intel Arc opens up a new market. Intel has the budget to advertise and promote an alternative to Nvidia and AMD graphics cards.
The GPU market still enjoys strong pricing power. Intel needs to capture the market while gamers continue to spend on their upgrades.

WASHINGTON, July 7 (Reuters) - Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has scheduled an all-senators classified briefing on the global innovation and technology race and a proposed bill to boost U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, his office said on Thursday.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell threatened last week to try to block the bill that would provide $52 billion to subsidize U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and boost U.S. competitiveness with China if Democrats move forward with a social spending and climate bill.
The briefing planned for Wednesday from the Biden administration will focus ""on the global innovation and technology race and the bipartisan innovation bill which is vital for America’s long-term national security.""
White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday the Biden administration wants Congress to move quickly, noting Intel Corp INTC.O announced it will invest $20 billion to open semiconductor factories in Ohio ""and that could expand to as much as $100 billion"" if Congress passes chips subsidies.
The Senate legislation, passed in June 2021, included $52 billion for chips subsidies and authorized another $200 billion to boost U.S. scientific and technological innovation to compete with China.
The House version, passed in February, is similar but nearly 3,000 pages long and includes a number of trade proposals not in the Senate bill. Many House provisions are expected to be dropped.
Some fear Congress will not be able to reach a deal before the November congressional elections if it does not come to an agreement in the coming weeks.
A persistent shortage of chips has disrupted the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some companies to scale back production. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who has been making calls in recent days to try to advance the bill, and many companies think the shortage will last at least until late 2023 if not longer.
Lawmakers warn some major investments in new U.S. chip production could be jeopardized without action from Congress.

BRUSSELS, July 7 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are investigating the video licensing policy of the Alliance for Open Media (AOM), whose members include Alphabet GOOGL.O unit Google, Amazon AMZN.O, Apple AAPL.O and Meta FB.O, the European Commission said on Thursday.
The investigation is the latest to hit the tech industry, which will be subject to tough new rules in Europe next year that could force companies to change their core business models and do more to tackle illegal content on their platforms.
""The Commission confirms that it has a preliminary investigation ongoing into AOM's licensing policy,"" a spokesperson for the EU executive told Reuters.
""The fact that the Commission has a preliminary investigation does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation on the existence of an infringement,"" the spokesperson said, without providing further details.
AOM did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Founded in 2015, the group aims to create a new standard software for streaming higher-quality 4K video on browsers, devices, apps, and gaming, known as AV1.
While the AV1 software is not yet adopted widely, Netflix NFLX.O and YouTube have started using it for some customers, and browsers such as Google Chrome and Firefox have started to support the new format.
Apple and Google did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Meta and Amazon declined to comment. Microsoft MSFT.O, Netflix, Broadcom AVGO.O, Cisco CSCO.O and Tencent 0700.HK, who are also AOM members, did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.
Intel INTC.O, Huawei HWT.UL, Mozilla, Samsung 005930.KS and Nvidia NVDA.O are also AOM members, according to its website.
Companies risk fines of up to 10% of their global turnover for breaching EU antitrust rules.

July 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rose on Thursday on expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve would ease the aggressive pace of interest rate hikes later this year amid growing concerns of a recession.
U.S. stock markets have stabilized in July after a brutal sell-off in the first half against the backdrop of a surge in inflation, the Ukraine conflict and the Fed's pivot away from easy-money policy.
The benchmark S&P 500 index .SPX has risen 2.8% so far this month, including session gains, after recording its steepest first-half percentage drop since 1970.
Minutes from the central bank's June policy meeting, where the Fed raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, showed on Wednesday a firm restatement of its intent to get prices under control.
However, Fed officials acknowledged the risk of rate increases having a ""larger-than-anticipated"" impact on economic growth and judged that an increase of 50 or 75 basis points would likely be appropriate at the policy meeting in July.
""The (rate hike) expectations for the July meeting haven't changed much, but the expectation later in the year is coming down a little bit,"" said Michelle Cluver, portfolio strategist at Global X ETFs
Though investors widely expect the Fed to hike rates by another 75 basis points in July, expectations of peak terminal rate next year have come down significantly amid growing worries of a global economic slowdown.
Fed funds futures traders are pricing for the benchmark rate to peak at 3.44% in March. Expectations before the June meeting were that it would increase to around 4% by May. It is currently 1.58%. FEDWATCH, USONFFE=.
Goldman Sachs forecast a 75 basis-point rate hike this month, a 50 basis-point hike in September, and 25 basis-point hikes in November and December.
A report on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week and demand for labor is slowing with layoffs surging to a 16-month high in June.
A closely watched employment report on Friday is expected to show nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 268,000 jobs last month after rising by 390,000 in May.
At 12:07 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 287.57 points, or 0.93%, at 31,325.25, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 48.06 points, or 1.25%, at 3,893.14, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 210.28 points, or 1.85%, at 11,572.13.
GameStop Corp GME.N rose 8.5% as the videogame retailer's board approved a four-for-one stock split.
Intel Corp INTC.O, Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O gained after South Korea's Samsung Electronics 005930.KS turned in its best second-quarter profit since 2018, driven by strong sales of memory chips.
The wider Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX climbed 4%.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4.00-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.53-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

July 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street benchmarks rose on Thursday, as investors reacted positively to the previous day's commentary from the U.S. Federal Reserve which hinted the central bank's aggressive pace of interest rate hikes could be tempered if growth suffered.
U.S. stock markets have stabilized in July after a brutal selloff in the first half against the backdrop of a surge in inflation, the Ukraine conflict and the Fed's pivot away from easy-money policy.
The benchmark S&P 500 index .SPX has risen 3% so far this month, after recording its steepest first-half percentage drop since 1970.
Minutes from the central bank's June policy meeting, where the Fed raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, showed on Wednesday a firm restatement of its intent to get prices under control.

""The (rate hike) expectations for the July meeting haven't changed much, but the expectation later in the year is coming down a little bit,"" said Michelle Cluver, portfolio strategist at Global X ETFs.
Though investors widely expect the Fed to hike rates by another 75 basis points in July, expectations of peak terminal rate next year have come down significantly amid growing worries of a global economic slowdown.
Fed funds futures traders are pricing for the benchmark rate to peak at 3.44% in March. Expectations before the June meeting were that it would increase to around 4% by May. It is currently 1.58%. FEDWATCH, USONFFE=.
Goldman Sachs forecast a 75 basis-point rate hike this month, a 50 basis-point hike in September, and 25 basis-point hikes in November and December.
A report on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week and demand for labor is slowing with layoffs surging to a 16-month high in June.
A closely watched employment report on Friday is expected to show nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 268,000 jobs last month after rising by 390,000 in May.

GameStop Corp GME.N rose 12.8% as the videogame retailer's board approved a four-for-one stock split. Another prominent meme stock, AMC Entertainment AMC.N, jumped 14.4%.

2022-07-07 00:00:00+00:00,INTC August 26th Options Begin Trading,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intc-august-26th-options-begin-trading,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the August 26th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new August 26th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $37.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.77. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $37.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $35.23 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $37.85/share today.
Because the $37.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.78% return on the cash commitment, or 34.92% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $37.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.03. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $37.85/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $40.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.40% if the stock gets called away at the August 26th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $40.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.72% boost of extra return to the investor, or 19.87% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $37.85) to be 32%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Chip stocks, much like most tech sectors in the stock market today, have been under significant pressure over the past year. Sentiments around the $550 billion chip industry were mixed on concerns of weakening consumer demand. Fortunately, it appears that there could be light at the end of the tunnel. On Thursday, Samsung posted a “better than feared” earnings guidance for its second quarter. Making it one of the earliest major chip companies to report earnings after a pivotal quarter. 
The company announced that it expects the upcoming quarter’s revenue to increase to $59.8 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Meanwhile, its operating profit would likely grow by 12% to $10.6 billion. To say the least, it appears that fears of a slowdown among tech manufacturers could be less severe than initially expected. With Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), another major chip company, scheduled to release its earnings next week, all eyes could be on the sector. Building off these positive sentiments, chip stocks could be worth a look right now. So, here are five of the top names in the industry worth noting in thestock market today 
Chip Stocks To Watch Right Now
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD)
Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU)
Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MRVL)
Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ: TXN)
Intel
First, we have one of the top names in the industry, Intel. Put simply, the company designs and manufactures products and technologies. For more than half a century, the company has been the heart of computing breakthroughs. Even now, many believe that Intel will play a huge role in several technological inflections such as artificial intelligence (AI), 5G network transformation, and many more. Now, why is that so? Well, silicon and software is the main driver for these inflections, and the company is at the heart of it all. 
Recently, Intel officially acquired the land required for its Ohio manufacturing plant. According to NBC, an Intel spokesman confirmed that crews have begun work on the land. It appears that a team led by Gilbane Building Company will be responsible for the construction site preparation for its planned factories. Investors would be delighted with this piece of news as there were speculations that the $20 billion project could be scaled back if the CHIPS Act is not passed in the near term. Considering these circumstances, should investors be optimistic about the future of INTC stock?

Advanced Micro Devices
Similar to Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is a force to be reckoned with in the chip sector. In detail, its segments include Computing and Graphics, and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi Custom. Today, AMD offers the industry’s broadest portfolio of leadership high-performance and adaptive processor technologies. The company combines CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, Adaptive SoCs, and deep software expertise to enable leadership computing platforms for cloud, edge, and other end devices. Therefore, AMD stock is often mentioned among the top chip stocks in the stock market. 
On top of that, AMD is not one that easily rests on its laurels. Late in June, the company announced the Versal™ AI Core series has been selected by Canon for its Free Viewpoint Video System. The Versal AI Core devices can deliver powerful machine learning-based video processing at the edge for Canon camera systems. With this, one may expect a revolution in the viewing experience for live sports broadcasting and webcasting. With that in mind, would AMD stock make it to the top of your watchlist?

Micron
Micron is a world leader in innovating memory and storage solutions. The company aims to accelerate the transformation of information into intelligence, inspiring the world to learn, communicate and advance faster than ever. Despite the company predicting a slightly weakened industry demand, Micron is still fundamentally sound. During its third quarter, the company reported revenue of $8.64 billion, an increase of 16.2% year-over-year. Meanwhile, its GAAP net income was $2.63 billion, or $2.34 per diluted share. Overall, the company is still confident that its long-term growth plans are intact.
Furthermore, Micron announced on Wednesday the commercial and industrial channel partner availability of its DDR5 server DRAM. This is in support of industry qualification of next-generation Intel and AMD DDR5 server and workstation platforms. It is a significant development as DDR5 memory enables up to an 85% increase in system performance over its previous generation, DDR4 DRAM5. Hence, as data continues to grow over time, this will address the critical need for the success of most businesses today. All things considered, would you bank on the future of MU stock?

Marvell
Following that, we have a semiconductor company that focuses on chip development for the data infrastructure industry, Marvell. Through Marvell’s cutting-edge chips, tech firms across the globe can move, store, process, and secure their data assets. Among Marvell’s core end markets are the enterprise, cloud, automotive, and carrier architecture industries. As tech firms continue to upscale their data processing infrastructure, MRVL stock could be worth looking out for.
Last month, the company announced an expansion of its Canadian presence in Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver. With growth in mind, Marvell will be adding over 120 new employees to the Marvell Canada team. The team in Canada will be working on the development of critical technologies and solutions for some of the fastest-growing and lucrative end markets in the chip sector. Aside from that, it also shows that the company is reinforcing its commitment to hiring top semiconductor talent across major hubs around the world. With all said and done, would you consider investing in MRVL stock?

Texas Instruments
To sum up the list, we will be looking at Texas Instruments. Essentially, the company designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits. Specifically, Texas focuses on developing analog chips and embedded processors, which account for more than 80% of its revenue. It is also one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world based on sales volume. Additionally, the company produces its digital light processing technology and education technology products such as calculators and microcontrollers. 
In June, Texas announced the expansion of its connectivity portfolio with a new family of wireless microcontrollers. These will allow high-quality Bluetooth Low Energy at half the price of competing devices. Not to mention, these microcontrollers feature the best-in-class standby current and radio-frequency performance. The SimpleLink™ Bluetooth LE CC2340 family is built on the foundation of the company’s decades of wireless connectivity expertise. Given such an exciting development, should investors be keeping a close tab on TXN stock?

July 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were set to open higher on Thursday as investors assessed the outlook for monetary policy amid growing concerns about an economic downturn following aggressive interest rate hikes to tackle inflation.
Global stock markets slumped in the first half of the year against the backdrop of a surge in inflation, the Ukraine conflict and the U.S. Federal Reserve's pivot away from easy-money policy.
U.S. stock indexes ended higher on Wednesday after seesawing for most of the session as minutes of the Fed's policy meeting in June showed a firm restatement of the central bank's intent to get prices under control.
The Fed raised its policy rate by three-quarters of a percentage point in June, the biggest since 1994, with market participants anticipating a similar move in July.
However, officials from the central bank acknowledged the risk of rate increases having a ""larger-than-anticipated"" impact on economic growth and judged that an increase of 50 or 75 basis points would likely be appropriate at the policy meeting later this month.
""(The Fed meeting minutes were) a little bit less hawkish yesterday and that's why you are seeing the market start to reallocate to equities here,"" Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas, said.
""If next week's inflation data is soft, 50 bps hike is on the table ... that is a good thing, especially when we were talking about 75 and some Fed members were saying as much as one point.""
As central banks across the world move to aggressively raise borrowing costs, fears of a recession have mounted, with oil and commodity prices also taking a hit in the recent days.
The S&P 500 .SPX and the Nasdaq .IXIC are down 19.3% and 27.4%, respectively, so far this year after suffering a turbulent first half that saw high-growth and technology stocks getting hammered.
At 08:40 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 156 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 14 points, or 0.36%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 43 points, or 0.36%.
GameStop Corp's GME.N shares rose 5.6% in premarket trading as the videogame retailer's board approved a four-for-one stock split.
Intel Corp INTC.O, Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O rose after South Korea's Samsung Electronics 005930.KS turned in its best second-quarter profit since 2018, driven by strong sales of memory chips.
Investors will keep a close eye on earnings reports, as well as economic data, including the June nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, to gauge the health of the economy.
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week and demand for labor is slowing, data showed, with layoffs surging to a 16-month high in June.

U.S. stock futures are slightly in the green in early morning trading today. This follows the latest insight into the Federal Reserve’s plans to reel in inflation. Namely, the meeting minutes from the Fed’s June talks are now out. The likes of which highlight that Jerome Powell and team are maintaining their focus on tightening monetary policy to address inflation. To be precise, the statement reads, “Participants concurred that the economic outlook warranted moving to a restrictive stance of policy.” Following that, the document also notes, “and they recognized the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if elevated inflation pressures were to persist.”
Speaking on all this is Barclays (NYSE: BCS) analyst, Jonathan Miller. He writes, “A broad-based slowdown in overall consumer spending has already been underway this year, led by deterioration in the goods category, with services providing little in the way of offset.” Additionally, Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley (NASDAQ: RILY) also spoke on the current volatility in markets. He argues, “It’s a tug of war between people who believe the economy will remain strong enough and not go into recession and those who believe we’re already in one.” While taking all this into consideration, here is how the major U.S. stock index futures are doing now. As of 6:22 a.m. ET, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures are trading higher by 0.19%, 0.09%, and 0.14% respectively.
TSM Stock Gains After Rival Samsung Posts Quarterly Earnings Beat Despite Concerns Of Waning Consumer Demand
Shares of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) could be worth considering today. For the most part, this stems from a quarterly update from one of its chip industry rivals, Samsung (OTC: SSNLF). Earlier today, Samsung posted better-than-expected results in its second-quarter financial release. According to the release, Samsung’s revenue for the quarter is up by 21% year-over-year. This could serve to calm investor fears regarding slowing consumer demand amidst rising material prices for tech firms. Overall, it seems that Samsung’s memory and chip-making arm helped to offset these industry headwinds for the quarter. Because of this, the general outlook for TSM could become more bullish.
Not to mention, comments from the Taiwanese Economy Minister, Wan Mei-hua could also contribute to this. According to Mei-hua, Taiwan’s order books for semiconductor chips remain “very full.” She continues by saying, “It looks like at the moment the business is firm for Taiwan’s semiconductor industry.” In the larger scheme of things, all these positive updates are coming at good timing for TSM. This is because it is set to report its second-quarter earnings next week alongside AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). As such, it would not surprise me to see TSM stock coming into focus in the stock market now.

Seagen In Focus Following Reports Of Merck Possibly Looking To Acquire Company For $40 Billion
On the merger and acquisitions front, Seagen (NASDAQ: SGEN) could be considering a possible business sale. In fact, this information comes from a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report posted yesterday. According to the WSJ, Merck (NYSE: MRK) is currently in serious discussions to acquire Seagen. Regarding the timeline of a potential deal, the report states that a final agreement could emerge within several weeks. Should this be the case, WSJ sources note that a deal upwards of $40 billion could emerge.
In detail, all this would put the per-share price for a Seagen takeover at about $200 per share. The WSJ source also adds that the duo are aiming to secure the deal ahead of Merck’s upcoming earnings call. Accordingly, this would be either before or during the July 28 event. While there is no direct confirmation as of now, this would likely see investors eyeing Seagen. This could be the case as mentions of potential takeover interest from Merck last month sent SGEN stock higher as well. Nevertheless, this WSJ report would put SGEN stock in the spotlight today.

Intel Secures Land For Development Of Ohio Manufacturing Plant
In other semiconductor industry news, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is hard at work growing its production capabilities. On the whole, this is apparent from its latest land acquisition in Ohio. According to a report from the Columbus Dispatch, Intel now has the space it requires to begin construction of its Ohio fab. In total, the 750 acres of land in New Albany cost Intel $111 million. Just last week, spokespeople from Intel confirmed that preparatory construction efforts had already begun at the site. According to a spokesperson, “A diverse Ohio-based team led by Gilbane Building Company has begun early work to prepare the site for the construction of our planned factories.”
As a result, it would not surprise me to see investors considering INTC stock at the opening bell today. After all, this would mark a significant update following Intel’s previous updates on its production plant. For some context, this is in reference to the company’s statements regarding possible delays due to Congress not passing the CHIPS Act last month. While funding for the legislation is progressing, Intel notes that it is doing so “more slowly than we expected.” Despite all of this, investors looking to go long on the top chip stocks around may be looking at INTC stock now.

GameStop Announces Four-For-One Stock Split
Meanwhile, GameStop’s (NYSE: GME) board of directors is authorizing a four-for-one stock split. This, according to the company, will be in the form of a stock dividend. GameStop explains that “stockholders of record at the close of business on July 18, 2022, will receive a dividend of three additional shares of the Company’s Class A common stock for each then-held share of Class A common stock.” As it stands, the stock dividend payout is due after the closing bell on July 21.
All in all, this would likely put GME stock on investors’ radars again. After considering its previous notoriety in the meme stock trade, this would be possible. While a stock split does not change the fundamentals of a company, it would make the shares more accessible to retail investors. The likes of which make up a majority of the meme stock trading community. With all this in mind, GME stock would likely be seeing some activity at the opening bell later.

2022-07-06 00:00:00+00:00,Biden in Ohio to woo blue-collar voters,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biden-in-ohio-to-woo-blue-collar-voters,,,"By Nandita Bose
CLEVELAND, July 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden touted plans to bolster pension plans for millions of Americans on a visit to Ohio to woo working class voters frustrated by inflation.
“We have seen the risk that millions of workers face as they watch their hard-earned pensions turn into broken promises. We saw before the pandemic and the economic crisis that followed the millions of retirees that were at risk of losing their retirement security through no fault of their own,"" Biden told union supporters in Cleveland.
While Ohio's urban areas favor Biden's Democrats, the president has tried to chip away at Republican dominance in rural areas with repeated visits and appeals to unionized workers in the state.
The trip on Wednesday was his fourth to Ohio as president.
Biden promised to rescue workers' pensions, from truck drivers to musicians, on the campaign trail.
“We turned a promise broken into a promise kept. It matters to workers, it matters to their families, it matters to the country,"" Biden said.
As part of a COVID-19 relief bill dubbed the American Rescue Plan, the White House and Biden's fellow Democrats secured financial assistance to multi-employer pension funds in the early months of the Biden administration.
The funds, created through employer agreements with unions, are projected to become insolvent in 2026. The proposed financing would keep them solvent until 2051.
Rising prices have left Biden and Democrats' control of the U.S. Senate and House vulnerable at midterm elections in November. Ohio, which former President Donald Trump won in 2020, is home to a competitive Senate race this year.
Biden's public approval rating is close to the lowest level of his presidency, with 57 percent of Americans disapproving of his performance, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll on June 28. https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/POLL/nmopagnqapa/
When Biden visited Ohio in May, he promised to bring back jobs, rebuild the state's manufacturing industry and withstand competition from China.
That message suffered a setback when Intel Corp INTC.O postponed a July 22 groundbreaking for a computer chip plant near the state capital of Columbus, after a planned investment of more than $50 billion in the semiconductor industry stalled in Congress.
With inflation becoming a top issue for voters around the country, Biden's administration has pushed back on recession fears, arguing that it is possible to curb inflation without causing a major economic slowdown.

2022-07-06 00:00:00+00:00,Stock Market Sell-Off: The Best Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2022,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-sell-off%3A-the-best-stocks-to-buy-for-the-second-half-of-2022,,,"The stock market fared terribly in the first half of 2022 thanks to multiple headwinds that seem to have become stronger as the year has progressed.
From Russia's war on Ukraine to rising interest rates to surging inflation and now the possibility of a recession, investors have had several reasons to flee the stock market so far this year. The S&P 500 has declined 20%, while the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has witnessed a severe drop of 33%. But investors shouldn't forget that the stock market has delivered solid average returns over the past decade.
As such, it would be a good idea to buy some top stocks before they start taking off in the second half of the year thanks to some solid catalysts.
A new iPhone could give Apple a nice boost
Smartphone sales may be dwindling this year, but that hasn't kept Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) from increasing its sales thanks to healthy demand for its latest iPhones. The tech giant had shipped 56.5 million iPhones in the first quarter of 2022, a year-over-year increase of 8% as per market research firm Canalys.
Apple grew even though global smartphone shipments contracted 11% during the quarter. What's more, the company increased its share of the global smartphone market to 18% in Q1 from 15% in the prior-year period. It now looks like Apple is expecting robust iPhone sales growth in the second half of the year.
Contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which assembles the iPhones, recently raised its full-year outlook, citing healthy smartphone demand. The Taiwanese company pointed out that its sales in June were up 31% year-over-year on account of improving demand, and added that its third-quarter revenue could witness significant year-over-year growth.
The developments at Foxconn aren't surprising, as Apple is about to start the production of its next iPhone soon. Apple usually refreshes the iPhone lineup in September, and the trend is expected to continue in 2022. This explains why Foxconn is confident of delivering robust growth in the third quarter, and that indicates that Apple may be looking at increasing its production.
A bump in iPhone production isn't out of the picture. Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities estimates that there are 240 million iPhones that are around three and a half years old now, so the next iPhone could set the sales registers ringing and give Apple a nice boost. With the stock trading at 22 times trailing earnings following its 20% drop in 2022, now looks like a good time to buy Apple -- it is cheaper than the Nasdaq-100 index, which has an average earnings multiple of 24.6.
AMD has a new ace up its sleeve
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock has shed half of its value in 2022. But investors looking for a top growth stock on the cheap have a great opportunity to buy AMD right now, as it is trading at just 27 times trailing earnings, compared to its five-year average earnings multiple of 104. Even better, the forward earnings multiple of 17 suggests that its earnings could grow impressively over the next year.
A big reason why AMD's growth could pick up the pace in the second half of the year and beyond is the launch of its new data center server processors. AMD's fourth-generation EPYC server processors, based on a 5-nanometer (nm) manufacturing process codenamed Genoa, will hit the market in the fourth quarter.
AMD claims that these new server processors should deliver strong performance gains over the current-generation chips. For instance, the top-of-the-line Genoa processor is expected to be at least 75% faster than the current-generation chip as far as enterprise performance while running Java applications is concerned.
More importantly, AMD's new server processors should help it take more market share away from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which is the dominant player in this space. A big reason why that could be the case is that Intel's next-generation Sapphire Rapids server processors have been delayed once again. Chipzilla was originally supposed to release its 10nm Sapphire Rapids server chips last year, but it has run into a couple of delays.
Had Intel released its 10nm server chips on time, it would have kept AMD from extending its technology lead in the server processor market. But that's not going to be the case, as the Sapphire Rapids processors will witness a ramp in volume production in 2023. So AMD could continue stealing server market share from Intel.
Mercury Research estimates that it controlled 11.6% of the server CPU (central processing unit) market in the first quarter of 2022. That number is expected to increase to 19% this year, as per Bank of America, and head toward 35% in the long run.
Success in data centers is going to be a critical growth driver for AMD in the long run, and it is one of the reasons why analysts expect its earnings to grow at an annual rate of 28% for the next five years. That's why buying the stock right now looks like a no-brainer, as it could step on the gas in the second half and sustain that momentum in the long run.

Top Analyst Reports for Novo Nordisk, Intel and Qualcomm
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Novo Nordisk A/S, Intel Corp., and Qualcomm Inc.. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
 
You can see all of today's research reports here >>>
Novo Nordisk shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+32.6% vs. +20.1%) on the back of the company's promising diabetes drug, Ozempic. The Zacks analyst has described the Rybelsus launch as further strengthening Novo Nordisk's best-in-class diabetes portfolio.
Ozempic, Rybelsus, Xultophy and Saxenda have been helping the company maintain momentum. Label expansion of these existing drugs is expected to boost sales.
However, lower realized prices in the U.S., loss of exclusivity for products and stiff competition are affecting sales totals. Patent expiration on some of the products in Novo Nordisk's portfolio is a concern. Sales continue to be negatively impacted by the Covid pandemic. Supply challenges for Wegovy have also hurt the stock.
(You can read the full research report on Novo Nordisk here >>>)
Intel shares have declined -28.3% year to date versus the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry's decline of -41.6%. The chip-making major reaffirmed its earlier guidance for 2022 despite short-term headwinds, as it expects demand to pick up in the second half of the year.
The company is riding on prospects of the Internet of Things and Mobileye businesses. Mobileye growth should be driven by design wins amid a recovering auto industry. Recovery in the enterprise business of the data center segment is positive. Intel is developing more integrated solutions that will likely be competitive on a cost-per-watt basis while offering customized solutions for bigger firms.

(You can read the full research report on Intel here >>>)
Qualcomm shares have declined -10.9% over the past year against the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry's decline of -16.7%. The company faces intense competition from low-cost chip manufacturers. High research and development costs are expected to dent margins, while the global chip shortage due to supply-chain disruptions is a headwind. It is susceptible to risks arising from lower handset shipments, especially in China.
However, Qualcomm is focused on retaining its leadership in 5G and the chipset market, delivering low-power resilient multi-gigabit connectivity with best-in-class security. It is witnessing healthy traction in EDGE networking solutions across diverse sectors.
The buyout of Arriver will bolster its ability to deliver fully integrated Advanced Driver Assistance System solutions to automakers. The company is well-positioned to benefit from solid 5G traction with greater visibility and diversified businesses to meet its long-term revenue targets.

2022-07-06 00:00:00+00:00,3 Dividend Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dividend-stocks-to-buy-hand-over-fist-2,,,"Nobody enjoys seeing the stock market decline, but bear markets can be a long-term blessing for investors, especially those looking for passive income.
Dividend yields increase when stock prices decrease, giving investors more bang for their buck.
Remember to always focus on buying quality stocks; here are three blue chips on sale that you can buy hand over fist.
1. Intel
Semiconductors are the building blocks of technology, little chips that make electronics work, from your computer to your car. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is one of the world's leading chip companies. It invented x86 processor chips, one of the world's most commonly used chip architectures, and owns 63% of theglobal marketfor them.
Intel has paid and raised its dividend for the past eight years; investors can get a 4% yield at the current share price. Its dividend payout ratio is just 58%, so it's not an enormous financial burden.

The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 10, a lower valuation than its median P/E of 13 over the past 10 years. Intel's prospects are also promising; the company is spending billions to build production capacity in the United States, turning it into a leader in chip manufacturing.
Analysts expect Intel's earnings per share (EPS) to grow by 7% annually over the next three to five years, supporting continued dividend increases.
2. 3M Company
Consumers typically see nothing but finished goods on store shelves, not realizing the many little components that go into making them. 3M Company (NYSE: MMM) produces many of them; the industrial conglomerate makes over 60,000 products, including window film, Post-it notes, and respirator masks.
The company's strong brand and diverse products have made it a reliable dividend stock; its payout has been raised annually for 65 consecutive years, making it one of the few active Dividend Kings. Investors can grab a 4.6% yield today, supported by a healthy 67% dividend payout ratio.
Analysts are optimistic about 3M, calling for EPS growth averaging almost 10% per year over the next three to five years.

3M's industrial roots could make it vulnerable to a recession, but management has navigated multiple economic scenarios to maintain its dividend growth streak and is poised to continue that. The company has $3.3 billion in cash and a leverage ratio of just 1.9 times EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). Investors should sleep well at night owning this proven blue chip. The stock trades at a P/E of just 13 against its decade median of 20.
3. T. Rowe Price Group
You might use T. Rowe Price Group (NASDAQ: TROW) financial products and not even realize it. It operates many of the mutual and exchange-traded funds investors use and offers wealth management and advisory services. It makes money by charging a percentage of its assets under management (AUM), which grow from an increase in market value or from new money from investors.
T. Rowe Price is a Dividend Aristocrat, a member of the S&P 500 that's increased its dividend annually for at least 25 consecutive years -- 36 years in this case. The dividend yield is excellent at almost 4.2%, and investors get an occasional special dividend, a nice bonus.
Analysts believe profits will grow 6% annually over the next three to five years, giving dividend investors some peace of mind.

The stock market has historically increased over time, which bodes well for T. Rowe Price's business outlook. The market steadily growing AUM increases how much revenue the company makes. A bear market or other sharp plunge in market values of T. Rowe's AUM could hurt the business, but it has $2 billion in cash on hand against zero debt. Meanwhile, the stock is on sale with a P/E of 9 against its median of 16 over the past 10 years.
