2022-04-28 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) Q1 Earnings and Revenues Beat Estimates,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-q1-earnings-and-revenues-beat-estimates,,,"Intel (INTC) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.87 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.80 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.39 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8.75%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this world's largest chipmaker would post earnings of $0.90 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.09, delivering a surprise of 21.11%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.
Intel, which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, posted revenues of $18.35 billion for the quarter ended March 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.18%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $19.67 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Intel shares have lost about 12.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -12.2%.
What's Next for Intel?
While Intel has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Intel: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.85 on $18.39 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.48 on $75.31 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor - General is currently in the top 8% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
Another stock from the same industry, Nvidia (NVDA), has yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2022. The results are expected to be released on May 25.
This maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +40.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
Nvidia's revenues are expected to be $8.11 billion, up 43.3% from the year-ago quarter.

2022-04-28 00:00:00+00:00,"Vedanta seeks free land, cheap water, power in race to be India's first chipmaker-sources",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vedanta-seeks-free-land-cheap-water-power-in-race-to-be-indias-first-chipmaker-sources,,,"By Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil
NEW DELHI, April 28 (Reuters) - In a race to become India's first chip maker, Vedanta Ltd VDAN.NS is seeking 1,000 acres (405 hectares) of free land from states and other incentives for its $20 billion foray into semiconductor and display manufacturing, sources told Reuters.
The oil-to-metals conglomerate in February said it will diversify into chip manufacturing and announced plans to form a joint venture with Taiwan's Foxconn 2317.TW to support Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plans to make India a semiconductor manufacturing hub.
Though Vedanta is seeking federal incentives under a Modi programme offering fiscal support, it is separately asking states for 1,000 acre of land free of cost on a lease for 99 years, according to two sources with direct knowledge of .
It needs 700 acres for its own facility, and the remainder for ancillaries.
Vedanta has told state governments that its operations would help them generate $2.2 billion in tax revenues over 20 years and create up to 100,000 direct and indirect jobs, said the first source.
The company is in advanced stages of reviewing proposals from at least three Indian states, Telangana and Karnataka in the south, and Maharashtra in west, added the source.
Vedanta did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives of the IT and industries department in the three states did not immediately respond.
More corporations and nation states, including India, are looking at ways to have seamless access to chips, which is at the core of many future critical technologies such as artificial intelligence and 5G.
Most of the world's chip output is limited to a few countries like Taiwan and United States. India, albeit a late entrant, is now actively luring companies, saying in December it wants to ""usher in a new era in electronics manufacturing.""
From $15 billion in 2020, Indian semiconductor market is estimated to reach $63 billion by 2026, the government says.
Chip plants generally consume electricity and water in huge quantities and their erratic supplies often concern industry in India.
As part of lobbying the states, Vedanta is demanding water and power at concessionary and fixed prices for a period of 20 years, the sources said.
The first source added that Vedanta expects its plants to eventually consume about 40 million litres of water daily. That would be roughly the amount of water required for a city with more than 300,000 people, going by the suggested benchmark for urban water supply by the Indian government.
Separately, while Modi's federal scheme could offer 50% financing support on the project's capital expenditure, Vedanta is seeking additional incentives from states, the source said.
India, hoping to attract more global investments in the space, will hold from Friday a three-day semiconductor conference in its southern tech hub of Bengaluru that Modi will inaugurate.
Singapore's IGSS Ventures and ISMC, a joint venture between Abu Dhabi-based Next Orbit Ventures and Israel's Tower Semiconductor, have also sought federal incentives under Modi's programme.

Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining us today. Q1 was another solid quarter where we beat on the top line, exceeded our guidance on gross margin and EPS, and where we continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy to unlock a $1 trillion market opportunity. As we laid out at our recent Investor Day, our strategy is built around 4 key pillars. We will deliver leadership products anchored on open and secure platforms powered by at-scale manufacturing and supercharged by our people.
In Q1, we made great progress in all of these areas, and we are continuing to hold our full-year revenue outlook. In our data center and AI group, we began shipping initial SKUs of Sapphire Rapids to select customers as planned. We also unveiled our expanded dual-track Xeon road map that strengthens our position in both per core performance and performance per watt for cloud and enterprise workloads. We launched our Arc A Series GPUs for laptops, taking our first steps to give the graphics industry a much needed new addition.
Mobileye demonstrated its Level 4 self-driving system in Jerusalem, a major milestone in preparation for its upcoming robotaxi services. We continue to add to our talent with strong industry leaders like Christoph Schell, who recently joined us from HP as our chief commercial officer. And finally, we took another major step in creating a balanced semiconductor supply chain with the announcement of our plans for new investments in Europe. We also held the grand opening of our latest leading-edge factory in Oregon, including a new name for the campus, the Gordon Moore Park at Ronler Acres, which recognizes our founder and the site's unique contribution to driving Moore's Law.
Q1 also marked a special moment for Intel as we announced our plans to further reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and develop more sustainable technology solutions, including using 100% renewable energy across our global operations by 2030 and achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in our global operations by 2040. Overall, Q1 was a great start to the year as we continue to execute on the path to our long-term growth story. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are executing at a torrid pace, and I remain confident in our path forward. Before I get into specific updates for each of our business units, let me start with some observations of what we are seeing in the industry.
I continue to believe we are just at the beginning of a long-term growth cycle across semiconductors. We continue to see some match set limitations in areas like ethernet, some softening in low-end consumer PC, and some inventory adjustments, as we discussed on our last call. But overall, the demand signals from customers continue to be robust in areas like enterprise, cloud, AI, graphics, and networking. Semiconductors are the fuel of innovation and transformation across a wide range of industries.
In the supply chain, lockdowns in Shanghai and the war in Ukraine have demonstrated more than ever that the world needs more resilient and more geographically balanced semiconductor manufacturing. The chip shortage costs the U.S. economy $240 billion last year and we expect the industry will continue to see challenges until at least 2024 in areas like foundry capacity and tool availability. As an IDM, we believe we are in a good position in the industry to manage through these constraints.
In fact, Intel is rising to meet this challenge. Following our announcements in Arizona, New Mexico, and Ohio, we recently announced a series of investments in Europe, spanning our existing operations as well as our new investments in France and Germany, the Silicon Junction. These investments position Intel to meet the future growth and represent a significant step toward our moonshot goal of having half the world semiconductor manufacturing located in the U.S. and Europe.
The pace at which we can reach this goal is dependent on the actions of the U.S. and other governments. America showed leadership when Congress passed the CHIPS Act, but the global situation has grown even more serious since then. The EU has been very aggressive in moving legislation forward to meet this challenge, and I recently testified before the Senate to highlight the critical need for the U.S.
to fund the CHIPS Act. I continue to encourage Congress to fund this critical legislation and enable us to move faster toward making a balanced semiconductor supply chain a reality. Turning now to Intel. We continue to make great progress on our plans to deliver five process nodes in four years.
Intel 7 is ramping extremely well with Alder Lake and on Intel 4, Meteor Lake has now successfully booted Windows 12 and Linux. The speed at which the team was able to achieve this milestone is a significant sign of the health of both Meteor Lake and our Intel 4 process technology. We plan to deliver several additional milestones in 2022, demonstrating our process technology development remains on track. This includes early Sierra Forest preproduction wafers on Intel 3, IP test wafers on Intel 28, and foundry customer test chips and initial IP shovels on Intel 18a.
Simply put, we remain on and in some places, ahead of schedule to deliver five nodes in four years. Our manufacturing network continues to perform well in a challenging environment. For the first time in years, Intel fabs and our substrate supply are close to meeting our customers' demand. Using our IDM advantage, the team was able to remix almost 3 million units within lead time to meet changing demand signals.
For example, we were able to partner with Meta to improve their Xeon supply and meet their needs. Finally, our supply chain resilience showed as our teams work tirelessly to mitigate any significant disruptions to our factory operations from the war in Ukraine, supplier shutdowns, and COVID lockdowns in China. Turning to our business groups. At our Investor Day, we laid out our long-term growth strategy centered around six distinct but highly complementary business units, a structure that provides investment flexibility increased market resilience, and enhance transparency for investors.
And in fact, we will report our results in this structure for the first time today. Our client group continues to deliver world-class platforms, positioning us to win share, grow ASP and win share of market. There is broad ecosystem agreement that the long-term PC market is sustainably larger going forward driven by PC density, refresh rates, and increased penetration as the PC remains the essential tool for work, learn, and play. We are seeing particular strength in gaming and in commercial PCs that is somewhat tempered by slower consumer inflationary pressure and customer inventory management, which Dave will talk more to later.
Our 12th gen Alder Lake family continues to ramp in Q1, and we have already shipped more than 15 million units. This family now has more than 250 designs planned this year from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, Samsung, and others. And it includes the world's fastest desktop processor, the Core i9-12900KS. Alder Lake will scale across every segment, including for businesses of all sizes with the launch of our latest vPro platform.
vPro offers industry-leading manageability and security for business, including the first and only hardware-based ransomware detector with Intel Threat Detection. The strength of our client road map continues with Raptor Lake, where we are shipping both desktop and mobile samples to our customers today, and we plan to follow that with Meteor Lake in 2023. In data center, DCAI had strong year-on-year growth as customers continue to choose Intel and as we continue to deliver increasing value and innovation, we are seeing strength in both hyperscaler and enterprise, and we expect the market to grow double digits going forward, driven by workloads like AI and security. Here, too, we are seeing ecosystem supply constraints, particularly in Ethernet that have limited end system shipments, which we expect to be a headwind through the year.
Our third-generation Intel Scalable processor Ice Lake has now shipped almost 4 million units and Amazon Web Services recently announced general availability of its EC2 I4i instance designed for storage and I/O intensive workloads. This is the 48th AWS instance powered by Ice Lake. I am also pleased to say that as committed, we began shipping initial SKUs of our fourth-gen Intel Xeon scalable processor, Sapphire Rapids, to select customers in Q1. These are the first of many SKUs for Sapphire Rapids with more due to ramp throughout the remainder of the year.
We also unveiled our expanded dual-track Xeon road map using performance and efficient cores delivered in a common platform, maximizing customer investments and on the cadence they prefer. Our first-generation E core Xeon will be Sierra Forest, which is designed to maximize performance per watt, providing high-density, ultraefficient compute for the cloud. For workloads that benefit from high performance per core and low latency like AI, we have our redefined Granite Rapids on Intel 3 with a new and improved P core. The strength of Intel Agilex and Stratix 10 FPGAs generated record revenue as we continue to win designs and ramp into key markets.
Intel FPGA-based IPUs are deployed in volume at 5 of the top 6 cloud service providers, and we continue to win designs with comm service providers utilizing Intel's latest generation FPGAs and eASICs. Our launch of the Habana Gaudi-based AWS EC2 DL1 instance has shown end customers how they can reduce training costs by as much as 40% versus GPU-based instances. One of the early customers, Mobileye, is now using DL1 for training their object detection models. Gaudi 2 is already sampling the customers and demonstrating leadership performance versus competitive GPUs on multiple workloads.
Finally, we continue to build our extensive data center software capabilities and recently announced the acquisition of Granulate. Granulate is a SaaS service that improves performance in cloud costs with its autonomous dynamic optimization service to unmodified customer workloads. The network and edge market continues to be strong with the transformation from proprietary fixed-function devices to fully programmable, software-defined infrastructure. Our Network and Edge Group is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this transition and had record revenue in Q1.
At Mobile World Congress, NEX launched our newest Xeon D processor, built specifically for software-defined infrastructure across the network and edge, our latest Xeon D has more than 70 leading companies working on designs, including Cisco, Juniper Networks, and Rakuten Symphony. We believe that in the network, O-RAN and vRAN, have reached a tipping point as the preferred model of all future network deployments. Nearly all commercial deployments running today are using Xeon and our FlexRAN software. We have more than 10 engagements with major global operators that we expect to be in high-volume commercial deployment within the next two years.
We also launched a new version of our OpenVINO software toolkit, with downloads growing 70% year over year. Built on the foundation of one API, OpenVINO has enabled hundreds of thousands of developers to dramatically accelerate performance on rapidly growing AI workloads at the edge, including Z-block Computational who is using OpenVINO to deliver their AI MicroCloud solution to cities everywhere. Going forward, the scale-out of 5G, the explosion of AI inferencing, and the growth of low latency workloads will further drive the need for compute at the edge. They will eventually begin to shift compute from the cloud, making the edge the next wave of semiconductor growth.
With a broad portfolio of hardware, software, and deep ecosystem partnerships, NEX remains positioned to lead the transformation across the network and to win the edge. Moving to our emerging businesses. Our accelerated computing systems and graphics group builds on our installed base of CPUs, IP, and software and leverages a thriving open ecosystem to disrupt a large and growing market. In Q1, AXG had strong growth and celebrated a major milestone with the official launch of the Intel Arc A Series portfolio for laptops.
Alchemist, the first of these products has been shipping to customers since early Q1 with designs from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, and others. The A-Series enables up to a two times performance improvement in graphics versus integrated graphics and incorporates Intel Deep Link technology, which utilizes Intel integrated graphics to increase application performance by up to 30%. The first laptops with Intel Arc 3 GPUs are available now. These will be followed by even more powerful designs with Intel Arc 5 and Intel Arc 7, along with desktop and workstation offerings later this year.
In the data center, our flagship Ponte Vecchio GPU for high-performance computing and AI is sampling to customers. Ponte Vecchio, along with Sapphire Rapids with high-bandwidth memory, will power the two Exaflop Aurora Supercomputer at Oregon National Laboratory. In addition, Arctic Sound, our general-purpose data center GPU designed for industry-leading media graphics and AI inference capabilities, will be available in the second half of the year. Finally, in Q1, we announced our intent to contribute to the development of blockchain technologies.
Intel will help advance this technology in a responsible and sustainable way by developing energy-efficient computing technologies at scale. Blockscale, our first blockchain accelerator, is sampling today and will ship in production later this year. AXG remains on track to deliver over $1 billion in revenue this year. Our Intel foundry services hit a $1 billion run rate for the first time as we continue to make progress toward being the trusted provider of foundry services.
Our overall customer pipeline remains robust, and we now have more than 10 qualified opportunities in advanced stages of engagement across our process and package offerings that collectively represent a deal value of greater than $5 billion. We have over 30 test chips committed to Intel 16 this year, and we expect the first Intel 3 and Intel 18a customer test chips to tape out in the second half of 2022. Our work with our five target anchor customers is progressing well. We expect additional updates later this year.
Finally, we have seen tremendous enthusiasm from customers for our acquisition of Tower. Tower shareholders recently approved the proposed acquisition. We have completed regulatory review in two jurisdictions outside the U.S. and hope to close the transaction as soon as possible.
Building on its market leadership in ADAS and AV solutions, Mobileye Advanced system launches have continued, including the next-generation BMW 7 Series with the leading-edge combination of EyeQ5 and an 8-megapixel camera as well as BMW Highway Assistant, which enables hands-free driving on separated roadways up to 80 miles per hour. We also added Miami and Stuttgart to our global AV testing program, bringing the total number of places where we have tested AVs to 10 cities in six countries across three continents. Additionally, we recently showcased Mobileye's Level 4 self-driving system in action for the first time with a robotaxi navigating the streets of Jerusalem. Mobileye expects to launch its commercial robotaxi services in Munich and Tel Aviv by the end of 2022.
And finally, we remain committed to unlocking shareholder value and are working on our plans to take Mobileye public in 2022. In March, we announced that we confidentially submitted a draft registration statement with the SEC. The IPO is proceeding smoothly, and we continue to make good progress as we work with the SEC to refine our Form S-1. Before turning it over to Dave, I wanted to close with a few thoughts.
First, I look forward to hosting our customers, partners, and analysts at our Intel Vision event in Dallas on May 10 and 11. This will be our second Intel on series event dedicated to the future of business and technology. Next, as I said at our Investor Day, we believe we have a tremendous growth story over the next several years. We're investing in innovation and embracing an open approach to compute platforms and manufacturing.
We continue to add to our incredible pool of technical talent. And of course, we remain intensely focused on rebuilding our execution machine. Finally, we'll continue to highlight our progress in key operational milestones as we manage within the financial framework we laid out in February. I know I speak for over 120,000 Intel employees when I say that while we have work to do, our best days are ahead.
With that, let me turn it over to Dave.
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a solid quarter, exceeding revenue, gross margin percentage, and EPS guidance despite continued ecosystem supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures, and macroeconomic uncertainty. Three of our six newly formed business segments, NEX, Mobileye, and IFS, achieved record quarterly revenue. Revenue was $18.4 billion, slightly exceeding our guidance, led primarily by broad-based strength in our NEX business.
Gross margin for the quarter was 53%, exceeding our guidance by 100 basis points on improved manufacturing yields and lower factory costs. EPS was $0.87, $0.07 above our guide on higher gross profit and slightly lower operating expenses. Operational cash flow for the quarter was $5.9 billion and we received an additional $4.6 billion from the McAfee equity sale. Total cash and investments increased by $9.7 billion in the quarter to $39 billion, driven by the NAND divestiture and McAfee sale.
Capex for the quarter was $4.6 billion. Now turning to our newly formed business unit results. CCG revenue was $9.3 billion, down 13% year over year on ramp-down of the Apple CPU and modem business, the expected OEM inventory burn we cited in our Q4 call as well as lower consumer and education demand. CPU ASPs were up greater than 25% year over year on richer mix and strong demand for our high-end mobile and desktop products across both our commercial and consumer segments.
Operating profit was down 34% year over year on lower revenue, increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and increased spending to further strengthen our product and platform road map. DCAI revenue was $6 billion, up 22% year over year on strong Xeon demand from both our hyperscale and enterprise customers. DCAI operating profit was flat year over year as increased revenue was offset by increased 10-nanometer mix, factory start-up charges, and increased investment in our technology and product road map. NEX achieved all-time record quarterly revenue of $2.2 billion, up 23% year over year on broad-based strength across the cloud, networking, and niche product lines.
Operating profit was $366 million, up 51% year over year on higher revenue, offset by increased investment. Mobileye achieved all-time record quarterly revenue of $394 million, up 11% sequentially and 5% in comparison to Q1 '21, which saw exceptionally strong auto production and pipeline rebuilding due to COVID-related recovery last year. Operating profit was $148 million, down 13% year over year on increased investment in next-generation products. AXG revenue was $219 million, up 21% year over year on the ramp of its supercompute and Alchemist discrete GPU products.
Operating loss was $390 million versus an operating loss of $176 million in Q1 '21, with the increase driven by new product qualification reserves on our Alchemist and Arctic Sound products, production ramp charges, and increased investment. IFS revenue was $283 million, up 175% year over year on increased IMF tool shipments, increased automotive demand, and initial revenue from Amazon and Cisco. Operating loss was $31 million, roughly flat year over year as revenue and gross margin increases were offset by increased investment to build out the custom foundry business. Moving to our full year and Q2 guidance.
As Pat mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong end-user demand for our products across each of our business units and we reaffirm our revenue guidance of $76 billion, as lower than previously expected PC revenue is offset by NEX growth and DCAI hyperscale customer strength. More specifically, in our PC business, we continue to see strong commercial demand, offset by low-end consumer and education softness and the impact of no longer shipping to customers in Russia and Belarus. Further, component supply constraints continue to be a challenge with the most recent COVID lockdowns in Shanghai, further increasing supply chain risk and contributing to inflationary pressures that are having a negative impact on PC TAM for the year. As a result, we're seeing OEMs continue to lower inventory levels to better match demand and align with other system components.
We expect elements of this inventory burn to continue in Q2, subsiding in the second half of the year. Although these headwinds have reduced our CCG revenue forecast, we expect CCG revenue to increase in the second half of the year as a return to normal seasonality boost demand, OEM inventory burn subsides and the ramp of our leadership, Alder Lake and Raptor Lake products position us to compete per share. For DCAI, we also expect to see a stronger second half of the year as hyperscale customer demand remains robust, component supply improves and the ramp of Ice Lake and Sapphire Rapids increased competitiveness. For NEX, we expect the strength we saw in Q1 to continue with growth throughout the year, fueled by improving component supply, continued 5G ramp, and transformation at the edge.
For AXG, we continue to expect full-year revenue greater than $1 billion, driven by the launch and ramp of the Alchemist, Arctic Sound M, Ponte Vecchio and Blockscale products. Finally, we expect to see second-half growth in each of our two remaining businesses, Mobileye and IFS, as they ramp new products and secure new customers. For gross margin, we're guiding 52%, in line with the 51% to 53% range previously communicated. Note that the inflationary environment creates a headwind that we are continuing to monitor but we remain confident in our ability to mitigate the impact through continued cost reduction programs as well as increased pricing in certain segments of the business.
For EPS, we're guiding $3.60, $0.10 higher than prior guide on the Q1 beat and a slightly improved tax rate of 12%. Finally, net capex guidance of $27 billion and moderately negative adjusted free cash flow for the year remain unchanged. We have made significant progress on our smart capital initiatives, and we'll continue to manage within the framework communicated at Investor Day. Moving to Q2 guidance.
For revenue, we're guiding $18 billion, down 2% sequentially on the short-term headwinds detailed earlier and the impact of an additional 14th week in Q1. For the lockdowns in Shanghai, we're estimating the impact to be relatively contained under the assumption that these restrictions are nearing an end. Even under a short lockdown, we anticipate it will take some time for the supply chain to normalize. And if the lockdowns persist or spread beyond Shanghai, we could see more material impacts to our outlook.
For gross margin, we're guiding 51%, down approximately 200 basis points sequentially on increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and Raptor Lake prequalification reserves. We had always expected Q2 gross margin to be at the low end of our range and with our full-year guide of 52%, we expect gross margin to inflect upward in the second half of the year as revenue increases and inventory reserve sell-through. Finally, we're guiding a tax rate of 12% and EPS of $0.70, down $0.17 sequentially on lower gross profit and higher opex. With that, let me turn it back over to Tony and get to your questions.

Questions & Answers:

Operator
And our first question coming from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
OK. Let me ask a question. Pat, I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the inventory dynamic you're talking about. Your inventory is up internally, but you're talking about some of the inabilities to ship with match sets, etc., going forward.
So can you guys just give a little more color on where the specific Intel inventory is versus a more generic inventory and shortage problem, specifically in the PC side of your business, it seems?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Thank you, Ross. And I'll just start out by saying, again, I'm really pleased with the team and what had plenty of turbulence in Q1 and to meet and beat in Q1 was really spectacular. Now on the inventory piece, we did talk about that we are building 10-nanometer inventory.
We have new products that we're ramping into the marketplace. And we do see some of those will be reversals as we go into the latter part of the year as that inventory will start flowing through the product area. So we would say this is very typical management of new product ramps and specifically around Sapphire Rapids, Alder Lake, we'll start seeing Raptor Lake as well. So those will be the key areas that you'll see that inventory shift occurring.
Also, as we've indicated, we did see our customers' inventory burn down in Q1. We expect some of that to be in Q2 as well. But by the second half, we expect those adjustments and obviously the strength of second-half outlook, we do expect much of that inventory burn to have finished in the first half and a strong second half as we're ramping our new products that will have much better performance feature some of that with higher costs, but also coming with higher ASPs.

Our next question coming from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Stacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I know you held the full year, but I mean the first half is kind of coming in lower, so it does kind of imply that you're taking the second half probably up versus the prior expectations. But in that light, obviously, we've got PCs that maybe look like they're at risk.
You talked about China shutdowns that if they last longer, that could bring risk. You talked about issues, I guess, with server builds that your customers that you said would persist. I guess what gives you the confidence that things actually will be inflecting? And it looks like you're looking for kind of a hockey stick across all of your businesses in the second half to first? Like how do investors get confidence that that's after the way things are going to be playing out and that you've built enough conservatism in the guide? I guess, long story short, I'm asking why hold the annual guide in the wake of all that?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Thank you, Stacy. And clearly, we overachieved in Q1, right? Q2, we were -- it's a little bit lighter, right? Given some of those, we've taken it down a bit, given some of those factors, but not substantially. This is very in line with what we expected.
We were always forecasting a stronger second half of the year. And that's what gives us confidence. We have built into our year guide, some room, right, for things to happen. Like any good company would we built some expectations that not everything goes right.
And that's why we're very confident in reaffirming our overall yearly revenue guidance. Now let's tease apart some of the factors that give us that confidence. First, we'd say, hey, we see strong growth in our DCAI business. We see strong growth in our particularly those areas, those are long lead time businesses with our customers.
We have strong views of the business expectations that we have. We do see strength in the enterprise and governance business. First half to second half, you always see the normal cyclicality of the client business and particularly in the second half, we're going into a much stronger product line with Alder Lake and Raptor Lake, and the reversal of inventories for Raptor Lake and Sapphire Rapids starting to hit there as well, which will be very nice to improve both operating gross margins as well as the revenue outlook. And then, right, we have an extraordinary set of products that were coming in the second half of the year.
When you think about AXG, we have all of the discrete products ramping in addition to the mobile ones that we launched in Q1. We have our new GPU products with Arctic Sound. We have Ponte Vecchio ramping. We also have our blockchain products ramping.
We have the new Xeon and NEX ramping, IFS is ramping. We see strength in our Mobileye business. So all of these give us confidence in the second half. And this is very consistent with the outlook that we gave in our Investor Day.
We were always expecting this to be the characteristic of first half and second half. And obviously, a small beat in Q1, a little bit of weakness in Q2 that we've accounted for these disruptions and strength in the second half. We are on track to do exactly what we said at the Investor Day, and we're building momentum to accomplish exactly that, with the great execution that we saw in the first quarter around products, around manufacturing, around dealing with supply chain challenges. This machine is building momentum.
We're confident in our second-half outlook.
Stacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst
OK, guys. Thanks.
Tony Balow -- Head of Investor Relations
Thank you. Next question.
Operator
Our next question coming from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Hey. Apologies for the confusion earlier. Thank you for taking the question. I guess given the change in segments, I would love to try to set the stage here for what expectations should look like for the big 3, CCG, DCAI, and NEX into Q2? And then for all of 2022, if there's any way you can kind of help plus or minus to the relative growth rates that you're guiding to for both June and the full year?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Thanks, C.J. And overall, this is the first quarter we're giving clear updates against the six business units. Clearly, that means things like DCAI, we're pulling out the NEX business from what might have been counted for before as part of data center.
And we're giving clear views of how those businesses are performing, respectively. Overall, what we said in the client business, we'll see the seasonality plus a bit and the client business because of the strength of the product line. In DCAI, we see growth through the second half of the year. And we had strong year-on-year growth in the data center and AI business in Q1.
And NEX, we expect that we're growing faster than the market. This is a good business for us. We're uniquely well-positioned, and we see the strength of the network and edge being an area of particular growth. We were well over 20% growth rate in that business in Q1.
So -- well, I don't think we'll see those kind of growth rates for the rest of the year, but a very strong growth business. But I'd also highlight that we are seeing the growth businesses, IFS, AXG, and Mobileye being very strong growers for us, and they'll start more meaningfully as we go into the second half of the year, which is a little bit of the answer to Stacy's question before, solid growth across all of the business areas of the company, and we're starting to start seeing these new areas contribute in meaningful ways. So overall, affirming the second half of the year, seeing strength in all of the business areas, the product, the execution, all of them getting stronger.

Our next question coming from the line of Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. Your line is open.
Pierre Ferragu -- New Street Research -- Analyst
I'd like to focus on the 10-nanometer node and Intel 7. And maybe for you, Dave, first, you mentioned 100 basis points driven by improved yields. It's like really music to my ears, as you can imagine. And I'd love to see a bit more, visibly this came as a surprise.
So what's happening there? And could we hope for like continued improved deal on Intel 7 driving some positive surprise on the gross margin? Or should we assume that this node has a very little room to improve? And maybe for Pat on the same topic, Intel 7, I don't know if it reflects reality, but there is a lot of noise in the market about products ramping slowly, which is a cadence at which Sapphire Rapids is ramping. It seems a bit slow, a bit difficult. So my question in all candor is do these nodes, 10-nanometer and Intel 7, make it difficult to get into the market with products? Is that slowing the pace at which Intel can execute on the velocity of the road map? And should we expect things to go much, much faster when you move to Intel 4 and Intel 3?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
So I'll start, and then I'll ask Dave to jump in. So overall, as we said, our five nodes in four years, we're performing well. Intel 7 is ramping more rapidly than we would have expected. Intel 4, we updated that we have a Meteor Lake now powered on, which is our first product on Intel 4.
Intel 3, we'll see the test wafers on that with our leadership products with Sierra Forest. In fact, just today, we taped out our first Granite Rapids compute die as well. We'll have the test wafers on 20a and 18a, which we expect to be a big foundry node as well. So I'll say, overall, the technology pipeline is doing tremendously well, and really proud of our teams there.
Intel 10, it's ramping very well. We're seeing good yields on that as Dave reflected, which overall gives us good momentum. In terms of products, Alder Lake has been a star, and it's ramping comfortably ahead of our expectations there, which has reaffirmed the health of Intel 7. Sapphire Rapids that you called out, it was first PRQ this quarter, and many of the additional SKUs, PRQ, and Q2 in the second half of the year, and that's why you might be getting some of that views of the more muted ramp there.
But we delivered on exactly what we said. First-quarter PRQs of Sapphire Rapids, and we'll see strength in that as we go through the rest of the year. Also, Ice Lake has ramped very nicely now for our 10-nanometer server part. So overall, the technology and the manufacturing machine are performing quite well and really bode well for our outlook for this year and the years to come.
So Dave, if you might add?
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. So we had a good quarter in the first quarter in terms of yields. We are going to see a little bit of pressure on 10-nanometer in the second quarter. That's part of the reason we're seeing margins down to the low end of our stated range of 51%.
But we do expect a nanometer to become a tailwind for us as costs improve through the back half of the year. And although Intel 7 is behind that, we're expecting the same from Intel 7.

Our next question coming from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joseph Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Great. Thank you for letting me ask a question. Dave, I think I heard you say CPU ASPs and client were up 25% year over year. It's a pretty big number.
Is that -- how much of that is -- if I heard that right, how much of that is mix shift away from things like Chromebooks? How much of that is success with new products like Alder Lake? Can you just give us a little bit more color on the delta there?
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
I mean a lot of it is obviously mix, either shifting away from consumer education and newer product ramps. But as I said in the prepared remarks, given the inflationary environment, we are looking for targeted price increases in certain segments. So that really hasn't shown up that much yet, but will be part of the story going forward through the year.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes. And I'll just say, overall, the product line is healthy. we're seeing the mix shifts as you move to Alder Lake, Raptor Lake being very strong, Ice lake as well. We'll start to see Sapphire Rapids factor into that in the second half of the year.
So overall, we're coming into a stronger product cycle, Joe, right, which just gives us more opportunity to right to deliver higher value to customers, remix the products to higher price points. But overall, just have a more competitive product line as we go compete for market share as well.

Your next question coming from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On Accelerated Computing and Graphics, client discrete GPU market is a pretty big market opportunity for Intel, right, $12 billion, $13 billion per year.
So it looks like you guys started ramping your GPU into notebooks now, your first-gen product, the reviews look quite constructive. Is the team still on track to roll out desktop versions this quarter and still on track to ship 4 million plus discrete GPUs this year? And then any feedback from customers or gaming developers will be helpful as well.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Thank you, Harlan. And overall, AXG is on track. And we launched the mobile SKUs.
We'll have the desktop SKUs coming in Q2. And we'll have more SKUs as we go through the year as well. We'll be filling out the product line. A lot of work, right, in qualifying games.
And if you're a gamer, you know that there's just a lot of individual optimization work on some of the key titles so that work is underway, working with our OEMs to populate their portfolios of products as well. So I'll say you're going to see more and more of that hitting the market, and we'll be filling out -- we have the three versions. We'll have the five, seven, and nine versions of the year products coming out we go build up that portfolio this year. And also, as I alluded to, AXG just has a boatload of products that is coming out across different segments, our high-performance computing products, our GPU products for data center, our blockchain of products.
So in addition to the discrete graphics products, we have just a lot of products coming out of it. So overall, it's on track for the volume goals as well as for hitting the $1 billion revenue goal that we said at Investor Day as we go build, as we said, over the five-year horizon to a $10-plus billion business. We see this as a great opportunity for us. And we have some unfair advantages with technologies like Deep Link, where we really get to build on the strong robust installed base that we have, the many years of software work that we've built into the foundations of the PC platform.
So these are reasons that we do think that we have a great opportunity to build a major new business for us and one that's -- we're coming from a very small place into a very large market, a great growth opportunity for Intel that we're executing on aggressively.

Your next question coming from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. So the Q1 capex was about $4.6 billion, suggests a very big ramp in the back half to get to your $27 billion net capex target. We are hearing of a lot of constraints on equipment supply. I was hoping, Pat or David, if you could give us some color on the availability of tools and if there are any implications on your full-year sales outlook because of the availability of tools?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes, I'll start with that one, and then Dave, you can add. Overall, capex is lumpy as we go through the year. And as such, we think overall that we'll still be on track to the overall capex target that we laid out. We are working very aggressively with the equipment companies.
And we have deep, strong, long-term relationships there. And clearly, some of the '23 and '24 equipment goals are ones that we're working on aggressively right now, but we do feel comfortable that we have the supply chain lined up to meet our equipment objectives and really importantly, to meet the factory ramp cycles that we've laid out for the marketplace as we're opening up the new factories like we just announced. Our Oregon fab coming online. We have the next -- we're starting to take equipment now into our Ireland.
We'll soon be doing that for our Israel fab ramp, we'll be groundbreaking on Ohio later this year. We'll be talking more about the German fab. So one by one, we're just executing on an aggressive build-out of our capital network and really quite pleased with the relationship that we have with the equipment companies to make that possible. That said, there definitely is some pressure on the equipment supply chain.
We're also working closely with the equipment vendors. Many of them use Intel FPGAs. So we're working closely to make sure that we prioritize that piece of the demand to support them in that requirement. Dave, anything else you'd add?
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. I would just add that we did expect this quarter to be a bit lower than the quarterly average for the year to get to the $27 billion. So it's not a complete surprise, although it was lumpy, as you said, and did come in a little bit lighter. But we feel good.
I would say the other thing is that when you look at it, I think we feel confident about the $28 billion growth capex, the $27 billion net capex obviously assumes a $1 billion of capital offsets. And I'd say the early read and of course, we're still early in the year, but looks quite good. So there's a potential we could actually do a bit better on the offset side, so that the net capex could potentially be a little bit.

Your next question coming from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is open.
Matt Ramsay -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the DCAI segment. The revenue, I guess, went from $5 billion to $6 billion from last year, and you have operating margin down, I guess, seven points.
And I guess it's no surprise after some of the disclosures that we had last year. But maybe you could tease that apart a little bit mix between enterprise and cloud, were there big changes there? And I guess the real question, Pat, is what gets that margin moving in the right direction? Is it the move to Sapphire, where you have multi-die products that might yield better? Is it revenue growth? I'm just trying to understand the drivers to turn around the operating margin in that segment as we go forward.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes. And I'll start on that one. Overall, the DCAI performed a little bit better than we expected for Q1. So I'd say overall, this is what we expected.
The biggest factor on margins was the ramp of the 10-nanometer product line and the costs associated with that. So that was the biggest factor associated with it. As we're looking at that, there also was, I'll say, relative strength in the cloud piece of that business, the hyperscalers and the enterprise piece of the business was a little bit more constrained by match set. So we did see a little bit of that effect in Q1.
As we go through the rest of the year, we do see good outlooks on both the hyperscaler as well as on the enterprise and government side. We're working aggressively to solve the match set problems. So we are hopeful that we'll be able to do a bit better in that area if we are able to address some of the shortages that we've seen in areas like Ethernet. Obviously, as we go into the second half of the year, the product line gets stronger.
As we see Sapphire Rapids ramp, we'll be launching products like Sapphire Rapids, HBM and the HPC segment will be ramping Ice Lake more aggressively with higher volumes as we go into the second half of the year. So all of those start moving the product line in the right direction and margins commensurately with it. We also have gotten great response for the longer-term view of our segment and road map. And as we've laid out, we'll have both the efficient cores as well as the performance course which better satisfy the market requirements.
And I believe that will be a factor of better pricing as better -- as well as better margins over time because you're not trying to stretch one product across really two distinct segments of the marketplace and really having highly optimized products for both the hyperscaler as well as the broader enterprise requirements. So overall, we think that the strategy that we've laid out, we've gotten great response from our customers for, and as I already indicated, we're executing as we set Sapphire Rapids' first PRQ this quarter, many more as we go through the rest of the year, and we'll be ramping that aggressively and seeing a good response from the customers. And I'd also say, particularly with Sapphire Rapids, every hyperscaler, every OEM has many SKUs lined up for this. This product will be extremely well respected, accepted and broadly deployed in the marketplace this year.
Dave, anything else you would add?
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
I would just add, we set out a goal in the Investor Day for the company to have gross margins of 54% to 58% and call it, roughly 30% operating margins. And I think when we start to see the fruits of the investments we're making, both in terms of process technology that's weighing down on the COGS and the investments we're making in operating expense to build out the product portfolio and get to leadership, those things will start to show strong scale on the top line side. And so I would bet this business is accretive to our overall corporate average.

Next question.
Operator
Your next question coming from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks. I had two. I guess the first question is, TSMC is kind of pushing out the timing of the high-volume 3-nanometer EUV.
And I guess the first question is sort of how that impacts your GPU and your CPU road map? And then I had a follow-up where really, Dave, I wanted to ask you on how you're going to account for subsidies? Are you going to account for those kind of in a contra account, so that as the depreciation ramps, you could offset some of that with that contrary account coming from subsidies?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes. And on the first part of it, clearly, the implications of foundry timing is something we have to work very carefully. And there is not just a question of the timing of a node, it's also the capacity of nodes. And with some of those changes that have been reported in the industry, we're just working through that with our product teams to make sure that we're aligning well to the availability of the foundry technologies.
But I would say that our IDM model just gives us fundamentally an advantaged business model here, where given the majority of our volumes are internal, we are able to balance between what we use externally for wafers and what we use internally for wafers. And thus, we're able to do a much better job satisfying our customers and having a more competitive product line. I'd also again add, Tim, that our execution of our five nodes in four years on or ahead of schedule across it. This just reinforces the competitiveness that we've described where we do see ourselves coming back to a position of unquestioned process technology leadership, and we're building out the manufacturing capacity at scale to deliver that to our customers.
So IDM 2.0, well leveraging the foundries, but even more importantly, building leadership technologies with that scale manufacturing to deliver the most robust product line in the industry. So Dave?
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes, sure. So it somewhat depends on the -- which capital offset you're talking about, the grant are usually aligned with a certain set of assets. And so they are contra and they get depreciated over the same life cycle of the asset. Things like Gilt we talked about is a bit more of a financing arrangement.
So it doesn't necessarily have an impact on the P&L, but it will be shown on the capital statement as a capital offset, like a partner contribution that will reduce our cash flow burn we have. Prepays are handled more or less like they show up as an asset on the balance sheet. And as you ship products, you reduce that account. So it's somewhat dependent on which one we're talking about.
But the one I think that you're talking about is the government incentives and yes, you're right there, they're contra accounts. They're on the contra account.
Operator
Your next question coming from the line of Tristan Gerra with Baird. Your line is open.
Tristan Gerra -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst
Hey. Good afternoon. How should we look at your discrete GPU platform in terms of expanding that beyond just consumer? And if you could talk about the software ecosystem that you might be building around to encourage adoption?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Thank you. And the answer is yes, we're going to be delivering the GPU products first for mobile, as we said, next for desktop. It will be game-centric as we're bringing them out of the marketplace.
But we're also going to have a full lineup and we see actually some very unique advantages as we think about media, some of the professional developers where we're already demonstrating radically advantage that positions like on some of the advanced graphics and media artist product lines. So these will be areas of strength, particularly when we bring our Arctic Sound product into the marketplace later this year, this will be well optimized for GPU environments and particularly will be strong in areas like encoding and media processing as well that if you think about cloud, you can certainly think about AI and training workloads, but many clouds are actually spending far more time on transcoding and media operations. So that will be an area of unique strength of our Arctic Sound product line. So and -- so if you think about that taken together, we'll be competing in the integrated graphics, the discrete graphics, the GPU business, the high-performance computing business will really be leveraging that technology across the entire space of the market.
And that's part of the reason that we're very encouraged by our ability to ramp this into a very significant business for Intel and one where we have a lot of advantages to build upon.
Tony Balow -- Head of Investor Relations

And our last question coming from the line of Srini Pajjuri with SMBC. Your line is open.
Srini Pajjuri -- SMBC Nikko Securities -- Analyst
Thank you, and thank you for sneaking me in. And, Pat, I want to go back to the Sapphire Rapids ramp. Can you talk about how the ecosystem is coming together given that this is a new platform, especially in DDR5 and PCIe 5.0, etc.? My question -- the real question is I just want to understand what your expectation for the ramp is versus the previous generations? Do you think this is going to be faster ramp versus Ice Lake? Or this is going to be a slower ramp? And also, when do you expect we'll see a public cloud instance based on Sapphire Rapids?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Great question, Srini. And clearly, one of the things that Intel as the market leader, the volume leader, it is this ability to ramp key new technologies. And with the Sapphire platform comes DDR5.
And if we were talking 90 days ago, we were fighting through some challenges on DDR5 with memory suppliers and really working on debunking those interfaces. We now feel very confident that multiple suppliers are now qualified. We're seeing good momentum from the memory partners in this area, they're ramping up their supply chains for the Sapphire platform, right? It's really that one that brings a major new memory technology into the marketplace and really reinforces Intel as the leader in data center and server market. Overall, we're modeling very carefully your exact question about looking at this versus the Ice Lake ramp.
And our objective is to ramp this platform meaningfully faster than we did the Ice Lake platform. We're doing a lot of work for the software stack, the validation of that making sure that we've really worked through all of the early sitings that customers would have driving down the defect rates in the platform that our customers can ramp this at volume. And as I already indicated, we're seeing a tremendous amount of SKUs and instance types across all of the OEMs as well as all of the hyperscalers in the marketplace, and we're looking forward to those being broadly available in the second half of the year. As we -- and I think then maybe just wrapping up the call today, we're grateful for all of you joining us the opportunity to update you on the business.
It's great that we start the year with a beat. We are looking at the momentum of the execution machine of Intel seeing solid progress, so five nodes in four years, Alder Lake, Sapphire Rapids, Arc launch, increasing momentum with our customers. We remain true to this building out of a geographically balanced and more resilient supply chain. And there's just lots of good things in flight that gives us confidence, not only in Q2 but to reaffirm our guidance for the year.
And our leadership team, we're fired up, and we believe that this is the greatest turnaround story in history, and it's my honor as the CEO of this great company to be able to be part of this leadership team. So thank you all for joining us today.

Presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So in this series we look at the largest insider buys by the ''top brass'' over the trailing six month period, one of which was a total of $247.9K by Patrick P. Gelsinger, CEO at Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC).

2022-04-27 00:00:00+00:00,The Aggressive Investor Is Buying AMD Stock Ahead of Earnings,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-aggressive-investor-is-buying-amd-stock-ahead-of-earnings,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) announces its first quarter 2022 earnings on May 3 after the markets close. Raymond James analyst Chris Caso expects them to be outstanding. He upgraded AMD stock earlier this week to “Strong Buy” from “Outperform.”
According to Koyfin, AMD stock has the 10th worst performance year-to-date (YTD) of the Nasdaq 100. If you’re an aggressive investor, Caso’s upgrade, combined with the fact AMD is down 43% YTD, suggests buying its stock before it reports next week is worth the risk.
From where I sit, the upside at this point is a lot greater than the downside.
AMD Stock Target Price
As Caso stated in a note to clients on April 25, AMD currently has a “highly attractive valuation” given the company’s opportunities to gain market share from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). He gives it a target price of $160, almost double where it currently trades. Investing.com reported Caso wrote in his note to clients:
As we have become more concerned about cycle risks given potential for slowing consumer demand and elevated inventory levels at customers, we favor those semi companies with strong secular drivers, more muted cyclical exposure and attractive valuations, for which AMD appears well positioned…
We have strong confidence regarding AMD’s position and share gains in the datacenter market.
Lastly, the analyst believes that market share at this point in the cycle is much more important than actual market growth.
It’s Time for AMD to Reverse the Trend
This time last year, I wrote that AMD stock had underperformed its peers for more than a year, suggesting that it could be ready to take flight. And it did. At the time, AMD’s share price was $81. By November, AMD had risen to a 52-week high of $164.46.
7 Dividend Stocks Paying Over 5% to Buy Now
Unfortunately, its flight higher didn’t last. Today, as I write this, it’s at $85, down 48% in five months. Over the past six months, it’s down 29%, 665 basis points more than archrival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Of the two stocks, I will always opt for Nvidia because of its free cash flow (FCF) generation, but there’s no question AMD is cheap right now at 6.4x sales, well below its price-to-sales (P/S) multiple over the past two years.
I think the analyst is right on the money to upgrade AMD stock before earnings. If you’re an aggressive investor, buying now ought to pay off in the near and long term.

2022-04-27 00:00:00+00:00,Can Higher Data Center Revenues Aid Intel (INTC) Q1 Earnings?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-higher-data-center-revenues-aid-intel-intc-q1-earnings,,,"Intel Corporation INTC is scheduled to report first-quarter 2022 results after the closing bell on Apr 28. In the first quarter, the company is likely to have recorded higher revenues from the Data Center Group (DCG) segment due to improving market conditions and new product launches.
Factors at Play
The DCG segment includes servers, workstations and other products for cloud, enterprise and communication infrastructure market.

In the to-be-reported quarter, Intel witnessed significant traction from the launch of the 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors (Ice Lake), the only x86 data center processors with built-in AI acceleration. The proliferation of cloud architecture, which forms the core of the data infrastructure, is leading to the democratization of high-performance computing. The company is witnessing healthy demand in areas like precision medicine and numerical weather prediction, while rapid adoption of 5G is enabling increased bandwidth, fueling the continued transformation of the network to an intelligent edge. All these initiatives are likely to have translated into higher revenues for the segment.
Moreover, with a gradual recovery in post-pandemic market conditions, the segment is likely to have recorded higher platform volume driven by the recovery in the enterprise and government sectors. Adjacent revenues are also likely to have witnessed healthy growth due to the inclusion of the Intel Optane memory business and improvement in Ethernet demand. Such initiatives are likely to get reflected in the upcoming results.
Overall Expectations
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the DCG segment is pegged at $6,851 million, indicating an improvement from $5,564 million reported in the year-ago quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of the company stands at $18,320 million, indicating a decline from $19,673 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at 80 cents per share. It had reported $1.39 in the year-earlier quarter.

2022-04-27 00:00:00+00:00,Will Soft Processor Revenues Dent Intel (INTC) Q1 Earnings?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-soft-processor-revenues-dent-intel-intc-q1-earnings,,,"Intel Corporation INTC is scheduled to report first-quarter 2022 results after the closing bell on Apr 28. In the first quarter, the company is likely to have recorded lower revenues from the Client Computing Group (“CCG”) segment due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and cheaper alternatives available from rival firms.
Factors at Play
CCG is the company’s largest segment and accounts for the lion’s share of total revenues. It includes computer CPUs, several server boards and form factor systems and graphic products.

In the to-be-reported quarter, Intel introduced the vPro platform with 12th Gen Intel Core processors for business productivity. The latest platform provides the highest performance and most comprehensive security for businesses of all sizes. Intel vPro delivers a wide array of computing solutions, which cater to nearly every type of worker at any business.

During the quarter, Intel announced the completion of the first phase of the sale of its NAND and SSD Business to Seoul-based SK Hynix. The first transaction includes the sale of its SSD business and the transfer of certain NAND and SSD-related intellectual property, employees and the Dalian NAND memory manufacturing facility in China. Intel’s sale of its manufacturing facility in China is in accordance with its long-term strategic goals. The company is gradually reducing its dependence on the PC-centric business by transitioning into data-centric businesses such as AI and autonomous driving. The divestitures are likely to have contracted the revenue base on a year-over-year basis.

Moreover, continued ramp down from the exit of 5G smartphone modem and Home Gateway Platform businesses is likely to have resulted in lower revenues for the segment. In addition, the prolonged Ukraine-Russia war has hampered the company's operations, and it has exited the Russian market owing to U.S. sanctions. This is likely to have led to top-line contraction and increased pricing pressure. It might limit margin expansion in the near term.
Overall Expectations
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the CCG segment is pegged at $9,335 million, indicating a significant decline from $10,605 million reported in the year-ago quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of the company stands at $18,320 million, indicating a decline from $19,673 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at 80 cents per share. It had reported $1.39 in the year-earlier quarter.

Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Intel for the first quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.

2022-04-27 00:00:00+00:00,Intel: What to Expect from Q1 Earnings,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel%3A-what-to-expect-from-q1-earnings,,,"Intel (INTC), a semiconductor chip maker, will report earnings for the first quarter of 2021 on April 28.
With a market valuation of $189.4 billion, Intel has lost about 10% of its value year-to-date. Intel used to be the market leader in chips, but that is no longer the case. Increasing competition in the chip space has put Intel under great pressure.
In terms of earnings results, Intel outperformed Wall Street consensus projections on both sales and earnings per share in the fourth quarter. Revenues of $19.5 billion were higher than the average projection of $18.32 billion. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share of $1.09 came in above analysts' expectations of $0.90 per share.
Q1 Expectations
According to experts, Intel is projected to announce adjusted earnings of $0.79 per share in the first quarter. This represents a year-over-year decrease of 43%.
Meanwhile, Intel projects adjusted revenue of $18.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $0.80 per share for the first quarter.
Wall Street’s Take
Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna expects Intel to report results in line with expectations for the first quarter.
According to the analyst, Intel's continued Alder Lake (Alder Lake is Intel's codename for the 12th generation of Intel Core CPUs) ramp is believed to have helped the company gain moderate market share in the first quarter.
However, the analyst believes that the business may face difficulties in the medium term due to “a weakening PC demand backdrop and potential margin headwinds.”
As a result, Rolland maintained a Neutral rating on the stock and a price target of $52 per share. This implies 14% upside potential from current levels.
On TipRanks, Intel stock commands a Hold consensus rating based on seven Buys, 13 Holds, and seven Sells. As for price targets, the average INTC price target of $52.77 implies almost 16% upside potential from the current levels.
Bottom Line
Given the fierce competition in the chip industry, Intel's short-term prospects do not appear to be very promising. On the other hand, it is positioning itself for the long haul by aggressively investing in its business. The company is increasing its fabrication capacity and making the foundries available to third parties. During the Q1 conference call, investors will be interested to hear about Intel's product selection and other expansion plans.

2022-04-27 00:00:00+00:00,3 Earnings I'm Watching Closely This Week,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-earnings-im-watching-closely-this-week,,,"This week is a big earnings week for the tech industry, and today's video focuses on three companies reporting this week and what investors should watch. The three companies are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: FB), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Each company brings different insights into the trends in the consumer market. Here are some highlights.
Meta Platforms is expected to release earnings on Wednesday, April 27, after the market closes. During its lastearnings call Meta saw a negative impact on its advertising revenue due to numerous factors. One of those factors was Apple's iOS changes, and investors should listen closely to see if any improvements have been made to Meta's advertising solutions. Another subject to watch is the expenses being used by Meta's Reality Labs segment as the company continues to push into the virtual reality market.
Amazon is expected to release earnings on Thursday, April 28, after the market closes. Amazon is an exciting company with a high-revenue but low-margin e-commerce business and a low-revenue but high-margin cloud computing business. Investors should make sure not to be blinded by revenue numbers alone. Since the e-commerce business is over 70% of total revenue, it can skew revenue results. Instead, investors should take a closer look at margins and the growth of its cloud computing business.
Intel is also expected to release earnings on Thursday, April 28, after the market closes. We have seen numerous semiconductor companies report earnings, but this is the first one that depends heavily on the consumer market. Intel has announced a strong roadmap and new products for this year alone. Investors would want to ensure that the schedule has not shifted due to supply chain issues.

2022-04-26 00:00:00+00:00,Samsung Elec to join renewables pledge as S.Korea shifts gears on green energy,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/samsung-elec-to-join-renewables-pledge-as-s.korea-shifts-gears-on-green-energy,,,"By Byungwook Kim
April 27 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics 005930.KS plans to join as soon as next month a group of global corporations committed to 100% renewable energy, a person familiar with the matter said, as partners such as Apple Inc AAPL.O push it for action against climate change.
Samsung, the world's biggest chipmaker, is late to the green power pledge: It's been two years since hometown rival SK Hynix 000660.KS joined the RE100 initiative, which sets a 2050 target for 100% renewable electricity, while global peers including Apple, TSMC 2330.TW and Intel INTC.O are already among its 350 members.
The timing of the cautious company's announcement, expected as early as the May 10 inauguration of South Korea's new president, will bring it on board just as the country's energy policy is set for a grand U-turn: away from the prior administration's aggressive push into renewables, and towards a pro-nuclear stance.
""It will be a group-wide announcement that also includes affiliates such as Samsung Display,"" said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
""The entire group will announce its climate goals including RE100 around when the new administration kicks off,"" the source said, asking not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The source added that Samsung had discussed with President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol's transition committee the regulations and hurdles that discourage the use of renewable energy.
Samsung declined to comment, while the CDP, an environmental non-profit organisation that brings together companies seeking to join RE100, said only that an announcement was expected this year.
""Samsung Electronics told us that it has notified its foreign investors that it would join and announce RE100 within this year,"" Kim Tae-han, a senior researcher at the CDP Korean committee, told Reuters.
Yoon has also tapped Han Hwa-jin, a climate specialist and outside director at Samsung, to serve as his government's environment minister.
The timing of Samsung's RE100 announcement could depend in part on the appointment of Han's replacement on the board.
""Samsung needs the legitimacy of all outside directors being present and approving the announcement,"" said Lee Jong-oh, director at Korea Sustainability Investing Forum.
RISK OF INACTION
Samsung has long acknowledged the risk of inaction on climate change, estimating based on 2020 revenue that up to 25.8 trillion won ($20.6 billion), or 20%, of its business-to-business sales such as chips could be lost if it does not switch to renewable energy.
""Our customers are demanding to produce products using 100% renewable energy to achieve their goals. There is an evident risk that our sales may be affected if these demands are not met,"" Samsung said in a statement posted on CDP's website in 2021.
It's not just B2B customers like Apple, which buys its chips, or consumers who buy its Galaxy smartphones who are concerned about Samsung's action on climate.
BlackRock, the fourth-largest institutional investor in Samsung according to Eikon data, said in a voting bulletin at its annual shareholders' meeting last month that investors had only limited access to information on Samsung's green strategies. It also criticised the board for a lack of urgency on climate issues.
Samsung Electronics has already been running its chip factories in China and the United States 100% with renewable electricity since 2019, but they accounted for just 10.7% of its total global energy consumption in 2020.
Its chip factories in South Korea accounted for 63.5% of its total global electricity use in 2020, and most of its $51.6 billion in profit last year, but ran almost entirely on non-renewable power.
It is building its third chip factory in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, and three more are planned for the city. Once completed, they are projected to consume 21.6 TWh per year, exceeding the entire electricity consumption of Busan, South Korea's second-largest city with 3.3 million people, according to an opposition lawmaker. Samsung did not dispute the figure.
This raises the stakes for Samsung's profitability in South Korea's energy policy.
While environmental groups have argued that an aggressive shift to renewables is necessary to promote economies of scale, Sonn Yang-hoon, an economics professor at Incheon National University, said Yoon's more cautious, pro-nuclear approach would help to stabilise electricity prices and let Samsung sustain profitability while moving towards renewables.
""Nuclear power will buy time until renewable energy gets cheaper with technological breakthroughs,"" Sonn said. ""Samsung will bide its time until renewable energy prices drop before it carries out RE100 at full throttle.""
The Korea Energy Economics Institute estimates the price of solar and wind power will fall as much as 55% and 44%, respectively, by 2030 from 2020.
Yoon, who won the March 9 presidential election by the smallest margin in South Korea's democratic history, aims for an energy mix of 20-25% renewables and 30-35% nuclear by 2030, compared with his predecessor's target of 70% from renewables and only 6% from nuclear by 2050.
Nuclear power accounted for 29% and renewable energy 6.6% in 2020, Electric Power Statistics Information System data showed.

Presumably the only reason for a company insider to choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. Within the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, only seven companies have experienced such buying over the trailing six month period, one of which was Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC), where an investment totaling $247.9K was made by CEO Patrick P.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-04-25 00:00:00+00:00,PREVIEW-Graphic chip price drop raises questions on whether end of shortage is in sight,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/preview-graphic-chip-price-drop-raises-questions-on-whether-end-of-shortage-is-in-sight,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee, Chavi Mehta and Noel Randewich
April 25 (Reuters) - A sharp drop in graphic chip prices could presage an unexpectedly quick ending to a global chip crunch that has crippled manufacturing from smartphones to cars, and the issue will be a central one for companies reporting results this week.
As Intel INTC.O, Qualcomm QCOM.O and others report, investors will weigh how dampened consumer spending from inflation, China’s COVID lockdown and Russia's invasion of Ukraine balance out supply chain blockages for microchips.
The trigger is a drop in prices of GPUs, or graphics processing units, which are the brains of gaming machines and are spreading to other uses.
Analysts at Baird recently downgraded GPU maker Nvidia NVDA.O to “neutral” after prices dropped. So far this year, Nvidia stock is down roughly 31% and rival Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O has fallen about 37% compared with a roughly 22% drop on the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index .SOX. Both companies declined to comment.
GPU prices are still being sold at a premium, but a smaller one. Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland earlier this month said that the markup over manufacturer suggested retail price or MSRP has fallen to 41% from 77%.
Graphics chips and hardware news site 3DCenter, which tracks graphic chip prices in Europe, reported that the price of AMD’s Radeon RX6000 and Nvidia's GeForce RTX30, both used for gaming, dropped steadily to less than 20% above MSRP from 80% at the start of the year.
Still, recent Reuters checks found that Nvidia’s GeForce graphics cards remained largely out of stock at retailers like BestBuy BBY.N and Newegg Commerce NEGG.O.
Baird senior analyst Tristan Gerra told Reuters that if electronic companies that buy chips expect prices to drop further, they will cut fat inventories, further cutting purchases -- and pressuring prices.
“It's a vicious cycle.” Gerra said.
Demand for GPUs may also drop because crypto currency Ethereum is expected to change the way it operates late this summer, reducing the demand for graphics chips that power systems used to mine the cryptocurrency today, analysts say.
There is a debate over whether the lower prices will spread throughout the chip sector.
Softening demand from PC and smartphone markets is also resulting in price drops of other chips such as leading edge processors like CPUs and some memory chips, according to Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan, who expects the supply of some other chips made on older machines to face over-capacity in the second half of this year.
But Bank of America said the weakness in the gaming or crypto currency mining segments could be balanced by strength in data center demand for graphic chips and has reaffirmed its “buy” rating for Nvidia.
Meanwhile major chip manufacturers, including Intel and TSMC 2330.TW, plan multibillion-dollar expansions.
“Between all the fab investments and then all the bullishness that the shortage wasn't going to end until 2023, 2024, we said we could see a glut coming,” that extends beyond graphics chips, said TechInsights’ Dan Hutcheson, who has been following chip supply and demand for over 40 years.

2022-04-25 00:00:00+00:00,Will Top-Line Contraction Hurt Intel (INTC) Q1 Earnings?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-top-line-contraction-hurt-intel-intc-q1-earnings,,,"Intel Corporation INTC is scheduled to report first-quarter 2022 results after the closing bell on Apr 28. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19 cents. In the first quarter, the company is likely to have recorded lower revenues year over year due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and divestment of businesses.
Factors at Play
During the quarter, Intel collaborated with Hepsiburada to launch an e-commerce platform for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Turkey. Dubbed DigitalSME, the program is likely to accelerate the digital transformation of local SMEs and drive the region's overall economic growth. Intel is betting big on the IoT business and is investing heavily to gain a higher market presence. While the focus was earlier on making the best computing chips and generating industry-leading margins from them, the company now prefers to focus on a product range targeting different market segments. Management believes that though the higher-end business in more developed economies continues to look up, the strategy should help it get into many more device categories, where Intel products will enjoy a premium based on performance and cost of ownership. Such initiatives are likely to get reflected in the upcoming results.

In the to-be-reported quarter, Intel introduced the vPro platform with 12th Gen Intel Core processors for business productivity. The latest platform provides the highest performance and most comprehensive security for businesses of all sizes. Intel vPro delivers a wide array of computing solutions, which cater to nearly every type of worker at any business.

During the quarter, Intel announced that the first phase of the sale of its NAND and SSD Business to Seoul-based SK Hynix has been completed. The first transaction includes the sale of its SSD business and transfer of certain NAND and SSD-related intellectual property, employees and the Dalian NAND memory manufacturing facility in China. Intel’s sale of its manufacturing facility in China is in accordance with its long-term strategic goals. The company is gradually reducing its dependence on the PC-centric business by transitioning into data-centric businesses such as AI and autonomous driving. The divestitures are likely to have contracted the revenue base on a year-over-year basis.

In addition, the prolonged Ukraine-Russia war has hampered the company's operations, and it has exited the Russian market owing to U.S. sanctions. This is likely to have led to top-line contraction and increased pricing pressure. It might limit margin expansion in the near term.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of the company stands at $18,320 million, indicating a decline from $19,673 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at 80 cents per share. It had reported $1.39 in the year-earlier quarter.
Key Developments in Q1
In the first quarter, Intel announced a deal to acquire Granulate Cloud Solutions Ltd for an undisclosed amount. Granulate’s approach to real-time optimization software complements Intel’s capabilities by helping customers achieve greater performance. Intel plans to rapidly scale Granulate’s optimization software across its data center portfolio. The acquisition will help cloud and data center customers enhance compute workload performance and reduce infrastructure and cloud costs.

Intel is witnessing intensifying competition in the server, storage and networking markets. Moreover, delay in 7 nm process-based chips is a major concern. The company detected a defect mode in the 7 nm process, which caused yield degradation. Notably, Intel’s chips utilize process technologies that are designed in-house. INTL anticipates the release of data center GPU design, Ponte Vecchio, sometime this year. The chipmaker now expects initial production shipments of the first Intel-based 7 nm client CPU in late 2022 or early 2023. Moreover, initial production shipments of Intel’s first in house-based 7-nm data center CPU design are scheduled in the first half of 2023.

To illustrate how sharp of a decline that is, consider that Nike and Home Depot have lost, on average, roughly 1.5% of their value per week. That's like starting the year with $100 and every three or four days someone takes a dollar from you. Ouch.
Though they face some serious short-term headwinds, there are reasons to believe that now could be a great time to buy the dip on these two blue-chip stocks.

An iconic brand at the top of its game
Nike is one of the most powerful and recognizable brands in the world. But in hindsight, it's clear that its valuation got ahead of itself. Nike's stock price peaked at $179.10 per share -- giving it a market cap of $281 billion at the high on Nov. 5, 2021. At that point in time, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 47 and its price-to-sales ratio was 6.2 -- significantly higher than its 10-year median P/E ratio of 28.8 and its 10-year median P/S ratio of 3.1.
Even after falling 28% from its all-time high, Nike still has a $200 billion market cap. And it's not a cheaply valued business either; its P/E and P/S ratios are still above those 10-year median levels, and higher than those of many of its peers.
NKE PE Ratio data by YCharts
However, segment-leading companies arguably deserve higher valuation multiples. When thinking about a business like Nike, it's important to separate the stock from the company. As a stock, Nike is still expensive, but less expensive than it used to be. But as a company, there's no denying that Nike is at the top of its game. It still sponsors many of the world's elite athletes, has never had a stronger brand image, is growing at a decent pace, and is more profitable than ever before.
Nike achieved record-high revenue and net income in 2021. But its real standout metric was its operating margin of 15.6% -- its highest level since 1993, back when Nike was a much smaller company.
NKE Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts
It remains to be seen if Nike can retain its high margins and continue to grow its top and bottom lines in an inflationary environment. But the long-term thesis for owning Nike stock remains stronger than ever.
A cooler housing market could negatively impact Home Depot
Like Nike, Home Depot is the gold standard in its industry. The stock has been a long-term outperformer -- it's still up more than 500% over the past decade, even after its recent sell-off. Home Depot's performance surged during the more intense stages of the COVID-19 pandemic as a white-hot housing market was paired with a rise in people undertaking do-it-yourself home improvement projects.
However, there's reason to believe that the housing market is about to cool off. And that's one of the reasons why investors are spooked about Home Depot stock right now.
Case-Shiller Home Price Index: National data by YCharts
The Case-Shiller National Home Price Index is basically the S&P 500 for the housing market. Every month, it updates its calculations by tracking the average single-family home price based on the prior three months of data. And that index is at an all-time high. Consider also the average sale price of existing homes in the U.S., which is $370,700 -- right near its peak. And the average sale price for newly constructed homes is at an all-time high of $511,000. The most concerning element of this chart isn't the all-time-high data. It's that the 2008 housing crisis looks like a blip on the chart. Put another way, the roaring housing market bubble that burst and led to a -38.5% return in the S&P 500 in 2008 -- the worst return since 1974 -- now looks like a hill leading up to the summit of towering 2022 housing prices.
To make matters even worse, the average interest rate on a 30-year mortgage is now 4.7%, which is a three-year high. It's not that a 4.7% 30-year mortgage interest rate is that high relative to historical levels. It's that mortgage rates are no longer bargain bin levels and housing prices are still extremely high.
30 Year Mortgage Rate data by YCharts
The housing market has been strong for years and accelerated when mortgage interest rates collapsed during the height of the pandemic. But now that home prices and mortgage interest rates are high, we could begin to see supply outpace demand, which would lead to falling home prices.
Either way, it's hard to argue that the near-term outlook for housing is good. And that negative outlook is certainly dampening investors' optimism for Home Depot. It would not be surprising to see the stock fall further. And in many ways, it makes sense that the stock is down 25% year to date. However, it's equally hard to picture a world where Home Depot stock isn't a lot higher 10 or 20 years from now than it is today. It's also worth mentioning that the company has a P/E ratio of 20, so at least investors can buy its stock at a relatively inexpensive valuation.

During times of heightened volatility, it's smart to rely on companies with strong fundamentals and track records of persevering through past sell-offs. Nike and Home Depot certainly fit that description. True, both are consumer discretionary companies, and therefore exposed to the impacts of broader economic cycles. Volatility is simply par for the course when it comes to buying and holding either stock. In the meantime, at current share prices, Nike has a dividend yield of 0.9% and Home Depot has a dividend yield of 2.5%, which will provide investors with a stream of passive income while they wait for the economic environment -- and these two companies' share prices -- to improve.

A well-rounded oil and gas giant
Chevron has a reputation for having the best balance sheet of the integrated oil majors, especially over the last five years or so as its capital expenditures have dramatically decreased.
CVX Financial Debt to Equity (Quarterly) data by YCharts
Chevron has lower financial-debt-to-equity and debt-to-capital ratios than ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, and TotalEnergies -- which is a sign that its capital structure is less dependent on debt than those of its peers.
The Chevron of today is a lean oil major focused on achieving a low cost of production so it can generate positive free cash flow even when oil is in the low $40s per barrel. That strategy was put to the test in 2020 when West Texas Intermediate crude oil averaged $39.17 per barrel for the year. Sure enough, Chevron lost billions. But it suffered less than its peers.
CVX Net Income (Annual) data by YCharts
A strong performer during good times and bad
Chevron stock is a few percentage points off its all-time high as oil and gas prices show no signs of going down anytime soon. Russia is one of the largest oil-and-gas-exporting nations in the world along with Saudi Arabia and the United States. But the war in Ukraine has led many European countries and the U.S. to either flat-out ban Russian energy imports or begin swiftly working toward solutions to wean themselves off Russian imports -- such as by constructing liquefied natural gas import terminals in Europe.
If oil and gas prices stay high, Chevron will continue to have outsize profits. But even if prices fall, Chevron has a wide margin of error where it can still do incredibly well. This efficient portfolio is one of the reasons Chevron is a Dividend Aristocrat and can support its growing dividend and stock repurchases. (A Dividend Aristocrat is an S&P 500 component that has paid and raised its dividend for at least 25 consecutive years.)
Chevron's upside potential and 3.4% dividend yield give it a one-two punch for long-term investors who like a financially strong company and are also interested in generating passive income.

2022-04-23 00:00:00+00:00,3 Things About AMD That Smart Investors Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-things-about-amd-that-smart-investors-know,,,"Most investors likely know three main things about Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD):
It's the second-largest producer of x86 CPUs after Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
It's the second-largest supplier of discrete GPUs after Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).
It was nearly rendered obsolete by both larger rivals before its current CEO, Lisa Su, brought it back from the brink of bankruptcy.
Su's revival of AMD, which started in 2014, sparked the stock's gain of nearly 2,000% over the past eight years. Intel's stock price rose less than 80% during that same period. That turnaround story has been well documented, but smart investors will likely also want to be aware of these three additional facts about AMD.
Image source: AMD.
1. It's a ""fabless"" chipmaker
AMD was once an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) like Intel. IDMs design and manufacture their own chips at their own first-party foundries. However, maintaining first-party foundries and upgrading their systems to produce smaller and denser chips is a very capital-intensive process.
To eliminate those costs and streamline its operations, AMD spun off its foundry business as GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: GFS) in 2009. It then became a ""fabless"" chipmaker that outsourced its production to third-party foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) and Samsung instead.
AMD also initially outsourced its chips to GlobalFoundries, but it stopped relying on its former foundry division after it halted its development of 7nm chips in 2018. AMD subsequently relied on TSMC to manufacture its most advanced CPUs.
Meanwhile, Intel stuck with its IDM model even as it fell behind TSMC in the ""process race"" to create more advanced chips. As a result, AMD's partnership with TSMC enabled it to produce smaller, denser, and more power-efficient CPUs than Intel over the past several years.
2. Intel is finally waking up
Intel's failure to keep up with TSMC, its ongoing production delays, and abrupt leadership changes all resulted in a massive loss of market share to AMD over the past six years.
Between the third quarters of 2016 and 2021, Intel's share of the x86 CPU market plunged from 82.5% to 60.2%, according to PassMark Software. AMD's share jumped from 17.5% to 39.7%.
But over the past four quarters, Intel seems to have woken up again under Pat Gelsinger, who took over the CEO position last February. Instead of following AMD's example and becoming a fabless chipmaker, Gelsinger had Intel double down on upgrading its first-party foundries to catch up to TSMC.
Intel also released new chips to counter AMD's Ryzen CPUs for PCs and Epyc CPUs for servers. Intel's latest chips still aren't as power-efficient as AMD's, but they're helping it tread water as it upgrades its foundries.
That tighter discipline has enabled Intel to regain some lost ground against AMD. Between the third quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2022, Intel's market share rose 6.2 percentage points to 66.4%. AMD's market share dropped 6.3 percentage points to 33.4%.
AMD previously benefited from Intel's big blunders, but that heyday could end soon as Gelsinger overhauls Intel's entire business.
3. Don't overlook its gaming console business
Investors often consider AMD's CPU and Radeon GPU businesses to be its core growth engines. However, the company also provides custom APUs -- which merge together a CPU and GPU on a single chip die -- for Sony's PS5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X consoles. AMD also previously supplied its APUs for the PS4 and Xbox One.
When Lisa Su took over, AMD relied heavily on steady sales of these APUs to generate fresh cash as it overhauled its CPU and GPU businesses. These chipsets also give it a competitive advantage against Intel, which doesn't power any major consoles with its chips, and Nvidia, which only powers the Nintendo Switch with its Tegra chips.
If AMD starts to struggle against Intel and Nvidia again, it can still fall back on its APU business as it develops new CPUs and GPUs. Its gaming APUs brought in a large portion of the Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (EESC) revenue, which generated 43% of its revenue last year.
Is AMD's stock worth buying now?
AMD's stock price tumbled nearly 40% this year as investors fretted over inflation, rising interest rates, and slowing PC sales in a post-lockdown market. But after that steep sell-off, its stock now looks historically cheap at 23 times forward earnings.
AMD's stock might remain volatile for the foreseeable future, but its future still looks bright. Investors who believe Su will continue to keep Intel and Nvidia on their toes should consider picking up a few shares of this growing chipmaker before the market warms up to the semiconductor sector again.

2022-04-22 00:00:00+00:00,See Which Of The Latest 13F Filers Holds Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/see-which-of-the-latest-13f-filers-holds-intel-0,,,"At Holdings Channel, we have reviewed the latest batch of the 35 most recent 13F filings for the 03/31/2022 reporting period, and noticed that Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) was held by 24 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.
Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.
Having given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in INTC positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:

In terms of shares owned, we count 12 of the above funds having increased existing INTC positions from 12/31/2021 to 03/31/2022, with 10 having decreased their positions and 1 new position.
Looking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the INTC share count in the aggregate among all of the funds which held INTC at the 03/31/2022 reporting period (out of the 762 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of INTC shares those same funds held back at the 12/31/2021 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for INTC. We found that between these two periods, funds increased their holdings by 110,700 shares in the aggregate, from 32,289,385 up to 32,400,085 for a share count increase of approximately 0.34%. The overall top three funds holding INTC on 03/31/2022 were:

2022-04-21 00:00:00+00:00,3 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks You Can Buy and Forget,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-high-yielding-dividend-stocks-you-can-buy-and-forget,,,"A safe and high-yielding dividend stock can make for a great investment to hang on to for years. It can not only boost your overall returns, but can also give you some money to spend, which can help you resist the urge to sell an investment just to free up some cash.
The S&P 500's dividend yield is less than 1.4% today. Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK), Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE: RY), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) all pay more than double that amount. In addition to their high payouts, their underlying business are also sound and incredibly profitable.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Merck
Merck's dividend yield of 3.2% is well above average, and can generate some meaningful income for dividend investors. And with a payout ratio that's at roughly 50% of net income, investors don't need to worry about the safety of this dividend. Plus, it has a top-selling drug in Keytruda, which helps patients fight cancer; in 2021 the drug generated $17.2 billion in sales for the company, up 20% from the previous year.
While the bears will try to dwell on an eventual loss in exclusivity for the drug, that won't come until 2028. This gives the company plenty of time to diversify its portfolio. And Merck has already begun doing that through an $11.5 billion acquisition of Acceleron Pharma, which focuses on rare diseases.
There's no crystal ball to tell investors how Merck will do 10 years from now. But with a strong business model that enables it to generate net margins of 27% and a modest payout ratio that's about half of its income, this is not a dividend stock I would worry about right now. The company's general stability is likely a key reason investors have been flocking to it this year as they look for safety amid soaring inflation. Year-to-date, shares of Merck are up 13%, while the S&P 500 has fallen by 8%.
2. Royal Bank of Canada
Bank stocks are normally safe havens for dividend investors, and ones that pay high yields can be especially attractive given that stability. Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) currently yields 3.5%, which makes it one of the higher-paying bank stocks out there; Wells Fargo & Company pays 2% while JPMorgan Chase is higher but still modest at 3.2%. That's even with Royal Bank's payout ratio at just 42%, well within its historical range of 40% to 50%, potentially suggesting that there's room there for some rate hikes in the near future.
RBC is Canada's largest bank and undoubtedly one of the safest investments in the country. It's also the most highly valued company on the Toronto Stock Exchange with a market cap of more than $155 billion. The bank has steadily grown its revenue over the years from CA$37 billion in fiscal 2017 (its year ends in October) to more than CA$45.6 billion in fiscal 2021. Its consistently high profit margins of around 25% or better also ensure that you aren't going to be taking much risk by investing in this top dividend stock.
3. Intel
Rounding out this list of safe income stocks is Intel. At a yield of 3.1%, its payout holds its own with some of the better dividend stocks on the markets today. And like the two stocks listed above, it also generates strong margins. In the past fours years, the lowest that the tech company's profit margin has been was 25% of revenue.
Its payout ratio of 28% is the lowest on this list, which give the company plenty of room to both pay a dividend and also pursue an aggressive growth strategy and expand its capacity to make computer chips. Earlier this year, Intel announced a $5.4 billion acquisition of Tower Semiconductor, funded entirely through cash, in another great sign that the business is self-sufficient and doesn't need to rely on large stock offerings to grow its operations.
Given the chip shortage in the world, the investments that Intel is making now to expand its capacity could pay off years from now (for both dividend and growth investors), and that's why it could make for an incredibly promising stock to hold for the long haul.

2022-04-21 00:00:00+00:00,3 Green Flags For ASML's Future,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-green-flags-for-asmls-future,,,"ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) posted its first-quarter earnings report on April 20. The Dutch semiconductor equipment maker's revenue fell 19% year over year to 3.53 billion euros ($3.83 billion), but it still beat analysts' estimates by 20 million euros. Its net income fell 48% to 695 million euros ($753 million), or 1.73 euros ($1.87) per share, but it also cleared expectations by 0.05 euros.
ASML faced a very difficult comparison to the prior-year quarter, when its revenue and EPS grew 79% and 244%, respectively, against the pandemic's initial impact in early 2020. But if we smooth out those messy year-over-year comparisons, ASML's future still looks bright. Let's discuss the three bright green flags that could bring back the bulls this year.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. The bearish concerns about ASML were overblown
The bears expected ASML to struggle with three main challenges in the first quarter. First, a fire at its Berlin factory in early January disrupted its production of older deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems and damaged a module that was used in its newer extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems.
Second, the Russian-Ukrainian war disrupted the global supply of neon gas, which was used in the gas-phase lasers of its DUV systems. Lastly, higher-than-expected 3nm yields at its top customer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC, suggested it might buy fewer EUV systems from ASML to hit its near-term production targets.
But despite all those challenges, ASML's revenue growth in the first quarter still hit the high end of its own guidance. It also expects its revenue to grow 27%-32% year over year in the second quarter, and it maintained its prior guidance for ""around 20%"" revenue growth for the full year. That's a bit higher than analysts' expectations for 19% growth.
That stable top-line forecast indicates the bearish concerns were overblown. Investors should also recall that ASML expects its annual revenue to hit 24 billion to 30 billion euros ($32.6 billion) in revenue by 2025, which implies its revenue will continue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 6.6% and 12.7% for the next four years.
2. Stable gross margins
ASML's gross margins rose from 44.9% in 2017 to 52.7% in 2021. That consistent expansion was driven by its unmatched pricing power.
ASML is the world's only manufacturer of EUV systems, which cost about $150 million each and require multiple planes to ship. EUV systems are used to etch circuit patterns onto wafers for the world's smallest and densest chips, and the world's top chip foundries -- TSMC, Samsung, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) -- are all lined up to obtain more EUV systems.
ASML's gross margin fell 520 basis points year-over-year to 49% in the first quarter of 2022. That decline was mainly caused by supply chain constraints and ""fast shipments"" -- which temporarily forego certain final tests in the installation process -- as its top foundry customers race to buy more systems to address the ongoing chip shortage. Those priority shipments have temporarily disrupted and delayed some of its other shipments.
However, ASML expects that pressure to ease in the second half of the year. It expects its gross margin to rise sequentially to 49%-50% in the second quarter of 2022, and potentially rise to about 53% for the full year.
It also maintained its long-term goal of achieving a gross margin of 54%-56% by 2025, which it set alongside its revenue targets last September. Analysts expect its earnings per share to grow by 13%.
3. A reasonable valuation and a clear roadmap
Based on analysts' expectations, ASML's stock trades at 35 times forward earnings and 10 times this year's sales. Those valuations aren't cheap, but they're reasonable for a semiconductor equipment maker that has monopolized a key piece of technology in the chipmaking supply chain.
ASML still has plenty of irons in the fire. Its current-gen EUV systems will help chipmakers produce chips down to the 3nm node, but its next-gen ""high-NA"" systems will help them manufacture even smaller and denser chips.
Over the next few years, ASML expects its higher-margin EUV systems -- which accounted for 36% of its bookings in the first quarter -- to drive most of its earnings growth. That transition will generate even more cash for the development of newer machines to succeed its high-NA EUV systems.
I'm still optimistic about ASML's future
ASML might seem like a cyclical stock, but it's still firing on all cylinders. Its dominance of the high-end photolithography system market makes it a linchpin of the semiconductor sector, and the world's insatiable appetite for new chips should drive this stock even higher over the next few years.

2022-04-21 00:00:00+00:00,7 Dividend-Paying Undervalued Stocks With Large Buyback Programs to Buy Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-dividend-paying-undervalued-stocks-with-large-buyback-programs-to-buy-now,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) — Oil giant launched a new $1o billion large buyback program along with a 4.0% dividend yield
The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) — The insurer announced a new $5 billion buyback program as the stock offers a 2.35% yield
HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) — The computer maker has a decent 2.31% yield as well as a hefty, consistent buyback program
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) — This semiconductor maker has a 3.0% dividend yield as well as a steady buyback program
Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) — This financial services firm has a 1.52% dividend yield with a significant repurchase program
Marathon Oil and Gas Corporation (NYSE:MRO) — With its $3 billion buyback program and its 1% dividend yield, the stock is a “buy”
Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) — The 1.6% yield and huge buyback program make the stock very attractive
These seven undervalued stocks are worth buying since they are dedicated to returning capital to shareholders through large buyback programs. This is through both dividend payments that are generous and share repurchases. The repurchases reduce shares outstanding, which has three immediate effects.
To begin with, it increases the remaining shareholders’ stake in the company. This allows them to gain a bigger portion of any shareholder capital returns, including spin-offs, dividends and rights offerings.
As well, a stock repurchase ultimately allows the company to make a higher dividend per share payment in the future for the same cost as before.
And, the smaller number of shares outstanding automatically increases earnings per share. Another major effect of share repurchases is that the stock price tends to rise as the company soaks up demand from selling shareholders.
7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy for a Robust Retirement
Let’s dive in and look at these undervalued stocks.
XOM Exxon Mobil Corporation $87.96
ALL The Allstate Corporation $143.26
HPQ HP Inc. $39.38
INTC Intel Corporation $48.11
AMP Ameriprise Financial $300.84
MRO Marathon Oil and Gas Corporation $27.65
ORCL Oracle Corporation $89.20
Undervalued Stocks: Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Market Capitalization: $370.5 billion
Exxon pays $3.52 per share in dividends, giving the XOM stock a dividend yield of 4.0% at yesterday’s closing price of $87.96. Morningstar indicates that the average yield over the last 12 months was 3.95%.
Moreover, the company has decided to initiate a new $10 billion share buyback program, on top of its generous dividend payments. This is also on top of Exxon’s paying down large amounts of its debt.
This is a direct result of the company’s free cash flow (FCF). Last year it generated almost $47.3 billion in cash flow from operations, including asset sales. After deducting $16.595 billion in capital expenditures (capex), its free cash flow was $30.5 billion.
Given its market cap of $370.5 billion, that works out to an FCF yield of 8.2%. That is double the payout of the 4.0% dividend yield to shareholders. As well, the $10 billion share buyback program is worth about 2.70% of its market valuation. This makes the total yield to shareholders worth 6.70% of the company’s market value.
The Allstate Corporation (ALL)
Source: Jirsak / Shutterstock.com
Market Cap: $39.5 billion
Allstate, the large property and casualty insurance company based in Chicago, pays an annual dividend of $3.40 per share, which works out to an annual yield of 2.40%. In the last 12 months, the average yield was 2.35%, and 1.96% over the last five years, according to Morningstar. This implies that if ALL stock were to rise to reach the average yield in the past five years, it would reach $173.47 (i.e., $4.30/0.019). This is 22.1% higher than the present price today of $142.00 per share.
Last year the company spent $3.3 billion in share repurchases, which works out to about 8.35% of its $39.5 billion in market value. So, combined with its 2.40% dividend yield, investors stand to make a total yield of over 10% in shareholder returns. This is the amount of capital the company is returning to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.
7 Cheap Stocks to Buy Before the Next Breakout
For example, in the company’s fourth-quarter slide presentation, it said that it had reduced common shares outstanding by 7.8% over the last 12 months. If Allstate keeps that up this year, the total yield for shareholders will be 10.2% (i.e., 2.4% dividend yield plus 7.8% buyback yield).
Undervalued Stocks: HP Inc. (HPQ)
Source: Tomasz Wozniak / Shutterstock.com
Market Cap: $41.5 billion
HP, the imaging and printing products company, now pays an annual dividend of $1.00 per share, giving HPQ stock a 2.54% dividend yield. This is actually higher than the average 2.31% yield in the last 12 months, according to Morningstar.
Not only that, the company has been consistently raising its dividend per share every four quarters and investors can expect this to continue, given the company’s ample free cash flow (FCF).
On Feb. 28, HP announced that for the quarter ending Jan. 31, it produced cash provided by operating activities of $1.7 billion and FCF of $1.4 billion. This funded the company’s dividend payments, share buybacks and debt repayments.
For example, based on HP’s slide deck, it spent $271 million on dividends, $1.5 billion on share repurchases, as well as $3.7 billion in net debt repayments. The share repurchase activity works out to 3.68% of its $40.8 billion market valuation.
As a result, the buyback yield plus the 2.31% dividend yield works out to about a 6.0% total yield to shareholders. That provides a very good potential ROI for most investors in HPQ stock. No wonder Warren Buffett, who likes companies with dividends and buyback programs, recently took a large 11.4% stake in the company.
Intel Corporation (INTC)
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com
Market Cap: $196 billion
Based on Intel’s annual $1.46 dividend per share, INTC stock has a 3.05% dividend yield at today’s price of $48.11. This is about even with its average 3.02% yield over the last 12 months, according to Morningstar. However, over the last five years, INTC stock has had an average yield of 2.48%. This implies that the price could rise to $58.87 per share or 22.8% higher (i.e., $1.46/0.248), if it were to rise to the historical average yield.
On top of this, Intel has a large share buyback program. Last year the company produced $11.3 billion in FCF and used $2.4 billion of this to repurchase 39.5 million shares of stock. Given its $196 billion market value, this works out to a buyback yield of 1.22%. And, it brings the total yield to shareholders over 4.0%, including the 3.0% dividend yield.
7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy for a Robust Retirement
That’s a decent return for most investors, especially since it is much higher than they can earn leaving money in the bank. That is especially the case if the INTC rises 22% more to reach its average historical dividend yield.
Undervalued Stocks: Ameriprise Financial (AMP)
Source: Shutterstock
Market Cap: $32.9 billion
Ameriprise, a financial products and wealth management company pays out an annual dividend of $4.52 per share. At yesterday’s closing price just pennies above$300, this gives AMP stock a dividend yield of 1.52%, about even with its average of 1.56% over the last 12 months. However, it’s lower than the 2.28% average yield over the last 5 years.
Moreover, the company is very profitable and it can fund a large share buyback program. With its year-end earnings announcement, the company said it would fund $3.0 billion in share repurchases through March 31, 2024. In Q4 2021, it bought back $499 million, which puts it on a $2 billion annual repurchase rate. This works out to 6.07% of its $32.9 billion market valuation.
This means that with the 1.52% dividend yield and the 6.07% buyback yield, the total yield to shareholders is about 7.6%. That is a very good return for most investors. In fact, Morningstar reported that the average total yield over the last 12 months was 7.88%.
Marathon Oil and Gas (MRO)
Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com
Market Cap: $19.2 billion
Marathon has been raising its quarterly dividends by a penny each quarter and now has an annual run rate payment of 28 cents per share. This gives it an annual yield of 1.05%. Given that the dividend is likely to keep rising each quarter due to higher oil and gas revenue, investors can expect to have a higher dividend yield.
Moreover, based on its huge and growing free cash flow (FCF), Marathon can afford its large $3 billion share buyback program. That works out to 15.6% of the company’s large $19.2 billion market valuation. So this is a very generous buyback program. That is especially so compared to other stocks in this list of undervalued stocks with dividends and buybacks.
7 Cheap Stocks to Buy Before the Next Breakout
For example, its FCF in Q4 was $898 million. That works out to an annualized rate of almost $3.6 billion. That is more than its buyback program of $3.1 billion and also the cost of its dividends of about $205 million.
This will likely help the stock move higher as investors realize that its large dividend and buyback program are both affordable and very generous for its shareholders.
Undervalued Stocks: Oracle Corp (ORCL)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Market Cap: $212.3 billion
Oracle pays an annual dividend of $1.28 per share, giving it a yield of 1.61%, based on a 32 cents per quarter payment. This has been the same payment for the past five quarters.
Typically, the company will raise its quarterly dividend after five quarters. This implies that the company might be getting ready to raise its quarterly dividend in its next reporting cycle. That will likely happen in mid-June 2022.
Last quarter the company spent $600 million in share repurchases of 7 million shares. That works out to an annual rate of $2.4 billion or about 1.1% of its market valuation. This is based on its fast-growing business, especially its cloud division, which represents about 26.7% of its total revenue as of Q4. Its free cash flow (FCF) last quarter was $6.59 billion, which is more than enough to fund the $600 million in share buybacks.
As a result, investors can expect the stock to reflect its healthy dividend and buyback programs over the long run.
