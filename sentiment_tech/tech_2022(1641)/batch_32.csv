The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Intel Corporation (INTC), and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
 
You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>
Broadcom shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the past year (+23.6 % vs. +13.8%) on the back of strength in networking and server storage segments. Networking is riding on strong adoption of Broadcom’s next-gen merchant switching and routing solutions by hyperscalers, enterprises and service providers. Aggressive adoption of its next-generation server storage solutions by hyperscalers is expected to drive top-line growth.
Broadcom expects fiscal third-quarter networking and server storage revenues to grow more than 25% and 60% on a year-over-year basis, respectively. An upbeat third-quarter fiscal 2022 guidance is encouraging. Recently announced VMware acquisition will aid prospects over the long term. However, increasing competition, along with high debt levels, are persistent overhangs.

Intel Corporation shares have declined -13.0% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry’s decline of -25.1%. The Zacks analyst believes that the Client Computing Group is expected to suffer due to component shortage. Production delays pertaining to 7 nm ramp up remain a concern. A strained Sino-U.S. trade relationship, imposition of fresh lockdown restrictions in some markets, forex woes and high debt burden remain other concerns.
However, despite short-term headwinds, the company expects demand to pick up in the second half of the year. The company is riding on prospects of the Internet of Things and Mobileye businesses. Mobileye growth should be driven by design wins amid recovering automotive industry. Recovery in the enterprise business of the data center segment is a positive. Intel is developing more integrated solutions that will likely be competitive on a cost per watt basis while offering customized solutions for bigger firms.

Union Pacific shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (+0.6 % vs. -4.4%). The company hiked dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP upped its quarterly dividend by a further 10%. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front. Management anticipates share repurchases in 2022 to be in line with the 2021 levels of $7.3 billion. %. The Zacks analyst believes that the company's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. Uptick in freight revenues (up 17% year over year in first-quarter 2022) as economic activities pick up the pace is an added positive.
However, escalation in fuel costs (up 74% in the March quarter) as oil prices move north induced a 16% rise in the operating expenses. High debt/EBITDA ratio and tepid automotive demand are further concerns. Increased capex may also be bothersome.

2022-06-02 00:00:00+00:00,INTC July 22nd Options Begin Trading,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intc-july-22nd-options-begin-trading,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options begin trading today, for the July 22nd expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new July 22nd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $44.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.74. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $44.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $42.26 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $44.30/share today.
Because the $44.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.95% return on the cash commitment, or 28.87% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $44.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.65. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $44.30/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $45.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.30% if the stock gets called away at the July 22nd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $45.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.72% boost of extra return to the investor, or 27.19% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $44.30) to be 31%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-06-02 00:00:00+00:00,Microsoft (MSFT) Releases Surface Laptop Go 2 Starting at $599,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsoft-msft-releases-surface-laptop-go-2-starting-at-%24599,,,"Microsoft MSFT recently launched Surface Laptop Go 2 in the United States, the first revision to its entry-level budget laptop. The latest addition is available on the Microsoft Store and Best Buy and it will start shipping from Jun 7, 2022.

The new Surface Laptop Go 2 ships with Windows 11, which Microsoft released last year. The initial model came with Windows 10 in S mode. The base model of Surface Laptop Go 2 comes with a 128GB solid-state drive, rather than 64GB like the last one.

The Surface Laptop Go 2 with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage is available at $599.99. Another model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage is available at $699.99. The top variant with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage will be available for $1099.99.
Microsoft Corporation Price and Consensus
Microsoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote
Improved Features in Surface Devices to Boost Competitive Position
The latest device is powered by Intel’s INTC 11th-gen Core i5 processor with up to 8GB RAM and 256GB storage that is further expandable. It sports a 12.4-inch PixelSense touch display with a 3:2 aspect ratio that offers a screen resolution of 1536×1024 pixels, along with an improved HD camera and dual Studio Mics.

Surface Laptop Go 2 provides 30% more key travel than MacBook Air and weighs 2.48 pounds.  Surface Laptop Go 2 is equipped with a lithium-ion battery that lasts for about 13.5 hours. The laptop comes with a USB Type C port and a regular USB port to connect external devices. Microsoft continues to use its standard Surface Connect port for charging this device.

We believe that the latest device, which is comparatively low-priced against Surface Book (starts at $1,499) and Surface Laptop (starts at $999) will attract more users that will eventually improve Microsoft’s top-line growth going forward.

However, intensifying competition from lower-priced products developed by Samsung, Huawei and Lenovo LNVGY and expensive ones from the likes of Apple AAPL will continue to impact market share, which is a major concern going forward.

Walmart is currently selling a Lenovo convertible laptop for $279 with $260 off the MSRP. The device has a Core i3 processor and 128GB of storage.

Apple is benefiting from the growing demand for the all-new Mac Studio, which is a high-performance desktop system with a reimagined compact design consuming up to 1,000 kilowatt-hours less energy than that of a high-end PC desktop over the course of 12 months. The newly released desktop helps clients render massive 3D environments and playback 18 streams of ProRes video with the M1 Ultra chip. It remains quiet even under the heaviest workloads.

Mac Studio features unified memory of up to 64 GB on M1 Max systems and up to 128 GB on M1 Ultra systems.

Microsoft is bringing new and improved Surface devices that could encourage enterprises to stick to Windows as they move toward bring-your-own-device (“BYOD”) and cloud computing. Microsoft’s advantages in this respect are two-fold.

First, the company has a very large installed base of Office users. Most legacy data are based on Office, so enterprises are usually reluctant to use other productivity solutions. Second, the BYOD model is dependent on security and cloud integration, both of which are Microsoft’s strengths. As a result, Microsoft has been largely successful in retaining enterprise customers.

In the recently concluded fiscal third-quarter 2022, Surface revenues were up 13% (up 18% at constant currency) year over year.

We also note that Microsoft has returned 10.8% over the past year against the S&P 500’s decline of 2.2%. We expect that the rejuvenation of the Surface product line along with an improving Office 365 subscriber base and strong growth prospect for Azure will help the stock maintain its upside in the rest of 2022.

At present, Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

A sharp selloff has wiped billions of dollars off of valuations in the past few weeks. Growth stocks have been unfairly targeted. Many of these companies offer excellent operating models and great growth potential.
Many people believe that the market has grown overly conservative and the only way to make money is to invest in value stocks. This belief has caused many growth stocks to take a hit even though they are doing well.
The 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy for June 2022
Here are seven growth stocks that make for a great addition to any portfolio:

Growth Stocks to Buy: Intel (INTC)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was founded in 1968. It has been around for over 50 years and it has been producing computing chips since 1971. The company invented the x86 microprocessor architecture, a standard for personal computers and servers. This makes Intel one of the most important chip companies in the world.
Over the years, the company has established itself as a proven performer. However, in recent years, it has lost space to companies, like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), that have taken advantage of its complacency. But the company is looking to make a comeback with its Alder Lake chips.
Intel is also one of the few blue-chip companies offering a substantial dividend, leading to a juicy yield of 3.28%. Few tech stocks can be considered dividend stocks in the true sense of the word. Therefore, INTC stock deserves credit there.
Oracle (ORCL)

Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) provides database software, hardware, and cloud services. Its databases are used by companies worldwide in various industries, such as finance, healthcare, retail and manufacturing.
These days, you will not find Oracle on many lists of growth stocks. That has to do with the company already having a substantial base of clients to whom they cater. Users and developers are comfortable with the company’s database solutions and they are reluctant to pick a competitor. It gives the company a sticky user base, something every tech stock desires.
7 Beaten-Down Growth Stocks That Look Like Big Bargains Right Now
However, I include this on my list of growth stocks because the company has a great and growing cloud business. Although it might not be making the type of money Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services is, it provides great diversification, which the company needs.
Growth Stocks to Buy: Salesforce (CRM)
Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com
Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a software company that offers cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) solutions. It’s a CRM solution available globally, provides support to over 150,000 customers and has more than 20,000 workers. This is one of the most popular solutions with this set of features.
Salesforce has been around since 1999 and has grown to become one of the most widely used CRM solutions in the world. It offers various features for its customers, such as sales pipeline management, customer service, marketing automation, and analytics. The company’s success is largely due to its functionalities and ease of use compared to other CRM platforms.
Salesforce has been building its platform for the past few years by adding tools to help with marketing, communications, and e-commerce. They have also been on the market for quite some time and have helped buyers find the perfect fit for their needs.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the most popular coffee shops in the world. In 1971, Jerry Baldwin and Gordon Bowker worked at a coffee roasting plant in Seattle when they met Zev Siegl. The three men had a dream to open up their store where they could sell high-quality roasted coffee beans and brewed coffee that they would make themselves. They wanted to create their own company, which would serve as a gathering place for people from all walks of life where they could enjoy good conversation over a cup of good coffee.
Starbucks is one of the most prominent brands globally and has a lot of influence on people’s lives. It is not just a coffee shop, but also an American icon that has been around for more than 50 years. The company started as a humble coffee bean roaster and grew into what it is today — a multinational corporation with “more than 32,000 stores in 80 countries.”
However, Starbucks is in trouble. Investors are concerned regarding a slowdown in China, high rates of inflation and employee dissatisfaction. In response, legendary Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz has taken the helm for the third time and faces a hefty to-do list.

The relative safety of dividend stocks makes them a compelling choice at any time. However, at times when many equities (and entire indexes) are posting negative growth, safe dividend stocks really shine. That’s because these stocks generate regular income that investors can reinvest. This boosts the total return of an investment.
Dividend stocks are usually stable companies with reliable earnings that they reinvest for the benefit of shareholders. In bullish times, this dividend can help to bring a stock’s total return on par with higher growth stocks. And in bearish times, this can help to mitigate losses.
One frequently referenced component of dividend stocks is the dividend yield. In general, a higher yield is better than a lower one. But there are other factors, such as the sector a company is in, that provide context for its yield. What many investors find more important is a company that has solid fundamentals that support the current dividend and offer an opportunity for the dividend to increase over time.
The 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy for June 2022
With that in mind here are seven safe dividend stocks with a high yield that can boost your total return.
DOW Dow Inc. $68.51
GILD Gilead Sciences, Inc. $64.01
CVX Chevron Corporation $180.48
INTC Intel Corporation $43.84
T AT&T Inc. $21.18
ET Energy Transfer LP $11.76
HDV iShares Core High Dividend ETF $108.81
Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy Now: Dow (DOW)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
The first of the safe dividend stocks to consider is Dow (NYSE:DOW). The stock price for the Michigan-based company is up 22% in 2022. And the stock has held those gains in May while the broader market is undergoing a correction. Plus, by many fundamental metrics including price-to-earnings (P/E), forward P/E and Price-to-Earnings for Growth (PEG), DOW stock looks undervalued.
In its first-quarter earnings report, the company reported 28% year-over-year revenue growth that was spread across all of its verticals. This was despite some concern that the company would be weakened by its exposure to Russia.
Currently, the company pays an annual dividend of $2.80 that calculates to a dividend yield of 4.13%. That’s more than twice the sector average. And if safety is your primary concern, it doesn’t get much safer than a company that has paid a dividend for 442 consecutive quarters.
Gilead Sciences (GILD)
Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com
In the last two years, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) has shown volatility that is inherent in the biopharmaceutical industry. For example, in the early days of the pandemic, GILD stock soared because its existing drug, remdesivir, was found to have some effectiveness in treating Covid-19. However, as vaccines became available, the stock was left behind.
In fact, the stock is down about 11% in 2022. And the consensus opinion of analysts is that GILD stock will essentially make up its lost gains and no more.
That’s where a reliable dividend comes in. And Gilead has an annual dividend of $2.92, meaning a dividend yield of 4.51%. Plus, the company has been increasing its dividend for each of the last seven years.

Plus, Gilead has a range of drugs including a robust pipeline that are used in treatment of ailments ranging from HIV, hepatitis and cancer. This means it will have many bites at the apple.
Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy Now: Chevron (CVX)
Source: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.com
If you’re looking at safe dividend stocks, the energy sector — particularly the oil and gas sector, is a good place to start. Stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) are cyclical in terms of their price movement. However, many of these companies have solid fundamentals that allow them to pay a dividend in any economic climate. So whether your concern is inflation or recession or both, Chevron looks like a solid choice.
CVX stock is up 52% in 2022. This is the outlier from the last five years in which the stock had not done that much prior to the beginning of the pandemic. And while the company’s growth is still expected to decline on a year-over-year basis for the next five years, it’s likely to remain at or above 2021 levels.
Plus, the company pays out a $5.68 annual dividend which calculates to a 3.19% dividend yield. The company has increased its dividend in each of its last 35 years.
Intel (INTC)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Semiconductor stocks were among the biggest winners during the pandemic. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) didn’t enjoy as robust of a gain as many of its competitors. That isn’t because of any fundamental weakness in the company. And as investors are finding out, that may be a benefit. The stock is “only” down 14% in 2022. That’s a bit better than some of the other stocks in the sector. And analysts give the stock a 16% upside from its current price.
7 Beaten-Down Growth Stocks That Look Like Big Bargains Right Now
From a fundamental standpoint, Intel looks to be a bit undervalued. Its earnings growth may be at lower levels than prior to the pandemic, but the growth should be more than sufficient to cover its dividend. And right now that dividend pays out $1.46 on an annual basis and yields 3.28%. The company has increased its dividend in each of the last eight years.
Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy Now: AT&T (T)
Source: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.com
Is the worst over for AT&T (NYSE:T)? It appears that it may be. The company’s stock was under pressure when it completed its spinoff of its WarnerMedia unit. Conventional wisdom was that many investors would flee from T stock after it cut its dividend in half. However, as of this writing, the stock still has a dividend yield above 5%.
This leaves investors free to start looking at the overall narrative for T stock. And with the stock up 12% in the last month, investors may like what they see. It starts with the company’s focus on 5G. Investors may also be encouraged by the amount of cash the WarnerMedia sale put on the company’s balance sheet. Money that can be applied to the debt on its balance sheet.
Energy Transfer (ET)
Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com
The next of the safe dividend stocks on this list is the one with the highest dividend yield. As of this writing, Energy Transfer (NYSE:ET) has a dividend yield of 6.87%. Some of this has to do with the fact that the company is a master limited partnership. As such, it is able to pass along most of its free cash flow as tax-deferred distributions to investors, often in the form of a dividend.
The 7 Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for Income
Energy Transfer already has a long history of developing infrastructure projects and plans to spend over $2 billion in 2002 to expand its network. Energy Transfer is an undervalued stock in the energy sector. However, with 73% year-over-year revenue growth, the stock is beginning to draw the attention of investors. In fact, ET stock is up 43% for the year. However, analysts believe there is still an approximate 31% upside for the stock.
Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy Now: iShares Core High Dividend ETF (HDV)

When it comes to safe dividend stocks, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that focuses on high-yield dividend stocks makes a lot of sense. Investors have many choices, but for the purposes of this article, one to consider is the iShares Core High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:HDV).
This fund focuses on developed markets in North America. At the time of this writing, the three sectors with the heaviest weighting in the fund are health care, energy, and consumer staples. So it’s no surprise that Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) were the top three holdings (by percentage) in the fund as of April 30, 2022.
The overall dividend yield for the fund is 3.28% and it features a very low net expense ratio of just 0.08%.

2022-05-26 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting INTC Put And Call Options For July 8th,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-intc-put-and-call-options-for-july-8th,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options begin trading today, for the July 8th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new July 8th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $43.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.70. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $43.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $41.30 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $43.27/share today.
Because the $43.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.95% return on the cash commitment, or 33.56% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $43.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $44.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.51. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $43.27/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $44.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.18% if the stock gets called away at the July 8th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $44.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $44.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.49% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.62% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the call contract example above is 32%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $43.27) to be 31%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

It is a fully integrated REIT that owns roughly 5% of Manhattan’s office real estate. It is the single biggest office landlord in the borough.

Its occupancy rate is at 93% and its management plans to shrink the 7% vacancy. Nevertheless, a 93% occupancy rate is a mind-boggling result, considering the Manhattan market’s occupancy rates fall in the 16% to 18% range. Moreover, management plans to increase its net operating income of $605.1 million by 18% until 2024. Perhaps a bigger sweetener is its eye-catching dividend yield of 5.98%.

AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is a biopharma giant primarily focuses on oncology and immunology. It is famous for its flagship rheumatoid arthritis medicine called Humira, which makes up roughly 50% of its profits. Total sales came in 22.7% higher at $56.2 billion last year. Moreover, sales of Humira jumped 4.3% year-over-year to $20.7 billion.
In the past, ABBV has been criticized for being a one-trick pony, generating over 60% of sales from Humira. However, that seems to be changing with management actively working toward diversification of its portfolio. That is perhaps why sales of other drugs, including Rinvoq and Skyrizi, have doubled in the past year. In addition to this, ABBV is a leading dividend stock in the sector, with nine years of consistent growth in dividend payouts and a yield of roughly 3.7%.

2022-05-26 00:00:00+00:00,AMD is Winning the Battle Against Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-is-winning-the-battle-against-intel,,,"Big global events are a part of the markets. The stock market has fallen, the currency rates are fluctuating, and inflation is rising. Dividend stocks are highly attractive because of their ability to produce significant returns over long periods. However, for those investors who can stomach a bit of risk, the tech sector looks like a gold mine. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is one to take advantage of among the bargains in established tech names. As a result of decades of hard work and dedication, AMD's ability to produce quality results has only increased.
AMD is a designer, manufacturer, and promoter of microprocessors that focuses on supplying clients with the latest technology.
Advanced Micro Devices is primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) in gaming consoles, personal computers, workstations, servers, and embedded systems. The company also produces central processing units (CPUs), programmable chipsets, discrete GPUs, and semi-custom designs.
AMD's most popular products are its Ryzen line of desktop processors and Radeon graphics cards. AMD is one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world.
In addition, the company has been competing with Intel (INTC) in the market for decades now. It has been gaining ground on Intel for several years now, and the latest quarter proved as much.
AMD made major IT headlines in the first quarter of 2022, as it took away significant market share from Intel. It is a major headache for Intel bulls because the company was finally generating some momentum versus AMD after several quarters of losses. However, the latest quarter confirms that AMD is still in the driver seat in this space.
AMD Versus Intel
The competition between Intel and AMD has been going on for decades. Despite being a larger company, it has fallen behind recently. The prediction is that Intel will continue to lead the semiconductor industry because of its competitive advantage over AMD. However, AMD is gaining ground fast, and for those investors looking towards the future, few companies look in better shape than AMD, looking forward.
Since Lisa Su took over as CEO of AMD in 2014, the company's stock has soared and returned 30-fold gains. Meanwhile, Intel has had an abysmal record. Under Su's leadership, AMD shifted its focus to high-performance computing and caught up to competitors like Nvidia.
AMD's computer segment was a fairly small contributor to its revenue in the past, but has been growing substantially in recent years. Its enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment makes up for this and are the driving force for AMD's growth. Its computing and graphics segment consists of its Ryzen CPUs & Radeon GPUs, which are important contributors to AMD. AMD's chips are also growing in demand as data centers expand. This will cause its returns to increase as well.
AMD saw tremendous growth in Q1, with a year-over-year revenue increase of 71%.
It includes over $5.9 billion and impressive market share increases across segments. Non-GAAP net income rose 148% over the year-ago period, due to a sharp decline in new expenses and higher revenue growth. This year, the company is forecasting aggregate revenue growth of over $26 billion.
Intel Is Becoming a Dividend Stock
Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company founded in 1968. It is the world's second-largest and most valuable semiconductor chip maker by revenue.
Intel has been a pioneer in developing microprocessors, including x86, Itanium, and Core processors. The company has also produced one of the world's first commercial microprocessors, the 4004.
Problems have been ongoing for a while now at Intel as it has lost its technological edge. Its leadership turmoil has also been quite deep. Though things are not so encouraging in an industry that keeps evolving by the day, Intel is not adapting very well to these changes. Due to several of these setbacks, the company has had to turn elsewhere and has started allocating its resources.
Intel's revenue for Q1 came in at $18.4 billion. While Intel is still the second-biggest chipmaker globally, its revenue has dropped 7% from last year. The company reported a non-GAAP income of $3.6 billion. This figure was down by 35% year-over-year compared to earnings a year ago, and the company's profits fell because of higher costs.
It's no surprise to see the stock price fall significantly over the last year. The revenue forecasts for Intel's 2022 fiscal year only predict ~1% growth. Since the rates will not change soon, there is no real hope of a turnaround on the horizon.
In such an environment, Intel mainly holds value as a dividend stock. Intel's shareholders have had continuous access to their dividends since it started making payments in 1992. Despite several economic crises and tough situations such as the brief pandemic-induced recession, the company has consistently met its expenses.
Wall Street's Take
AMD continues to hold all the cards in terms of Wall Street opinion. The stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys and nine Holds. The average AMD price target is $134.47, which implies 47.51% upside potential from early Thursday trading levels.
My Bottom Line on AMD Stock
AMD is currently the better buy by most investor standards. It is more expensive than Intel but is growing faster and will continue to do so.
AMD is a very successful business; it has been around for over 40 years and has grown to become one of the most influential companies in the tech industry.
The company does not only make processors but also graphics cards and other related products. It is currently ranked as the second-largest chipmaker in the world. The chip maker's underlying fundamentals are solid, and they show no signs of degrading. This company could be a good bet because it has dropped in value recently - keep an eye on it.

Nvidia (NVDA) reports earnings after the market closes on May 25.
The “whisper number” may be hard to beat, and the company may warn on future growth.
NVDA stock is now 20% cheaper than it was when it split shares 4:1 last year.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the graphics chip leader, has lost nearly one-third of its value since it last reported earnings in February.
It’s due to report again after the market closes May 25. Officially, expectations remain high. While the official earnings estimate is for net income of $1.20 per share, the “whisper number” analysts tell their best customers is for net income of $1.35 per share, or over $3.3 billion, on revenue of $8.12 billion.
The stock, however, continues to fall, down 45% so far in 2021. It’s now 20% below where it was when it split 4:1 last year. This has taken the market cap down to $400 billion, which is still more than twice rival Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) $170 billion.
Ticker Company Current Price
NVDA Nvidia $166.56
Pulling Back
Nvidia is already reacting to slower growth, slowing hiring and blaming rising inflation. But the expected revenue number is still 44% ahead of what it did for the same quarter last year.
Despite this, bullish analysts are reducing their price targets on the stock. Even if the company reports solid numbers, it could warn on weakness ahead.
Much of the blame goes to cryptocurrency mining. Crypto miners use a lot of Nvidia chips, and crypto has fallen hard this year. The price of a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is down from over $46,000 to under $30,000, even as mining costs rise as it approaches the theoretical limit of 21 million coins.
7 Retirement Stocks to Buy to Turbocharge Your Savings
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently fined Nvidia for failing to warn about the impact of crypto mining on its business. But Louis Navillier says investors should see that as a gift.
There’s more bearish news. The after-market price of Nvidia gaming cards is falling. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is now selling its cards at standard retail prices, without the usual mark-up. Shares of AMD, memory chip maker Micron Technologies (NASDAQ:MU) and communications chip maker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) are all down this week. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SOXX) is down 25% on the year.
Why are chip stocks being hit when there’s still a shortage? Inflation has analysts pricing in a recession, even in technology.
Victory Lap
Despite the stock troubles, Nvidia is taking a victory lap at the annual CompuTex trade show in Taiwan.
Its data center business continues to grow. Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) has already signed-on as a customer for its latest liquid cooled chips. The company says its latest data center chips use 30% less energy than earlier designs that relied on air cooling. These “superchips” are designed to transform data centers into “AI factories,” which Nvidia calls a $150 billion market opportunity.
Analysts haven’t given up on Nvidia either. There are 27 of them at Tipranks, with 22 telling investors to buy the stock. Their average price target would have their value nearly double over the next year.
Bottom Line on NVDA Stock
I have owned Nvidia shares for several years. After the stock split, I sold some, recouping my investment.
It may be time for me to buy more.
Nothing fights inflation better than technology, and Nvidia remains in the sweet spot. It continues to import supplies from Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) fabs, and with the Taiwan dollar now trading at 30 to the dollar, instead of 28, it benefits from foreign exchange. TSMC is now building a large fabrication plant in Arizona, that will produce chips with lines just 5 nm apart. Abundant renewable energy is said to make up for higher water costs.
Still rising costs, the fall of crypto and delays in getting artificial intelligence software into theglobal marketare all weighing on the stock. If Nvidia misses the number and goes lower, buy it.

2022-05-25 00:00:00+00:00,India puts 'new reality' on display with Davos street show,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/india-puts-new-reality-on-display-with-davos-street-show,,,"By Aditya Kalra
DAVOS, Switzerland, May 25 (Reuters) - Bright colours and bold logos proudly signal where India has set up base on the main street in Davos this year, as the country trumpets its pro-business and foreign investment drive.
Inside a pavilion on the Swiss Alpine resort's Promenade street beneath an ""India @ Davos 2022"" logo, the federal government served up treats including 'masala chai' tea, 'samosa' snacks and other spicy delicacies.
Clustered around it are six Indian states with their own lounges, housed in what are usually high street shops.
""It's an Indian street, it should be called 'Little India'. It shows the country is open for investments,"" said Samir Saran of India's Observer Research Foundation.
Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told Reuters that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had suggested bringing states together to showcase unity at the gathering of business and political leaders at the World Economic Forum.
""Investors love this kind of a messaging,"" Goyal said.
While India has long had a presence at the World Economic Forum, several officials and attendees from Asia's third-largest economy said it was not previously so prominent.
At the government's base, food was being prepared by a team of 15 chefs who were flown in from India, along with 450 kilograms of vegetables and local spices, head chef Guru Nathan told Reuters, as people enjoyed a fragrant morning buffet.
""We were asked to keep the spice moderate so that everyone can enjoy (the food),"" Nathan said.
Only a few steps down the road, Indian tech giants Infosys INFY.NS, Wipro WIPR.NS and HCL Technologies HCLT.NS have set up their bases close to those of Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google, Meta FB.O and Intel INTC.O.
One state government official put the number of Indian officials attending Davos at more than 100, with scores of company executives and a handful of startups also present. Goyal estimated overall there would be 200 Indian participants.
""We have record numbers from India,"" Sriram Gutta, head of India agenda at the WEF, said.
'NEW REALITY'
Federal ministers have talked about India's economic boom and the opportunities it offers at Davos.
Although Modi's government has often faced criticism from foreign companies for announcing policies which they say are protectionist in nature and favour domestic companies, India recently reported its highest ever foreign direct investment inflow, which hit $83.57 billion in 2021-22.
After engaging regularly with Indian states on subjects such as agriculture technology, drones and electric vehicles, the WEF has gradually increased the number of invitations to them, Gutta said, adding that they ""will continue to gain prominence"".
Even though they are run by different political parties, the states were seeking to project a united image and showcase their respective offerings for businesses, Deepak Bagla, CEO of federal investment promotion arm Invest India, told Reuters.
The southern state of Andhra Pradesh signed investment pacts worth a total of $16 billion for investment in renewables at Davos, while one official said Karnataka has held meetings with prospective investors.
""What this street really shows you is the new reality of India,"" Bagla said.

When times get tough, investors should seek opportunities in safe stocks to buy and hold through thick and thin.
Apple (AAPL) remains the king of stocks.
Amazon (AMZN) is backed by the all-time best startup story.
Campbell Soup (CPB) is a tank, even on most bad days.

If you follow the stock market, then you know the kind of volatility Wall Street is currently showing. Even the experts are finding it hard to make too many valid predictions. During such unstable times, investors should stick to what has worked for decades. This brings us to the idea of finding stocks to buy and hold forever. If the markets are wild, then we should to try and tame it.
The pandemic perhaps changed the short-term mindset of all traders. They have come to expect instant gratification. This is why we now have terms like a “V”-shaped recovery. The idea of buy-and-hold faded into the background — at least for now. I don’t think that we are ready to bury it, especially if we just modify it a bit.
Today’s list of stocks to buy includes nothing but “sure things.” The point is to eliminate all internal sources of variable of hiccups, leaving only extrinsic risks. This would make it nearly impossible to have a company flub cause pain to investors. I even omitted great stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) because of potential personality drama.
7 Large-Cap Stocks to Avoid Until the Market Crashes Again
I am usually very hesitant to use the word “safe” when presenting investment ideas. If there were stocks that are completely safe, they would not pay a reward. So, let this be a disclosure that we are merely discussing relative safety, which isn’t foolproof.
Ticker Company Current Price
AAPL Apple $143.11
AMZN Amazon $2,151.14
CPB Campbell Soup $46.16
INTC Intel $42
MSFT Microsoft $260.65
GOOGL Alphabet $2,072.08
JPM JPMorgan Chase $124.60
Apple (AAPL)
We cannot have a safe stocks to buy list and not include the king of stocks Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Arguably it is the best company on the planet, with special brand powers. Its clientele is amazingly loyal and price is almost never a problem. I am not a die hard fan, but I too agree it is a gem of an equity to own. Therefore, it must be part of this list of sure things.
However, I hesitate to own my entire position right away. This is only because of AAPL stock’s relative altitude to the summer 2020 levels. That’s when the markets really broke out with the tailwind from the stimulus. I expect that the bears will try to deflate more of it before it finds a true floor. I realize that it has already corrected 25% from its highs. But it is still 40% above the breakout neckline.
While this is not a reason to short it, it’s worth waiting it out a bit. Besides, there are other members of this list that have already shed this 2020 rally froth. Meanwhile, its financial metrics are beyond reproach. There isn’t a blemish on them, so don’t waste your time looking.
Amazon (AMZN)
The growth that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) accomplished in the last five years is astonishing. This is a one of a kind story that will likely never happen again. If there is one doubt about it being on the list of stocks to buy and hold is its new leader. Founder Jeff Bezos handed the reins over to a new team.
I am being paranoid, because it is likely that the Amazon machine will continue to excel regardless. The momentum it has is substantial, so it will take a lot of trepidation to die. The world is going through a rough patch coming out of the pandemic. The virus caused a human tragedy, but the policies that came out of it brought complete chaos.

Central banks are trying to slow this pendulum down, but my bet is that they will mess it up. They will overshoot and perhaps inflict near-term pain. If so, then AMZN stock nears $1,800 would be a bargain stock to buy for a long term.
Campbell Soup (CPB)
When people are sick, the old adage suggests eating soup. When the indices are on the fritz, often Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB) stock offers a safe haven. Meanwhile, when the bulls are in charge it too participates with the upside to a degree. Therefore, this makes it the perfect stock to own through the proverbial thick and thin.
In addition to the relative overall calmness, CPB stock also rewards its owners with some extra cash. The 3% dividend payout is a nice source for fixed income in this low rate environment. The company’s fundamentals are as boring as they get. Perhaps this is what makes it perfect for a list of safe stocks to buy and hold forever.
For the last seven years, the profit and loss statement barely budged. Despite that, according to Yahoo Finance, its value grew. CPB still maintains a current 15x price-to-earnings ratio, which is its lowest since 2015.
Intel (INTC)
The digital revolution has never been stronger, partly because the pandemic put it in high gear. So the world will need chips to power the tech that is taking over the world. The leader in that is currently Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), even though Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are hogging the headlines. Eventually, investors will know a good thing even if it’s too late.
So far, INTC managed to stay on top for decades, and it should continue to do so for a long while. As for timing, INTC stock is at the low end of the range since 2014. I bet that there are buyers lurking from these levels and into $40 per share. Even though it could go lower, it would then become a slam dunk BUY.
7 Blue-Chip Stocks With Dividends to Buy Before June
Intel’s top line metrics don’t stack up to AMD or NVDA, but they have impressive bottom line upside. Net income has now more than doubled since 2015, without inflating the valuation proposition. The current 12 month P/E ratio is about half of then.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is a staple on Wall Street. It rose to fame during the breakout of the digital revolution decades ago. If we include Apple in a list of stocks to buy, then we must also include MSFT. They were bitter rivals, even “frenemies” one could say.
Under the leadership of ex-CEO Steve Ballmer, the outlook was a bit murky. Satya Nadella steered that ship straight into the proper favorable tech currents. The company not only switched to a subscription service for the office suites, but it is also aiming to take a huge chunk of the cloud. Furthermore, with its recent acquisition of Activision (NASDAQ:ATVI), it can also become a gaming powerhouse.
Perhaps this would also be a gateway to the metaverse. Clearly, MSFT is doing its best to keep up with the times and stay relevant. There is no reason to doubt it now. I do caution a bit about its distance to the June 2020 breakout. At this altitude, it can easily lose another 15% before finding real support. But this is a good place to start a multiple entry point position for the long term.
Alphabet (GOOGL)
Safety often comes from size, and not many are larger than Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). It is also operationally in control of so many lives, including mine. The android operating system is the most ubiquitous smart phone globally, so it has more users than anyone else.
Social media changed the world, and I bet it is here to stay. For this I struggled with picking between GOOGL and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB). I chose Alphabet because of its command of android and YouTube. Also, more recently, it announced the resurgence of wearable products. The idea of augmented reality sounds lucrative in the mid term. The company has all the tools it needs to dominate it.
The 7 Best ETFs to Buy Now if You’re Looking for Safety
Alphabet already made this transition from desktop search monster to mobile. I bet it can make another leap to whatever comes next. The proof of Alphabet’s success is obvious in its financial reports. Alphabet grew sales 2.5 times in just five years. Meanwhile, its net income grew twice as fast in the same time. These impressive accomplishments should give investors confidence that GOOGL belongs on the list of stocks to buy and hold forever.
JPMorgan (JPM)
JPMorgan’s (NYSE:JPM) management has navigated the toughest of tests since the 2008 debacle. It has emerged stronger than ever and now has a fortress balance sheet. JPM stock has strong financial reports backing up its position on this list of stocks to buy. While revenue growth isn’t great, it has grown its net income significantly. JPMorgan has earned the trust of investors, so I have no reason to doubt that it can maintain its strength.
The caveat here is that now the Federal Reserve’s actions are likely to put a serious hurt on its metrics. The tightening measures the central bank strike at the heart of JPM’s business. Therefore, I expect potential calamities during their next few quarter reports. So investors would be wise to temper the enthusiasm short term and try to get in at a lower price.
JPM stock has already lost 23% of its value this year, but it could fall half as much more from here. Buying all in now would defeat the purpose of this list. Being part of a list of stocks to buy and hold doesn’t mean we do it blindly. There are levels that are easy marks for the bears to hit.

This year, multiple headwinds have ravaged stock markets, pushing even the most reliable stocks to multi-year lows. Nevertheless, it presents an interesting time to consolidate and focus on preserving capital by investing in the best blue-chip stocks to buy.
Blue-chip companies have had a long track record of proving themselves in good times and bad. These stocks belong to enterprises with a history of sound financial performance and shareholder rewards.
Unfortunately, these stocks have been trading at all-time lows with the current downturn. As these stocks are remarkably stable compared to smaller market cap equities, it would be tough to find many blue chips that trade at their lowest-ever prices.
7 Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Right Now
Nonetheless, I have curated a list of blue-chip investments trading at beaten-down valuations and their all-time low prices within touching distance within touching distance.
CCL Carnival $11.92
AMZN Amazon $2,008.98
MA Mastercard $339.28
GM General Motors $35.10
INTC Intel $41.61
BAC Bank of America $35.37
PATH Uipath $16.50
Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Carnival Corporation (CCL)
Source: Flickr
Cruise operator Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) has had a tough outing in the stock market,, as had the rest of the sector. CCL stock has shed over 45% of its value in the past year and currently trades near its lowest stock price of $11.92. However, with the pandemic fade and an all-important summer season approaching, things are looking upward for the company.
Its most recent quarterly update reported a disappointing net loss of $1.9 billion with revenues of $1.62 billion. Analysts expected revenues to be roughly 42% higher than the actual result. CCL told its investors that it was facing increasing uncertainty due to the invasion of Ukraine and the resultant effects on fuel prices.
However, oil prices have been dropping late amidst peace talks between Russia and Ukraine held in Turkey. Moreover, the company stated that its booking deposits are rising and expect its entire fleet to be in operation for the summer season.
Hence, Carnival could mount a comeback soon, kickstarting a bull-run.
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was in the news in the past couple of weeks for the steepest drop in its stock price since 2006. The massive price drop is a testament to how rough things have been in the equity market. Amazon is seeing a slowdown in growth rates due to tough comps, but does that mean it’s a sell?
It’s true that Amazon’s core business is in flux, and investors are wondering how much upside remains with its mammoth retail business. However, Amazon has had a penchant for proving its naysayers wrong, with incredible performances year-in and year-out.

Moreover, we see the amazing results it posted with its non-core segments, including Amazon Web Services, virtual healthcare solutions, Prime service, and others. Hence, wagering on the business during the current investing environment could be an excellent long-term move.
Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Mastercard (MA)
Source: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com
Payments processing giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) has been a steady performer over the past several years. Its fundamentals are firmly in the green, boasting double-digit growth across metrics that matter the most.
The past couple of years have been outliers for the business, with the surge in online buying. Nevertheless, MA stock isn’t shielded from the current challenging macro-environment, trading close to its lowest stock price.
There’s plenty to like about Mastercard. It operates a business with remarkably low overheads and no credit risk, which is why it boasts an average EBITDA margin of over 55% in the past five years. The company’s recent results weren’t too shabby either.
Its first-quarter results showed 24% growth in sales, with adjusted margins growing to 57.50% from 52.90% in the prior-year period. Hence, it’s an attractive opportunity to load up on Mastercard.
General Motors (GM)

A couple of months ago, General Motors (NYSE:GM) reported stellar final quarter results despite supply chain constraints. The automotive giant delivered record-adjusted earnings and operating profits for the full year.
Additionally, the management was upbeat about its 2022 prospects. Despite the positive outlook though, its stock has taken a massive hammering since the earnings release.
Semi-conductor shortage is likely to impact production this year, but it should only increase pent-up demand and support strong sales in the coming years. Moreover, the company is investing its profits aggressively in its EV lineup.

That should keep the automotive giant relevant as the sector transitions away from gas-powered cars. Additionally, it has also invested in robotaxi maker Cruise, which could potentially pay many dividends down the line for the business.
Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Intel (INTC)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a juggernaut in the server and client CPU markets holding over 75% market share in both sectors.
Over the past few years, it has ceded market share to its peers in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) but is likely to bounce back in the long run with the launch of its cutting-edge new chips. The company has an impressive product roadmap which includes the launch of new processors, including the Raptor and Meteor Lake lines.
Moreover, it’s also looking to take the CPU market by storm with Sapphire Rapids processors, based on a 7-nanometer process. This will pit it against AMD’s Epyc processors based on a 5-nm process.
Therefore, there’s much to like about the company’s long-term position, and it should recapture its market share within the next few years. It expects to post 10% to 12% revenue growth by 2026,  significantly above its 5-year average of 6.40%.
Bank of America (BAC)
Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is one of the largest banks in the United States, one of the more rewarding investments in its sector.
It has returned over 300% to shareholders and grown its dividends for the past eight years in the past decade. Its business transformation has been spectacular under CEO Brian Moynihan’s effective leadership. It went from an institution whose viability came into question to a much leaner business focusing on asset quality.
7 Undervalued Stocks to Buy Before Investors Catch On
With the rising interest rates, the company is poised to benefit immensely with a massive increase in net interest income. Its recent results have been tremendous, including its first-quarter results, where loan and deposit growth increased substantially. Therefore, it’s an excellent investment trading under three times forward sales.
Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy:  UiPath (PATH)
Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com
UiPath (NYSE:PATH) is an established workplace automation enterprise growing rapidly. It saw its revenues rise 39% year-over-year to $289.7 million, beating consensus estimates by $6.5 million during the fourth quarter.
Moreover, despite the drop in adjusted net income to $27.2 million, it still exceeded analyst expectations by a couple of cents. Additionally, its total customers have grown by 28% from the prior-year period in the fourth quarter to 10,100, with a revenue retention rate of over 140%.
Next year the company expects sales to be in the $1.075 billion to $1.085 billion range above the $1.09 billion consensus estimate. Moreover, average recurring revenues will surpass the $1 billion mark, falling in the $1.2 billion to $1.21 billion range.
Hence, the company has an incredible growth runway ahead while trading 80% below its 52-week highs.

2022-05-24 00:00:00+00:00,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Intel Corporation (INTC) is a Trending Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/here-is-what-to-know-beyond-why-intel-corporation-intc-is-a-trending-stock,,,"Intel (INTC) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -10.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.8% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Intel belongs, has lost 9.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.69 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -46.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -18.7%.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.53 points to a change of -35.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.6%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.69 indicates a change of +4.6% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +139.3%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Intel.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
In the case of Intel, the consensus sales estimate of $18.02 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -8.2%. The $75.55 billion and $78.72 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -3.2% and +4.2%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $18.35 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.7%. EPS of $0.87 for the same period compares with $1.39 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.18%. The EPS surprise was +8.75%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Palantir (PLTR): Growing revenue may become too much for reluctant investors to ignore.
Nio (NIO): When electric vehicle stocks become more attractive, Nio is likely to lead the way.
Wendy’s (WEN): The company may be raising prices, but it should have little effect on revenue.

If you see “Reddit stocks” and immediately think of meme stocks, I’d encourage you to think again. It’s true the Reddit community became part of the national conversation because of stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). However, its members invest in much more than meme stocks.
You may think the market is too risky right now. But there’s also a part of you that knows some terrific stocks are trading at bargain prices. To invest in the best Reddit stocks, you don’t have to have a lot of money. In fact, if you have just $100 and the time to wait on the market to turn around, there are some real bargains available.

Prior to SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) releasing its first-quarter earnings report, I wrote that it was swimming against the market current. That may still be true, but don’t tell that to the company’s CEO Anthony Noto, who recently purchased 39,000 shares of SOFI stock. That’s one reason why shares have climbed 28% since May 12.
The fintech company is not profitable and is not expected to turn a profit until 2024. However, it makes this list of the best Reddit stocks to buy because it continues to grow revenue and add customers. Plus, the company recently received its bank charter.
On the other hand, it will take several quarters to assess the impact of rising interest rates on student loans which will impact one of the company’s core audiences. Nevertheless, analysts are bullish about SOFI stock. The mean price target of 12 analysts is $11.21, which gives the stock a 53% upside.
Palantir (PLTR)

Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is trading below its direct listing price. This continues a bearish trend that started in September 2021. However, I recently posed the question: What more does the company have to do to please investors?
One critique of Palantir when it went public was its reliance on government contracts. However, when the company reported earnings in early May, it posed a 54% year-over-year (YOY) revenue increase with its commercial business and a 31% YOY increase in overall revenue.
The failure to grow earnings may be a contributing factor. And as Nicolas Chahine points out, investors may be scrutinizing its government business.
7 Dividend Stocks to Boost Your Retirement Savings
However, PLTR stock looks like a stock that warrants investor attention, particularly for starting a small position. There’s no dividend, but if the future revenue forecasts are accurate, it should meet analysts’ expectations for a mean price target of $11.28.
Nio (NIO)

The electric vehicle (EV) sector has gone from feast to famine. And that’s been all too true of Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock. The stock is down 70% from its 52-week high set in June 2021.
Right now, Nio (and all electric car manufacturers) are tangled up in the supply chain difficulties as well as facing rising supplier costs. As a Chinese company, Nio also is being engulfed by the Covid-induced lockdowns in its home country. It also faces a (perhaps overblown) delisting concern. All of these put a risk premium on NIO stock.
However, none of these issues will remain in place forever. Of course, that doesn’t mean they’ll be going away anytime soon. Nevertheless, at its current price and with new models scheduled to launch, NIO is one of the best Reddit stocks to buy. And if you’re still holding onto shares, this may not be the time to sell.
Wendy’s (WEN)

Fast-food restaurants thrive during times of economic uncertainty, and Wendy’s (NYSE:WEN) has been a picture of consistency since the onset of the pandemic. Even though the company recently announced it will likely be raising prices, that trend should continue.
One reason is that CEO Todd Penegor said inflation is hitting grocery stores harder than the company’s restaurants. That should allow the company’s products to remain a comparative value.
Many market analysts are advising their clients that a return to more “normal” growth is likely in order. That makes WEN stock even more attractive.
7 Undervalued Growth Stocks to Buy Now
It’s not going to blow the doors off for investors. But as long as it continues to increase revenue and pay a respectable dividend, WEN stock is a solid choice for investors — especially trading near its 52-week low.
Intel (INTC)

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) makes this list of the best Reddit stocks because of its valuation. Specifically, it’s one of the only stocks that is currently undervalued. Finding stocks that are trading at a true discount to their intrinsic value is key, and the fact that Intel pays a dividend as well may be an attractive selling point.
It also appears that the company’s $15.2 billion investment in research and development may begin to pay off. Intel recently launched its 12th-generation Alder Lake chips for laptop computers. This is an opportunity for the company to go on the offensive against some of its rivals.
Moreover, Intel Foundry Services, which was founded in 2021, is another avenue for growth. This is still in its early stages, but the company has already made significant investments in the United States and Europe to add capacity.
Verizon Communications (VZ)

One way for investors to approach an investment in this market is to look for defensive stocks that pay a nice dividend. That’s the bullish argument for investing in Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). The telecommunications giant continues to deliver reliable revenue and earnings.
And if a recent report by Grand View Research is accurate, the company should have no problem continuing on this path for the next five years or more. This growth is likely to come from the second generation of 5G, which is only now beginning to gain traction with consumers.
7 Oil Stocks to Buy With Safe Dividends
Verizon is a safe choice for investors. If the economy improves, the company will benefit as more people look to upgrade their mobile devices. On the other hand, if the economy does go into a recession, investors will be looking for reliable dividend stocks. That makes VZ stock the kind of win-win scenario that should be very appealing to investors.
Robinhood (HOOD)
Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com
The last of the best Reddit stocks to buy may be the most controversial. I understand Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) is a stock that investors love to hate. It doesn’t have a true moat. It has exposure to cryptocurrency markets, which are collapsing in lock step with equities. Plus, many retail investors may be bailing on their quixotic dreams of getting rich quick via the stock market.
But that only tells one side of the story. The reality is the company is giving many investors who previously may not have felt they had access to the market an opportunity to build wealth over time. There will always be risk in that. But a larger pie of investors benefits everyone in the end.
The company is also benefiting from a fresh infusion of cash from billionaire investor Sam Bankman-Fried. He sees “a lot of areas for the company to grow and innovate going forward.”

2022-05-23 00:00:00+00:00,4 Top Semiconductor Stocks To Watch In The Stock Market Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-top-semiconductor-stocks-to-watch-in-the-stock-market-today,,,"Are These The Best Semiconductor Stocks To Buy Right Now?
Much like most industries in the stock market, many semiconductor stocks have been in a correction from their pandemic-driven highs. Well, this has been going on for quite some time now. With that said, some investors may be wondering if the worst could be over soon. Notably, some of the biggest names, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Marvell Technologies will be reporting their earnings this week. Thus, it could be a good idea to keep a close watch on the industry. Mixed sentiments aside, there are still plenty of exciting developments within the semiconductor industry. 
For instance, GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: GFS) recently announced the launch of GF Labs. This is a new program that extends the development horizon of innovative semiconductor technology. Also, GF Labs will focus on long-term roadmap differentiation that will enable its customers to develop innovative products and accelerate their time-to-market. Meanwhile, a report by Bloomberg suggests that Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is in talks to acquire VMware Inc (NYSE: VMW). If true, the deal would catapult Broadcom into a specialized area of software. Overall, the industry is still moving on the right trajectory. So, here are some of the top semiconductor stocks to watch in the stock market today.
Semiconductor Stock To Watch Right Now
Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MRVL)
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD)
Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADI)
Marvell
Firstly, we have the semiconductor infrastructure supplier, Marvell. In detail, the company engages in the design, development, and sale of integrated circuits. The markets that it serves include data center, carrier infrastructure, enterprise networking, consumer, and automotive/industrial. Coming off a record fourth quarter to close off the fiscal year 2022, many investors will be keeping a close eye on its upcoming earnings result later this week. During the previous quarter, it reported a net revenue of $1.34 billion, up 68% year-over-year and exceeding the midpoint guidance provided by the company. Along with that, the company posted a non-GAAP net income of $429 million or $0.50 per diluted share. 
Furthermore, Marvell also announced a definitive agreement to acquire Tanzanite Silicon Solutions earlier this month. For those unaware, this is a leading developer of advanced Compute Express Link™ (CXL) technologies. With this addition, Marvell will strengthen its CXL development initiatives. Silicon components based on CXL will facilitate new cloud data center architectures with significant performance and efficiency benefits. Keeping these factors in mind, would you consider investing in MRVL stock ahead of its earnings release on Thursday, May 26, 2022?

Intel
Intel would be no stranger to most people around the world. The multinational tech giant is one of the world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturers. It is also the developer of the x86 series of microprocessors which are found in most personal computers (PCs) today. Despite mixed sentiments within the semiconductor industry, there has been plenty of excitement surrounding Intel this month. For starters, the company turned its focus to how it will meet the growing security needs of organizations during its inaugural Intel Vision event earlier this month. To help organizations better prepare for the challenges of tomorrow, Intel introduced an innovative service-based security implementation code-named Project Amber. This will provide organizations with remote verification in the cloud, edge, and on-premises environments. 
On top of that, the company also recently introduced an open-source tool to migrate code to SYCL through a project called SYCLomatic. Naturally, this will help developers to easily port CUDA code to SYCL and C++ to accelerate cross-architecture programming for heterogeneous architectures. Additionally, this open-source project would also enable community collaboration to advance the adoption of the SYCL standard. In fact, this is a key step in freeing developers from a single-vendor proprietary ecosystem. All in all, there are multiple reasons for optimism surrounding Intel right now. With that said, would you add INTC stock to your watchlist?
Advanced Micro Devices
Next on our list, we have Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a semiconductor company that continues to drive innovation in high-performance computing along with graphics and visualization technologies. In fact, its products are used by billions of people all over the world. Last week, the company announced a collaboration with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) to optimize the Qualcomm FastConnect connectivity system for AMD’s processor-based computing platforms.
The collaboration will begin with AMD Ryzen PRO 6000 Series processors and the Qualcomm FastConnect 6900. Jason Banta, CVP and General Manager, OEM Client Computing of AMD, had this to say, “AMD Ryzen™ PRO 6000 Series processors with Qualcomm FastConnect 6900 enable next-generation business laptops to have the processing and connectivity tools needed to perform in modern environments, offering professional-strength remote manageability for users in the new, hybrid workplace.” The collaboration also represents the first step in forging a strong relationship between the two companies to bring superior wireless connectivity to the AMD mobile computing roadmap. Given this piece of news, is AMD stock worth investing in right now?

Analog Devices
To sum up the list, we will be looking at another semiconductor giant, Analog Devices. Essentially, this is a company that designs, manufactures, and markets a portfolio of semiconductor solutions. This includes integrated circuits, software, and subsystems that leverage analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing technologies. Now, ADI stock has been trading sideways since the start of the year. That still compares favorably to the performance of some of the top names within the industry this year.
Last week, Analog announced the financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2022. Some of the notable highlights include revenue of $2.97 billion, which was up 79% year-over-year, and double-digit growth across all its end markets. Now, this marks the fifth consecutive quarter of record revenue by the company. This appears to be a testament to the unprecedented demand for Analog’s technology and its ability to meet those demands in a challenging supply backdrop. Aside from that, Analog also increased its share repurchases to $776 million and paid $398 million in dividends. With that in mind, would you consider ADI stock as a top semiconductor stock to watch?

2022-05-23 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) to Build Data Center Research Lab in Hillsboro,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-to-build-data-center-research-lab-in-hillsboro,,,"Intel Corporation INTC is set to make an investment of $700 million to construct a 200,000–square-foot lab to focus on data center sustainability research and expand its product development initiatives. This latest investment by Intel in Oregon will help researchers toil on technology to address immersing cooling, effective usage of water and recapturing and reusing of heat.
The company has also clarified that the center will qualify, test and enable its portfolio of data center products, including processors, memory technologies, FGPA chips, Xe architecture, Habana accelerators and future products that are still under development. Construction of the lab will commence this year at the Jones Farm campus in Hillsboro, OR, with the opening expected in late 2023.
Additionally, the company has launched an open intellectual property immersion liquid cooling solution and reference design, a concept created in Taiwan with the hope of bringing this technology to the broader data ecosystem. An advantage of this solution is that the computers will be submerged in a unique liquid which is a good thermal conductor with little or no electricity, reducing heat in the hardware.
Intel is particularly optimistic about the data center business. The drive to lower cost computing devices is increasing the pressure on servers that are taking the load off these devices. As more information in various structures and formats is increasingly stored in the cloud, there is demand for a new breed of chips that are more efficient in terms of cost and energy but may not pack in quite as much computer power as in the past.

2022-05-23 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting INTC Put And Call Options For August 19th,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-intc-put-and-call-options-for-august-19th,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the August 19th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 88 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new August 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $37.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.41. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $37.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $36.09 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $41.91/share today.
Because the $37.50 strike represents an approximate 11% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 78%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.76% return on the cash commitment, or 15.60% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $37.50 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $42.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.56. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $41.91/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $42.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.52% if the stock gets called away at the August 19th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $42.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $42.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 52%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.11% boost of extra return to the investor, or 25.34% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 41%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 34%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $41.91) to be 31%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-05-23 00:00:00+00:00,Is SPDR NYSE Technology ETF (XNTK) a Strong ETF Right Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-spdr-nyse-technology-etf-xntk-a-strong-etf-right-now-2,,,"The SPDR NYSE Technology ETF (XNTK) made its debut on 09/25/2000, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Technology ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.
Fund Sponsor & Index
The fund is managed by State Street Global Advisors, and has been able to amass over $422.03 million, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Technology ETFs. Before fees and expenses, XNTK seeks to match the performance of the NYSE Technology Index.
The NYSE Technology Index is composed of 35 leading U.S.-listed technology-related companies.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.35%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.
The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.47%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings

The best semiconductor stocks to buy in 2022 are companies that continue strong spending on technology.
Intel (INTC): One of the world’s largest chipmakers that generates consistent positive free cash flow.
Micron Technology (MU): Strong Q2 FY2022 and surge in free cash flow are bullish.
Skyworks Solutions (SWKS): It remains cheap with great financial strength, all while trading near its 52-week low.

Semiconductor stocks have rallied in the previous two years amid the pandemic, as demand for devices amid the increase in remote work sent the ICE Semiconductor Price Return Index to a high price of 922.97 on Dec. 31, 2021 from a dip at 685.96 on May 14, 2021. That was a near-35% rally for the space. But moving forward, things are a bit different, and choosing the best semiconductor stocks to buy is more complex than before.
Higher interest rates, worries about a recession, the war in Ukraine and the current risk-on, risk-off mood are some key risks investors face today. However, the prospects for the global semiconductor market remain excellent: “The market is projected to grow from USD 483.00 billion in 2022 to USD 893.10 billion in 2029 at a CAGR of 9.2% during the 2022-2029 period.”
7 Undervalued Growth Stocks to Buy Now
Buying the dip in stocks without having a more analytical approach is naïve. As such, all three semiconductor stocks in this article have strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. The increased demand for consumer electronics and integrated circuits in developing countries according to the report will support market growth in the semiconductors industry.
Ticker  Company Current Price
INTC Intel $40.59
MU Micron Technology $66.57
SWKS Skyworks Solutions $99.27
Intel (INTC)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is among the world’s largest chipmakers. Shares of Intel have reached new lows, tumbling beneath the $42 mark.
Typically, when a stock of a company like Intel trades near its 52-week low, institutional investors take notice and this can lead to a floor for the stock price. With a price-to-earnings ratio (TTM) of 7.01x and a forward dividend and yield of $1.46 and 3.29%, respectively INTC stock is too cheap.
The sales growth over the past three years may not impress, but Intel is the classic definition of a cash cow company. In 2021, the free cash flow dipped 54% due to higher capital expenditures, but in the past five years, in four of them, the free cash flow growth was positive. The spinoff and IPO of Mobileye are expected to create a lot of value for Intel and its shareholders.
Micron Technology (MU)
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has seen its shares decline in 2022 from nearly $96 in early January 2022 to $66 today. It appears that MU stock has strong support near the $66-$67 level as it rebounded in April and in May, where it made a rally to $73 and $74, respectively.
Micron’s price-to-earnings ratio (TTM) of 8.89x is very low, making MU stock cheap, but the forward dividend and yield of 40 cents and 0.56% are not meaningful.
Analysts are bullish about Micron Technology with a 1-year target estimate of $110.42. Furthermore, the Q2 FY 2022 latest earnings report was very strong.
Revenue of $7.79 billion was much higher than $6.24 billion for the same period last year, representing year-over-year growth of nearly 25%. Its gross margin expanded to 47.2% versus 26.4% in Q2 FY2021. Finally, diluted earnings-per-share increased to $2 compared to 53 cents in Q2 FY2021.
7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at Fire Sale Prices
Micron Technology is also great at generating positive free cash flow. In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the company generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow. This is very positive given the fact that in 2021 the firm had generated $2.44 billion in free cash flow, a remarkable growth of 2,837.35%.
Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)
Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) has a vast product portfolio, including amplifiers, antenna tuners, attenuators, automotive tuners and digital radios, for several markets such as aerospace, automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, entertainment and gaming, industrial among others.
Buying the dip in shares of Skyworks Solutions after losses of 38% year-to-date makes sense as its valuation is cheap, and its fundamentals are strong. The PEG ratio is 0.71x, a signal of a deeply undervalued growth stock. Likewise, the expected three-to-five-year EPS growth of 12.90% is strong.
The sales growth in 2021 surged 52.25% to $5.11 billion and net income growth was 83.89%.
The firm is another cash cow with consistent but volatile free cash flow generation.
Given that SWKS is near its 52-week lows, this is an attractive opportunity for long-term investors. For short-term investors, the odds seem high for a rebound too. The 1-year target estimate of $147.38 represents 48% upside potential.

Interest rate hikes and soaring inflation are making investors look for defensive growth stocks. With a series of macroeconomic headwinds threatening the global economy, such share could offer safety as well as market-beating returns.
The risk-off sentiment across all asset classes has adversely affected high-growth stocks in particular, which have seen their stock prices plunge in 2022. For instance, the Nasdaq 100 index has declined 27% so far in 2022. And the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG), the leading ETF among large-cap growth stocks, is down almost 29% year-to-date (YTD).
Analysts are now debating how much longer Wall Street’s downturn will likely continue. Meanwhile, seasoned investors realize that many high-quality growth stocks trade at bargain valuations these days. Therefore, the second part of the year can be a good time to review some of these shares.
7 Dividend Stocks to Boost Your Retirement Savings
With that information, here are seven defensive growth stocks that boast dominant market positions and offer competitive advantages:
ADBE Adobe $388.06
FISV Fiserv $93.68
IBM IBM $126.17
INTC Intel $40.41
ISRG Intuitive Surgical $213.69
TMUS T-Mobile $124.09
VBK Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund ETF Shares $200.95
Adobe (ADBE)

The first defensive growth stock on our list is Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), the leading provider of software for creative content creation. Enterprises and individuals rely on products and services for document management, digital marketing as well as advertising.
Adobe released first-quarter results on March 22. Revenue grew 9% year-over-year (YOY) to $4.26 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at $3.37 per diluted share, up from $3.14 in the prior-year quarter. Cash and equivalents ended the period at $2.74 billion.
The cloud software company sells its suite of software products through a recurring subscription model, which Wall Street loves. In Q1, the digital media annualized recurring revenue increased $418 million quarter-over-quarter to $12.57 billion.
Inflation is a big worry for many companies, which may wonder whether their customer numbers will be affected in the near future. Yet, as Adobe’s services tend to be sticky, the client demand is likely to stay stable. In fact, during the second quarter, management anticipates $4.34 billion in revenue, representing mid-teens percentage YOY growth.
Like many other software names, ADBE stock has had a rough year so far and declined close to 30% since January. Shares are trading at 27.2 times forward earnings and 11.3 times sales. The 12-month median price forecast for Adobe stock stands at $570.
Fiserv (FISV)
Our next defensive growth stock, Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), provides banks and other financial institutions the financial technology (fintech) needed to execute many of their daily functions. It works with around 10,000 financial institutions and 6 million merchants.
Fiserv released Q1 results on April 27. Revenue grew 10% YOY to $4.14 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.40 per share, up 20% YOY from $1.17 per share in the prior-year period. Free cash flow (FCF) stood at $603 million. Cash and equivalents ended the period at $2.83 billion.
The fintech provider saw 11% company-wide organic revenue growth in the first quarter. Investors were pleased that Fiserv’s small-business offering, the Clover platform, reported a solid 39% revenue growth. Moreover, the recent Finxact acquisition will provide potential long-term growth in cloud-native banking solutions.
7 Undervalued Stocks to Buy Before Investors Catch On
FISV stock has dropped 9.2% YTD. Shares look undervalued at 14.90 times forward earnings and 3.9 times sales. Meanwhile, the 12-month median price forecast for Fiserv stock is at $130.
IBM (IBM)

Tech giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) offers integrated solutions, including data center assembly, software, and IT services. The recent Kyndryl (NYSE:KD) spinoff will likely allow IBM to focus on long-term growth opportunities such as hybrid cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI).
IBM announced Q1 results on April 19. Revenue grew 8% YOY to $14.2 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.40 per share, compared to $1.12 in the prior-year quarter. Cash and equivalents ended the period at $10.8 billion. FCF stood at $1.2 billion.
Wall Street was pleased that the software segment grew by 15% YOY at constant currency, generating $5.8 billion in revenue. Consulting revenue also grew by 17% YOY and reached $4.8 billion.
IBM stock is about flat so far in 2022. Shares have a modest valuation at 13.5 times forward earnings and just 2.1 times sales. The 12-month median price forecast for IBM stock stands at $145.
Intel (INTC)

Next on our list of defensive growth stocks is Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), one of the largest semiconductor manufacturers worldwide with a market capitalization (cap) of $176 billion. The chipmaker is in the process of investing $20 billion in two leading-edge chip factories in Ohio.
Intel issued Q1 results on April 28. Revenue declined 7% YOY to $18.4 billion. Adjusted earnings saw a sharper drop, falling 35% YOY to 87 cents per share. Cash and equivalents ended the period at $6.22 billion.
Despite the decline in total revenue, first-quarter revenue from the data center and artificial intelligence segment soared 22% YOY. The chipmaker highlighted that strong data center and networking markets would more than compensate for the weakness in PC demand. Therefore, management maintained its $76 billion revenue estimate for 2022.
7 Oil Stocks to Buy With Safe Dividends
Nonetheless, INTC stock has lost 17.5% YTD. As a result, shares are trading at 11.95 times forward earnings and 2.26 times sales. At present, the 12-month median price forecast for Intel stock is at $50.
Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)

Next we look at Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), the market leader in robotic-assisted surgeries. The company commands almost 80% of theglobal market Its famed “da Vinci” surgical systems offer surgeons a suite of robotic capabilities to perform complex procedures.
The medical robotics company released Q1 results on April 21. Revenue increased 15% YOY to $1.49 billion. However, adjusted earnings declined slightly to $1.13 per diluted share, down from $1.17 a year ago. Cash and equivalents ended the period at $8.40 billion.
Procedures worldwide using da Vinci systems increased 19% YOY. Understandably, hospitals make significant investments when purchasing such robotic surgical systems. But, once hospitals buy them, they become long-term customers for updates, parts, or services.
Put another way, a hospital would face high switching costs to move to a competitor. Therefore, Wall Street is not expecting a decline in the number of clients that Intuitive has. In addition, the company will likely benefit from global growth in such surgical operations.
Despite the strong fundamental metrics, so far this year, ISRG stock has declined over 40%. Shares are trading at 44.05 times forward earnings and 13.7 times sales. At present, the 12-month median price forecast for ISRG stock stands at $325.
T-Mobile (TMUS)
Source: Tupungato / Shutterstock.com
My final single stock on this list of defensive growth stocks is T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), which offers communication services via its flagship brands, T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, and Sprint. As a result of the Sprint acquisition, its total customer count increased to 109.5 million.
The wireless service provider announced Q1 results on April 27. Revenue grew 7% YOY to $15.1 billion. However, diluted earnings per share declined 23% YOY to 57 cents, down from 74 cents a year ago. FCF grew 26% YOY to $1.6 billion.
T-Mobile boasts a clear network lead in 5G coverage, with significant growth in postpaid and broadband customers. It grew total accounts by 348,000, postpaid customers by 1.32 million, and postpaid phone net adds by 589,000 YOY.
The 7 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy Now
TMUS stock has appreciated nearly 7.5% YTD. Shares are trading at 49.26 forward earnings and 1.93 times sales. Finally, the 12-month median price forecast for T-Mobile stock is at $169. Even in economic downturns, individuals and businesses keep their phone and internet accounts active. Therefore, a business like T-Mobile is not likely to lose customers even during a potential recession stateside.
Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (VBK)
Source: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com
52-Week Range: $193.17 – $306.78
Expense Ratio: 0.07% per year
Our final discussion centers around a low-cost exchange-traded fund (ETF), namely the Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSEARCA:VBK). The fund started trading in January 2004. Over the years, it has been a popular choice for growth investors looking for exposure to a diversified group of small growth companies. It also would help fill out a portfolio full of individual defensive growth stocks like we’ve discussed so far.
VBK tracks the CRSP US Small Cap Growth Index and it currently has 751 holdings. The top 10 names account for around 6.7% of its net assets of $28.7 billion. Among the leading names on the roster are the advanced materials and process solutions provider Entegris (NASDAQ:ENTG); technology instruments manufacturer Bio-Techne (NASDAQ:TECH); global media and entertainment company Liberty Media (NASDAQ:LSXMA); and real estate investment trusts (REITs) Equity LifeStyle Properties (NYSE:ELS) and Rexford Industrial Realty (NYSE:REXR).
In terms of sectoral allocation, technology accounts for the largest slice with 21.40%, followed by health care with 19.10%, industrials with 17.70%, and consumer discretionary with 15.60%.
This popular ETF hit a record high in early November 2021. But, since the start of the year, VBK has dropped 26% and now it is changing hands around a 52-week low. Buy-and-hold readers could find value around these levels.

High-yielding dividend stocks to buy are the go-to now. However, yields aren’t always sustainable and the selection process is critical.
Citigroup (C): Citigroup is a new Warren Buffett favorite. The bank’s stock is significantly undervalued relative to its book value and exhibits robust dividend-related metrics.
Chevron (CVX): Chevron stock is a momentum play. CVX’s expansion in Mexico could add to its already solid balance sheet.
Intel (INTC): The firm’s CPUs and GPUs are performing well amid an artificial intelligence surge.
Verizon (VZ): Utilities could prosper in the event of an economic downturn, and Verizon could be a “best-in-class” pick.
Ford (F): Ford’s payout ratio is lagging historical averages. Thus, a dividend increase could be in the offing.

Finding dividend stocks to buy is a great option right now.
First of all, risk aversion tends to shift investor sentiment into high-yielding assets such as dividend stocks and investment-grade bonds. Secondly, contractionary economic policies such as rising interest rates provide support to dividend-paying stocks as they’re generally able to absorb fluctuating consumer sentiment.
Although most dividend payers are generally safe bets, some exhibit risk from a yield vantage point. For example, a dividend might exhibit a lucrative yield in the current market climate, which could later erode due to cyclical purposes.
7 Undervalued Stocks to Buy Before Investors Catch On
The goal of this article is to identify high-yielding dividend stocks to buy that could sustain their yield into perpetuity. So, without further ado, here are five high-yield dividend stocks to buy.
Ticker Company Current Price
C Citigroup Inc. $49.78
CVX Chevron Corporation $166.86
INTC Intel Corporation $42.01
VZ Verizon Communications Inc. $49.10
F Ford Motor Company $12.85
Dividend Stocks to Buy: Citigroup (C)

Citigroup (NYSE:C) stock has been overlooked during the past year. I suspect that investors have thrown caution to the wind during the firm’s restructuring period. However, Citi’s prospects are looking up, and legendary investor Warren Buffett thinks so too after adding approximately 55 million Citi stock to his portfolio during the first quarter.
The big bank’s dividend yield of 4% is highly respectably, especially considering that C stock is undervalued. Citigroup stock is trading at a 1.9x discount to its book value, which suggests that the asset holds value in abundance.
I expect Citi to outperform the market in a higher interest rate environment. Higher rates will provide support to the bank’s debt segment as well as stagnate its wage bill, in turn, providing attractive residual value to its investors.
Chevron (CVX)

This is a momentum play. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has benefited dearly from rising energy prices, which has resulted in the firm now carrying $33.05 billion in ongoing cash from operations. I remain bullish on energy stocks for the foreseeable future as oil and gas prices need to retrace substantially before the sector’s profitability takes a hit.
Chevron looks set to expand on its operations by entering a licensing agreement with the Venezuelan government and expanding into Mexico with a $1.6 billion deepwater project in the Mexican gulf.
CVX stock’s dividend yield is both lucrative and robust. First off, Chevron’s dividend yield of 3% is supported by a coverage ratio of 2.9x, conveying sustainability. In addition, Chevron’s return on equity of 14.7% suggests that it provides justified value to its investors.
Intel (INTC)

Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) use case has grown significantly during the past decade. The company’s been able to leverage the artificial intelligence market with its CPUs being used for time-series programs and its GPUs for image recognition programs. Intel’s prospects look bright amid a surge in technological hardware and software during the pandemic.
Intel’s momentum is there for all to see. The company recently beat its first-quarter earnings target by 8 cents per share amid robust demand for semiconductors. 
Furthermore, Intel provides a lucrative dividend at a yield of 3.1%. Additionally, Intel’s shareholder compensation seems sustainable, given that it sports a dividend coverage of 2.4x.
Dividend Stocks to Buy: Verizon (VZ)

I disagree with Ray Dalio’s first-quarter Verizon (NYSE:VZ) sale. I believe that utilities provide a great option at the moment, given the economic climate. Additionally, Verizon could tap into AT&T’s (NYSE:T) investor base, which has grown increasingly frustrated with the firm’s recent shift in shareholder policy.
Michael Rollins of Citigroup substantiates my opening argument well. Rollins said last month that communications could show durability during a trying economic period as investors view them as relatively defensive.
Verizon stacks up well from a quantitative vantage point. The stock provides a stunning dividend yield of 5.1%, backed by an earnings-before-interest-and-tax margin of 21.4%. Lastly, Verizon boasts $180,740 net income per employee, suggesting that it could leapfrog the rising input costs caused by a tight labor market.
Ford (F)

Ford (NYSE:F) is one of the most widely traded stocks on the market. Thus volatility is inevitable. Furthermore, F stock is cyclical due to the nature of its product offerings. Nonetheless, I believe that Ford is a solid long-term dividend-yield play if you’re willing to bear the risk.
The company’s ICE and EV divisions are both performing proficiently, with total wholesale shipments coming in strong at around 970,000 vehicles in the first-quarter, leading to a revenue beat of $457.31 million and an earnings beat of 1 cent per share.
Lastly, Ford pays a lucrative dividend with a yield of 3%. Ford’s dividend payout ratio is 92% lower than its five-year average, prompting me to believe that dividend increases are on the way.

2022-05-20 00:00:00+00:00,Better Semiconductor Stock: AMD or Qualcomm,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-semiconductor-stock%3A-amd-or-qualcomm,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) both saw their stock prices surge to all-time highs last year, but both semiconductor plays have stumbled in recent months as rising interest rates drove investors out of tech stocks and into more conservative investments.
Should investors buy shares of either chipmaker right now? Let's review their core business models, growth rates, and valuations to find out.
The similarities and differences
AMD and Qualcomm are both ""fabless"" chipmakers, meaning they outsource the production of their chips to third-party foundries. By comparison, integrated device manufacturers like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) take the more capital-intensive route of manufacturing their own chips.
Image source: Getty Images.
AMD is the world's second-largest supplier of x86 central processors (CPUs) and discrete graphics processing units (GPUs). It trails behind Intel and Nvidia in CPUs and GPUs, respectively, but it doesn't face any other notable rivals in either market. It also produces custom accelerated processing units (APUs) for leading game consoles.
Qualcomm produces mobile system on chips (SoCs) -- which bundle together a CPU, GPU, and baseband modem -- for smartphone makers. It currently ranks second in the global mobile SoC market after MediaTek, but it's still the clear market leader in premium devices. Its massive portfolio of wireless licenses also entitles it to a cut of each smartphone sold worldwide -- even if they don't use its mobile SoCs or modems.
Which company is growing faster?
AMD's revenue surged 68% to $16.4 billion in 2021. It benefited from four main tailwinds: elevated sales of PCs for remote work and gaming; Intel's inability to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, AMD's main foundry partner, in the ""process race"" to manufacture smaller and denser chips; its gradual market-share gains in the data center market; and brisk sales of Sony's PlayStation5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series S/X, which are powered by AMD's custom APUs.
AMD expects its revenue, which includes its recent acquisition of the programmable chipmaker Xilinx, to rise about 60% to $26.3 billion this year. It expects its adjusted gross margin to expand about 6 percentage points to 54%, and analysts expect its adjusted earnings to increase by 58%.
Those rosy expectations indicate that the bearish concerns about a post-lockdown slowdown in PC sales and Intel's potential comeback are overblown. It also suggests the stock is still pretty cheap at 21 times forward earnings.
Qualcomm's adjusted revenue rose 55% to $33.5 billion in fiscal 2021, which ended last September. Its chipmaking (QCT) revenue soared 64% as its licensing (QTL) revenue grew 26%.
Its QCT business benefited from the market's growing appetite for premium 5G phones, but it continued to diversify beyond handsets by selling more RF front-end, automotive, and Internet of Things (IoT) chips. The ongoing expansion of those three smaller categories could eventually turn Qualcomm into a more diversified chipmaker like Texas Instruments or Broadcom.
Qualcomm's revenue rose 35% year over year in the first half of fiscal 2021, and analysts expect its revenue to increase 34% to $44.7 billion for the full year. Those estimates account for its recent acquisition of the driving assistance technology developer Arriver, which should strengthen its automotive business. Analysts expect its adjusted earnings to grow 47%.
That bullish forecast implies that Qualcomm's QCT sales will continue to rise, even as it laps the 5G upgrade cycle and deals with new COVID-19 outbreaks in China, and that its stock is still a bargain at 11 times forward earnings.
Qualcomm is a safer bet in this stormy market
AMD and Qualcomm both spent a lot of their free cash flow on big buybacks in recent years. However, AMD's share count actually increased 66% over the past five years (partly due to its all-stock takeover of Xilinx) while Qualcomm's number of outstanding shares declined 24%.
Qualcomm also pays a forward dividend yield of 2.2%. AMD doesn't pay a dividend, and it doesn't plan to start paying one anytime soon.
AMD will also likely face more competitive headwinds than Qualcomm over the next few years. Intel could still strike back at its CPU business, and Nvidia could ramp up the pressure on AMD with new low-end and high-end GPUs. Qualcomm's only meaningful long-term competitor is MediaTek, and it remains far ahead of that Taiwanese rival in the premium smartphone market.
I like both of these stocks as long-term investments. However, Qualcomm's lower valuation, higher yield, more meaningful buybacks, and wider moat all make it a much more attractive investment than AMD in this volatile market.
