2022-03-22 00:00:00+00:00,"Nvidia unveils latest chips, technology to speed up AI computing",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-unveils-latest-chips-technology-to-speed-up-ai-computing,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee and Chavi Mehta
March 22 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp NVDA.O on Tuesday announced several new chips and technologies that it said will boost the computing speed of increasingly complicated artificial intelligence algorithms, stepping up competition against rival chipmakers vying for lucrative data center business.
Nvidia's graphic chips (GPU), which initially helped propel and enhance the quality of videos in the gaming market, have become the dominant chips for companies to use for AI workloads. The latest GPU, called the H100, can help reduce computing times from weeks to days for some work involving training AI models, the company said.
The announcements were made at Nvidia's AI developers conference online.
""Data centers are becoming AI factories — processing and refining mountains of data to produce intelligence,"" said Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang in a statement, calling the H100 chip the ""engine"" of AI infrastructure.
Companies have been using AI and machine learning for everything from making recommendations of the next video to watch to new drug discovery, and the technology is increasingly becoming an important tool for business.
The H100 chip will be produced on Taiwan Manufacturing Semiconductor Company's 2330.TW cutting edge four nanometer process with 80 billion transistors and will be available in the third quarter, Nvidia said.
The H100 will also be used to build Nvidia's new ""Eos"" supercomputer, which Nvidia said will be the world's fastest AI system when it begins operation later this year.
Facebook parent Meta FB.O announced in January that it would build the world's fastest AI supercomputer this year and it would perform at nearly 5 exaflops. Nvidia on Tuesday said its supercomputer will run at over 18 exaflops.
Exaflop performance is the ability to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second.
In addition to the GPU chip, Nvidia introduced a new processor chip (CPU) called the Grace CPU Superchip that is based on Arm technology. It's the first new chip by Nvidia based on the Arm architecture to be announced since the company's deal to buy Arm Ltd fell apart last month due to regulatory hurdles.
The Grace CPU Superchip, which will be available in the first half of next year, connects two CPU chips and will focus on AI and other tasks that require intensive computing power.
More companies are connecting chips using technology that allows faster data flow between them. Earlier this month Apple Inc <AAPL.O> unveiled its M1 Ultra chip connecting two M1 Max chips. [nL2N2VB1DI]
Nvidia said the two CPU chips were connected using its NVLink-C2C technology, which was also unveiled on Tuesday.
Nvidia shares were up more than 1% in midday trade.

2022-03-22 00:00:00+00:00,Alphabet (GOOGL) Makes Waymo Fully Autonomous in San Francisco,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alphabet-googl-makes-waymo-fully-autonomous-in-san-francisco,,,"Alphabet’s GOOGL self-driving unit Waymo is set to make its ride-hailing vehicles fully driverless on the streets of San Francisco, CA, where it has been gaining traction on the back of its Early Rider program called Trusted Tester.

Since the launch of Trusted Tester in the city, Waymo vehicles contained a safety driver to take control if required.

The company will remove safety drivers soon, allowing a fully autonomous commercial ride-hailing service in San Francisco.

We note that Waymo in San Francisco marks its first expansion outside Phoenix, AZ.
Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus
  Alphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote
Growing Waymo Efforts
The latest move bodes well for Waymo’s growing efforts toward expanding its ride-hailing service across the United States.

In addition to the latest move, the company recently partnered with Geely, a China-based automotive company. Per the terms, Geely’s electric mobility brand, Zeekr, will design and develop electric vehicles for Waymo, into which Waymo Driver will be integrated.

The vehicles will be first introduced on the roads of the United States. With the Geely partnership, Waymo will expand its Waymo One fleet.

Apart from this, Waymo teamed up with Google’s Maps to ensure a seamless booking experience for Waymo One. This enables customers to book Waymo One directly from the Maps app.

The endeavors will help Alphabet further penetrate the booming autonomous driving space.

Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the worldwide driverless vehicle market is expected to see a CAGR of 18.06% between 2021 and 2026.
Intensifying Competition
Given the upbeat scenario, not only Alphabet but companies like Amazon AMZN, Intel INTC and Baidu BIDU are also making every effort to capitalize on the growth prospects in the autonomous driving space.

Amazon’s buyout of Zoox, a developer of autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, remains a major positive. Further, the company’s launch of its first self-driving robotaxi strengthened its position in the autonomous driving space.

Zoox has been testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, Las Vegas and Foster City. It intends to open an engineering office and operations facility this year, which will act as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing.

Meanwhile, Intel is gaining from the low power consumption of Mobileye chips and the ability to create maps for self-driving systems. The company intends on introducing a pilot for autonomous taxis and ride-hailing services in Munich and Tel Aviv in 2022.

In addition to this, Mobileye recently teamed up with German electric mobility unit Benteler EV Systems and Beep to develop and deploy self-driving, fully electric shuttles in the United States by 2024.

Baidu is gaining from the expansion of the Apollo Go Robotaxi service, which features about 100 pick-up and drop-off stations across several residential as well as business areas.

Nevertheless, Alphabet’s growing autonomous driving initiatives are likely to help it stay ahead of the curve.

Currently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2022-03-21 00:00:00+00:00,7 Growth Stocks to Buy Now for the Coming Recession,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-growth-stocks-to-buy-now-for-the-coming-recession,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Growth stocks, which were the darlings of Wall Street in 2021, have been beaten down considerably since the beginning of 2022. The jittery market sentiment has been pushing the markets lower amidst rampant inflation, sky-high oil prices and geopolitical tensions. The Nasdaq 100 Index has plunged 12% year-to-date (YTD), while the S&P 500 is down 8% over the same period.
Economists are already debating whether the U.S. economy could be heading for a recession in the coming months. Although market participants understandably fear economic downturns, recessionary periods often create rare buying opportunities in the stock market.
Purchasing high-quality growth stocks during a recession could lead to steady returns. Seasoned investors currently see golden buying opportunities in such resilient stocks the are likely to do well even in a possible recession.
9 Gold Stocks to Buy as Global Fears Rise
However, allocating a large part of a portfolio on growth stocks could come with increased volatility, especially in the short run. Therefore, it would be wiser for investors to build a balanced portfolio of reasonably priced growth and value names for diversification purposes.
With that information, here are seven growth stocks that could continue to deliver steady returns regardless of a possible recession.
ASML (NASDAQ:ASML)
Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK)
Autozone (NYSE:AZO)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Nextera Energy (NYSE:NEE)
Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI)
VanEck India Growth Leaders ETF (NYSEARCA:GLIN)
Growth Stocks to Buy: ASML (ASML)
Source: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock
52-week range: $536.01 – $895.93
Dividend Yield: 0.67%
ASML manufactures photolithography systems used by semiconductor foundries to produce chips. It commands over 60% of this niche market. Other chip heavyweights, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) use ASML’s products.
ASML released Q4 2021 results on Jan. 19. Net sales came in at 5 billion euros. Net income came in at 1.8 billion euros, or 4.39 euros per share, up from 1.7 billion euros in the prior quarter. Cash and equivalents ended the period at 7.6 billion euros.
With the metaverse becoming the next big buzzword in the chip industry, it will undoubtedly be the primary growth driver for the foreseeable future. Chipmakers increasingly rely on ASML’s machines to manufacture chips that will handle real-time processing of large amounts of data required to power the metaverse.
ASML stock hovers around $630, down 21% YTD. Shares are trading at 34.7 times forward earnings and 13 times trailing sales. The 12-month median price forecast for the stock stands at $925.
Autodesk (ADSK)

52 week range: $186.29 – $344.39
Autodesk provides 3D design, engineering and entertainment software and services worldwide. The company sells software suites focused on architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, and media. Its architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) segment and its legacy AutoCAD business accounted for 72% of its revenue in the recent quarter.
Autodesk announced Q4 FY22 results on Feb. 24. Revenue increased 17% year-over-year (YOY) to $1.21 billion. Non-GAAP income came in at $421.6 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, up from $314.6 million a year ago. Cash and equivalents ended the period at $1.5 billion.
Autodesk software suites are popular across all its business segments and deployed by many companies worldwide. Such a broad user-base shields the company from adverse effects of recessions and geopolitical risks.
7 Stable Energy Stocks for Uncertain Times
Autodesk bills customers on a subscription basis. Due to the high initial costs of switching to a competitor, Autodesk has the pricing power to pass on regular price increases to businesses. Such a subscription model generates revenue every single year until the customer drops the software entirely.
The company issued revenue guidance of 14% to 17% growth in 2022. Management is also projecting non-GAAP EPS to grow by 28% to 35%.
Autodesk stock hit a 52-week low of $186.29 on Mar. 14. It currently trades around $213, that’s still down 24% year-to-date . Shares are valued at 32 times forward earnings and 11 times trailing sales. The 12-month median price forecast for Autodesk is at $285.50.
Growth Stocks to Buy: Autozone (AZO)
Source: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com
52-week range: $1,274.48 – $2,110.00
Autozone is the largest auto replacement parts and accessories retailer stateside. Although most sales are to retail customers, sales to domestic commercial clients are growing rapidly.
Autozone released Q2 FY22 results on Mar. 1. Revenue grew 15.8% YOY to $3.4 billion. Net income came in at $472 million, or $22.30 per diluted share, up from $346 million, or $14.93 per diluted share, a year ago.
The chip shortage has led to price increases across the board in the auto market. Research company Edmunds suggests that over 80% of car buyers paid on average $700 more than the suggested retail price last January, compared to just 3% who did so a year ago.
Due to soaring prices, car owners tend to keep their cars longer, providing considerable business growth for retail parts suppliers. Given to its ability to pass along price increases to consumers and suppliers, Autozone maintained its gross margin of 53% in 2021.
Autozone stock is around $1,953, up more than 45% over the past 12 months. Yet, it’s down 4.5% YTD. Shares are trading at 18.8 times forward earnings and 2.6 times trailing sales. The 12-month median price forecast for Autozone stands at $2,183.50.
Intel (INTC)

Dividend Yield: 3.29%
Santa Clara, California-based Intel is the world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturer. The company produces microprocessors for the global personal computer and data center markets.

Growth Stocks to Buy: Nextera Energy (NEE)

52-week range: $69.79 – $93.73
Dividend Yield: 2.15%
NextEra Energy is the largest publicly-traded electric utility holding company in the world, serving over 11 million customers. It is also the world’s largest solar and wind energy producer, leading the drive in sustainable energy.

The stock is priced around $82, down 10% YTD. Shares have a moderate valuation at 27.6 times forward earnings and 8.9 times trailing sales. The 12-month median price forecast for Nextera stock stands at $90.50.

52-week range: $48.24 – $71.71
Dividend Yield: 1.62%
Service Corporation International is a deathcare products and services company. It provides funeral and cemetery services and products via more than 1,900 funeral homes and cemeteries in 44 states and eight Canadian provinces.

Benjamin Franklin recorded in a letter, “In this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes” in 1789. This quote still holds true today. Even recessions have minimal adverse effects on businesses like Service Corporation.
8 Strong Uptrend Stocks to Buy on the Next Dip
Moreover, the funeral and death-related industry saw a spike in revenue during Covid-19. The company highlighted the impact of the pandemic and raised its 2022 bottom-line guidance. Management forecasts adjusted EPS to come in at around $3.00, up from $2.80 projected earlier. 
SCI stock currently hovers below $64 territory, up 33% over the past year. Shares are trading at 20.3 times forward earnings and 2.5 times trailing sales. The 12-month median price forecast for Service Corporation stock is at $77.50.
Growth Stocks to Buy: VanEck India Growth Leaders ETF (GLIN)
52-week range: $32.59 – $44.17
Expense ratio: 0.81% per year

2022-03-21 00:00:00+00:00,"7 Tech Stocks to Buy as Apple, Intel, and Microsoft Lead Russia Boycotts",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-tech-stocks-to-buy-as-apple-intel-and-microsoft-lead-russia-boycotts,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
When Russia decided to invade Ukraine, it deeply miscalculated the West’s response. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), a global provider of financial messaging services, sanctioned a selection of Russian banks. This crippled much of Russia’s financial system and contributed to the country’s counter-response in shutting down its stock market. American firms in the consumer goods industry also said they would curtail or shut down their businesses in the country.
Technology companies followed suit. The operational shut-down from leading firms in the information technology sector is critical. Russian military relying on computer hardware cannot update their systems. In a small way, it will set a time limit to Russia’s invasion. As the West supplies Ukraine with military equipment and related technology, Russia must rely on its aging equipment. Admittedly, technology companies that are predominantly consumer-facing may have a smaller impact on the Kremlin. Still, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) boycotting the country will hurt Russian consumers. The more inconvenienced they become, the more likely Russian citizens will question their government’s decision-making.
9 Gold Stocks to Buy as Global Fears Rise
There are seven tech stocks investors should buy as the above-mentioned firms lead the boycott. They are:
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)
Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB)
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB)
IBM (NYSE:IBM)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)
Tech Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)
Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com
Apple announced on Mar. 1, 2022, that it would stop sales in Russia. In response to Russian President Vladimir Putin invading Ukraine, the consumer technology giant said it would suspend all product sales. It also removed Russian news apps. This includes Sputnik and Russia Today, news services that the Kremlin backs.
Apple’s stand against the invasion is a rare move. The company typically avoids taking a stand against governments. For example, Apple appeased the Chinese government by loosening some of its privacy policies in China.
Apple cannot afford to continue doing business in Russia. The hostile attack is against Apple’s core company values. If it did nothing, Apple fans may question what it means to support the company’s products. Furthermore, this war does not stop at military conflicts on the ground. It involves a misinformation war. Apple cannot let Russia’s government spread false information in the West or in Russia.
Apple’s growth in 2022 will not likely slow. The company announced a much-needed update to the affordable iPhone SE. The SE 3 will have 5G, a better processor, and a better camera.
Airbnb (ABNB)
Source: AlesiaKan / Shutterstock.com
To voice its opposition to Russia invading Ukraine, Airbnb said it would suspend all operations in Russia and Belarus. The announcement may look like a negligible stance. Airbnb would have no revenue from the region anyway after most airlines stopped flying to Russia at the time of the decision. Still, the company is supporting Ukrainians. It is offering temporary housing to up to 100,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine.
Beyond the boycott and war, markets are forgetting the company posted strong fourth-quarter (Q4) results. Q4 revenue grew by 38% compared to Q4 2019. When compared to the pandemic-hit Q4 2020 period, revenue grew by 80% year-over-year (YOY). Airbnb earned $55 million in income, a company record. Adjusted EBITDA of $333 million made this the company’s most profitable fourth quarter.
7 Stable Energy Stocks for Uncertain Times
The company benefited from guests discovering thousands of small towns and rural communities. Domestic and non-urban travel bookings rose by 45% compared to Q4 2019. Customers are feeling more comfortable booking at urban destinations. Look for cross-border travel restrictions continuing to ease. This will result in higher revenue for Airbnb.
Tech Stocks to Buy: Meta Platforms (FB)
Source: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com
After reeling from a poor quarter, Meta Platforms is in the news again. In response to Russia’s internet censorship agency blocking Facebook, Facebook is allowing for more controversial posts.
On Mar. 11, 2022, Facebook said it would allow war posts. These posts are urging violence against Russian invaders on Facebook and Instagram. The stance is contrary to the company’s hate speech policy. Still, a Meta spokesperson said, “We still won’t allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians.”
FB stock already traded in a highly bearish pattern since posting weak quarterly results on Feb. 2. Bottom-fishers tried to bet on the stock rebounding that month. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the stock continued on a downtrend.
Meta stock is highly bearish because investors are worried that Facebook and Instagram users will spend less time on those platforms. To counter the long-term slowdown, Meta is investing billions of dollars in its metaverse. Risks are high that the virtual reality platform will fail. In the last decade, technology firms tried, but failed, to transition gaming to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality. They could not convince consumers to wear a VR headset. People preferred the computer screen or a non-3D OLED television instead.
IBM (IBM)
Source: shutterstock.com/LCV
On Mar. 8, IBM said it would suspend all business in Russia.
IBM’s separation of Kyndryl on Nov. 3, 2021 is a turning point. The spin-off will allow IBM to concentrate on the hybrid cloud, software, and consulting. In Q4, IBM posted revenue of $16.7 billion. Software revenue rose by 8% and included around 5 points from external sales to Kyndryl. Consulting revenue rose by 13% YOY.
James Kavanaugh, IBM senior vice president and chief financial officer, highlighted IBM’s research and development efforts. The company is increasing spending in that area. It acquired 15 companies to strengthen its artificial intelligence (AI) and hybrid cloud capabilities. IBM stock is an inexpensive approach for investors to benefit from the automation, data, AI, and security sector.
7 Safe Investments for Seniors to Consider in 2022
The company ended the quarter with $12.8 billion in cash from operating activities. It held $7.6 billion in cash. Its debt of $51.7 billion includes financing debt of $13.9 billion. This did not prevent the firm from paying investors $5.9 billion worth of dividends in 2021. This makes it one of the best tech stocks to buy now.

Intel said it would suspend all shipments to customers in Russia and Belarus. It will also raise funds to support relief efforts. Its decision aligns with the U.S. government sanctioning Russia. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce limited the export of microelectronics and telecommunications.
Intel is a dominant supplier of processors that power computers. But investors get more than a PC supplier with Intel. On Mar. 7, the company’s Mobileye unit confidentially filed for a U.S. initial public offering (IPO). Mobileye develops technology that powers driverless cars.
The IPO may value Mobileye at over $50 billion. In 2017, Intel bought the Israeli company for just $15.3 billion. Investors will benefit from the capital gains windfall. Intel needs to monetize the unit before the technology sector falls further. It is spending billions to expand its manufacturing capabilities.
As a separately run firm, Intel will still have a close connection to Mobileye. It will remain relevant in the automotive chip market. More importantly, Intel will turn its focus back on growing its computer business, which is good news for the stock.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com
Microsoft suspended sales in Russia on Mar. 4. It is also coordinating its efforts closely with the U.S., European, and U.K. governments. This will increase the effectiveness of the government sanctions and help Ukraine. Microsoft is most keen on protecting Ukraine’s cybersecurity. The company is helping the country’s cybersecurity officials in Ukraine defend itself from Russian attacks.
For weeks following the invasion, Nasdaq’s selling worsened. This hurt MSFT stock. It also gives growth investors a better entry point as its price-to-earnings ratio declines.
Microsoft has multiple tailwinds ahead. To sustain the growth of its Office app, it updated the home screen. It also updated the Office app and Office.com to more tightly integrate Word, Excel, OneNote, and other Office apps. To increase the adoption of cloud technology, Microsoft is charging just $40 for Azure courses.
7 Sports Betting Stocks to Buy as March Madness Tips Off
Slow adoption for Microsoft’s Windows 11 is a headwind. To encourage users to switch, the company introduced a new search experience and improved the file explorer tabs. Consumers will appreciate the better user interface. The higher satisfaction should drive Windows operating system sales higher.
Tech Stocks to Buy: Netflix (NFLX)
Source: Riccosta / Shutterstock.com
Netflix stopped its services in Russia on Mar. 6. NFLX stock, which plunged from over $500 to around $350 after posting results in January, is approaching attractive levels from here.
Investors punished the company’s stock after it posted weak customer growth. Although it issued a light outlook on customer growth for the quarter, the streaming giant has an attractive product. On Mar. 10, the streaming service raised subscription prices in the U.K. and plans to do the same in Ireland. Netflix will re-invest the higher cash flow to deliver quality U.K. production. It will also “’offer a wide variety of curated quality shows and films.’”
Netflix’s strategy to attract customers with better content instead of better prices will work. It cannot compete with larger, well-funded studios that have a bigger budgets. Runaway costs and high cancellations could damage the business permanently. Instead, Netflix will have an attractive library of content that suits its audience by region.
NFLX stock is at low historical price-to-earnings multiples. It only needs to post a quarter of strong subscription growth to win back investors.

You can find the video below, but here are some of the highlights.
In January, Intel announced it will invest more than $20 billion to build two new factories in Ohio. It also pledged an additional $100 million toward partnerships with educational institutions.
Last week it announced something even bigger than one or two fabs. Intel plans to invest up to €80 billion over the next decade in Europe.
Intel is investing in the whole chip ecosystem: R&D, design, packaging, manufacturing and foundry services. The initial investment, phase one, represents €17 billion in Germany and to create a new R&D and design hub in France and €12 billion in Ireland. Once this phase is complete, Intel's total investment in Ireland will be more than €30 billion.
The world needs semiconductors. But the majority are made in Taiwan or South Korea, 80% to be exact. This is one reason we are seeing supply chain problems.
The EU Chips Act will bring in €43 billion of public investment.
The plan is to make Europe the leader in chip production and for Europe to produce 20% of the world's microchips by 2030, about twice as much as today.

2022-03-19 00:00:00+00:00,"Got $1,000? 2 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy Before the Tech Rally Begins",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/got-%241000-2-nasdaq-stocks-to-buy-before-the-tech-rally-begins,,,"The NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector index has lost 17% of its value so far in 2022 as investors have sold technology stocks. This has been caused by a hawkish Federal Reserve that just hiked interest rates as well as other factors that are likely to negatively impact companies in this sector, such as rising inflation and geopolitical instability.
Some high-flying technology stocks that have historically delivered outstanding returns to investors have borne the brunt of this sell-off. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) are down 22% and 16%, respectively, so far this year. However, both stocks have shown signs of a resurgence of late, along with the broader technology sector.
^NDXT data by YCharts
Why you should buy the dips in AMD and Applied Materials
Of course, a couple of strong sessions don't mean that a tech stock rally has finally arrived. However, it may be a good idea to buy shares of AMD and Applied Materials while they are still down. That's because both stocks rallied hard following the stock market sell-off of February-March 2020.
^NDXT data by YCharts
Once the market hit bottom on March 23, 2020, shares of AMD and Applied Materials rallied furiously until the end of 2021, generating eye-popping returns for investors in the process. If you'd invested $1,000 in each on March 23, 2020, you would have $3,920 and $3,450, respectively, at the end of December 2021.
AMAT data by YCharts
It wouldn't be surprising to see these tech stocks repeat their impressive feats in the next bull market, especially considering that the demand for their products and solutions is going to remain robust for a long time to come. That's why it would make sense for investors to accumulate shares of AMD and Applied Materials while they're down and are available for relatively cheaper valuations.
AMD, for instance, is trading at 45 times trailing earnings and 28 times forward earnings. When compared to the five-year average trailing multiple of 109 and forward earnings multiple of 57, the stock is quite cheap.
Applied Materials, on the other hand, is trading at 18 times trailing earnings and 15 times forward earnings. These multiples are in line with the company's five-year average earnings multiples, but it is worth noting that Applied Materials had a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 24 in 2021. So, just like AMD, Applied Materials stock is also on the affordable side right now.
However, these companies may not be available at such attractive valuations in the future given the pace at which they're growing.

Secular catalysts should help these tech stocks fly higher
AMD finished 2021 with $16.4 billion in revenue, up 68% from the prior year. The company's earnings shot up 117% to $2.79 per share last year. That terrific growth was driven by solid demand for AMD's processors, which are used in several applications ranging from personal computers to data centers to supercomputers to gaming consoles.
AMD's guidance indicates that its outstanding growth is set to continue in 2022. The company has guided for 31% revenue growth in 2022 to $21.5 billion. However, AMD could do better than that, as the company was originally anticipating its 2021 revenue to increase 37%, and its actual growth came out to be much higher.
There are a few concrete reasons why AMD could exceed its expectations once again this year. For example, the company is on track to benefit from an increase in sales of gaming consoles. Microsoft and Sony use AMD's semi-custom chips in their consoles. Sony sold 17.3 million units of the PlayStation 5 (PS5) by the end of 2021, while Microsoft's latest Xbox consoles reportedly moved 12 million units by the end of last year.
Sony's PS5 is expected to hit an installed base of 67 million units by 2024, while Microsoft's current-generation Xbox consoles could have an installed base of 44 million units by then. Throw in the fact that AMD is now powering another handheld console, and its semi-custom business seems built for solid growth in the long run.
The server processor business will be another key growth driver. That's because AMD has been consistently taking share away from rival Intel in this market. AMD reportedly had a 10.7% share of the server processor market at the end of 2021. Analysts expect its share to go as high as 25% in the server processor space.
Applied Materials, meanwhile, is benefiting from the semiconductor boom as it supplies manufacturing equipment and services that help foundries make chips. The company finished fiscal 2021 with record revenue of $23 billion, up 34% from the prior year. Applied Materials maintained its growth momentum in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, with revenue increasing 21% year-over-year to $6.27 billion and adjusted earnings jumping 36% to $1.89 per share.
Applied Materials clocked such impressive growth despite supply chain constraints, and exited the quarter with a record order backlog of $8 billion. The company expects spending on wafer fabrication equipment to increase 15% in 2022 to $100 billion. More importantly, management anticipates that Applied Materials will grow at a faster pace than the broader market, and carry a significant backlog into 2023 as well.
With annual spending on wafer fabrication equipment expected to hit as much as $120 billion by 2025 according to third-party estimates, Applied Materials is operating in a market that's built for long-term growth. This explains why analysts are expecting Applied Materials to clock 16.5% annual earnings growth for the next five years -- though the company could do better by sustaining its current pace on account of the sizable end-market opportunity it is sitting on.
Time to buy
Both AMD and Applied Materials could regain their mojo and turn out to be top growth stocks in the long run. We have already seen the capability of these stocks to bounce back big time following a market correction, which is why investors should consider using their relatively cheap valuations to buy shares and set their portfolios up for terrific gains before the next rally arrives.

2022-03-19 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Meta Platforms vs. Nvidia,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-meta-platforms-vs.-nvidia,,,"Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: FB) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) both seemed like unstoppable growth stocks in 2021. After the initial COVID lockdowns, a surge in advertising growth drove Meta's stock to an all-time high of $382.18 last September. Nvidia stock peaked around the same time, reaching $333.76 in November 2021 as the chipmaker dazzled investors with robust sales of gaming and data center GPUs.
February brought that growth to a grinding halt for both companies, badly burning investors who had chased earlier rallies. After mixed fourth-quarter earnings and weak guidance in the year ahead due to its shifting business model, Meta stock now sits near $200. Nvidia stock has similarly stumbled, dipping to the mid $240s amid concerns about decelerating growth, peaking gross margins, and the ongoing chip shortage. Nvidia's plan to buy Arm Holdings and become a chip design powerhouse failed, disappointing investors.
Should investors take the contrarian view and jump on opportunities to buy either tech stock at a steep discount? Let's take a fresh look at both companies to decide.
Image source: Getty Images.
What happened to Meta?
Recent years have been good to Meta. While its advertising business struggled at the onset of the pandemic, the company bounced back in the second half of the year, with revenue rising 22% to $85.97 billion in 2020. That same year, Meta expanded operating margins by four percentage points to 38% and increased earnings per share (EPS) by 57% year over year.
Meta had good fortune in 2021 too: revenue increased 37% to $117.93 billion as businesses continued ramping back up ad spending. Following 2020's trend, Meta's operating margin expanded to 40% and EPS jumped 36%.
Those past numbers look fantastic, but Meta anticipates a slowdown in 2022. The company expects revenue in the first quarter of 2022 to represent 3% to 11% year-over-year growth. Meta primarily blames this halt on Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iOS privacy update, which enables users to opt-out of data-tracking features. The company also anticipates increased competition from short video apps like ByteDance's TikTok.
To keep pace with TikTok, Meta plans to prioritize short video content on Facebook and Instagram Reels. That shift, though, will throttle near-term revenue and earnings growth as videos are difficult to monetize. Meta also plans to pour more cash into its unprofitable Reality Labs division, which focuses on virtual reality and the metaverse. This segment may prove promising in the future, but it's currently burning money: in 2021, Reality Labs racked up an operating loss of $10.1 billion while generating just $2.27 billion in revenue.
Investors are spooked by this combination of slow growth and high spending. Meta's sliding stock price reflects analyst expectations that company revenue will grow just 12% this year while earnings slide 10%. The future, though, isn't all bleak: assuming Meta overcomes near-term challenges, analysts expect revenue and earnings alike to rise about 17% in 2023.
What happened to Nvidia?
Pandemic trends proved a boon for Nvidia: in fiscal year 2021, (ended January 2021), revenue surged 53% to $16.68 billion. Sales of gaming GPUs jumped as people played more video games while stuck at home. Demand for cloud services increased as people worked from home, streamed media, and played video games, causing data centers to purchase more high-end GPUs to process AI and machine learning tasks.
It's no surprise then that Nvidia's adjusted gross margin expanded from 62.5% to 65.6% over its 2021 fiscal year, with its adjusted EPS soaring 73%.
The following year, Nvidia's revenue continued to grow, hitting $24.91 billion by the end of January. What's more, adjusted gross margin rose to 66.8% and adjusted EPS grew by 78%. Again, gaming and data center GPUs did most of the heavy lifting. Competitors could barely keep up: according to JPR, during the fourth quarter of 2021, Nvidia controlled 81% of the discrete GPU market, while its rival AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) held a 19% share.
Those growth rates are surely solid, but analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings to slow this year as the market's appetite for new gaming and data center GPUs wanes. Predictions have the company growing revenue by 29% and earnings by 26%. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2024, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings to decelerate further, growing just 17% and 20% respectively as the upgrade cycle continues to cool.
Other unpredictable headwinds await on the horizon and could impact growth. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is launching new discrete GPUs to compete against Nvidia and AMD, which is sure to bite into both companies' market share. The use of Nvidia's gaming GPUs to mine cryptocurrencies could pin the company's growth on the volatile crypto market. The ongoing chip shortage threatens to cap Nvidia's supply of available chips.
The valuations and verdict
Bearing this in mind, which bargain stock is the better buy? Examining valuation offers insight into which company currently offers the most bang for your buck. Meta trades at just 16 times forward earnings, making it the cheapest FAANG stock by a wide margin. Despite its recent dip, Nvidia is still one of the priciest semiconductor stocks, trading at 44 times forward earnings.
Both of these companies are solid long-term investments, but I believe that Meta's discount valuation and less cyclical business model make it a more compelling investment than Nvidia. Nvidia is still growing at a healthy clip, but its high valuation will hamper possible returns.

NEW ORLEANS (Reuters Breakingviews) - Lina Khan is in New Orleans, without actually being there. At the annual Tulane Corporate Law Institute in the Big Easy this week, high-profile merger lawyers and bankers took aim at regulators, specifically Khan, the head of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. They may feel haunted by her presence but, in reality, mergers are mostly experiencing rational checks and balances.
The conference kicked off on Thursday with a speech from Gordon Dyal, a former Goldman Sachs banker with an eponymous advisory firm. He couldn’t remember, he said, when there had been an FTC chair with “such bias.” Following up was Melissa Sawyer, partner at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, who noted that “our leaders prefer companies grow organically” rather than through deals. Paul Weiss’s Scott Barshay, who also noted what he perceived as regulatory bias, sees the technology sector taking the brunt of it.
But a focus on Khan neglects other factors that make deals harder to do. Pandemic and now war have heightened sensitivities to those risks, and partners in mergers want protection against them. Material adverse change clauses, the fine print that can allow buyers and sellers to wriggle out of deals in some circumstances, have become more descriptive and longer, causing dealmaking to slow down. 
And while watchdogs are for sure being less cooperative these days, parts of the critique are unconvincing. Dan Burch, chief executive of consulting firm MacKenzie Partners, is concerned his clients might be at a disadvantage with what's known as universal proxy voting. That's a Securities and Exchange Commission effort to streamline the process by which shareholders choose directors, particularly when there are candidates rivaling a company's own nominees, and in the 21st century it's a no-brainer. So are the regulator's proposed changes to the speed with which activist investors and others would have to report certain levels of shareholding – a push which John Coates, the SEC’s former director for corporate finance, said would be a battle.
In any event, the truth is in the numbers. Both dealmakers and activist investors are off to a busy start this year. Microsoft’s $69 billion bid for Activision Blizzard, Frontier Airlines' deal with Spirit Airlines, and Intel’s deal with Tower Semiconductor have all been announced, and Amazon.com's purchase of movie studio MGM closed this week despite Khan's pre-FTC work suggesting the e-commerce giant acts in anticompetitive ways.
Meanwhile there are cage-rattling campaigns under way at big names like Hasbro, McDonald’s and Bed Bath & Beyond. Dyal pleaded that the lawyers find ways to get transactions done more quickly. Chances are, the Tulane folks are on the same page.

Unilever’s stock price has been rising in recent years due to its high revenue growth and strong cash flow. Its shares are also relatively cheap, with a forward P/E ratio of 17.12 times. In addition, Unilever is one of the best dividend stocks and it has an excellent dividend yield. It has a strong balance sheet, steady cash flow, and long-term brand strength that give it all the validity it needs.
Citigroup Inc. (C)

Citigroup provides financial services, such as banking, credit cards, private equity, and insurance products and services to consumers, small businesses, corporations, and large corporations worldwide.
The company has expanded its focus to include wealth management services, as well. They provide everything from advisory and private banking to government bonds and international investments.
This company has been around for more than 200 years and has made many changes throughout its existence. The company has changed over time by adding new technologies to its business. Due to this approach towards innovation, Citigroup is currently considered one of the top Wall Street firms in the world.
After their latest earnings report, Citigroup shares are trading at a deeply discounted rate. This is because of their declining profits in the fourth quarter (Q4). Citigroup’s net income decreased year-over-year (YOY) by 26%. If a dip in net income occurs, it will shake anyone trying to make serious money.

Intel is a stock that has been on the rise. It has been in the top 10 stores for years and has experienced a lot of growth.

Still, it also makes data center processors, graphics processing units (GPUs), mobile processors, embedded processors, and more recently, artificial intelligence (AI) chips for use in personal computers and servers.
Some analysts believe Intel is falling behind rivals AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). In recent years, it has lost a lot of market share to those two companies. However, with the launch of new chips, there is hope that we will see a comeback soon.

For over 130 years, Caterpillar has been the leading heavy construction and mining equipment manufacturer.
Caterpillar is one of the most recognizable brands in the world, with its iconic yellow logo on a black background. They have been known to create high-quality, durable products used in various industries, including construction, mining, forestry, transportation, and farming.

The company has maintained its position by making good-quality, durable, and reliable products.
However, despite its top-notch brand, the stock has performed sluggishly in the last few years. That is because attention was on growth stocks. However, the market sentiment is changing after the recent corrections. Investors are now returning to safer stocks, and CAT is among the best. On top of all this, the company counts itself among the Dividend Aristocrats.

Usually, all the focus is on Home Depot. It is a bigger brand and has 2,300 stores, while Lowe’s is a bit behind. However, Lowe’s is a better dividend stock than Home Depot. The latter also pays out dividends, but they are not as high as Lowe’s, which has hiked its payout every year for more than 50 years. With this in mind, it is certainly a solid investment.

10 stocks we like better than Intel
When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*
They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Intel wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of March 3, 2022
Billy Duberstein: They recently had an investor analyst day where they outline their long-term plans. This transformation is going to take heavy investment for the next three years pretty much. Intel's being downgraded. They guided for slight revenue growth in 2022. But look at the EPS. Their EPS is going to go from $5.47 down to $3.55 this year. Revenue is growing but their expenditures are going way up. That investment phase is going to last through 2024, where they're targeting mid- to high-single-digit growth but lower margins and basically, they're going to spend all of their free cash flow on their foundry business and catching up to TSM.
I don't know if anybody watched the State of the Union but Joe Biden spent a good amount of time talking about the new plant that Intel is going to develop in Ohio hopefully and likely with government incentives. It's going to be just a ton of spending. 2025 and beyond is where it gets interesting. They're going to tie it 10-12% revenue growth. They're going to get back to margin expansion and free cash flow margins around 20%. That's still a little lower, I think, than they used to generate when they were just making PC chips. But they will be a better growth profile because they'll will be a player in the foundry market.
They're also reconfiguring the business into six new segments. Client, which is PCs and desktops; data center; network, and edge, which is actually different from data center, which is interesting. Accelerated computing and graphics. That'll be their FPGAs and accelerators from Alterra and the new graphics chip that they're coming out with. Intel Foundry Services and then Mobileye. They're going to plan to use a smart capital approach, which means they're going to try to get help from customer prepayments, which I'm guessing they're going to give discounts for prepayments. It de-risks the tremendous capital expenditure they're going to make.
One other interesting thing is that they're also teaming up with Brookfield Asset Management, which I think is a Fool favorite in the infrastructure and clean energy space. They are an asset manager. They're going to try to get financing from them in conjunction with renewable energy on-site. Then they're going to use Mobileye proceeds and then also some outside foundry help from TSMC. I posted a link.
One quote that stood out to me was this, ""Intel remains on track to reclaim transistor performance per watt leadership by 2025."" They're hoping to catch up and surpass TSM by 2025. Despite the plan, I think Intel was just downgraded today by an analyst. Basically said, this plan looks good, we completely agree with Pat Gelsinger this is what they should do but this could be dead money for two or three years. It's basically an all-in approach where they're betting the company on this big foundry project and then Mobileye information at the bottom. But this is just a real quick cursory glance. There's a lot of in-depth stuff on the Analyst Day site, which I think everybody should read who is interested in the space. It will give you a better understanding of the whole industry. They talk about where Moore's Law stands today and the big computing trends of the next decade. Keep in mind it's coming from a biased source in Intel but it's still probably a lot of good stuff in there. I would go to their Investor Relations page and look at the Investor Day. I think it's from Feb. 14 or 15 or something like that.
Jose Najarro: It's pretty recent, I think just two weeks ago. One of my favorite things there was just the overall growth that they're expected to see in datacenter chips. Obviously it's cool to see, hey, we are going to innovate. Any company can say that, we're going to be the best chips, but at least they give us a roadmap. Normally Intel is one that has missed those timelines before. Hopefully that changes with the new CEO.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

As interest rates rise, dividend stocks will be one area in the stock market that can retain value. This especially applies to companies that can afford to pay their dividends with cash flow.
I wanted to find seven dividend stocks that seem poised to do well this year. There are several reasons a company might have a good outlook. It might have strong earnings and/or cash flow, a potential dividend hike, some sort of upside catalyst or undervalued valuation metrics.
7 Sports Betting Stocks to Buy as March Madness Tips Off
Here are the featured dividend stocks:
Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM)
AT&T (NYSE:T)
Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ)
Walmart (NYSE:WMT)
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)
Dividend Stocks: Exxon Mobil (XOM)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Exxon Mobil has a very attractive dividend yield. Its $3.52 dividend per share (DPS) represents 4.2% of its price of $77.81 as of March 16.
This is easily affordable by the oil giant since in 2021 it made $5.39 per share, well over the dividend payment.
In addition, analysts estimate that in 2022, EPS could rise to $8.05. That puts XOM stock on a cheap forward P/E of just 9.7 times earnings. That allows Exxon to keep on paying its huge dividend.
On top of this, as I recently wrote about, Exxon recently started a new $10 billion share buyback program. All three of these factors — the high yield, low P/E, and share buyback program — make XOM one of the best dividend stocks.
AT&T (T)
Source: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock
I have written several articles recently showing how AT&T will actually have a decently high yield. This is after the company spins off its Warner Media division into a new public company called Warner Bros Discovery (WBD).
I explained in this article how the new dividend yield can be estimated. At the time, the stock was at $23.19. T stock opened at $23.15 on March 16 and has mostly hovered around $23 recently.
Let’s use $23 as an example price. First, we deduct approximately $5.85 as AT&T will no longer own Warner Media assets. That lowers the post-spinoff price to $17.15. Next, we can determine that the new DPS payment will be $1.11 annually. That brings the new dividend yield to 6.5%.
This makes AT&T still an attractive dividend-paying company, especially since management says this will be no more than about 40% of its post-spinoff cash flow. That implies that they can keep on paying the dividend, even though it’s lower than the $2.08 DPS payment annually before then.

Look for AT&T stock to do well once it spins off the WBD assets, sometime in early Q2.
Dividend Stocks: Intel Corp (INTC)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Intel recently raised its DPS by 5% to $1.46 when it announced fourth-quarter (Q4) and 2021 earnings. Therefore, at today’s price of $45.30, the new dividend yield is 3.2%. This makes it very attractive, as it has not been at this yield for a while.
The average yield over the past 5 years has been 2.48%. That is much lower than today and implies that INTC stock could be worth much more.
One way to figure this is to divide the present dividend of $1.46 by the 2.48% average yield over the last 5 years. That produces a price of $58.87, which is 30% higher than today’s price.
Moreover, Intel is also cheap on a forward P/E basis, as it trades for just 13.9 times forward earnings.
So given its valuation, it looks like INTC stock could be a good investment for the long term.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com
Microsoft reported a stellar Q4-quarter earnings report on Jan. 25. It shows that the software developer and cloud infrastructure company can produce large amounts of free cash flow (FCF).
Moreover, Microsoft pays a $2.48 per share annual dividend. At today’s price of $276.44, this gives it a dividend yield of 0.9%. That may not seem like much, but remember that the company is also growing earnings quickly, which helps push the stock up.
In addition, it also buys back its own stock, which lowers its dividend costs over time. In turn, that leaves room for Microsoft to keep raising the dividend, especially as its FCF keeps growing.
For example, its free cash flow — which is operating cash flow minus capital expenditure — was $8.6 billion. That represents a very high percentage of its revenue. With $51.7 billion in sales produced during the quarter, Microsoft generated 17% of that in FCF.
7 Growth Stocks That Trade at Attractive Valuations
This implies Microsoft could make $34 billion in FCF based on 17% of a $200 billion revenue forecast for the year to June 2022. Using a 1% FCF yield, that brings its target value $3.4 trillion, or 55% over today’s market value. In other words, MSFT stock potentially has a 55% upside from here.
Dividend Stocks: Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)
Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com
Domino’s Pizza recently announced raised its quarterly dividend by 17% to $1.10, or $4.40 annually. So, at today’s price of $386.18, the new yield is 1.14%. Moreover, this is more than affordable by the company as it made a diluted EPS of $13.60 in 2021.
Domino’s has 36.67 million diluted shares outstanding, so its dividend payments will cost $161.3 million. Its free cash flow was higher than this dividend cost at $560 million. In other words, free cash flow covers the dividend by more than 3 times.
Moreover, Domino’s also has a strong share repurchase program. In 2021 alone it bought back $1.32 billion of shares, and it has $704.1 million left in its share buyback program. That will help raise the company’s earnings per share and also lower the ongoing dividend costs. Both of these things will help push DPZ stock higher over the coming year.
Walmart (WMT)
Source: fotomak / Shutterstock.com
Walmart recently raised its dividend to $2.24 on an annual basis. This gives the stock an annualized dividend yield of 1.6%.
Moreover, this is the 49th year in a row that the company has raised the annual dividend, which is paid out on a quarterly basis. Interestingly, Walmart is one of the few companies that makes its quarterly dividend declarations ahead of time for the next year.
Investors expect Walmart to make at least $6.73 per share on average for the year ending Jan. 2023, according to Seeking Alpha. That more than covers the $2.24 dividend (the payout ratio is just 33%). The company produced $11 billion in FCF last year, but its dividend cost was just $6.15 billion in 2021. So its FCF more than covers the dividend at Walmart, even though they declared it in advance for one year.
7 Dividend Stocks to Finance Your Golden Years
Walmart has also been buying back its shares — almost $10 billion worth in the last year. Based on this analysts have higher price targets for WMT stock for the next year. The average price target of 27 analysts in the Refinitiv survey on Yahoo! Finance is $165.29. That represents an upside of almost 15% for the stock.

Apple’s stellar earnings for the first quarter, released on Jan. 27, will likely lead to a higher dividend per share declaration after March. It posted an all-time revenue record of $123.9 billion, up 11% year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.10.
Apple also posted a huge gain in its quarterly free cash flow of $44.16 billion as seen on page 3 of its report. This more than covered the $3.73 billion in dividend payments as well as $20.49 billion in share repurchases during the quarter. That is slightly less than 55% of its total $44.163 billion in FCF. So, clearly, Apple could easily increase its dividend and share buyback activity.
In the last four quarters, Apple paid out 22 cents each quarter. Apple usually increases its quarterly dividend payment after 4 payments at the same level.
Therefore, investors can expect, in April, an announcement that the quarterly dividend will rise at least 10%. I estimate Apple will raise it to 24 cents per quarter or so. That will raise it to 96 cents per year. At today’s price of $157.05, that raises the yield to 0.61%.
Moreover, it could also increase its share buyback program. On page 11 of its 10-Q filing, Apple has now spent almost all of its $315 billion in authorized share repurchases. As of Dec. 25, it had spent $274.5 billion of this total. That leaves just $40.5 billion. If it has already spent over $20 billion as it did in Q4 during Q1, this leaves less than one quarter in share buyback authorization.
That is why I think Apple will soon declare both a dividend increase and a new share buyback program.

2022-03-17 00:00:00+00:00,Should First Trust Value Line Dividend ETF (FVD) Be on Your Investing Radar?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-first-trust-value-line-dividend-etf-fvd-be-on-your-investing-radar-0,,,"Looking for broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market? You should consider the First Trust Value Line Dividend ETF (FVD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 08/19/2003.
The fund is sponsored by First Trust Advisors. It has amassed assets over $12.57 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.
Why Large Cap Value
Companies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.
Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.
Costs
Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.70%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.82%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Utilities sector--about 20.70% of the portfolio. Industrials and Financials round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Intel Corporation (INTC) accounts for about 0.52% of total assets, followed by L3harris Technologies Inc. (LHX) and New Jersey Resources Corporation (NJR).
The top 10 holdings account for about 5.13% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
FVD seeks to match the performance of the Value Line Dividend Index before fees and expenses. The Value Line Dividend Index is a modified equal dollar weighted index comprised of U.S. exchange listed securities of companies that pay above-average dividends and have potential for capital appreciation.
The ETF has lost about -3.41% so far this year and was up about 11.55% in the last one year (as of 03/17/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $37.35 and $43.09.
The ETF has a beta of 0.81 and standard deviation of 21.76% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 204 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
First Trust Value Line Dividend ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, FVD is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.
The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $57.17 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $99.63 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.19% and VTV charges 0.04%.
Bottom-Line
While an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.

2022-03-17 00:00:00+00:00,Nasdaq 100 Bear Market: 3 Stocks That Are Now Screaming Buys,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nasdaq-100-bear-market%3A-3-stocks-that-are-now-screaming-buys,,,"It's been a rough couple of months for tech stocks and growth-seeking investors. All of the major indexes, many of which have been led higher by growth stocks, have officially entered correction territory.
And things have been even tougher for the Nasdaq 100. This index, comprising the 100 largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange, ended Monday down more than 20% from its all-time high. In other words, it's officially in a bear market for the first time in two years.
While steep drops in market-leading indexes can be unnerving, they're historically a great time to put your money to work. Eventually (key word!) every correction and bear market throughout history has been wiped away by a bull market rally.
Image source: Getty Images.
With the Nasdaq 100 bear market now a reality, the following three components stand out as screaming buys.
CrowdStrike Holdings
The first beaten-down tech stock that's begging to be bought by investors is the premier name in cybersecurity, CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD).
The beauty of cybersecurity is that it has evolved into a basic necessity over the past two decades. Robots and hackers have grown more sophisticated at stealing data and information over time, and they're certainly not going to take a day off just because Wall Street had a bad day or inflation is rising in the United States. With businesses moving more data than ever onto the cloud, third-party providers like CrowdStrike are being leaned on to a large degree.
CrowdStrike focuses on end-user security. It has separated itself from the competition with its cloud-native Falcon platform, which relies on artificial intelligence (AI) to grow smarter at recognizing and responding to potential threats over time. With the platform overseeing around 1 trillion daily events, it's getting plenty of practice in identifying threats.
The proof is in the pudding as to whether CrowdStrike's security platform is loved by businesses. Over the past five years, the company's subscriber count has skyrocketed from just 450 to 16,325 at the end of its fiscal year. What's more, it's working on a 16-quarter streak of dollar-based net retention rates of at least 120%. In simpler terms, it means existing clients have spent at least 20% more year over year for every quarter over the past four years.
Getting existing clients to spend more has always been the most impressive thing about CrowdStrike. In five years, the percentage of clients with four or more cloud subscriptions has jumped from the high single digits to 69%, as of the end of fiscal 2022.
Even though CrowdStrike isn't cheap in a true fundamental sense, its superior growth rate and exceptionally high adjusted subscription gross margin make it a screaming buy on any significant weakness.

Baidu
Another stock that's a screaming buy with the Nasdaq 100 in bear market territory is China-based internet content giant Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU).
In recent weeks, China-based stocks listed in the U.S. have taken it on the chin. There's concern about rapidly spreading cases of COVID-19 in China and how that might affect the domestic and global economy.
There are also renewed worries about the ongoing listing of Chinese stocks in the United States. Although the Securities and Exchange Commission recently cited five China-based companies that could face delisting, Baidu wasn't one of the names on the list.
It wouldn't be on this list of screaming buys if I felt either of these concerns had any teeth to them. While China's zero-COVID policy could slow growth in the near term, I don't view COVID as having a material impact on Baidu's long-term growth strategy.
Since China is such a unique and controlled market, Baidu's dominance of internet search should remain unmatched. According to GlobalStats, the company was responsible for 84% of China's internet search in February, and hit nearly 87% in November. The next-closest competitor is Microsoft's Bing at a mere 5.5% share in February. This makes Baidu the logical go-to for businesses that want to advertise, and that should afford the company excellent ad pricing power.
What's arguably even more exciting is the company's non-advertising revenue, which grew by 63% in the fourth quarter from the prior-year period. This segment is focused on cloud services and AI, which offer a faster sustainable growth rate and better long-term margins than the advertising side of the business.
Thanks to the cloud and AI, Baidu has a real shot at sustaining double-digit sales growth. With shares of the company approaching a multiple of just 10 times Wall Street's forward-year consensus earnings, I believe now is the time to pounce.

Intel
The third screaming buy during the Nasdaq 100 bear market is semiconductor behemoth Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
I know: Intel is about as boring a company as I could probably have put on this list. It's been growing at a relatively slow rate compared to other semiconductor companies, and in recent quarters has been hurt by supply chain concerns. Nevertheless, Intel is incredibly profitable, maintains significant legacy market share, and is investing in a number of high-growth initiatives that could begin paying big dividends by mid-decade.
When I speak of the company's legacy operations, I'm primarily talking about the chips it supplies in personal computers (PC) and the solutions it provides to data centers. Though data center demand should increase as the world becomes more digitized, these are two segments where sales growth will be modest, at best. But that hasn't stopped Intel from generating massive operating cash flow from these segments or maintaining its dominant position as the supplier of PC processing chips.
What's far more important is that the operating cash flow from these segments is allowing Intel to invest in faster-growing channels. For instance, Intel generated $4 billion from its Internet-of-Things (IoT) Group last year, which represented a year-over-year increase of 33%. Although some of this growth was simply Intel's IoT business bouncing back from pandemic lows, IoT will become increasingly important as next-gen vehicles hit the roads and next-gen appliances find their way into consumers' homes.
Investors would also be wise to keep their eyes on the upcoming Mobileye initial public offering. The company makes driver-assist chips for newer vehicles. Intel acquired Mobileye for $15.3 billion in 2017 and could net a hearty return on its investment given the 43% sales growth Mobileye reported in 2021 from the prior-year period.
Intel may not be an exciting investment like CrowdStrike, but at less than 12 times Wall Street's forecast earnings for 2023, it's a screaming bargain.

2022-03-16 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Expands Ryzen Portfolio With New Gaming Processor,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-expands-ryzen-portfolio-with-new-gaming-processor,,,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD recently announced the launch of its new gaming processor AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D. The new processor is expected to expand the portfolio of Ryzen line-up.

The new AMD Ryzen 7 processor is the first of its kind to feature AMD’s 3D V-Cache technology, which is anticipated to increase gaming performance by 15% compared with other processors without the cache technology.

AMD also announced the new Ryzen 5 and 3 series processors and expanded chipset compatibility to cater to different customer bases across various price segments.

The new processor will be available in the market from Apr 20, starting at $449.
New Ryzen Model to Drive AMD Top Line
AMD has been riding on robust performance from the Computing and Graphics segment. The fourth-quarter 2021 results are a testament to the same. It has been benefiting from strong sales of its Ryzen server processors, courtesy of the increasing proliferation of AI and Machine Learning in industries like gaming and supercomputing domain.

In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Computing and Graphics segment reported revenues of $2.6 billion, reflecting an increase of 32% year over year. The upside can be attributed to higher Ryzen processor sales.

This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has returned 32.3% in the past year compared with the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s growth of 4.3%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector declined 7.4%.
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Quote
However, in the traditional computing market, which generates a chunk of its revenues, AMD is up against Intel’s INTC strong market position. With Intel systems so well entrenched, there is an obvious preference for system integrators to choose Intel processors over AMD.

So far, Intel processors have exhibited superior functionality, enabling the company to exercise pricing power. In the past, AMD was forced to resort to penetration pricing, which severely impacted its profitability. Now that it is getting into the higher-range segment, it is facing very stiff competition from Intel.

AMD faces significant competition from NVIDIA NVDA in the GPU market. NVIDIA’s GPUs are rapidly benefiting from the proliferation of AI. By applying its GPUs in AI models, the company is expanding its base in the other untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing, which will support its earnings and revenues.

A steady ramp-up of the new products has been enabling the company to gain a competitive edge over the likes of AMD and Intel, and widening its market share.
Another Stock to Consider
While AMD is a lucrative stock to buy, here is another stock to consider in the broader computer and technology sector.

Arista Networks ANET currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Arista shares have returned 67.5% in the past year against the Zacks Communication - Components’ and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s fall of 3.9% and 7.4%, respectively.

5 Stocks Set to Double
Each was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2021. Previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.
Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.

2022-03-16 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel, Micron CEOs to testify at U.S. Senate hearing on chip making",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-micron-ceos-to-testify-at-u.s.-senate-hearing-on-chip-making,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Reuters) - The chief executives of Intel INTC.O and Micron MU.O will testify on March 23 before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee as the industry and lawmakers make the case for $52 billion in U.S. subsidies for semiconductor chips manufacturing.
The chief executive of truckmaker Paccar Inc PCAR.O will also testify at the hearing, which will look at vulnerabilities in semiconductor supply chains and the sector's connection with American competitiveness.
Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell announced the hearing on Wednesday. Reuters reported the planned hearing earlier.
Two decades ago, the United States produced nearly 40% of all chips and today it accounts for only 12% of global production, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said.
Last week, President Joe Biden met with executives of chipmakers including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS, Micron Technology Inc and other companies as part of an effort to push the U.S. Congress to fund subsidies to chipmakers to ease the semiconductor crunch.
The Senate in June and the House in February approved the $52 billion in subsidies in separate bills. ""Get it to my desk as quickly as you can,"" Biden said last week.
The bills take different approaches to addressing U.S. competitiveness with China on a wide range of issues, as well on trade and some climate provisions.
A persistent industry-wide shortage of chips has disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some firms to scale back production.
Cantwell said it was urgent to act, noting the chip shortage cost the global auto industry an estimated $210 billion in revenue in 2021 and a loss of production of 7.7 million cars.
""It's 30% to 50% cheaper to build a semiconductor foundry in Asia than in the United States, mostly because of foreign government investment... We can't wait,"" she said.
Intel said it was pleased to have the opportunity to ""advocate for the importance of investing in American semiconductor leadership.""
In January, Intel said it would invest up to $100 billion to build potentially the world's largest chip-making complex in Ohio.
Micron said in October it plans to spend $150 billion over the next decade globally on leading-edge memory chips manufacturing and research and development. Micron said funding from Congress ""would open the door to new industry investments.""
SEMI, an industry association, said in a letter to Congress that chips funding ""is vital to provide a foundational incentive for investments in domestic design and manufacturing facilities for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment.""
Critics like Senator Bernie Sanders question why Congress would give subsidies to a large profitable industry.

2022-03-16 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Vs. AMD: Which Stock Has the Best Competitive Prospects?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-vs.-amd%3A-which-stock-has-the-best-competitive-prospects,,,"Intel (INTC) used to be the dominant CPU force by a long distance but that is no longer the case. Under Lisa Su’s astute leadership, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has made huge strides over the past several years; by offering superior products and taking advantage of manufacturing issues and product shortages at Intel, the company has considerably closed the gap between the two chip giants.
Intel, however, has put a new CEO in charge and has been hatching a comeback plan. The company even made the case in its recent analyst day that they believe the production of TSMC’s 3nm chip is a year late (TSMC has a close working relationship with AMD), which could mean that when Intel launches Granite Rapids on I3 in 2024, AMD will still be on the N5 TSMC node.
“If that’s the case,” says Raymond James’ Chris Caso, “then it would suggest that INTC would have process superiority in 2024, not in 2025, as Intel has previously targeted.” This will also give Intel some “wiggle room” if required.
But is that really the case? AMD, for their part, have stated they have not encountered any of the delays INTC has noted, and that their roadmap is “consistent with TSMC’s roadmap.”
For the record, TSMC has said that by 4Q22, the N3 will be in “volume production,” and by 1Q23 should start generating revenue.
So, what’s Caso’s take on the matter? “Our view is that if Intel executes flawlessly against their process roadmap (which is far from assured) Intel does have the potential to get close to TSMC/AMD’s transistor performance by 2024/25,” the 5-star analyst said. “But even if that were to happen, we still don’t think Intel would be able to maintain their currently dominant market share in client and server.”
What Caso expects will happen over time, is a market which will “move toward a sustained duopoly.” The analyst believes that even flawless execution on Intel’s part is unlikely to stop AMD’s continued market share gains.
To this end, Caso’s rating for AMD stays an Outperform (i.e. Buy) backed by a $160 price target. The implication for investors? Upside potential of 40%. (To watch Caso’s track record, click here)
The Street’s average target comes in just under Caso’s objective; at $154.24, the figure suggests one-year gains of ~35%. Overall, the analyst consensus rates this stock a Moderate Buy, based on 15 Buys vs. 6 Holds. (See AMD stock analysis on TipRanks)

U.S. stock futures are in the green in early morning trading at the midweek mark. This seems to be the case as investors respond to a slightly lower than expected read from February’s producer price index (PPI). In brief, the PPI rose 0.8% throughout the month, just below consensus economist estimates of a 0.9% increase. More importantly, most would also be closely eyeing the Federal Reserve for its latest policy update later today. This would include the Fed’s latest decision on interest rate hikes and its Summary of Economic Projections, or “dot plot” for short.
Providing an overview on all this is Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) Investment Management’s chief investment officer, Michael Kushma. He believes that “the dot plot should increase given all the news that we’ve had between December and today.” Providing his reasoning for this, Kushma continues, “We’ve got a strong labor market, higher than expected inflation. Oil prices, energy prices, commodity prices are much higher now than they were back then. All of it suggests that the Fed needs to get going, and that they need to up the dot plot. So, I think they’ll talk about the mean, maybe five rate hikes in 2022, and a couple more in 2023.” On top of that, there is also no shortage of stock market news as well. As of 6:18 a.m. ET, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures are trading higher by 1.10%, 1.29%, and 1.87% respectively.
Intel To Invest $36 Billion In Chip Manufacturing Operations In Europe
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is among the top head turners in the tech space today. For the most part, this is thanks to the company’s latest announcements regarding its European strategy. As of yesterday, Intel is now planning to shell out over $36 billion to boost its chipmaking capacity in Europe. This move would be in line with the company’s transition toward becoming more self-reliant when it comes to producing semiconductors. In the larger scheme of things, Intel’s current play is not all that surprising. This is the case as global chip shortages are persisting and chip giants rush to bolster their production lines.
In detail, among the key focuses of this round of investments is constructing two new factories in Magdeburg, Germany. According to Intel, the facilities will employ its cutting-edge chip manufacturing tech. The likes of which will help in the creation of chips that are less than two nanometers in width. By the company’s current estimates, the construction of these chip plants will begin in the first half of 2023. Should things go smoothly on the construction and regulatory fronts, Intel expects the factories to be production-ready by 2027.
Explaining its choice of location, Intel believes that Germany is a suitable place to establish a new “Silicon Junction,” mega-site. The company cites the robust talent and infrastructure at hand in the region. Alongside this, there is also an impressive network of suppliers and customers as well. Moreover, Intel is also considering a series of R&D projects across France, Ireland, Poland, Spain, and Italy. Topping all of this, the European Commission’s executive arm also recently launched a new European Chips Act last month. In essence, Europe is enabling another $16.45 billion in public and private investments into the industry through 2030.

Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg Teases Launch Of NFTs On Instagram
At the same time, tech companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: FB) are currently eyeing the next frontier of blockchain tech. Namely, according to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Instagram is actively working on introducing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to the platform. At the South by Southwest conference yesterday, Zuckerberg revealed that NFTs are coming to Instagram in the “near term.” Although the CEO did not reveal Meta’s entire plan for it, this could see FB stock gain attention from tech investors. After all, NFTs essentially serve as another means of monetizing content digitally. With Meta’s experience in the online marketplace business, such a move would make sense as it appeals to younger audiences.
For one thing, this would not be the first time Meta has been linked to NFTs. Back in January, a report from the Financial Times wrote that the company is developing plans to let users create and sell NFTs. Officially, Zuckerberg only spilled the tea on Instagram’s possible NFT plans. However, it would not be a far cry to assume that Meta would be keen to bring similar services to its massive Facebook platform as well. All in all, Meta does not seem to be sitting idly by as it explores all reaches of the metaverse. Whether FB stock can benefit from this, in the long run, remains to be seen.

CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz On Rising Cyberthreats Amidst Ukraine-Russia War
In other tech-related news, things appear to be heating up on the cybersecurity front as well. Notably, the current update on the industry comes from CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) CEO George Kurtz. In an interview with CNBC’s Jim Cramer, Kurtz warns that cybercriminal activity is on the rise. This comes at a time when the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues to take its toll on global economies. In Kurtz’s own words, “E-crime is actually up since the war in Ukraine started.” To put things into perspective, this information comes from CrowdStrike’s threat intelligence unit. The likes of which provide visibility and insights from across 176 countries.
According to the CEO, nation-state actors, particularly Russian hackers, are gaining all the attention now. So much so that e-criminals elsewhere are leveraging the current distractions to double down on their activities. To point out, this would be a grim follow-up from Kurtz’s last interview with Cramer late last month. In which he pointed out that some of the top banking executives are already cautious about cyberattacks on national banks. Overall, it seems that demand for cybersecurity services could continue to grow in our increasingly tech-dependent world. With that in mind, investors may want to consider watching CRWD stock among other cybersecurity stocks now.

AbbVie In Focus As Shares Trade At Record Highs Following Numerous Positive Developments
AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) seems to be in the midst of a hot streak in the stock market now. Evidently, ABBV stock is currently trading at around record levels. Year-to-date, the company’s shares have already risen by about 15%. By and large, these gains follow a string of operational wins for AbbVie. For starters, AbbVie completed its acquisition of Syndesi Therapeutics earlier this month. Through its portfolio of novel synaptic modulator candidates, AbbVie would, in theory, be significantly bolstering its neuroscience arm.
Additionally, the company is also actively working on collaborations to develop antiviral COVID-19 and neuropsychiatric diseases treatments. For the former, it is working with Scripps Research, an independent biomedical research, and drug discovery institute. Regarding the latter, AbbVie is working with Gedeon Richter, a major European pharmaceutical player. Worth mentioning, all of these developments are from just this month. With AbbVie seemingly firing on all cylinders, it is no wonder that investors are keen on ABBV stock now.
