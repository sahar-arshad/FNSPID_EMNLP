May 19 (Reuters) - Applied Materials AMAT.O forecast third-quarter revenue below expectations on Thursday, suggesting that supply bottlenecks, exacerbated by the lockdowns in China, would hamper its ability to meet demand for its chipmaking tools.
Shares of the chip tools maker fell 5.1% to $105.10 in extended trading.
A semiconductor and parts shortage for machines used to produce chips has been pressuring the broader chip supply chain that is already facing more demand than chipmakers are able to meet.
""Demand for Applied Materials' products and services has never been stronger, yet we remain constrained by on-going supply chain issues,"" Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW, the world's largest contract chipmaker, last month had warned that its tool suppliers were facing labour, component and chip constraints, which is extending delivery time for both older technology as well as advanced chip making machines.
Applied Materials estimates current-quarter revenue of $6.25 billion, plus or minus $400 million. Analysts on average expect revenue of $6.73 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company said revenue rose 12% to $6.25 billion in the second quarter ended May 1, below estimates of $6.38 billion.

2022-05-19 00:00:00+00:00,Why You May Regret Not Buying AMD Stock Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-you-may-regret-not-buying-amd-stock-right-now,,,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are down 29% in 2022, but there are no signs of a slowdown in the company's growth. Its first-quarter results were released on May 3, and AMD crushed Wall Street's expectations, thanks to tremendous growth in revenue and earnings. It also issued a solid forecast that points toward another year of eye-popping growth.
The latest market-share numbers for the x86 processor space (which includes processors that are used in computers, servers, consoles, and Internet of Things devices) from Mercury Research tell us just why AMD has been putting up healthy growth quarter after quarter. AMD once again took business away from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in the first quarter of 2022 in key areas that sent its x86 market share to a record high. Let's look at the reasons why this trend could continue and help AMD sustain its impressive growth.
AMD continues to chip away at Intel's dominance
According to Mercury Research, AMD exited Q1 with a 27.7% share of the x86 processor market, an increase of 7 percentage points over the prior-year period. The notebook and server CPU (central processing unit) markets were the key drivers of this impressive growth.
AMD's share of the notebook CPU market increased 4.4 percentage points year over year to 22.5% last quarter. The company's gains in this segment were driven by strong shipments of commercial notebook processors.
The good part is that AMD expects further growth in this segment, thanks to its recent design wins. Its chips have been chosen to power upcoming laptops from many leading OEMs (original equipment manufacturers).
AMD CEO Lisa Su said on the company's May earnings conference call that:
We are well positioned to accelerate our growth in commercial notebooks in 2022 based on the expanded number of design wins on track to launch. Although the PC market is experiencing some softness coming off multiple quarters of near-record unit shipments, our focus remains on the premium, gaming and commercial portions of the market where we see strong growth opportunities, and we expect to continue gaining overall client revenue share.
Su's statement indicates that AMD may be able to weather the soft PC (personal computer) sales environment. Market research firm IDC estimates that the global PC market was down 5.1% in the first quarter of 2022, following two years of robust double-digit growth. AMD, however, was able to post record revenue from sales of mobile processors in the first quarter, and the trend looks set to continue as new laptops powered by AMD processors hit the market.

More importantly, AMD is focused on pushing the envelope further in the notebook processor space with the launch of its Dragon Range and Phoenix processors in 2023, which will be based on the 5-nanometer (nm) Zen 4 architecture. Intel, on the other hand, is currently on the 10 nm process with its Alder Lake laptop chips. The larger company is expected to jump to a 7nm process in 2023 when its Meteor Lake processors launch.
It's worth noting that Intel's manufacturing process is reportedly denser than the one in which AMD's chips are manufactured. This means that Chipzilla packs more transistors in a smaller area. As a result, Intel's processors are likely to be more competitive next year as they can deliver more computing power and consume less energy at the same time. Processors based on a denser process can carry out more calculations while generating less heat.
But AMD enjoys the upper hand right now as its latest laptop processors were based on a 6nm process. Therefore, it could continue to take share away from Intel until Chipzilla turns up with a more competitive process node.
The server market is another notable catalyst
AMD's share of CPUs used in servers increased to 11.6% in the first quarter, up 2.7 percentage points year over year. The chipmaker has gained quarterly server market share for three years now, and Su pointed out on theearnings callthat AMD has ""more than doubled server processor revenue year over year in eight of the last 10 quarters.""
AMD's influence on the server market should keep growing as cloud service providers are increasing the deployments of its EPYC processors, with the likes of Amazon, Alibaba, Baidu, Microsoft, and Google using its chips in 70 new virtual servers last quarter. More importantly, AMD's upcoming server processors could help it take more share away from Intel.
AMD's current generation EPYC Milan processors are manufactured using a 7nm process. With Intel's competing Sapphire Rapids server chips running into delays and yet to be made widely available, AMD has a great opportunity to corner a bigger share of the server market. What's more, AMD is expected to launch its 5nm EPYC Genoa processors this year, which should be more powerful and efficient, compared to the Milan processors, since they'll be made using a more advanced process.
All this indicates that AMD's server business is built for more upside, and further progress in this area could substantially boost the company's revenue, given the massive opportunity at hand. As such, it won't be surprising to see AMD keep up its impressive growth for years to come.
The company forecasts a 60% jump in revenue this year to $26 billion, and analysts are upbeat about its long-term prospects, as well, since they expect AMD's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 33% for the next five years. That's why investors who haven't taken advantage of the drop in AMD's shares yet should consider buying this semiconductor stock. It's trading at 38 times earnings now, which is a big discount to its five-year average multiple of 107.

2022-05-19 00:00:00+00:00,7 Dividend Stocks to Boost Your Retirement Savings,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-dividend-stocks-to-boost-your-retirement-savings,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Dividend stocks are a great way to buffer your portfolio against the uncertainty in the market, especially when thinking long-term.
Bank of New York Mellon (BK) was originally owned by Alexander Hamilton and has been around since 1784.
Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) is one of the top regional banks in the country and continues to drive innovation.
Intel (INTC) remains a premier chipmaker and bringing chipmaking back to the U.S. will help its long-term stability.
Merck (MRK) may have missed out on the Covid vaccine gold rush but it remains one of the top drug companies in the world.
Amgen (AMGN) is the kind of biotech all biotech hopefuls want to grow up to be, with plenty of drugs in the market and in the pipeline.
Morgan Stanley (MS) has proven to be both one of the most durable financial services companies and one of the most profitable, decade after decade.
T Rowe Price (TROW) might not be one of the big Wall Street names but it has been delivering for its clients and shareholders more than eight decades.
As stocks devolve towards bear market territory and the global economic picture remains in the “uncertainty” camp, many investors want safety and security. That’s why dividend stocks are the perfect choice for long-term investors.
Buying dividend stocks isn’t a bet on the short term. They’re long-term choices where dividends and steady growth top the list of priorities. These stocks have been around for decades, some for centuries.
Their staying power means they understand that fads are exciting, but they don’t necessarily build the bottom line for a sustainable long-term future. This is somewhat refreshing given the start-ups that have flooded the market in recent years and sport massive market caps after just a few years on the exchanges.

Bank of New York Mellon (BK)

Not only does Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) carry the powerful banking name of the Mellon family — and of course the prestigious Carnegie Mellon University — but its lineage goes back to the founding fathers. Alexander Hamilton founded the bank in 1784, and this bank has been operating since before the Constitution was finalized.
Right now, a lot of banks, big and small, are trying to gain their footing as the economy and interest rate environments are very dynamic. Uncertainty is poison for the markets. And banks haven’t been immune to this uncertainty. That has hit big banks, including BK.
But that doesn’t spell doom for BK stock. On the contrary, it has been through more severe contractions and headier expansions than we’ve been through recently. And through it all, it has emerged stronger.
BK stock has lost 25% year to date and it’s carrying a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 11. This is a great opportunity to add this stock to your nest egg for the long term. It currently has a rock-solid 3.1% dividend.

After the big national banks, the next tier is regional banks. These are banks that operate in a number of states around a geographical region. At this point for Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB), it nearly covers two regions.
It has locations in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Tennessee, West Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. That’s most of the Midwest and South, east of the Mississippi River.
But that growth has taken time. It wasn’t a massive private equity fueled buying spree. The bank has been around since 1858 and has spent decades methodically growing it operation.

FITB stock has lost 18% year to date and now trades with a P/E of 10. It has a 3.4% dividend and is well situated in states where companies — and their workers — are moving into.

Intel (INTC)

We’ve been hearing a lot about the semiconductor chip shortage this year. Well, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is the world’s largest chipmaker. That means it’s the largest victim of this issue, as well as the biggest beneficiary once it’s resolved.
What’s more, when most other chipmakers when “fabless” INTC continued to build its own chips.
Fabless chipmakers engineer the chips — usually in the U.S. or Europe — and then ship the specs to Asia for manufacturing, since a chip plant these days has a cost in the billions of dollars. That’s a massive expense, and fabless players don’t have to deal with that issue.
However, they’re now worse off due to the supply chain collapse. Now, everything is more expensive, and the chip foundries are starting and stopping production time and again. In the midst of all this, INTC announced it was going to build at least one if not more foundries in the U.S. That likely comes with massive tax breaks and federal subsidies as well.
INTC stock is down 18% year to date, but that’s not bad compared to many of its competitors. It also has a 3.4% dividend that will continue to help compound the cash in your portfolio.

Merck (MRK)

Merck (NYSE:MRK) has been a drug maker since 1891. It has both a human health and an animal health division. The latter has become ever more important due to the economic devastation brought by recent animal-borne diseases from Covid-19 to the avian flu to African swine fever.
While the pandemic is a fresh memory of Covid-19’s power, rising egg and poultry prices in the U.S. are partially due to a fast-moving avian flu. And ASF was crushing the Chinese economy in the summer and fall of 2019.
But vaccines aren’t where the money is for big pharmaceutical companies. It’s drugs. And MRK has always been at the center of innovation. Its Keytruda was one of the first cancer immunotherapy drugs to get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That means it was researching these drugs long before the public ever imagined these drugs were possible.
The 7 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy Now
MRK stock has gained 20% year to date, as healthcare beyond the pandemic returns to normalcy. It still trades at a bargain 17 P/E and has a stalwart 3% dividend.

Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) has been in the biotech space since 1980. And its $130 billion-plus market cap makes it a biotech that’s as big as some significant big pharma drug makers.
In the current market, investors are focused on companies that can deliver. The speculative bubble has burst, so money isn’t flowing into niche biotechs that have a cool technology. In the past market, they were buyout candidates or could get massive funding from private equity firms.
Now, everyone is keeping their cash closer to their vests. And the attractive drug companies are those with proven track records, a healthy portfolio drugs, and a strong pipeline. AMGN fits that bill to a T.
The stock has gained 9% year to date, has a P/E of 24 and a very reliable 3.2% dividend.

Morgan Stanley (MS)
Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com
One of the realities of the markets is that the big institutional players like Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) don’t just do well when the markets are going up. They make money when investors are active, either moving money around, pulling it out or funneling it in.
They can use that cash flow to position their accounts as well as work complex cross-hedging across stock, bond and derivatives markets. As long as that momentum is moving, the direction isn’t as crucial as volume.
And right now, MS and others are staying busy. Financial services companies have sold off a little this year as broad selling is the first wave of market readjustments. But lumping banking stocks and financial services companies together isn’t always apples and oranges. For example, MS isn’t particularly interest in the traditional banking sector and continues to focus on its investment banking strengths. That focus will pay dividends (pardon the pun) in the long-term.
The 7 Best Energy Stocks to Buy Now
Given that MS has been around since 1924, it understands the long term. Currently MS stock is down 18% year to date. But it has a generous and trustworthy 3.4% dividend and is trading at a P/E of 10.

T Rowe Price (TROW)

Like MS, T Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) is a financial services company that has been around since 1937. But unlike most of its peers, TROW isn’t a Wall Street firm. Its headquarters has always been in Baltimore, Maryland.
The logic is that there’s too much group think among all the firms on the Street. By operating out of Baltimore, TROW can think for itself and stick to its view of the markets without undue influence from competitors.
With a $28 billion market cap, it’s not a major player, but it’s a well established one. Much of its business is focused on its family of funds — for consumers and companies – and managing institutional money.
The current selloff has hit its assets under management, which has hit the stock pretty hard. TROW stock is down 38% year to date. But this is the kind of company that knows how to weather the storms, which is why it’s very attractive now. And its 3.8% dividend is an investment in your patience.

2022-05-19 00:00:00+00:00,3 Reasons Why It's a Great Time to Be an AMD Investor,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-why-its-a-great-time-to-be-an-amd-investor,,,"On Tuesday, May 18, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) finished the day with over 8% gains after releasing numerous new products and receiving a bullish upgrade and price target increase. Today's video focuses on these topics and what they mean for long-term investors. Here are some highlights.
Piper Sandler upgraded AMD from neutral to overweight and increased its price target to $140 from $98. The upgrade is a change of tone as numerous analysts have decreased price targets for AMD and other semiconductor companies in the past few months due to fear of reducing consumer spending.
Online reports by TechSpot show that AMD is gaining CPU market share from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). The most significant year-over-year (YoY) market share gains are the server market, which deals with cloud provider customers, and the mobile laptop market. Investors should note that AMD did see a YoY decrease in desktop CPUs.
AMD has released new products and announced new partnerships within the past few weeks. Thanks to its recent Xilinx acquisition, AMD released robotics developer kits and announced that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: FB) is using Xilinx's chips to develop its mobile network infrastructure. AMD also announced a collaboration with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) to optimize Wi-Fi connectivity in the enterprise market.

2022-05-18 00:00:00+00:00,This Semiconductor Stock Could Go Parabolic,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-semiconductor-stock-could-go-parabolic,,,"Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) stock has lost a quarter of its value on the market in 2022, but shares of the company that supplies semiconductor manufacturing equipment to foundries have been in recovery mode over the past week.
It won't be surprising to see Applied Materials stock get a nice shot in the arm when it releases its fiscal 2022 second-quarter results after the market closes on May 19. Let's look at what Wall Street expects from the company and why it is on track to smash those expectations.
Applied Materials is on track to deliver solid results once again
Applied Materials has won big from the global semiconductor shortage over the past couple of years, consistently logging robust top- and bottom-line growth. That trend is expected to continue as the company guided for $6.35 billion in revenue and $1.90 per share in adjusted earnings when it released its fiscal first-quarter results, for the three months ending on Jan. 30, in February.
The midpoint of Applied Materials' second-quarter guidance range points toward a 14% year-over-year increase in revenue, while its earnings are on track to jump 17%. Consensus estimates are nearly in line with the company's guidance, as Wall Street is looking for $1.90 per share in earnings on $6.37 billion in revenue.

It is worth noting that Applied Materials has beaten analysts' expectations in three of the last four quarters, and it could do the same once again with its upcoming report. That's because the company has been sitting on a tremendous backlog of orders given the booming demand for chip manufacturing equipment.
Applied Materials CFO Bob Halliday said on the company's February earnings conference call that it had a record backlog worth $8 billion at the end of fiscal Q1. The company added $1.3 billion worth of backlog in Q1, and management believes that Applied Materials is on track to ""carry sizable backlog into 2023.""
Additionally, the supply chain constraints that limited Applied Materials' growth in Q1 are expected to ease as the year progresses. As such, the company's numbers could be better than expected and that could give the stock's rally a jolt.
More reasons to buy the stock
Applied Materials management expects both 2022 and 2023 to be growth years for the company, though it won't be surprising to see it sustain its momentum for a longer time thanks to the market it serves.
According to a third-party research report, the global semiconductor manufacturing equipment market could hit nearly $142 billion in revenue by 2030, compared to $72 billion last year. Applied Materials is in a nice position to tap into this incremental growth opportunity as it supplies its equipment to major foundries such as Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- popularly known as TSMC -- and Intel, among others.
In fiscal 2021, Samsung and TSMC together produced 35% of Applied Materials' total revenue, while Intel was another key customer. These chipmakers have ambitious plans to increase their manufacturing capacities over the long run. Intel, for instance, has decided to spend $88 billion in Europe along with $20 billion on a factory in Ohio.
TSMC, on the other hand, has also laid out an aggressive capital spending plan as it looks to speed up the development of advanced process nodes that will help it create chips that could tackle bigger workloads more efficiently. Given these tailwinds, it is not surprising to see that analysts are expecting 15%-plus annual earnings growth for the next five years, though the size of the end-market opportunity could help Applied Materials grow at a faster pace.
As such, investors who are still on the sidelines and haven't bought Applied Materials stock yet should consider doing so. The stock is trading at 16 times trailing earnings, which is a discount to the Nasdaq-100's multiple of 26. A strong earnings report and healthy guidance could make this semiconductor stock go parabolic, which means that it could rise rapidly in a short period and become more expensive to buy.

2022-05-18 00:00:00+00:00,3 Tech Stocks That Could Help Set You Up for Life,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-tech-stocks-that-could-help-set-you-up-for-life,,,"The tech sector lost its luster this year as rising interest rates sparked a rotation toward more conservative investments. However, shunning all tech stocks is generally a bad idea, since many of those beaten-down names could rebound to fresh highs after the macroeconomic outlook improves.
Instead of blindly selling all of your tech stocks, you should simply stick with well-run blue-chip companies, which generate stable growth and plenty of cash while trading at reasonable valuations. These three evergreen plays fit the bill: Accenture (NYSE: ACN), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (also known as TSMC), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google. Let's find out a bit more about each and how they can set you up for life.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Accenture
Accenture is one of the world's largest IT service companies. Its IT professionals, who are based in 50 countries, provide a wide range of services to approximately 7,000 clients across 120 countries. Most of those clients are Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 companies.
Between 2016 and 2021, Accenture's annual revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% as its earnings per share (EPS) grew at a CAGR of 7.3%. That steady growth enabled it to more than double its annual free cash flow (FCF) from $4.1 billion in 2016 to $8.4 billion in 2021.
Last year, it returned $5.9 billion of that total back to its investors through $3.7 billion in buybacks and $2.2 billion in dividends. It expects to return ""at least"" $6.3 billion of its FCF of $7.7 billion to $8.2 billion to its investors this year.
However, Accenture also plans to ramp up its investments in its higher-growth cloud, interactive, industry X (digital transformation), and security business segments. It expects these ""strategic growth priorities"" to lock in more customers, widen its moat against other IT service providers, and help it keep pace with the digital transformations of larger companies.
Accenture might initially seem like a dull investment, but it's generated an impressive total return of 150% over the past five years. It trades at a reasonable 24 times forward earnings, it pays a decent forward dividend yield of 1.4%, and its core business should continue growing for years to come.
2. TSMC
TSMC is the world's largest contract chipmaker. It manufactures chips for fabless chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices, Apple, and Qualcomm. It also remains ahead of its two closest rivals, Samsung and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), in the ""process race"" to create smaller and denser chips. TSMC established that lead by adopting ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which are used to etch the world's smallest chips, before either rival.
That pricy upgrade has paid off. Between 2016 and 2021, TSMC's annual revenue grew at a CAGR of 10.9% in New Taiwan dollar (NTD) terms and 14.1% in U.S. dollars. Its earnings per American depositary receipt grew at a CAGR of 15.6%.
Its annual operating cash flow also more than doubled from $16.8 billion to $39.8 billion, even as it ramped up its spending on new plants and smaller nodes.
TSMC plans to maintain its process lead by boosting its capital expenditures from $28 billion in 2021 to between $40 billion and $44 billion in 2022, which is far beyond Intel or Samsung's spending capabilities. Intel is pleading for government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to narrow that gap, but it will likely remain at least one chip generation behind TSMC for the foreseeable future.
TSMC's stock has already generated a total return of more than 200% over the past five years, but it still trades at just 16 times forward earnings. That low valuation, along with its projected forward dividend yield of 2.2%, makes it a solid long-term investment.
3. Alphabet
Alphabet's Google owns the world's leading search engine, its largest streaming video platform (YouTube), its most popular web browser (Chrome), its top email platform (Gmail), and its most widely used mobile operating system (Android).
It also operates the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure platform, Google Cloud, and holds a near duopoly in digital ads with Meta Platform's Facebook in many markets.
That nearly inescapable ecosystem has enabled Alphabet to grow its annual revenue at a CAGR of 23.3% between 2016 and 2021, even as its core advertising business endured a brief slowdown during the pandemic. Its EPS also grew at a CAGR of 32.1%, even though it aggressively expanded its unprofitable cloud business.
It generated a whopping $67 billion in FCF in 2021, and it spent $50 billion of that total on buybacks throughout the year. That left it plenty of cash for fresh investments and acquisitions.
Alphabet's stock has soared nearly 140% over the past five years, but it still trades at just 20 times forward earnings. The stock has been dragged down with the broader tech sector this year, but I believe it remains one of the safest long-term investments on the digital advertising and cloud markets.

Tiger Global Exits Rivian, Netflix Stakes In Q1 — Doubles Down On These Chinese EV Makers Instead
Hedge fund Tiger Global dissolved its stake in Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) in the first quarter and significantly lowered its exposure to Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER). It more than doubled its positions in Chinese EV makers Xpeng Inc (NYSE: XPEV) and Li Auto Inc (NASDAQ: LI), according to regulatory filings. The Chase Coleman-founded hedge fund, popular for its mega bets on technology firms, completely exited its position in Rivian, the high-profile EV maker that went public last year and has been under pressure after missing some key production and delivery targets. Tiger Global sold all of the 751,000 shares in Rivian it held at the beginning of the year. Rivian shares slumped 55% in the first quarter to $46.44. The stock is down 76% year-to-date.

2022-05-17 00:00:00+00:00,Should iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) Be on Your Investing Radar?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-ishares-msci-usa-value-factor-etf-vlue-be-on-your-investing-radar-1,,,"The iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) was launched on 04/16/2013, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.
The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $11.20 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.
Why Large Cap Value
Companies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.
Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Looking at their long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets. They are however likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.15%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.72%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
ETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 29.60% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, At&t Inc (T) accounts for about 7.21% of total assets, followed by Intel Corporation Corp (INTC) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.48% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
VLUE seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index before fees and expenses. The MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index is based on a traditional market capitalization-weighted parent index, the MSCI USA Index which includes U.S. large and mid capitalization stocks.
The ETF has lost about -10.29% so far this year and is down about -4.42% in the last one year (as of 05/17/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $96.74 and $114.92.
The ETF has a beta of 1.02 and standard deviation of 26.36% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 155 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
IShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, VLUE is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.
The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $53.49 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $98.25 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.19% and VTV charges 0.04%.
Bottom-Line
While an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.

2022-05-16 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Stock: Market Still Not Convinced,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-stock%3A-market-still-not-convinced,,,"Intel (INTC) shares are close to hitting another multi-year low this week as U.S. equity markets inch closer to a technical bear market. While shares have traded lower towards the low $40s, I am neutral on the stock.
Intel’s Q1 results weren’t bad with small beats on earnings and revenue, however investors were disappointed to hear weaker guidance for Q2. Additionally, this week, China reported a sharp decline in retail sales and industrial output as the CCP refuses to deviate from its zero-COVID policy. China accounts for over 25% of Intel’s total revenue, which could lead to further downward revisions in the coming quarters.
In recent years, Intel has struggled to compete effectively with top semiconductor players. TSMC (TSM) in particular has outperformed Intel, as the company faced delayed product releases and slow chip development.
Management is now guiding large CapEx spending in the years ahead to build out product development efforts, and expand manufacturing across the globe. Wall Street is guiding for $2.5 billion in free cash flow in FY22, and $4.3 billion in FY23. Management is actually guiding negative free cash flow in FY22 between $1 billion and $2 billion.
This decrease in free cash flow is a result of large CapEx spending in the years ahead. Management expects CapEx to be around 35% of revenue over the coming years, with a target of lowering that figure to around 25% in the long term. 
Intel also has a target of reaching 20% FCF margin by 2026, which should yield FCF of $19 billion from 2026 onwards. Luckily, Intel has the financial resources available to attempt a turnaround. While Intel has long-term debt of $37.24 billion, it has enough cash ($38.7 billion) and operating income to maintain a dividend while also running an historically large CapEx budget.
Insiders appear to be convinced of Intel’s plan as they have purchased roughly $6 million worth of shares in the past year. In May alone, CEO Patrick Gelsinger and new CFO David Zinsner purchased over $500,000 worth of Intel stock.
Investing for a Turnaround
Increased CapEx spending is what investors want to see, however other semiconductor manufacturers are also adding to their CapEx budgets in the years ahead. TSMC is guiding a CapEx budget of $40 billion to $44 billion. This is a massive increase from its $30 billion CapEx spend in 2021.
By the time Intel catches up, they (Intel's competitors) will also have made process development leaps. While the market for semiconductors is tight with higher margins and large backlogs, Intel is at risk of overspending if it does not meet its goals.
Management claims Intel will surpass the manufacturing capabilities of TSMC by 2025. However, Intel has disappointed previously with product releases and manufacturing delays. Therefore Intel has an uphill battle to restore credibility with investors.
It's likely a turnaround to some degree will be occur, however investors need to determine if they're willing to wait several years for a turnaround just for their average return to be similar to that of an index.
Management has 24 concurrent construction projects across the globe and an ambitious target of developing five nodes over four years. Under previous management, significantly less ambitious targets were missed at a time when Intel was loosing market share.
However, I would argue today Intel has better equipment and partnerships to support its goals, particularly its continued partnership with ASML. Intel ordered its first TWINSCAN EXE:5200 EUV (lithography machine) from ASML in January, which will have a 200 wafer per hour capacity.
Across its segments, Intel expects total revenue to grow in the mid-high single digits over the next few years followed by double digit growth from 2025 onwards.
At Intel's investor meeting in February, Zinsner outlined his expectations for margin growth over the coming years. He guided gross margins to grow from 51%-53% in FY22-24 to 54%-58% from FY25 onwards.
Valuation
Intel has is valued at $177.6 billion. NTM EV/EBITDA is guided to be 6x, suggesting investor sentiment has diminished. While this seems like a cheap valuation, Intel's free cash flow is expected to vanish for several years.
From a cyclical perspective, semiconductor delivery times are still high and it's expected that semiconductor manufacturers will see decent margins over the next few quarters as we are still mid-cycle.
An increasingly hawkish Fed is the main short-term risk to Intel, as the Fed might abandon any expectation of a soft landing as it raises rates. If this happens demand for chips will slowly contract leaving Intel to delay it's free cashflow targets.
At the current valuation, Intel yields a dividend of 3.3%, which is likely to be a supporting factor preventing from Intel from a complete valuation collapse if the current equity market sell-off accelerates.
Intel has received six Buy ratings, 14 Hold ratings, and seven Sell ratings over the past three months. The average Intel price target of $50.90 suggests 17.2% upside potential.
Conclusion
I believe Intel will continue to see a slow sell-off. followed by sideways consolidation over the coming years while investors wait on key milestones.

Matthew Ball: [MUSIC] Cash, resources, and conviction are not sufficient to thrive in the metaverse. Of course, Microsoft was as convinced as anyone; in mobile and in the Internet. It didn't really help. They had all of the pieces. They put them together incorrectly. In fact, the number of thesis errors that they made, was actually quite something.
Chris Hill: I'm Chris Hill and that was Matthew Ball. From 2016 to 2018, he was the Head of Strategy at Amazon Studios. Today, he is the venture capitalist, rider, and author of the forthcoming book, The Metaverse and how it will revolutionize everything. Recently, he sat down with my colleague, Asit Sharma to talk about the technical challenges in bringing the metaverse to life, how gaming could change and one less obvious company with a lot of exposure to this new frontier but Asit began the conversation by trying to learn when we're going to get the metaverse we keep hearing about.
Asit Sharma: Do you feel, or do you believe that the rate of acceleration of interest in the metaverse, the rate of acceleration of capital put into this team is going to produce this common place bridge between digital and physical experiences in the near future or we still looking at 10-20 years of evolution before we start to take metaverse as second nature and how we live and work?
Matthew Ball: Certainly to argue two different things. One is that we need to truly depart from the idea that there is a before or after. If the metaverse is a successor state to today's mobile and cloud Internet era, we should identify exactly when that era began. We can start in 1973 with the first wireless cellphone call. I wouldn't start there but one could argue that the mobile era began there. We can start in 1991, that's when the first 2G network was launched. That was the first wireless digital network for data transmission.
The BlackBerry comes out in the late '90s, in 1999, we have the wireless application protocol, allowing anyone on a mobile device to access a primitive altered version of the web as we knew it in the '90s. Then of course we have the rise of consumer smartphones, BlackBerry Pearl in the 2000s, 2007, the iPhone 2008, the iPhone 3G, with the sufficient speeds to make most of the mobile Internet usable and the app store, which provides us with something to do. Mid-next decade, half of Americans have a smartphone. Few years later, half of the world over 13 has a smartphone.
When did the mobile Internet era begin is both a philosophical and unanswerable question but ultimately one of generation. You take a look at Roblox today, 75 percent of those, 9-12 use Roblox regularly in many developed markets. For them, they've already moved beyond the form of the Internet that you and I name. Much like in the '90s and then certainly the early 2010s, many people were in the mobile Internet era. Many companies were, but we wouldn't really say that society was at large. I see this as unfolding over the coming decades. Many people think the end of this decade is when you start to say, its advent is truly here but I think the lesson in the story that I just told you is, we can discount how much of the preparation needs to begin now.
Asit Sharma: You named a number of technological milestones are going back decades. For a lay person, what milestones still need to be achieved until we get to this state where the metaverse is no longer this conceptual thing that we're trying to explain to people but just a natural extension of our present approach to consciousness.
Matthew Ball: There really are a few different things that we can keep in mind. One is to recognize that the Internet is actually pretty outstripped buyer ambitions when it comes to the metaverse. Many of your readers may have heard the term latency. Latency is something that we don't think of very often but it's essentially the transit time in milliseconds that it takes a given package to go from one point to another point. We usually think of how long it takes a button to be pressed.
For context, if it takes Spotify longer than 200-250 milliseconds to pause when you hit the pause button, your brain starts to say it's not working. In an interactive environment, you're usually thinking about 40 milliseconds, 50 milliseconds, 70 seconds is when things really start to erode, but ideally 20 milliseconds. The Internet was not designed for that, were in fact up against the practicalities of the speed of light. I know it sounds insane, but to put this in perspective, it takes like 45 milliseconds to go from New York to Tokyo. Light of course, can go there efficiently and essentially without disturbance. What does this mean practically? Well, only 75 percent of Americans truly can participate in today's real-time environments. In the Middle East, fewer than one quarter of broadband homes can, and that's on a local basis, not an international basis. The extent to which infrastructure remains an impediment is hard to overestimate.
The other thing is the Internet, TCP/IP. The Internet protocol suite, actually does a bad job of managing because the Internet was developed to send asynchronous messages that were themselves static between one person and another, one lab sends it to one university. We're talking about a constant stream of live data to marry different parties who are collaborative. What that means is actually the Internet protocol suite does not manage for traffic very well. We're talking on one side of infrastructure, on another side, we're talking about protocols; private or public and then we can think of everything else, Computing devices. Obviously, we need the extraordinary improvements. Intel has had a thousand factor. Improvement is required. John Carmack has said that in 2000, if you asked him whether you could build the metaverse with a 100x compute, John Carmack said, consulting and former founding CTO of Oculus with a 100x compute, could you build it? He said, in 2000 he'd have said yes. Of course today we have 120x in average iPhone and we've got seven billion devices, not a billion. Computers required, but we can go on and on fundamental changes to app store policy, new platforms to make it easier for anyone to create. This is why we talked about it as an iterative process.
Asit Sharma: On one hand, we have the evolution of say content delivery networks or Edge Networks, which are part of the solution to this problem. On the other hand, we have companies like Roblox, which you talked about, which are more user-facing or building those worlds. I'm curious to know on the side of compute power, which you mentioned is another, what's that called it? A constraint, so much as an opportunity. But theoretical constraints, what role does say more slot or the belief that maybe that is not really a law, that theory isn't going to hold up? We see a lot of capital being poured into the extension of this by Intel, Nvidia, even Apple, so many companies. Do you feel that or believe that limitations on computing power will eventually put a hard stop onto the experiences that we can develop. Or this is something we can keep pushing beyond [inaudible].
Matthew Ball: It's great. Look, I would first disagree by saying that we are constrained by computing resources. I think what's important to recognize is many of the limitations that result from that aren't evident, which is to say, when we have more computing available, we tend to uncover problems that we didn't know about. And we tend to pursue more difficult problems, which is why computing remains scarce. There's never enough of it. Whether we're talking about a CPU or GPU. A good example would be to take a look at Battle Royale games.
Battle Royale games send roughly 100 players into a shared simulation. It's not new that game designers want to build Battle Royales, it's new that they can, they have the server power, broadband helps, of course. But then they have the widely deployed computing devices and iPad, frankly, mid-level laptop that can run those experiences. That led to the creation of Battle Royale's about six years ago. It's no mistake that many of the most popular games globally, there is about 450 million daily Battle Royale players, are new. We should recognize that when we have more compute available, new experiences are built, but we should not forget how constrained those are. I like to talk about the fact that it's incredible that we can get 100 players into a Battle Royale. But even that is a little bit of a cheat.
A Battle Royale takes place on an enormous map. Fortnite is two-and-a-half kilometers by two-and-a-half kilometers. What that means is if I'm playing, my computer actually doesn't really need to pay attention to most of the other players and doesn't even know they exist. They exist as a number in the match. I might see 20 at-once rarely, but it's really only processing 20 different people. When you take a look up and down the computing devices and platforms, you can see that difference. Call of Duty: Warzone only runs on gaming PCs and high-end consoles. It has just 150 people. Fortnite runs on most platforms, but far from all it has 100. When you play Free Fire, which comes from Garena, it's designed to run on low-end Androids and developing markets. You can have 50 people despite those limitations.
When you use an Oculus Rift or a metaquest, they have population, one, they're Battle Royale and it has 18 people. In fact, it has 18 people at half the resolution, half the frame rate as a result, it's roughly one-quarter of the pixels process per second. The graphics look closer to a PlayStation 3 title than a PlayStation 5 title. This limitation on compute really does change what you can do from which devices and certainly which new devices, AR and VR, we want. The primary reason why you can't use a HoloLens AR device or an Oculus for so long is both the fact that the battery can't process or can't power that computing device long enough. If you actually want to solve for some of the rendering potency, you need an enormous battery that's going to melt your face or break your neck. This is where you get into the more fueled ideas of do we need quantum computing? Alternatively, people talked about decentralized computing. The problem with Edge computing is Edge can give you more power.
But if you and I are playing a game against one another, ultimately, that doesn't solve for the fact that we need computers powerful and close to both of us, latency comes into play. But most importantly, people ask this question of decentralized compute, which is. Well, I don't think my neighbor's home right now. They probably have 10 devices in their home. We're well acquainted to the idea that two doors down in truth, there are solar panels on top of the house. They're leasing, supply, and capacity for compensation to the network, it might be powering my computer right now. But there is this question of not just do, we need more powerful processors, but do we need a better way to utilize processors?
Asit Sharma: Yeah, I really loved that last idea. A colleague of mine has a service at The Motley Fool Digital Explorers, and he's Bernd Schmid. He is very taken by the idea that money being poured into digital assets often times has a very real-world use case. Problems are being solved in this space which goes into this huge and I think, incoherent moniker of like crypto assets. There is a lot there that can help in terms of spreading out computing power. Between your first writings about the metaverse and this book, I'm curious as to any big aha moments that you had. Let me put it this way. In writing this book, what were the initial conceptions you had that turned out to be not wrong, but you had a very steep evolution between the way you first conceptualize this and again writing about it, to the time of now how you think about the metaverse, what has changed in your thinking about either what the metaverse is or we could also touch on topics of again, what is needed to realize the vision that you have of so many multiple worlds that are interconnected, not just a single entity that is called the metaverse, which I know some people like to think of. I also disagree with that vision.
Matthew Ball: I think there were a few primary themes that I've determined. One was, it was a lot of fun digging into the hardware challenges. You and I spoke about it a moment ago. But to some extent, AR and VR is a chartable problem. We know or we think we have a good sense of what minimum viable product looks like. We can start to understand all of the constituent parts around the interplay between battery life, sensors, resolution, computing, processing, power, price point. That was a lot of fun just digging in deeply because that actually is a bit of a solvable equation. The second thing is, I went deep into the history of what could you know and what couldn't you know.
I'm often asked the would be metaverse expert, though I would decline the term. So what does the metaverse look like in 2035 or 2030? I like to say, I don't know and that's important because first of all, confusion and uncertainty is a prerequisite for disruption. If we all knew, no one would be displaced. The other thing is, you can look back over time at TCP/IP, at the mobile Internet. There was no technical understanding or no high-level elements of more people with more devices and more places using the Internet more often. That told you about Instagram, of TikTok, of the impact of Robinhood and commission-free trading. It didn't really tell you what to build, when, why, how, and how it would be monetized as well.
So really unpacking that was fascinating because it allowed me to say, here's what I'm convinced of, here's what I think but I'm not certain about, and here are the things I would never speculate on. Because the third conclusion is really to understand that technological change of this nature is recursive. Someone produces an innovation. It leads to users, those users manifest new behaviors, that inspires a derivative innovation or technology that changes behaviors producing new use cases and this just continues to flow. It's one of the reasons why I would say one of the fourth biggest takeaways is cash, resources, and conviction are not sufficient to thrive in the metaverse. Of course, Microsoft was as convinced as anyone in mobile and in the internet. It didn't really help. They had all the pieces. They put them together incorrectly.
In fact, the number of thesis errors that they made, not execution errors, but thesis errors they made was actually quite something. That's a good parallel to Facebook right now. They have three billion users, two billion dials, billions a year in OCF, a founder with absolute conviction, an enormous headstart in VR, wide range of talented developers. But cash, resources, conviction not sufficient to thrive in this next era. Because we don't know exactly how it's going to play out.
Asit Sharma: You don't run, but you co-founded an ETF, which I mentioned at the outset. I'm not sure, the extent of your involvement in managing the portfolio.
Matthew Ball: No. We're the index provider.
Asit Sharma: Index provider. So my question just to begin is, when you thought through the themes that would underlie this ETF, did you find just a huge amount of companies that were in your selectable universe, was it something that after some time laying out your criteria, you realized wow, this service is going to have fewer stocks and companies than 100? Very curious about the size of the ETF and the companies that are indexed to.
Matthew Ball: Sure. Let me give you the macro perspective. I and my co-founders believed that the Metaverse is a multi-trillion dollar, multi-decade transformation. You will find Citibank, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs of all estimated by 2030, it's roughly 8-13 trillion are actually using my methodology and altering the exact forecast. But so the prospective becomes, how do you gain appropriately diversified exposure to that macro level, an extraordinarily large investment thing? My perspective, is there's certainly an opportunity for picking.
The challenge with picking right now is that that future is relatively uncertain for the reasons that I mentioned, we all wish we could go to 1995 buy Apple, 2005, buy Netflix. Yet some people instead bet on Nokia or BlackBerry good for a short period, not good after or Samsung. Others bet on Time Warner, a fine return, but nothing offer generative. Having a well diversified, structured, thematic index would have provided extraordinary returns even if it fell a little bit short of Apple or Netflix.
You can take a look at social media, social networking, mobile Cloud, enterprise Cloud, thematic ETFs over the past 30 years, and the results are great. From my perspective when you talked about composition, because it's such a broad theme, I didn't see that I could actually develop it solely myself, and so I built the council. Six others, former executives at Amazon, at Nvidia, at Square, Spotify, Andreessen Horowitz, at New York Times. Very securities professionals, the former executive producer and lead game design lead for Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V. We produced this passive rules-based thematic index. We took a look at seven core profit pools, weighted them based on their projected and current share of the profit pools and then came out with the scoring mechanism for all companies.
We went through 3,000. Could we have provided some allocation to the hundreds? Certainly. But the goal here was to provide investors with as tight and exposure to the actual Metaverse team. Let me give you a good example. Many believe that Nike is going to be a large participant. From the Metaverse, they've got a good data C suite. We can understand how virtual existence has requirements for apparel, augmented reality for a fitness company. You wouldn't say that that's pure-play exposure, but you would say it's meaningful exposure. We just as easily put Adidas or Under Armour, but we came out with a methodology that tightens the selection down to between 30 and 70 companies on a relative basis. I think we're sitting at 42 right now.
Asit Sharma: That's so interesting. Did Nike make it into the index?
Matthew Ball: Nike did, but not at first. As I mentioned, we have a passive rules-based thematic index. The goal is not to pick. There are times in which i think x versus y is over undervalued, there are times in which I think that our allocation for a specific company is perhaps not ideal. But the goal is to have an ironclad experts criteria for qualification and waiting up and down and for rebalancing. Based on public disclosures, which is of course how we operate and the rules, but also what Nike wasn't doing, when we launched they were not included in, they are now.
Asit Sharma: Nike is one I've been following with some interest. Has something to do with some patents that they had. I think in advance of some of their competitors that play to strength I think in virtual worlds. I also interested in Nike, just because they had an understanding of this idea of scarcity, which is tied to the NFT world. We know NFTs will play a fun role in the Metaverse. Very forward-looking company in the way it approaches technology. They understood from, I want to say 1990s, how valuable single pair of shoes could be. They're thinking with the Air Jordan brand was far in advance. We have exchanges now in which sneakers or rare sneakers are traded. This is connected to the commercialization of the Metaverse as well. Thinking of Nike executives always impress me. They're not a technology company per se, well they are a physical technology company, but I'm interested to hear that even through your passive and rules based criteria the company made it in. We just have a few minutes left. I could go on for so long. This has been immensely fascinating. Let me ask you in terms of thinking about the Metaverse for a layperson. You personally, and I know you've very clearly stated, look, it's going to evolve, there's no point in trying to predict the endpoint of what it should look like, we don't know. But for you Matthew, what would be an ideal expression of the Metaverse for you, 10 years now, what would you like to see? What do you dream about sometimes or envision it becoming?
Matthew Ball: Well, let me hit a quick thing that I think often alludes people and also allows me to catch up on a question I didn't answer of yours, which is several years ago actually, the Chief Digital Officer of Nike left to become the President of Epic Games. A great example of a company that was not on many radars, but actually shows you the close cohesion between Nike strategic thinking. It's no mistake that the rest of the organization, even after Adam Sussman left, has been a pioneer. That allows me to get to this question is I think one of the things that's interesting is if we produced the Metaverse ETF two years ago or two and half years ago, two of the top four names would not be in there, and that is Unity and Roblox. We certainly expect that overtime the composition of this will fundamentally alter just like a mobile Internet ETF in 1996 and 2002 and 2005 would look different than it does today.
That's again why we have a passive thematic rules based index. I don't want to hypothesize specifically on companies or valuation or waiting, but there are some companies where people looked at large, 10-50 billion dollar companies, Epic, Niantic, Dapper Labs, OpenSea, that you can totally understand is being relevant to this theme could likely be public, but are not yet. When you ask, what's the ideal end-state? I would say we see an end state pretty similar to what we see today in the real-world. We often forget that even in this world of [inaudible] control, those companies have less than 13 percent of digital economy revenues on a gross basis. As a percentage of the global economy, they're small. In the United States, Amazon is the largest employer, Mcdonald's is quite close, but there's 33 million small to medium businesses in the United States. Those are the people who have more than half of jobs, more than half of GDP. My hope would be that we see similar decentralization in terms of rights of ownership of entrepreneurship and of profits.

2022-05-13 00:00:00+00:00,Alphabet (GOOGL) Expands Trusted Tester in Downtown Phoenix,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alphabet-googl-expands-trusted-tester-in-downtown-phoenix,,,"Alphabet GOOGL is leaving no stone unturned to expand its Waymo ride-hailing service across the United States.

This is evident from the latest move of making its Early Rider program, now called Trusted Tester, available to the public in downtown Phoenix.

People interested in becoming Waymo One Trusted Testers are required to download the Waymo app and complete a survey.

Currently, the service is available to a small group of test riders.

At present, Waymo vehicles are operating from north to Camelback and 44th Street to the east in the downtown.

Notably, this bodes well for the company’s plan to expand in downtown Phoenix, which was announced in late March this year.

The latest move marks Waymo’s expansion in Phoenix. Notably, Waymo vehicles began its ride-hailing service from the East Valley of Phoenix.

Expanding Waymo Efforts
The recent step is in sync with the company’s strengthening efforts toward expanding its operations, fleet and making the vehicles more rider-friendly.

The company recently revealed that it would make its ride-hailing vehicles fully driverless on the streets of San Francisco. This also marks Waymo’s first expansion outside Phoenix.

The company recently partnered with Geely, a China-based automotive company. Per the terms of the deal, Geely’s electric mobility brand, Zeekr, will design and develop electric vehicles for Waymo, into which Waymo Driver will be integrated.

The vehicles will be first introduced on the roads of the United States. With the Geely partnership, Waymo will expand its Waymo One fleet.

Apart from this, Waymo teamed up with Google’s Maps to ensure a seamless booking experience for Waymo One. This enables customers to book Waymo One directly from the Maps app.

The endeavors will help Alphabet further penetrate the booming autonomous driving space.

Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the worldwide driverless vehicle market is expected to see a CAGR of 18.06% between 2021 and 2026.
Intensifying Competition
Given the upbeat scenario, not only Alphabet but companies like Amazon AMZN, Intel INTC and Baidu BIDU are also making every effort to capitalize on the growth prospects in the autonomous driving space.

Amazon’s buyout of Zoox, a developer of autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, remains a major positive. Further, the company’s launch of its first self-driving robotaxi strengthened its position in the autonomous driving space.

Zoox has been testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, Las Vegas and Foster City. It intends to open an engineering office and operations facility this year, which will act as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing.

Meanwhile, Intel is gaining from the low power consumption of Mobileye chips and the ability to create maps for self-driving systems. The company intends on introducing a pilot for autonomous taxis and ride-hailing services in Munich and Tel Aviv in 2022.

In addition to this, Mobileye recently teamed up with German electric mobility unit Benteler EV Systems and Beep to develop and deploy self-driving, fully-electric shuttles in the United States by 2024.

Baidu is gaining from expanding the Apollo Go Robotaxi service, which features about 100 pick-up and drop-off stations across several residential and business areas.

Nevertheless, Alphabet’s growing autonomous driving initiatives are likely to help it stay ahead of the curve.

Currently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2022-05-13 00:00:00+00:00,Worried Stagflation Will Return? The History of 2 Stocks Shows Investors Can Still Win,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/worried-stagflation-will-return-the-history-of-2-stocks-shows-investors-can-still-win,,,"The stagflationary environment in the 1970s was unkind to stocks, generally. The Dow stood at 809 on the first day of trading in 1970. By the end of 1979, it had risen to 839, less than 4% over a decade.
Assuming we have again entered stagflation, this history bodes poorly for those who invest in index funds such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. Since broad-based indexes are barometers of the overall state of the economy, they don't generally move higher in a stagflationary environment, and index investors could go years without earning significant returns.
Fortunately, even in such an environment in the 1970s, fledgling growth stocks such as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Walmart (NYSE: WMT) performed well. Understanding their stories could provide clues to finding the growth stocks of the 2020s.

1. Intel
In today's tech-focused world, few can imagine a world without semiconductors. While Intel did not invent that product, it played a key role in mainstreaming chips. Intel began in 1968 and established an early reputation for outperforming competitors with existing technologies.
Soon after, the invention of the 4004 microprocessor in 1971 convinced Intel that its future lay in microprocessors that stood at the center of an emerging microcomputer industry. By 1974, its 8080 processor powered the Altair 8800, widely regarded as the first commercially successful personal computer. This computer eventually paved the way for its partnership with IBM in 1981, which placed its processor in most personal computers.
These improvements boosted Intel stock from its beginning in 1971. Intel launched its IPO in October of that year at $23.50 per share or about $0.02 per share adjusted for stock splits. In 1971, its revenue reached $9.4 million, more than double the previous year, and it reported its first profit of just over $1 million. By 1979, revenue would reach $663 million, taking net income to $78 million.
Although the stock price did not rise as fast as its income, it dramatically outperformed the Dow. During the 1970s, it would increase in value by over 1,600%. Also, it would go on to approve five stock splits during the 1970s -- four three-for-two splits and one five-for-four split. This served as another sign of its rapid stock price increases.
OCT. 13, 1971 DEC. 31, 1979 % CHANGE
Intel (split-adjusted price per share) $0.019 $0.33 1,637%
Dow Jones Industrial Average 889 839 (6%)

2. Walmart
Another 1970s growth story happened not in tech but in the retail space. Sam Walton founded Walmart in Rogers, Arkansas, in 1962.
Initially, Walmart focused on bringing department store retailing to smaller towns, offering a wider variety of goods at the ""lowest prices."" This strategy changed a small-town retail culture once dominated by smaller local retailers. Its presence led to a positive economic impact on towns served by its stores, further enabling Walmart's expansion.
Building on this success, the company began offering common stock in 1970, and that year, the company reported $44.2 million in sales from 38 stores in Arkansas and four surrounding states. The stock moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1972, and by 1979, it grew to 229 stores in 10 states which generated $900 million in revenue.
That growth had a profound effect on the stock price. Its original price in 1970 came to $16.50 per share, or $0.008 per share adjusted for splits. Additionally, three of its 11 stock splits took place during the 1970s. The stock ended the 1970s with a gain of nearly 17-fold during the decade.

Making sense of growth amid stagflation risk
Even if the 1970s did not treat stock investors on the whole particularly well, the decade delivered considerable returns to those who invested in two of the growth stories that have become the leaders of today.
Even as Intel's current recovery hits a speed bump, its stock has risen more than 2,200-fold since the 1971 IPO. Intel also remained the world's largest semiconductor company until 2019. In 2021, it reported $79 billion in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) revenue and is still second-biggest next to Samsung.
Moreover, Walmart's stock rose 19,000-fold since its IPO. It now operates nearly 10,600 stores which earned almost $573 billion in revenue in 2021.
Finally, investors should understand that Intel and Walmart will probably not become the great growth stories of the 2020s. Instead, they should study these stocks as a reminder that growth stocks can still generate outsized returns in a stagflationary environment. This knowledge should give investors the confidence to take a chance on the growth stocks of today.

Like other semiconductor stocks, Nvidia (NVDA) has been hit hard in 2022
NVDA stock still trades for 16 times annual revenue and 44 times earnings
When the current panic ends, investors should pounce
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is beginning to look like a bargain again. At its May 12 closing price of just below $162 a share, Nvidia is down 45% so far this year. But it’s still not cheap. Investors buying now would be paying 16 times revenue and 44 times earnings to own it.
NVDA stock likely has further to fall. But if you can grab it near its bottom, you’ll make money.
That’s because Nvidia makes money. During the 2022 fiscal year, which ended in January, Nvidia earned $26.9 billion in revenue and $11.3 billion in net income, for a net profit margin of over 40%. The company had more than $21 billion in cash on its books in January and doesn’t have the capital expense of a foundry.
So why is NVDA stock falling?
Nvidia NVDA $161.75
No One Buys Yesterday
The first quarter of 2023, which just ended, should be the best in Nvidia history when it’s reported on May 25. Analysts expect earnings of $1.29 per share on revenue of $8.1 billion, up 42% and 43%, respectively, over the same period last year. The whisper estimate puts earnings at $1.35 a share.
The trouble is investors don’t buy your yesterdays. They want your tomorrows. And the next few quarters could be rough. Taking Russia out of the market, and looking at China’s lockdowns, analysts are predicting a global recession.
Chip prices are also very sensitive to demand. The price of Nvidia’s graphics boards dropped about 12% in April and should go down further in May. The crypto crash means there’s no demand from miners, which has created bargains for gamers. Cloud data centers, which are the biggest buyers of chips, are certain to take advantage, resulting in lower margins.
As a result of all this, some analysts have already downgraded NVDA stock.
Nvidia’s biggest problem, however, is supply. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which is seeking to expand its foundry capacity (and could supply Nvidia once that’s done) sees the current chip shortage lasting another two years. Nvidia’s current supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), keeps hiking prices, which will crimp margins.
Is NVDA Stock Cheap Yet?
Nvidia bulls are eyeing the stock’s chart and wondering where the bottom is. Over the long run, they insist shares are a great bargain, even here, thanks in part to Nvidia’s $1 trillion addressable market. Nvidia regularly appears in articles touting stocks that are well off their highs and, thus, bargains.
One analyst made headlines back in July when he gave NVDA stock a $1,000 price target. Currently, the average price target is just above $329, which would be a double from here. 
So, while Nvidia’s sales and earnings are rising, NVDA stock is falling as the entire market experiences a period of multiple compression. The price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is now below 20. Nvidia’s P/E ratio is more than twice that.
That’s why some smart analysts, like InvestorPlace’s Tyler Craig, are telling investors to keep their powder dry a while longer. Semiconductor stocks often go through intense boom-and-bust periods. This is a bust. There will be a boom. You just have to wait for it.
The Bottom Line on NVDA Stock
The current market has proven once again why the cash in your account is a great asset. If you have some, there are great buying opportunities coming. Nvidia is one of them.
There will come a time, not long from now, when people are talking about smart cars, artificial intelligence and virtual reality again. Those are great opportunities for Nvidia’s graphics chips, on both the client and server side. But that time is not now.
I’m reminded of my favorite investment aphorism: Buy what’s real, buy what’s profitable, buy it when it’s cheap and make your money over time. Nvidia is real, it’s profitable, and it’s getting cheaper every day.

May 12 (Reuters) - ProFrac Holding Corp PFHC.O, an oilfield services company backed by billionaires Dan and Farris Wilks, priced its initial public offering at $18 per share, well below its target range, valuing the firm at $1.7 billion.
The company had earlier set the indicative price range at between $21 and $24 apiece.

Several companies have postponed or shelved their U.S. listing plans as the Russia-Ukraine war and the prospect of aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve roil global markets.
Excelerate Energy's IPO in April was a bright spot, however, as the provider of floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals benefited from the war boosting energy prices and driving up demand for LNG.

Stocks fell last Thursday, crashing to one of the worst days since 2020. While it is doom and gloom for most investors, there are many aggressive bargain hunters that are looking to take advantage of the huge price correction and are looking for bargain stocks to buy.
7 Safe Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Now
Therefore, if you have the capital to invest, here are seven options you need to keep in mind.

NFLX Netflix $171.87
DIS Disney $103.71

NRDS NerdWallet $8.48
FB Meta Platforms $191.22

Netflix (NFLX)
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a revolution in the entertainment industry. The company is actively changing how people consume movies and TV shows. The streaming service uses AI to create personalized recommendations that are tailored to each individual’s taste.
Netflix has been able to achieve this success by using AI tools such as machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) for their recommendation system. They have also been able to use AI tools for their algorithm to help decide which content will be available on their platform.
Netflix had a bit of a wild ride in 2021. With 221.8 million global paid subscribers, Netflix ended last year as the undisputed champion of the streaming space. However, things changed quite rapidly this year. In the first quarter, the company lost 200,000 subscribers during the January-March period. It led to investors becoming very skeptical regarding the streaming space.
However, Netflix is trying to grow. It has purchased several independent gaming studios to enhance its gaming division. At the same time, it is trying new features such as interactive movies like Minecraft: Story Mode and You Vs. Wild, among others. It is also ramping up local content production since Netflix knows that the majority of its growth will come from outside the U.S.
Hence, it makes it on this list of the best bargain stocks to buy.
Disney (DIS)
Disney (NYSE:DIS) is a company that has been around since the 1920s. It is one of the most prominent companies in the entertainment industry. The company has created many well-known characters and movies that have become staples in American culture.
Disney has its own animation studio, Disney Television Animation, which produces television series and shorts for Disney Channel, Disney XD and other networks. In addition to this, they also produce a number of direct-to-video films for DVD release.
Disney is one of the most popular and recognizable brands in the world. It is also one of the most lucrative for content creators as it is one of the few companies that can afford to pay top dollar for their content.

Disney has been a longtime innovator and has excelled in every sector of the entertainment business. The company launched Disney+ in 2019 and it has made waves in the industry within a short period of time. The streaming service had 129.8 million subscribers worldwide as of Q1’22. And while Netflix lost subscribers in the first quarter, Disney+ gained 11.8 million new subscribers.
Intel (INTC)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has a history of innovation that dates back to its first semiconductor, the 4-bit memory chip in 1971. Intel’s first microprocessor was released in 1978 and it has since expanded into other markets, such as personal computers, mobile computing devices, data center servers and many more.
The main criticism of Intel these days is that the company’s focus on personal computers — which make up over half of their total sales — isn’t living up to expectations. In the meantime, chipmakers such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) have made inroads in the market. AMD in particular has given Intel a considerably tough time. In March 2017, AMD came out with the Ryzen microprocessor to reduce the cost of high-end CPUs and improve performance. It’s capable of challenging the best of Intel’s chips and it provides a better alternative.
To many individuals, the Ryzen is an affordable and powerful update to old processors. For great overclocking speed, it’s not just a new brand with a very fast processor; it’s also compatible with older architecture and allows for the low cost that budget-conscious consumers are looking for.
However, Intel is now trying to take market share from its rivals with its 12th-Gen Alder Lake chips. That is exactly the kind of news investors need at this stage.
NerdWallet (NRDS)
NerdWallet (NASDAQ:NRDS) is a personal finance website that provides financial advice and tools to consumers. It was founded in 2009 and has since become one of the most popular personal finance sites on the internet.
NerdWallet is an online publication that provides information on how to save money and make smart investments. The website provides information on how to compare financial products, so consumers can make the best buying decisions possible in order to save money.

NerdWallet will help in this regard. The information on financial products is important for investors to make an informed decision. It helps them understand the risk and potential return of a particular investment. Thus, NerdWallet will continue to do well in this environment.
Meta Platforms (FB)
It is very rare to see Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) stock down 44% during a calendar year. But here we are. There are several reasons for this. Some of them have to do with the overall economic environment of the U.S., including high inflation rates and interest rates. While the other issues deal with Meta Platforms, in particular. They have to do with the privacy changes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) made to its iOS operating system last year, and the company’s excessive spending on metaverse innovations.
Nevertheless, Meta has a huge portfolio. It includes Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Whatsapp. In combination, they have 3.64 billion people on different platforms. Apps such as Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp were among the top 5 most downloaded apps last year.
The company has been active for a few years now and it has done very well so far. You should also take into account the fact that they have an excellent track record of previous success. In the short run, FB stock could remain under pressure as it gets all of its ducks in a row. However, in the long run, it’s an outstanding investment.
Upstart Holdings (UPST)
Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ:UPST) is an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven lending platform that helps people make a profit on their personal loans. It uses AI to predict loan repayments and calculate interest rates. It also provides insights into the borrower’s financial history, credit score and other factors that affect the loan.

Recent changes to lending policies by some banks are unlikely to slow down the momentum that has been building behind Upstart. With increasing adoption rates in the big banks, there has been a resurgence of offline loan applications. In light of this trend and given the success of this AI lending platform, a higher interest rate environment will increase usage of the company’s platform. All of these factors point to a massive upside for this company.

2022-05-12 00:00:00+00:00,INTC July 1st Options Begin Trading,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intc-july-1st-options-begin-trading,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the July 1st expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new July 1st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $41.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.66. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $41.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $39.34 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $42.60/share today.
Because the $41.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.05% return on the cash commitment, or 29.56% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $41.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $46.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.00. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $42.60/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $46.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.33% if the stock gets called away at the July 1st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $46.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $46.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.35% boost of extra return to the investor, or 17.14% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example above is 39%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $42.60) to be 30%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

""What we're seeing is that inflation is starting to slow down but the velocity was not as fast as people had hoped. So I think markets are still scared about that,"" said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management.
""There's really a lot of uncertainty around the Fed right now. If they are too aggressive, that hurts economic growth, but (if) they're too conservative, higher inflation hurts consumption, which also hurts growth.""
Growth stocks, which led Wall Street's rally from the pandemic lows in 2020, have borne the brunt of a selloff this year as their returns and valuations are discounted more deeply when rates go up.

These growth stocks seem to have the best of all worlds. They have good growth characteristics, low valuations, low payout ratios (allowing room for other uses of its cash flow), and good dividend yields. Typically, but not always, companies with low payout ratios tend to have medium to average yields, but also good share buyback programs.

I have chosen each of these stocks because they have the ability to withstand a recession and maintain their dividends. Since their dividends do not take up more than 50% of earnings, they are not likely to cut the dividends.

Dividend-Paying Stocks to Buy: HP Inc (HPQ)
Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com
Market Cap: $39.0 billion
HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) is a low-tech company that has a decent 2.70% yield as well as a hefty, consistent buyback program. Its annual dividend is $1.00 per share, which represents just 23% of its forecast $4.26 earnings per share (EPS) for 2022. Moreover, HP has produced 11 consecutive years of dividend increases, as well as 32 years of continuous dividend payments.
Moreover, based on analysts’ estimates, HPQ stock trades for just 8.5 times the average of 16 analysts’ EPS estimate of $4.26 this year. It is slightly lower based on next year’s estimates.
HP has ample cash flow. HP generated cash flow from operating activities of $1.7 billion and FCF of $1.4 billion. From this FCF HP paid $271 million on dividends and $1.5 billion on share repurchases.
Warren Buffett likes HP and recently took a large 11.4% stake in the company. HPQ stock is likely to be one of the top undervalued stocks to own for the long term.
Intel Corp (INTC)
Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com
Market Cap: $181 billion
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) raised its dividend-per-share (DPS) by 5% to $1.46 annually when it announced fourth-quarter (Q4) and 2021 earnings. As a result the stock now yields 3.30% as of May 6. But its $1.46 dividend per share (DPS) represents just 41.6% of its forecast $3.51 earnings per share (EPS) 2022 estimates. As a result, its price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is very low at just 12 times forecast EPS.
Moreover, Intel’s powerful free cash flow (FCF) allows it to pay out these dividends. Last quarter ending April 2, Intel reported that its adjusted FCF for its latest quarter was $5.549 billion. This was more than enough to pay its dividends, which cost just $1.487 billion. However, unlike other companies on this list, Intel did not buy back any of its shares in the latest quarter.

Nevertheless, given its high yield and low payout ratio, the stock is one of the best dividend-paying stocks to own in this turbulent market.
Dividend-Paying Stocks to Buy: Cummins Inc (CMI)

Market Cap: $28.5 billion
Cummins (NYSE:CMI) makes, distributes and services large diesel and natural gas engines. The company pays a $5.80 DPS, which represents a low 33% of its forecast $17.53 EPS for 2022. Moreover, at May 6’s price of $201.72, the dividend provides an ample yield of 2.88%.
Moreover, in its latest quarter ending March 31, the company has been repurchasing its shares for $311 million. The company said it plans to return approximately 50 percent of operating cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
Analysts now project that its EPS for 2022 will reach $17.53 in 2022 and $20.16 in 2023. At $201.72 this puts CMI stock on a forward P/E multiple of just 11.5 times for 2022 and 10 times for 2023.
This makes CMI stock one of the better dividend-paying stocks worth buying in May 2022.
Target Inc (TGT)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Market Cap: $104.4 billion
Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) is a fast-growing retailer with good cash flow and a 1.59% dividend yield. The company will likely produce its next financial results for the quarter ending April 30 on June 1 or shortly thereafter. Target pays a $3.60 DPS, which represents just 24.7% of analysts’ forecast EPS of $14.58 for this year (ending Jan. 2023). Moreover, this puts TGT stock on a cheap P/E multiple of just 15.5 times earnings.
People will keep buying groceries, clothes and cheap items at stores like Target during a recession. That is what occurred during the Covid-19 lockdown period. Target had one of its best years in 2020, growing 19.8%. In 2021 its sales rose 13.2%.
7 Defensive Dividend Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now
Target also produces strong FCF, about $2 billion last quarter. That allows it to cover its $432 million quarterly dividend costs. Moreover, Target spent $2.3 billion on share buybacks. Last year it bought back $7.36 billion worth of its stock, representing 6.88% of its existing market cap.
Dividend-Paying Stocks to Buy: CVS Health (CVS)

Market Cap: $132.2 billion
CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) has over 9,900 retail drug stores and 1,100 walk-in MinuteClinic locations. CVS Health also acquired Aetna in late 2018, a giant health insurance company. This has helped stabilize its earnings. As a result, the company now pays out a solid $2.20 dividend per share (DPS).
Since analysts forecast that its earnings per share (EPS) will reach $8.32 this year, its payout ratio is low at 26%. Moreover, its valuation is low with a P/E multiple of just 12.1 given its price on May 6 of $100.69 per share.
Moreover, CVS has started buying back large amounts of shares. Last quarter ending March 31, it bought back over $2 billion of common stock. On an annualized basis that represents over 6.2% of its $132.2 billion market capitalization. That will help make it one of the most undervalued dividend-paying stocks.
Tyson Foods (TSN)
Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com
Market Cap: $32.9 billion
This meat producer has a low forward P/E of just 11 times forecast earnings for 2022, based on EPS of $8.55. In addition, its $1.84 annual dividend provides an ample 2% dividend yield. This also means its payout ratio is low at 21.5% (i.e., $1.84/$8.55).
7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for May With Yields Over 6%
Moreover, Tyson Foods dramatically increased its share buyback activity during its latest quarter ending Jan. 31. It repurchased $348 million of common stock compared to $16 and $17 million in the prior two quarters. This works out to 4.2% of its $32.9 billion market value on an annualized basis. That makes it one of the best undervalued dividend-paying stocks with low payouts and valuations.
