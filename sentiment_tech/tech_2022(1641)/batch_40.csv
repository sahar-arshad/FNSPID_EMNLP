2022-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-U.S. warned firms about Russia's Kaspersky software day after invasion -sources,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-u.s.-warned-firms-about-russias-kaspersky-software-day-after-invasion-sources-0,,,"By Christopher Bing
March 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. government began privately warning some American companies the day after Russia invaded Ukraine that Moscow could manipulate software designed by Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky to cause harm, according to a senior U.S. official and two people familiar with the matter.
The classified briefings are part of Washington's broader strategy to prepare providers of critical infrastructure such as water, telecoms and energy for potential Russian intrusions.
President Joe Biden said last week that sanctions imposed on Russia for its Feb. 24 attack on Ukraine could result in a backlash, including cyber disruptions, but the White House did not offer specifics.
""The risk calculation has changed with the Ukraine conflict,"" said the senior U.S. official about Kaspersky's software. ""It has increased.""
Kaspersky, one of the cybersecurity industry's most popular anti-virus software makers, is headquartered in Moscow and was founded by Eugene Kaspersky, who U.S. officials describe as a former Russian intelligence officer.
A Kaspersky spokeswoman said in a statement that the briefings about purported risks of Kaspersky software would be ""further damaging"" to Kaspersky’s reputation ""without giving the company the opportunity to respond directly to such concerns"" and that it ""is not appropriate or just.""
The senior U.S. official said Kaspersky's Russia-based staff could be coerced into providing or helping establish remote access into their customers' computers by Russian law enforcement or intelligence agencies.
Eugene Kaspersky, according to his company website, graduated from the Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science, which the Soviet KGB previously administered. The company spokeswoman said that Kaspersky worked as a ""software engineer"" during military service.
The Russian cybersecurity firm, which has an office in the United States, lists partnerships with Microsoft, Intel and IBM on its website. Microsoft declined to comment. Intel and IBM did not respond to requests for comment.
On March 25, the Federal Communications Commission added Kaspersky to its list of communications equipment and service providers deemed threats to U.S. national security.
It is not the first time Washington has said Kaspersky could be influenced by the Kremlin.
The Trump administration spent months banning Kaspersky from government systems and warning numerous companies to not use the software in 2017 and 2018.
U.S. security agencies conducted a series of similar cybersecurity briefings surrounding the Trump ban. The content of those meetings four years ago was comparable to the new briefings, said one of the people familiar with the matter.
Over the years, Kaspersky has consistently denied wrongdoing or any secret partnership with Russian intelligence.
It is unclear whether a specific incident or piece of new intelligence led to the security briefings. The senior official declined to comment on classified information.
Until now no U.S. or allied intelligence agency has ever offered direct, public proof of a backdoor in Kaspersky software.
Following the Trump decision, Kaspersky opened a series of transparency centers, where it says partners can review its code to check for malicious activity. A company blog post at the time explained the goal was to build trust with customers after the U.S. accusations.
But the U.S. official said the transparency centers are not ""even a fig leaf"" because they do not address the U.S. government's concern.
""Moscow software engineers handle the [software] updates, that's where the risk comes,"" they said. ""They can send malicious commands through the updaters and that comes from Russia.""
Cybersecurity experts say that because of how anti-virus software normally functions on computers where it is installed, it requires a deep level of control to discovery malware. This makes anti-virus software an inherently advantageous channel to conduct espionage.
In addition, Kaspersky's products are also sometimes sold under white label sales agreements. This means the software can be packaged and renamed in commercial deals by information technology contractors, making their origin difficult to immediately determine.
While not referring to Kaspersky by name, Britain's cybersecurity center on Tuesday said organizations providing services related to Ukraine or critical infrastructure should reconsider the risk associated with using Russian computer technology in their supply chains.
""We have no evidence that the Russian state intends to suborn Russian commercial products and services to cause damage to UK interests, but the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,"" the National Cyber Security Centre said in a blog post.

2022-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,Why AMD Stock Crashed on Thursday,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amd-stock-crashed-on-thursday,,,"What happened
For the second day running, shares of semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) fell in Thursday trading as selling accelerated. As of 11:25 a.m. ET, AMD shares are down 6.1%.
And Barclays is to blame.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
As StreetInsider.com reports this morning, British banker Barclays just downgraded AMD stock to ""equalweight"" (i.e., hold) and slashed its price target by 22%, to just $115 a share. Of course, AMD stock was trading closer to $119 a share before the downgrade -- so despite the rating technically saying only to hold, investors sold.
The news isn't all bad. In its note, Barclays forecast continued market-share gains for AMD (at Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) expense) ""in both the client and server markets."" Indeed, Barclays believes sales growth could exceed 31% in fiscal 2022. Problem is, by the time 2023 rolls around, Barclays believes ""cyclical risk [will arrive] across several end markets (PC, Gaming, and broad-based/XLNX).""
All three of these markets, you see, have been ""running at elevated levels"" for AMD, but both Intel and ARM are becoming more competitive. Barclays believes that by the 2024/2025 time frame, Intel could catch back up to AMD, and ARM could even take ""more share.""
Now what
So...not such great news for Advanced Micro Devices here -- but don't make the mistake of assuming that this is all good news for Intel. As Barclays confides, it's still unclear how much progress Intel has made ""in closing the process gap"" with AMD's chips. Although it's true that Intel stock at less than 11 times earnings looks a lot cheaper than AMD stock at 48 times earnings, Barclays still rates Intel stock ""underweight"" (i.e., sell) with a $45 price target.
The worst it will say about AMD is that the future is too murky for it to recommend buying AMD now that the stock has run up 47% over the past year. And if the worst Barclays sees for AMD is a $115 stock price, then the downside risk here doesn't look too bad.

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The semiconductor supply chain has become so tangled that its head is biting its tail. ASM International is one company that supplies gear needed to make chips. In an interview with Nikkei Asia the Dutch company’s boss, Benjamin Loh, said https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/Chip-tool-maker-warns-of-delays-as-semiconductor-crunch-bites lead times for producing its machines have extended because it is having trouble finding enough chips itself.
Semiconductor producers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Intel are responding to shortages by trying to ramp up production. Their new factories need machines in them, and that has swamped the makers. Fellow Dutch firm ASML, which makes lithography machines for chipmakers, has also warned of problems increasing its output.
Another wrinkle is that ASM International’s biggest customers focus on producing cutting-edge chips. Yet the worst shortages are in less advanced semiconductors – the ones AMS International is having to fight over with other users, including carmakers. History shows that chip shortages resolve themselves thanks to market forces and innovation. But today's supply chain woes will take a while to straighten out. (By Robert Cyran)

Between March 14 (the Nasdaq's low point) and March 28, the tech-laden index has gained 14%, while the S&P 500 is up almost 9%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up just 5.3%. Semiconductors are leading the way back, with stocks like Nvidia and Intel posting double-digit gains.

Obviously, no one knows in advance when markets will crash nor when they will reach inflection points and turn upward again, which is why it pays to not take your money out of stocks when times look bleak. Instead, the right course is to remain in the market, and if possible to take advantage by buying shares of good companies that have been beaten down.
Although the Nasdaq 100 has cut its losses by more than half, there are still good bargains in the tech sector -- among them, this pair of companies with explosive growth potential.

Palantir Technologies
Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) is a data analytics shop that once crunched numbers solely for shadowy agencies in the spy world and national security state, but has since expanded into Big Data for enterprise-level businesses.
The stock has bounced off its February lows, but it remains 55% below its 52-week high, and is as good a buy now as has been at almost any time since its 2020 initial public offering. Offered at just $10 a share, Palantir's stock today trades less than 30% above that level, even though Wall Street forecasts it will grow earnings at a compound annual rate of 40% a year for the next five years, and its revenue is expected to more than double to over $3.5 billion by the middle of the decade.
Although Palantir's government analytics platform, Gotham, still provides 58% of its annual revenue, Foundry, the commercial side of its business, particularly in the U.S., is the faster-growing segment.
Its U.S. business sales more than doubled in 2021, and its U.S. commercial count rose nearly five-fold for the year. Net dollar retention, or how much revenue has expanded or contracted over a certain time period, jumped to 150% in 2021 for its enterprise customers, outpacing the 146% gain for its government contracts. So both businesses are growing smartly, but there is more expansion opportunity on the private sector side.
Palantir Technologies has risen by 35% from its low point, but the company looks to have plenty of upside for years to come.

AT&T
Investors have a unique chance to connect with AT&T (NYSE: T) again before the spinoff of WarnerMedia, which will be merged with Discovery (NASDAQ: DISCA)(NASDAQ: DISCK) to form a new business, of which AT&T will own 71%. The entertainment business proved a misguided acquisition that saddled AT&T with debt. By shedding it, the telecom will be able to more narrowly focus its attention on its communications operations at a time when the adoption of 5G is taking off.
However, the markets seem to have instead focused mostly on the fact that AT&T will slash its dividend by nearly half following the divestiture. As a result, the telecom's stock has tumbled by 21% over the last year. However, AT&T's payout currently yields 8.7% annually. Even halved, it will still be one of the top dividend yields among the Fortune 500.
The deal is expected to close on April 5, at which time AT&T shareholders will receive 0.24 shares of the new Warner Bros Discovery company for each AT&T share they own. The telecom also said its board set its second-quarter dividend at $0.2775 per share. So investors in AT&T will still get a healthy dividend payment, will have shares in what could be a new growth company, and will have the growing value of the 5G communications space to look forward to.
It's expected that much of the growth will come from consumers spending more on enhanced video, augmented reality and virtual reality, and digital gaming over 5G networks. Swedish telecom Ericsson estimates that communications service providers like AT&T will receive $3.7 trillion of the anticipated $31 trillion the entire consumer 5G network market could be worth by 2030.
It's an explosive time for the segment, and AT&T investors should reap the rewards.

That's why everyone's portfolio looks at least a little different from anyone else's. And that's the way things should be.
There are a few companies, however, that are so all-weather and so reliable that they're at home in anyone's portfolio. Here's a rundown of three of these names you may want to think about scooping up if you don't own them already.
Image source: Getty Images.
Alphabet
You know the company. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is, of course, parent to search engine giant Google, which as of Global Stats' most recent data, still handles 92% of the world's search traffic. Each of those searches is ultimately another revenue-bearing ad impression. Alphabet is also behind the world's biggest online repository of digital video, YouTube, which serves up more than a billion hours' worth of content every single day to over two billion monthly users.
And while it's not a major profit center in and of itself, the Android operating system falls under Alphabet's umbrella too, positioning the company as the proverbial middleman between most of the world's mobile device owners and the internet. Global Stats indicates Android powers more than 70% of the planet's actively-used smartphones and tablets, funneling this crowd toward Google's revenue-bearing platforms.
The prominence of Alphabet's place in our cultural landscape is tied to the extreme unlikelihood the world will suddenly stop using the internet or suddenly lose interest in quick, easy-to-access, entertaining videos. People are now leaning on Google, YouTube, and Android out of sheer habit without giving it a second thought, generating revenue for Alphabet's coffers every day.
In this vein, the company has posted year-over-year revenue declines in only two quarters over the course of the past 10 years with one of those lulls linked to the arrival of COVID-19 in North America.
Texas Instruments
When most investors think of computer hardware companies to invest in, names like NVIDIA or Intel come to mind. And understandably so -- these are the companies that helped usher in the modern technology era.
There's a problem with owning stocks of this ilk, however. That is, these companies are operating in hypercompetitive slivers of the industry, and they're one design flaw or one foundry problem away from hard times. The more reliable plays from the technology sector are focused on the simpler, perpetually marketable products like sensors, transistors, and other solutions you'll often find soldered to a circuit board.
Enter Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN).
You may recognize the company first and foremost for its calculators, but there's so much more to this operation. Its semiconductors are found in broadband modems; it's supporting the autonomous driving evolution; and you'll even find its tech installed in an aircraft cockpit, just to name a few. And yet, most people can't actually name one specific item (aside from calculators) that Texas Instruments makes. That's the point. It's the supplier within the technology sector you never think about but would definitely miss if it were to unexpectedly stop production.
The kicker: Texas Instruments has raised its annual dividend for 18 straight years at an annualized rate of 25%. Yet, with last year's payout of $4.21 per share still only a fraction of the $8.26 the company earned, there's plenty of room for continued payout growth. The stock's current yield stands at 2.5%.
Dollar General
Finally, add Dollar General (NYSE: DG) to the list of stocks anyone should consider adding to their portfolio.
At first blush, it feels like any retailer that has to compete with Walmart is already operating at a disadvantage. That's not quite the case here, however. Dollar General is using its smaller stores to its advantage, doing things Walmart can't (or at least won't). Namely, the company is catering to the small-town crowd that might not be looking to drive too far just to pick up a few things. The company says 75% of its 18,000-plus stores are located in communities with populations of less than 20,000, offering them basics like milk, bread, frozen foods, and other consumer goods that are necessary but not necessarily accessible at other nearby stores.
And the model works. Dollar General's top line has more than doubled over the past 10 years.
Look for the discount retailer to continue nabbing market share from bigger rivals like Walmart and Kroger, too. Its DG Fresh initiative, launched in 2019, is now supplying around 2,000 stores with perishable goods like dairy items and fresh produce, but given enough time, that number could be ratcheted up to 10,000 of its locations.
In the meantime, the company is taking a more direct stab at Walmart and rivals like Party City and Five Below. While its new pOpshelf brand of stores is still more of an experiment than a profit center, this suburb-focused concept will target a more affluent customer base that the Dollar General brand cannot. It still offers convenience and accessibility that Walmart doesn't, though.
The company aims to have pOpshelf locations up and running by 2025.

2022-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,2 Dividend Tech Stocks to Buy While the Market Is Down,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-dividend-tech-stocks-to-buy-while-the-market-is-down,,,"The S&P 500 is inching its way back toward its previous highs, but there are still quality companies trading at cheap valuations and some pay dividends with yields that far exceed the index's current average of 1.26%.
Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are riding strong demand trends in the semiconductor industry. Both trade at a discount to the average valuation of other blue chips and, at current share prices, both sport yields of more than 2.4%. Here's why it's the right time to open positions in these two tech component suppliers.
INTC Dividend Yield data by YCharts
1. Broadcom
Broadcom is a key supplier of networking components, such as fiber optic transmitters, ethernet switches, and embedded processors that are used in data centers. Given the long-term tailwinds favoring higher enterprise spending on data center capacity, Broadcom is a solid growth stock to consider. Its share price has tripled over the last five years, but its dividend still yields an above-average 2.4%.
It's uncommon to find a growth stock with such a high yield. For example, high-flying graphics chip maker Nvidia's dividend yields just 0.06% at its current share price. Growing companies usually have plenty of ways to reinvest more of their profits into new product lines, delivering returns to investors by growing the business. But Broadcom has benefited from rising demand for its products while also returning nearly half of its free cash flow to shareholders in dividends. This reflects a strong and very profitable business.
Broadcom reported solid revenue growth of 16% year over year in the first quarter of its fiscal 2022, which ended Jan. 30. Management credited accelerating demand from enterprise IT spending, upgrades in data centers and cloud service providers, and telecommunication companies that are deploying next-generation fiber-to-the-home service.
While the company continues to experience long lead times in the supply chain, the best news was the outlook. Management expects revenue growth to accelerate in its fiscal second quarter compared to the prior-year quarter's 15% growth rate.
The outlook for double-digit growth is compelling for a stock that trades at a modest valuation of 17.5 times fiscal 2022 earnings estimates. The dividend has increased from $1.94 per share in fiscal 2016 to an expected full-year payment of $16.40 in fiscal 2022. The steady rise in the dividend is supported by free cash flow that more than doubled to $13.3 billion over that period.
With the company experiencing robust demand for its products, this is a solid investment that could beat the average return of the market.

2. Intel
Intel has lost some market share to rival Advanced Micro Devices over the last few years, which has contributed to its stock price underperforming the broader market. But Intel has started to fight back. Since the third quarter of 2021, its share of central processing units (CPUs) sold improved from 60% to 66%, according to data from Passmark Software. This improvement came after Intel started shipping its new Alder Lake (Intel 7) 10-nanometer processors last year. In July, Intel unveiled a detailed roadmap for its plan to regain market leadership through 2025 and beyond, and it seems to already be showing progress.
Intel's weak performance over the last few years, during which it suffered from manufacturing delays that postponed the release of its 7-nanometer chips (Intel 4), doesn't mean it can't catch up. This is a company that generates $79 billion in revenue and spends $15 billion on research and development every year. There's plenty of free cash flow to fund a growing dividend.
Intel recently raised its quarterly payout by 5% to $0.365 per share. That brings the dividend yield to an attractive 2.7% at recent share prices. Even as free cash flow fell last year to $11.3 billion, the company paid out 50% of that free cash in dividends. That combination of a relatively modest payout ratio and a high yield makes Intel a great income stock since it can sustain dividend increases even as it invests to speed up innovation in advanced process technologies.
The stock trades at 15 times 2022 earnings estimates, which is below the market average earnings multiple of 18. It's also well below AMD's forward P/E of 30.
With Intel starting to reassert its enormous financial advantages over its smaller rival, this would be a good time to place a bet on a comeback by Chipzilla, especially while it trades at a discounted valuation and pays a dividend with an above-average yield.

2022-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-U.S. warned firms about Russia's Kaspersky software day after invasion -sources,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-u.s.-warned-firms-about-russias-kaspersky-software-day-after-invasion-sources,,,"By Christopher Bing
March 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. government began privately warning some American companies the day after Russia invaded Ukraine that Moscow could manipulate software designed by Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky to cause harm, according to a senior U.S. official and two people familiar with the matter.
The classified briefings are part of Washington's broader strategy to prepare providers of critical infrastructure such as water, telecoms and energy for potential Russian intrusions.
President Joe Biden said last week that sanctions imposed on Russia for its Feb. 24 attack on Ukraine could result in a backlash, including cyber disruptions, but the White House did not offer specifics.
""The risk calculation has changed with the Ukraine conflict,"" said the senior U.S. official about Kaspersky's software. ""It has increased.""
Kaspersky, one of the cybersecurity industry's most popular anti-virus software makers, is headquartered in Moscow and was founded by a former Russian intelligence officer, Eugene Kaspersky.
A Kaspersky spokeswoman said in a statement that the briefings about purported risks of Kaspersky software would be ""further damaging"" to Kaspersky’s reputation ""without giving the company the opportunity to respond directly to such concerns"" and that it ""is not appropriate or just.""
The senior U.S. official said Kaspersky's Russia-based staff could be coerced into providing or helping establish remote access into their customers' computers by Russian law enforcement or intelligence agencies.
Kaspersky, which has an office in the United States, lists partnerships with Microsoft, Intel and IBM on its website. Microsoft declined to comment. Intel and IBM did not respond to requests for comment.
On March 25, the Federal Communications Commission added Kaspersky to its list of communications equipment and service providers deemed threats to U.S. national security.
It is not the first time Washington has said Kaspersky could be influenced by the Kremlin.
The Trump administration spent months banning Kaspersky from government systems and warning numerous companies to not use the software in 2017 and 2018.
U.S. security agencies conducted a series of similar cybersecurity briefings surrounding the Trump ban. The content of those meetings four years ago was comparable to the new briefings, said one of the people familiar with the matter.
Over the years, Kaspersky has consistently denied wrongdoing or any secret partnership with Russian intelligence.
It is unclear whether a specific incident or piece of new intelligence led to the security briefings. The senior official declined to comment on classified information.
Until now no U.S. or allied intelligence agency has ever offered direct, public proof of a backdoor in Kaspersky software.
Following the Trump decision, Kaspersky opened a series of transparency centers, where it says partners can review its code to check for malicious activity. A company blog post at the time explained the goal was to build trust with customers after the U.S. accusations.
But the U.S. official said the transparency centers are not ""even a fig leaf"" because they do not address the U.S. government's concern.
""Moscow software engineers handle the [software] updates, that's where the risk comes,"" they said. ""They can send malicious commands through the updaters and that comes from Russia.""
Cybersecurity experts say that because of how anti-virus software normally functions on computers where it is installed, it requires a deep level of control to discovery malware. This makes anti-virus software an inherently advantageous channel to conduct espionage.
In addition, Kaspersky's products are also sometimes sold under white label sales agreements. This means the software can be packaged and renamed in commercial deals by information technology contractors, making their origin difficult to immediately determine.
While not referring to Kaspersky by name, Britain's cybersecurity centre on Tuesday said organizations providing services related to Ukraine or critical infrastructure should reconsider the risk associated with using Russian computer technology in their supply chains.
""We have no evidence that the Russian state intends to suborn Russian commercial products and services to cause damage to UK interests, but the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,"" the National Cyber Security Centre said in a blog post.

2022-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting INTC Put And Call Options For May 13th,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-intc-put-and-call-options-for-may-13th,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the May 13th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new May 13th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $49.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.71. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $49.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $47.29 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $50.74/share today.
Because the $49.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.49% return on the cash commitment, or 29.62% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $49.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $51.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.07. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $50.74/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $51.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.59% if the stock gets called away at the May 13th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $51.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $51.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.08% boost of extra return to the investor, or 34.63% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $50.74) to be 29%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,Alphabet's (GOOGL) Waymo Gears up to Enter Downtown Phoenix,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alphabets-googl-waymo-gears-up-to-enter-downtown-phoenix,,,"In a bid to expand the reach of Waymo cars, Alphabet GOOGL is set to hit the streets of downtown Phoenix with its self-driving cars — Jaguar I-PACE and Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans.

Waymo has been taking measurements in downtown and midtown Phoenix for the past few weeks.

Per the plans, Waymo rides will be initially available to the company’s employees. Gradually, Waymo will roll out its Early Rider program, which is now called Trusted Tester, to the public.

The latest move marks Waymo’s further expansion in Phoenix. Notably, Waymo vehicles began its ride-hailing service from the East Valley of Phoenix.
Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus
Alphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote
Growing Waymo Efforts
The latest move bodes well for Waymo’s growing efforts toward expanding its ride-hailing service across the United States.

The company recently revealed that it would make its ride-hailing vehicles fully driverless on the streets of San Francisco. This also marks Waymo’s first expansion outside Phoenix.

The company recently partnered with Geely, a China-based automotive company. Per the terms of the deal, Geely’s electric mobility brand, Zeekr, will design and develop electric vehicles for Waymo, into which Waymo Driver will be integrated.

The vehicles will be first introduced on the roads of the United States. With the Geely partnership, Waymo will expand its Waymo One fleet.

Apart from this, Waymo teamed up with Google’s Maps to ensure a seamless booking experience for Waymo One. This enables customers to book Waymo One directly from the Maps app.

The endeavors will help Alphabet further penetrate the booming autonomous driving space.

Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the worldwide driverless vehicle market is expected to see a CAGR of 18.06% between 2021 and 2026.
Intensifying Competition
Given the upbeat scenario, not only Alphabet but companies like Amazon AMZN, Intel INTC and Baidu BIDU are also making every effort to capitalize on the growth prospects in the autonomous driving space.

Amazon’s buyout of Zoox, a developer of autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, remains a major positive. Further, the company’s launch of its first self-driving robotaxi strengthened its position in the autonomous driving space.

Zoox has been testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, Las Vegas and Foster City. It intends to open an engineering office and operations facility this year, which will act as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing.

Meanwhile, Intel is gaining from the low power consumption of Mobileye chips and the ability to create maps for self-driving systems. The company intends on introducing a pilot for autonomous taxis and ride-hailing services in Munich and Tel Aviv in 2022.

2022-03-30 00:00:00+00:00,Insider Buying Heating Up at McDonald’s and Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/insider-buying-heating-up-at-mcdonalds-and-intel,,,"I don't think I need to be the one telling you that a company's internal operations are well oiled when its own management chooses to assume financial liability on the very company it's working for. It's both trivial and theoretically substantiated that insiders buy their own company's stock when they believe the firm's prospects could yield financial gains in the short-to-medium term.
The insider buying feature at TipRanks allows us to track the transactions of companies' management, and I've noticed some unusual activity at McDonald's (MCD) and Intel (INTC). I subsequently analyzed the two companies' recent developments and decided that I'm bullish on both.
McDonald's Stock Analysis
The multinational fast food corporation's low-sales price business model could serve it well in the coming year. The firm sells Giffen goods; Giffen goods are lower-cost goods with a high-substitution effect during challenging economic times.
I believe we'll see many consumers substituting expensive food choices for more affordable options in the medium term as non-core inflation just doesn't seem to find calm.
Insiders at McDonald's are clearly optimistic about the stock's near-term prospects. Insiders gobbled up $244.2K worth of MCD shares in the past three months, with the latest informative sell taking place way back in October 2021.
It's encouraging to see that McDonald's price-to-earnings ratio of 24.7x is accommodated by a PEG ratio of only 0.40x. Cohesively considered, the two metrics tell us that the stock is trading 2.5 times below its current earnings growth, meaning that most stock market participants haven't priced in McDonald's earnings growth just yet.
Turning to Wall Street, McDonald's has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 20 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months.
The average McDonald's stock price target of $282.73 implies 13.6% upside potential.
Intel Stock Analysis
There's a lot of buzz in the tech space regarding Intel's new Iris Plus, which is being touted as one of the best GPUs in the business. Although Intel is an established multinational, tech stocks in themselves are only as promising as their next invention.
Deutsche Bank's (DB) Ross Seymore agrees with my narrative and thinks Intel is turning matters around after the company plateaued for the past decade. Seymore stated: ""We believe the tangible proof of success on these efforts may take years to demonstrate, as proving the execution engine is on track and regaining investors' trust after years of misexecution will likely take longer than a few quarters.""
Bullish insiders at Intel overshadowed the bears by a ratio of 4-to-1. $497.2K worth of Intel shares were purchased by insiders during the previous quarter, suggesting that something special may be brewing.
I personally find a liking to Intel's valuation prospects. The stock is severely undervalued, with its price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios trading at five-year discounts worth 17% and 14.8%, respectively, suggesting that it holds value in abundance.
On Wall Street, Intel has a Hold consensus rating based on eight Buys, 13 Holds, and seven Sells assigned in the past three months.
The average Intel stock price target of $53.76 implies 4.5% upside potential.
Concluding Thoughts
As an investor, you should use the insider buying signals as part of your analysis but don't consider them as the only variable before making your investment decisions. My analysis leads me to believe that McDonald's is economically aligned to prosper in 2022 and that Intel could perform well due to the transformation of its product range.

2022-03-30 00:00:00+00:00,4 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for April,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-for-april,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC): Its Core i9-12900KS processor claims to be the “world’s fastest desktop processor.”
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU): Solid net income growth of 118.12% in 2021
Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO): Down nearly 17% in 2022 and is now very attractive
Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX): The impressive free cash flow growth of 68.42% in 2021 is supportive of the stock price

Semiconductor stocks have taken a beating in 2022 with a risk-off sentiment and concerns about how aggressively the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. The supply chain problems persist and the global chip shortage is still unsolved. However, at the same time, there is high demand for goods that depend on semiconductors, like cars and mobile phones.
The main U.S stock indexes have recently made a strong rebound, so it is important to invest in high-quality stocks that are attractive based on their valuation. As a reference, the Nasdaq Composite Index had a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.35 as of Mar. 25.  Additionally, the Information Technology Sector had median values of forward P/E GAAP of 26.34 and forward price-to-sales (P/S) of 3.29.
7 Stocks to Buy as the Fed Raises Rates
Here are four semiconductor stocks that are strong buys in the short-term. They all have strong fundamentals, are undervalued, and have strong long-term growth prospects:
INTC Intel Corporation $52.43
MU Micron Technologies $85.64
QRVO Qorvo $131.34
LRCX Lam Research $564.04

Intel has a P/E Ratio trailing twelve months (TTM) of 10.77 and is now flat in 2022. The forward dividend and yield of $1.46 and 2.79%, respectively, are attractive and so is its valuation. The forward P/E GAAP is 17.40 and the forward P/S is 2.81.
The expected three to five year earnings per share (EPS) is 7.5%. Intel has announced that its new Core i9-12900KS processor is a game-changer as it will be the fastest desktop processor in the world. This is a significant milestone that can boost sales, especially for desktop computer users that rely on speed and are fine with paying the relevant high price.
Micron Technology (MU)

Micron Technology has seen its shares having losses of nearly 110% in 2022.
In 2021, the firm reported an impressive net income growth of 118.12%. With a P/E Ratio (TTM) of 13.03, MU stock seems cheap. It has a forward P/E GAAP of 8.2 and a forward P/S of 2.79. It gets better as MU stock has also a price/earnings to growth (PEG) GAAP (TTM) of only 0.09, reflecting an undervalued stock.
7 Retail Stocks Worth a Buy Now
The expected three to five year EPS growth of 24.2%  is very promising, indicating a stock that offers both value and plenty of growth.
Semiconductor Stocks to Buy: Qorvo (QRVO)

Shares of Qorvo have losses of nearly 17% in 2022. QRVO stock has a PE Ratio (TTM) of 13.29 and on a forward valuation it has a forward P/E GAAP of 13.82 and a forward P/S of 3.09.
Sales growth in 2021 was nearly 24% and net income growth surged by 119.4%.
Qorvo is expected to have a three to five year EPS growth of 10.09%, which is both attractive and seems sustainable. The stock has a PEG GAAP (TTM) of 0.1, which is another strong indication of being undervalued.
Lam Research (LRCX)

This fourth semiconductor stock has losses of 22% in 2022. This represents an investment opportunity based on its valuation and strong fundamentals, like the nearly 69% growth of free cash flow in 2021.
The PE Ratio (TTM) of 17.53 is the first indication of a stock that is attractive compared to the broader Nasdaq Composite Index. LRCX stock has a P/E GAAP (FWD) of 17.52 and a forward P/S of 4.59. The latter may not seem that attractive compared to the median value of its sector, but on the other hand, the stock has a PEG GAAP (TTM) of only 0.3.
7 Dividend Stocks That Can Withstand Inflation
What about growth? LRCX stock offers more than just a very attractive valuation now. The expected three to five year EPS growth is very promising at 18.88%.

March 30 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger earned 1,711 times as much as the average worker at the U.S. chipmaker in just 11 months since he joined in February last year, a regulatory filing showed on Wednesday.
Compared to Gelsinger, former CEO Bob Swan had earned 217 times more than the average Intel employee in 2020.
Gelsinger earned $178.6 million in 2021 with stock awards making up nearly 79% of his total compensation, which was about 698% higher than Swan's 2020 pay.
Executive pay has been rising in the United States. Apple Inc AAPL.O CEO Tim Cook earned 1,447 times the average employee's salary at the tech giant in 2021. Shareholders of Apple approved the pay package despite proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services pushing against it.
Intel has asked shareholders to vote in favor of its executives' compensation at the annual stockholder's meeting on May 12. It did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
After Gelsinger took the reins at Intel, once a world leader in chip-making technology, he unveiled a turnaround strategy for the company to regain its dominance in the semiconductor industry, currently led by Taiwan's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TSM.N2330.TW.
Intel's shares rose 6.8% last year after declining about 17% the year before as the company faced a manufacturing crisis and struggled with competition. The shares were up 0.3% at $52.41 on Wednesday.
Earlier this month, Intel laid out the first details of a $88 billion investment plan spanning across six European Union countries including a massive investment in Germany.
Gelsinger was CEO of VMWare Inc VMW.N before he returned to Intel as its top boss. He had spent 30 years at Intel before leaving.
His compensation included one-time new-hire equity awards with a target value of about $110 million, according to the filing.

2022-03-30 00:00:00+00:00,7 Blue-Chip Stocks With Dividends to Add to Your Buy List,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-blue-chip-stocks-with-dividends-to-add-to-your-buy-list,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The U.S. Federal Reserve announced last week that it would be hiking interest rates more aggressively in its efforts to curb rampant inflation. That’s leading investors away from high-yielding and risky stocks to safer options.
Perhaps the best strategy at this time is to invest in blue-chip stocks with dividends, which offer consistent returns and healthy dividend payouts.
Adding blue-chip stocks to your portfolio can significantly reduce your market risk and create consistent shareholder value. Blue-chips protect shareholders from capital erosion in the event of a downturn.
Moreover, consistent dividend payouts and share repurchases often compensate for their inability to offer outsized returns.
7 Stocks to Buy as the Fed Raises Rates
Having said that, let’s look at seven of the best blue-chip stocks with dividends to supercharge your portfolio:
Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM)
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)
Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)
AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP)

Annual Dividend: $1.60

Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has played a key role in marginalizing Covid-19 with its hugely successful vaccine. It raked in billions in revenue from vaccine sales in the last 18 months but still boasts an incredible growth runway ahead.
With experts suggesting that the pandemic will transition into endemic, the vaccine it co-developed with BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) will remain relevant for a long time.
Layer that up with Pfizer’s incredible pipeline, robust products and a Covid-19 antiviral pill in Paxlovid and investors are looking at a spectacular time ahead. Furthermore, it boasts one of the strongest dividend profiles in its sector, with more than 3% yield and 12 years of dividend growth.

Intel (INTC) stock has been disappointingly range-bound for years.
The relentless spirit of innovation will help the stock to finally get un-stuck.
Investors should buy shares of Intel as this might be their last chance to get them at a discount.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is among the world’s most famous microprocessor suppliers. INTC stock is still relatively cheap, and both current and prospective investors should buy at least a few shares now.
No company can rescue the world from tech-component supply issues. Yet, Intel is well-positioned to help solve the “chip crunch” as multiple developed nations struggle with semiconductor shortages.
As we’ll see, innovation will be the key to Intel’s continued profitability. By offering solutions to the world’s problems, Intel will create a win-win scenario for consumers, national economies and, inevitably, its shareholders.

What’s Happening With INTC Stock?
Intel has made it so easy to invest profitably, it’s quite remarkable. It’s not every day that market technicians are given a stock with such a clear-cut and consistent support level.
At least half a dozen times over the past five years, INTC stock has bounced off of the $45 level. There’s no such thing as a guaranteed, hardwood floor in the financial markets, but this support level has been surprisingly reliable.
However, there’s also a stubborn resistance level at $70. Every time the Intel share price gets close to that price, the sellers come rushing in.

Of course, the worldwide microchip shortage made it difficult for INTC stock to break out of its defined range in 2021. Yet, this hasn’t stopped Intel from pushing the envelope as a tech innovator.
For instance, Intel recently launched a $1 billion fund to “support early-stage startups and established companies building disruptive technologies for the foundry ecosystem.”
Clearly, new technologies — including yet-to-be-discovered chip architectures — remain a high priority for Intel. This $1 billion investment is just the beginning, though, as Intel is audaciously pouring much more capital into next-generation tech-component solutions.
Landmark Investments
Indeed, $1 billion is a drop in the bucket compared to the 33+ billion euros, and eventually the 80 billion euros, that Intel plans to invest in top-tier technology.
Believe it or not, Intel intends to invest as much as 80 billion euros in the European Union over the next ten years to support the semiconductor value chain. Targeted areas will include research and development (R&D), manufacturing and packaging technologies.
There will be multiple phases to this grand plan. In the first phase, Intel will develop two first-of-their-kind semiconductor fabs (fabrication facilities) in Magdeburg, Germany.
Intel also plans to double the manufacturing space in an expansion project based in Leixlip, Ireland. Plus, Intel is negotiating to “to enable a state-of-the-art back-end manufacturing facility” in Italy.
Don’t worry — Intel isn’t spending money recklessly on these innovative endeavors. Rest assured, the company still expects to generate revenue of $76 billion in 2022. Moreover, Intel anticipates its year-over-year revenue growth to move into the mid-to-high single-digit percentages in 2023 and 2024.
What You Can Do Now
INTC stock won’t stay range-bound forever. Patience will pay off as Intel remains committed to both revenue generation and game-changing innovation.
At the end of the day, Intel is a terrific problem solver and deserves every tech-market investor’s attention. Thus, owning at least a few shares of Intel is a sensible and forward-thinking thing to do.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was among the best performing tech stocks of 2021. Although the stock did come under pressure this year, it has so far weathered the market-wide downturn relatively better than most of its tech peers. NVDA stock is down about 6% year-to-date (YTD) compared to the 9.5% drop for the Nasdaq 100 Index.

Industry-leading growth, solid product momentum, strong execution and innovation are all secret recipes that have powered the Nvidia growth engine. The only pushback now seems to be the stock’s stretched valuation.
Is Nvidia still a buy at current levels?
How NVDA Stock Makes Money
Nvidia derives the bulk of its revenues by selling gaming chips, predominantly to the PC industry. These graphic processing units (GPUs) also go into streaming services and console gaming devices.
The company is also heavily reliant on data center chips that power compute-intensive workloads such as artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics, graphics and scientific computing across hyperscale, cloud enterprise, public sector and edge data centers.

Segment-wise Revenue Breakup For Nvidia In Q4’21

Nvidia took to the hot-and-happening metaverse by unveiling its Omniverse enterprise platform in April 2021. This platform is meant to facilitate real time collaboration of global 3D design teams in a shared virtual space.
Nvidia Evolving as Diversified Tech Play
Nvidia is not about merely chips anymore. It has developed a whole new array of products, bestowing on it the advantage of a diversified company.
The four-day 2022 GPU Technology Conference (GTC) underlined Nvidia’s ambitious plans. The company bumped up its long-term total addressable market opportunity to $1 trillion. The break-up works out as follows:
Gaming: $100 billion
Software (AI enterprise software & omniverse enterprise software): $300 billion
Chips & systems: $300 billion
Automotive: $300 billion
To put things in perspective, Nvidia is now seeing more potential outside of Gaming, which makes the biggest contribution to the top line.
Nvidia’s Hot New Technologies
Nvidia is currently targeting a massive AI inflection. At the GTC, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang announced updates to the company’s AI platform and the AI accelerated program that would ensure performance and reliability of AI applications developed by partners.
The Nvidia founder sees the company’s AI as the “software tool box of the world’s AI community.”
“Our GTC 2022 release is massive. Whether it’s creating more engaging chatbots and virtual assistants, building smarter recommendations to help consumers make better purchasing decisions, or orchestrating AI services at the largest scales, your superpowered gem is in NVIDIA AI.”
The auto end market is another promising opportunity for Nvidia, given the accelerated electric vehicle (EV) transformation that is underway. Team Green is cementing its position in the automotive segment with the latest Nvidia Drive Hyperion 8 platform and Drive Orin system-on-a-chip. The who’s who of the auto industry have all stitched up partnerships with Nvidia. The company puts the value of its automotive pipeline at over $11 billion.
Not to mention the metaverse opportunity. At the GTC 2022, the company announced Omniverse for developers.
Nvidia also launched Nvidia OVX, a computing system, to operate complex digital twin simulations that will run within the Nvidia Omniverse.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Harlan Sur summarized Nvidia’s all-pervasive push as follows:
“With leading silicon hardware and software platforms and a strong ecosystem, Nvidia is well positioned to continue to benefit from major secular trends in artificial intelligence, high performance computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles.”
NVDA Stock Trades at Elevated Valuation
Notwithstanding the recent pullback, NVDA stock is still trading at an elevated multiple of 51.08 times its forward earnings. This is amongst the highest in the industry. In comparison, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) trade at forward price-to-earnings multiples of 28.09 and 13.18, respectively.
Nvidia’s trailing twelve months (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is at 26.51. The metric is at 9.03 for Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), 2.5 for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), 8.52 for AMD and 12.31 for Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL).
Bottom Line on Nvidia Stock
Nvidia’s premium valuation may deter some investors. Sifting through the company’s performance metrics over the quarters, we see that the it has been able to grow revenues at a robust clip of 50% or more for seven straight quarters.
After bottoming in mid-2019, margins have been trending higher thanks to strong topline growth and operational efficiency. Nvidia is among those very few companies that consistently outperform relative to expectations on the bottom line. More importantly, Nvidia’s future holds a lot of promise as it finds itself in the sweet spot of cutting-edge technological innovation.
The recent pullback in shares presents an attractive entry point for those investors looking to ride the potential upside promised by this tech growth story.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-03-28 00:00:00+00:00,The Best Metaverse Stocks to Consider Buying Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-best-metaverse-stocks-to-consider-buying-now,,,"There's a lot of excitement surrounding the growth potential of the metaverse. The current concept of this word is still evolving, so don't concern yourself if it's fuzzy to you.
In simple terms, the metaverse can be thought of as a melding of the physical and virtual worlds. For investors, what's key to keep in mind is that the metaverse has the potential to be the next evolution of the internet. It seems on track to not only expand upon experiences now possible on the internet but also enable many new applications -- some of which nobody can even imagine yet. This is the nature of disruptive technology.
Last December, I wrote an article about the top 10 metaverse stocks in the world's first metaverse ETF. That article highlighted the basics of the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEMKT: METV), listed the fund's top 10 holdings, and included what I viewed as the best stocks in the top 10 group and the ones to avoid.
This article reviews where things stand with this ETF (which began trading on June 30, 2021) and my stock picks and pans at the one-quarter mark (one week after the one-quarter mark, to be exact). It also includes my current picks and pans.

Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF: Top 10 stock holdings as of original article
The below chart includes the top 10 holdings of the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF as of my original article on this topic, published on Dec. 17, 2021. These holdings are listed in order of the best to the worst performers from that date through March 25, 2022. For context, the performance of the ETF itself is shown along with the performance of the Nasdaq Composite, which is the best benchmark index for this article's purpose since it's heavily composed of stocks in the technology realm.
The stock market has struggled during the period shown in the chart. The market's decline started late last year largely because of expectations that the Federal Reserve was poised to begin raising interest rates in early 2022 and continue doing so throughout the year in order to help control inflationary pressures. (The first rate hike -- for 0.25% -- occurred earlier this month.) Tech growth stocks and other interest-rate-sensitive stocks have generally been hit the hardest over this period. And then in late February, a new reason for market volatility occurred: Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Data sources: Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF, Yahoo! Finance, author's original article on this topic. EPS = earnings per share. *Assets under management. All data except first part of column 2 (ranking) as of March 25, 2022.
Here are some key updates investors should know about the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF, an index fund that's rebalanced quarterly:
Ticker symbol change: On Jan. 31, this ETF's ticker symbol changed to METV from META. The company didn't comment on the reason for the change, but it seems safe to assume it was made to avoid confusion with Meta Platforms. In October, the company formerly called Facebook announced its name change to reflect its focus on the metaverse.
Number of holdings: The fund now has 44 stock holdings, up from 40 in my first article.
Expense ratio: The expense ratio is now 0.59%, down from 0.75%. This decline is small, but small decreases can make notable differences over long periods.
As the chart shows, Qualcomm and Tencent Holdings are no longer in the fund's top 10 holdings. They are now its 11th- and 15th-largest holdings, respectively. So which two stocks have moved into the top 10? Social media company Snap (No. 6) and Sea Limited (No. 7), a Singapore-based digital entertainment and e-commerce company in which Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings owns a sizable stake.
How did my first round of picks and pans do?
One quarter is a brief period, so it's early in the game from a long-term investing standpoint. That said, I got off to a good start with this initiative. Here's the first part of my conclusion from the original article:
The Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF looks like a solid way for investors to get exposure to the metaverse. The drawback of ETFs is the same as their advantage: diversification. Indeed, investors willing to do some work and select individual stocks should have a decent shot at outperforming this fund.
As to the last sentence, six of the ETF's top 10 holdings at the time of my first article performed better than the ETF over the period noted in the chart. And four performed better than the Nasdaq Composite. Here is the second part of my conclusion from the original article:
If you're looking for a larger company that's profitable, it's probably hard to go wrong with Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, or Apple. Meta Platforms (the former Facebook) isn't as good a bet. It has higher regulatory risk than the other big U.S.-based tech companies, in my view. Moreover, it has nearly all its (revenue) eggs in one basket because it generates almost all of its revenue from digital advertising.
Risk-averse investors should steer clear of Tencent Holdings because it's headquartered in China. The Chinese government has been cracking down on tech companies, making their regulatory risk high.
The four stocks I called out as ""hard to go wrong with"" -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple -- were the only four of the original top 10 that outperformed the Nasdaq Composite, as well as the ETF. Apple and Nvidia held up particularly well during this challenging period.
I was right about Meta Platforms stock being not as good a bet back in December, as it lost one-third of its value in just over one quarter. My advice to steer clear of Tencent also proved good, as the stock declined 16.5% over a period in which the Nasdaq Composite fell ""only"" 6.4%.
Letting my four ""big tech"" stock picks ride -- and one key thing Nvidia investors should watch
Given that the Motley Fool is focused on the long term, it shouldn't come as a surprise that I'm letting my picks ride here. In other words, at this stage, most tech growth stock investors should still favor Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft, in my opinion.
My favorite of the group remains Nvidia -- my largest personal stock holding. ""Nvidia is a 'pick-and-shovel' play on the metaverse. That is, the computer gaming and tech giant provides the tools other companies need to create their own metaverses,"" as I wrote in my December article. Its Omniverse platform brings together the graphics chip specialist's expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), simulation, graphics, and computing infrastructure.
Investors in Nvidia should be watching one big happening on the near-term horizon: chipmaking goliath Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) long-awaited entrance into Nvidia's turf, discrete graphics processing units (GPU) for gamers and creators. Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, is currently the No. 2 player (behind Nvidia) in the discrete GPU market. The first of Intel's Arc-branded graphics cards for consumers could be launching as soon as this Wednesday, March 30, as the company has an online reveal event planned for this date at 11 a.m. ET.
One important note for Amazon, too: The e-commerce titan is scheduled to split its stock 20 for 1 on June 6. Investors who hold the stock at the close of the market on May 27 will receive 19 shares for every one share they own.
What about Meta Platforms and Tencent Holdings? I'm also reiterating my original call on these stocks. Granted, they've been beaten down a lot and there are good arguments for why their sell-offs have been overdone. Indeed, investors who have higher tolerances for risk might be well rewarded for nibbling at these stocks. But with interest rates rising, inflation increasing, and geopolitical tensions continuing, the market could be quite volatile for some time. Thus it seems prudent for investors who have an average (or low) tolerance for risk to continue to hold off on buying these two stocks.

2022-03-28 00:00:00+00:00,June 2023 Options Now Available For Intel (INTC),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/june-2023-options-now-available-for-intel-intc,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 2023 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 445 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new June 2023 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $44.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $51.14/share today.
Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 11.20% return on the cash commitment, or 9.19% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $50.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $52.50 strike price has a current bid of $5.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $51.14/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $52.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.41% if the stock gets called away at the June 2023 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $52.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $52.50 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 10.75% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.82% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 41%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 31%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $51.14) to be 29%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.
