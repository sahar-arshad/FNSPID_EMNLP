2022-01-26 00:00:00+00:00,Does Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/does-intel-nasdaq%3Aintc-have-a-healthy-balance-sheet,,,"David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.
When Is Debt A Problem?
Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.
How Much Debt Does Intel Carry?
You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of September 2021 Intel had US$40.3b of debt, an increase on US$36.6b, over one year. On the flip side, it has US$34.6b in cash leading to net debt of about US$5.67b.
NasdaqGS:INTC Debt to Equity History January 26th 2022
How Strong Is Intel's Balance Sheet?
According to the last reported balance sheet, Intel had liabilities of US$29.6b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$48.3b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$34.6b as well as receivables valued at US$8.61b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$34.6b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.
Given Intel has a humongous market capitalization of US$207.4b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.
In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.
Intel's net debt is only 0.16 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 50.3 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. But the other side of the story is that Intel saw its EBIT decline by 7.5% over the last year. That sort of decline, if sustained, will obviously make debt harder to handle. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Intel's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.
Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Intel recorded free cash flow worth 75% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.
Our View
Happily, Intel's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But truth be told we feel its EBIT growth rate does undermine this impression a bit. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that Intel takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. While that brings some risk, it can also enhance returns for shareholders. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Intel that you should be aware of before investing here.

2022-01-25 00:00:00+00:00,Apple's (AAPL) Supply Chain Woes Persist Ahead of Q1 Results,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apples-aapl-supply-chain-woes-persist-ahead-of-q1-results,,,"Apple AAPL is still grappling with supply chain constraints ahead of its first-quarter 2022 results.

Per a recent 9to5Mac article, the iPhone maker is still unable to meet demand with accurate supply. The ensemble of new products that the company is supposed to launch in 2022 is complicating the issue further.

Apple plans to report earnings on Jan 27. The company has not provided any official guidance for the first quarter due to uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting the manufacturing of chips.

Chip shortage supply is affecting the newly launched products, including the 14-inch MacBook and the 16-inch MacBook Pro. Delivery of these new products upon order might take up to eight weeks, highlighting the major supply shortage plaguing the company.
New Products With Advanced Chips Complicating Supply Chain Issues
The pandemic-induced chip shortage and supply chain constraints are already costing Apple billions in revenues ($6 billion in fourth-quarter fiscal 2021).

The launch of newer products with even more advanced chips and redesigned products without dealing with the already persistent new chip shortage issue is expected to negatively impact Apple’s prospects.

The iPhone maker is rumored to launch its first AR headset in the second half of 2022. The rumored AR headset has completed the second phase of prototype testing and is expected to be in production in the second quarter of 2022. The new iPhone models also comprise of the A15 Bionic Chip, which is currently the fastest in the industry. Apple is also speculated to launch AirPods 2 with lossless support. The latest changes include a new form factor design and a charging case that emits a sound for users to track.

These products require even more advanced chips and with the ongoing chip supply shortage, it will be worth seeing how Apple produces these products and meets supply accurately.

Reportedly, Apple has lowered its iPhone production target for the fourth quarter. Per Investors Business Daily, Mizuho Securities analyst Yasuo Nakane lowered his estimates for iPhone production in the fourth quarter to 90 million units from 95 million — a production decrease of 4% year over year.

However, Apple is taking necessary steps like reducing dependency on third-party providers like Intel INTC and Advanced Micro Devices AMD and creating facilities to manufacture its chips in order to address these issues.

I have been a big Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) bull for a long time now. All you have to do is look at a chart of NVDA stock over the past five years to see why. The company continues to dominate competitors and there is seemingly nothing to slow it down. 
NVDA) logo displayed on phone screen"" width=""300"" height=""169"">

When NVDA stock dipped during the Covid-19 selloff and everyone was seemingly losing their collective minds, I called Nvidia “a steal” below $50 (on a split-adjusted basis). For what it’s worth, I don’t say that to gloat. 
Trust me, that’s not my thing. I have been humbled far too many times that arrogance is now a superstition of mine. In any regard, I really bring that call up because, when things feel panicky, that’s when investors need to dial in and focus. Don’t get lost in the chaos. As a mentor of mine once said, when the market speeds up, slow down.
Currently down 35% from its all-time high, I think it’s safe to say things have officially sped up for NVDA stock. 
When to Buy the Dip in NVDA Stock
Nvidia is a former relative strength monster, but when shares were up more than 160% on the year at the highs, it was clear that it would have to cool off at some point. That point is now. Shares are down four weeks in a row and in eight of the last nine weeks. 
7 Dividend Stocks to Profit off the Hot Real Estate Market
On Jan. 21, NVDA stock filled the gap from Oct. 26. With a bit more downside, though, we’ll start to hit some more meaningful levels. Specifically, that’s the weekly VWAP measure, then the 200-day and 50-week moving averages.
If NVDA stock hits the 200-day, it will be down about 37% from the highs. If it hits the 50-week near its present value, shares will be down roughly 40% from the high.

If you love Nvidia and want some exposure, there are worse times to buy then after a 35% dip down toward the 200-day. However, if we get to the $195 to $200 area, I think that’s an area investors really need to consider adding some exposure. 
Not only is the 50-week a notable breakout area on the chart (blue line), but it’s also near the fourth-quarter low. 
While the markets could tumble into a bear market and NVDA stock lose 50% or more of its value, investors can bet on the long-term here. In the long run, this name will come back. It’s a matter of when, not if. 
Going below $195 and failing to get back above that does open Nvidia up to more potential downside. But we can revisit NVDA stock if that becomes the situation.
Why to Buy the Dip in Nvidia
Okay, so we know where to buy the dip, but why do we want to do that? Frankly, because Nvidia is one of the best companies I have ever seen. I like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and respect Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) — although I’m not attracted to the latter — but Nvidia dominates both.
AMD has robust growth and, like Nvidia, has continued to stun analysts, leaving them far too conservative and caught flat-footed. But Nvidia’s margin profile versus AMD shows which company really has the pricing power. Analysts (finally) expect approximately 60% revenue growth this year for Nvidia, with estimates calling for $26.7 billion in sales.

Source: Chart courtesy of Ycharts
Allow me to show you something. The chart to the side shows how much consensus revenue estimates have come up over the last 12 months. Will they be short again this year?
Estimates for calendar 2022 (fiscal 2023) call for 19% growth. While that seems like a big deceleration from the prior year, it’s still pretty darn impressive. Further, estimates for fiscal-year 2024 and 2025 also call for 16% and 19% revenue growth, respectively. 
It might be a little too aggressive, but can we make a bull case and say 20% annual revenue growth for the next three years? 
Given Nvidia’s end-markets — autonomous driving (AD), artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, graphics, supercomputing, cloud-computing, datacenters, metaverse and more — that’s not so far-fetched in my view. And if that’s the case, it answers the why part of why investors should be long NVDA stock.
One Risk to Create More Chaos
All that said, the one risk that really jumps out to me here is Nvidia’s planned acquisition of Arm. The $40 billion deal is nothing to sneeze at. While it will cost a pretty penny for Nvidia, it will significantly bolster its list of customers and give it an impressive portfolio. 
There’s incredible value there. However, if the deal falls through, I don’t know what will happen to NVDA stock. 
If the market remains in a sell-the-news mood, a failed deal might smack the share price lower. Will it be down 40% at that point? Or even 50%, maybe? For all we know, NVDA will rally back to $300-plus and pop on the news. Who really knows? 
I only mention this because headlines amid chaos can create sell-the-news reactions. I don’t think this is any different.

2022-01-25 00:00:00+00:00,S&P 500 Corrects Ahead Of Fed Meeting: Let's Check The Technicals,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sp-500-corrects-ahead-of-fed-meeting%3A-lets-check-the-technicals,,,"It's been a crazy start to what is expected to be the most pivotal week of market action in the first quarter. The outlook divergence among investors has never been wider as bulls and bears duked it out in the highest volume sessions for US public equities since the pandemic capitulation (March 2020).
Money managers are de-risking their portfolios ahead of the Fed's first policy meeting of 2022 and taking profits in big tech before their quarterly results are unveiled this week. Fear of a monetary shock coupled with margin pinching inflation fears (specifically regarding wages) is compelling shareholders to reduce exposure to rate-sensitive mega-cap tech names following an incredible nearly 2-year market-buoying rally. 
Nevertheless, S&P 500's break below the critical -10% correction marker (at excessively oversold RSI levels) has cash-heavy market participants putting money back to work. Fundamentals are taking back the stock market after months of euphoria-driven neglect, and this week's big-tech results could provide an excellent value-powered springboard for recently compressed growth equities.
The Fed's policy decision and subsequent Powell press conference Wednesday afternoon (1/26) will be the most important event of the week as it will tighten up interest rate expectations, which underpin the valuations of the entire public equity market. As long as nothing shocking transpires, I expect to see a relief rally with Jerome's market soothing words of a gradual monetary shift. 
The Daily Action
High-beta technology stocks were naturally at the forefront of this week's daily price action, following last week's consequential selling pressure spilling over. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 retreated as much as -18% from its November highs in Monday's session, less than 2% away from bear market territory (-20% or more decline from recent highs). Still, the selling is beginning to look overdone, and this growth-focused index is poised to bounce out of the excessively oversold RSI levels it's trading at.
The US 10-Year Treasury yield dipped marginally after touching 1.9% last week, in the all too familiar flight-to-safety rotation, with surging demand for the safety of bonds marginally pressuring yields since last week (out of risk-on stocks and into riskless bonds). 
WTI crude oil futures took off to the consensus analyst price target of $85/barrel in the first couple weeks of 2022 trading, which is the price WTI crude will conceivable oscillate around until the next catalyst (likely OPEC's February meeting next Wednesday). 
The VIX, aka the market's fear gauge, has been on a tear since the year began, opening 2022 around 16 but spiked to nearly 40 in less than 3 weeks as market anxieties took flight in this week's action (remaining in the 30s).
A New Market
The democratization of individual investing (commission-free trading accessible to anyone with a smartphone) coupled with pandemic boredom has driven millions of eager freshmen traders & investors into the stock market. 
Soaring market engagement from capital-infused institutional money managers and amateur traders has completely changed the market dynamics, with hyper-fast high volume momentum trading, highly technically driven daily action, and self-fulfilling prophecies (particularly with technical levels) becoming an industry standard.
For example, investors have been preparing for the S&P 500 to correct for months now (-10% or more pullback from recent high), and most analysts had projected this to occur in earlier 2022, which is precisely what transpired. After the predicted ""Santa Rally"" concluded on the third trading day of the year, the market began looking for reasons to correct, which isn't challenging when the pace of inflation is at a 40-year high.
Nevertheless, a self-fulfilling prophecy came to fruition in Monday afternoon's buying spree once the S&P 500 entered correction territory, which was the buy trigger many market participants had patiently prepped for.
Whether the 4222 low that the S&P 500 hit Monday marks the bottom for public equities will be dictated by the Fed's policy decisions coupled with mega-cap tech's Q4 margin results (inflation implications) and forward-looking guidance. 
The Week Ahead
We've got a formative week of market-moving fundamentals ahead, and with the recent volatility, public equities are more susceptible than ever to any catalyzer (or fear of one).
We are coming to the crescendo of Q4 earnings season as big tech prepares its annual reports while the Federal Reserve determines how to approach these uncharted economic waters as material inflation persists.
The Fed Meeting
This will be new Vice-Chair Leal Brainard's first time taking her seat beside Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Following her declaration of her dedication to control recently outsized pricing pressures, the markets are looking for a more hawkish tone in this Wednesday's (1/26) post-FOMC meeting policy statement and subsequent press conference with Jerome.
Fed Chair Jerome and his band of market accommodating central bankers are expected to unveil their 2022 monetary strategy. Market participants are anticipating the Fed will announce a March liftoff, which would kick off a long-awaited period of monetary tightening, following a 40-year high in the pace of inflation.
With the latest Omicron-variant causing prolonged pricing pressures that are officially not ""transitory"" (Jerome publicly retired the term in the context of inflation), the Federal Reserve is now under the gun to make more aggressive monetary strides towards controlling consumer prices before it gets out of hand.
The credit markets have been franticly raising their 2022 rate hike projections as primarily COVID-related supply chain bottlenecks push back economic recoveries and pressure prices as the Omicron-variant spreads like wildfire. The market is currently pricing for a 60% probability of 4 or more rate hikes by the end of 2022 (each incremental increase represents 25 basis-points).
I believe that these expectations are on the aggressive side, considering how outstandingly market accommodating Powell has been. Powell has done nothing but ensure investors that he intends to ease the US economy into a normalized interest rate environment. I wouldn't be surprised if the Fed were to reduce the number of rate hikes over the next 12 months but accelerate its asset sheet roll-off for a smoother market transition towards the target sustainable monetary approach (as little interference as possible).
However, incoming Vice-Chair Brainard's hawkish comments about controlling inflation being her #1 priority in a Congressional hearing earlier this month has traders pricing for the possibility of a monetary shock (unexpected policy changes at the world's most influential central bank). A monetary shock is one of the few things that would almost certainly impede our currently flourishing economic revival.
The booming US economy has managed to shrug off most of the recent inflation, with customers' willingness to pay at an all-time high. Still, the potentially severe adverse impacts of rapidly rising prices only show up when this willingness abates.
If the Fed raises rates too quickly, it risks halting demand and catalyzing an economic contraction, but letting prices run too hot for too long could cause much deeper and systemic economic harm.
Fed Chair Powell has done a tremendous job navigating the unchartered monetary waters that the pandemic's medically-induced economic coma forced upon the world. Jerome's progressive policy approach has been receiving a growing level of criticism from those worried that this slow and steady monetary tightening strategy will catalyze a period of irrevocable stagflation like that of the 1970s (high inflation, low economic growth).
Chair Powell remains the smartest man in the room. He remains steadfast on his outlook for the natural deceleration of inflation, which I presume will occur once the latest Omicron-driven supply chain tie-ups subside and demands can once again be met.
Mega-Cap Tech Reports
Big tech is finally up to bat as we enter the heart of Q4 earnings season, and these quarterly fundamentals can't seem to come soon enough, with sellers driving this cohort's year-to-date returns towards bear market territory (-20% or more off recent highs).
With their recent valuation slips, Netflix's NFLX stock capitulating report last week, and margin compressed results from Wall Street's leading financiers, investors are looking for these market-buoying beacons of boundless growth to drive fresh fundamental optimism back into this exhausted bull market.
Microsoft MSFT, which is trading nearly -20% off its November highs (toeing bear market territory), will be the first of the trillion-dollar club to reveal its year-ending results after the closing bell Tuesday afternoon (1/25). The market is looking for record results, and I see no reason they won't get them. MSFT has surpassed analysts' top and bottom line estimates every quarter for more than 5 years as its best-in-class cloud & AI services fuel this innovation-fueled legacy tech giant's continuous valuation advancement.
Tesla's TSLA incredible market-disrupting growth narrative has catalyzed a tidal wave of investor demand for this EV giant's shares. Nevertheless, the stock has sizable pulled back from the trillion-dollar valuation milestone it reached in October. TSLA is now trading over 30% below its recent highs but may be in for a bounce when it reports Wednesday after the closing bell (1/26) if Musk can deliver the growth figures he promised in the face of this global chip shortage.
Thursday afternoon (1/27), Apple's AAPL Q4 results will be the single most important December quarter release. The world's most valuable enterprise (making up 6.8% of the S&P 500 & over 12% of the Nasdaq 100) will give investors integral color on how systemic and material the recent Omicron-fueled inflation rally was/is.
The components of Apple's market-leading smartphone (and its most significant profit drive), the iPhone, are sourced worldwide, making it an excellent gauge for the real impact that rising prices have on corporate margins. There have been rumors that Apple's suppliers have had trouble fulfilling order obligations, but we will get the full story before the week concludes.
Abbott ABT, Intel INTC, AT&T T, and Boeing BA release their Q4 results on Wednesday (1/26). Visa V, Mastercard MA, Comcast CMCSA, and McDonald's MCD on Thursday (1/27). To conclude this pivotal earnings week, watch out for some of the largest US exporters, Chevron CVX and Caterpillar CAT.
There is nothing systematically disturbing about the recent market pullback, and I see this healthy correction as an opportunity. 
If you still have cash on the sideline, I urge you to begin putting some of that money to work here. Don't try to call a bottom with any ""all-in"" trades but rather scale into your favorite stocks by dollar-cost averaging lower if the market continues to slip.
Good luck out there!

WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said Tuesday a global survey of semiconductor chip producers and users shows a shortage will persist, sparked primarily by wafer production capacity constraints.
The voluntary survey of 150 companies last fall in the supply chain confirmed ""there is a significant, persistent mismatch in supply and demand for chips, and respondents did not see the problem going away in the next six months.""
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters that the department ""in a few instances didn't really get what we needed and we're going to go company by company and do personal engagement and get what we need.""
Raimondo said in November that she had spoken to ""all of the CEOs in the supply chain - including Samsung 005930.KS, TSMC 2330.TW, SK 096770.KS - and all of the CEOs have pledged to me that they will be submitting robust and complete data flows to us.""
Some companies in Asia and governments had earlier expressed concern about the data request. Raimondo reiterated that the department could invoke its legal authority to get responses.
The U.S. could compel foreign semiconductor firms with U.S. operations to answer detailed questions about the chips market.
Raimondo declined on Tuesday to say who did or did not comply. The department also said it was sharing its findings with foreign governments.
The department said it had seen some unusually high prices among some chips used by automakers and medical device manufacturers.
The department said it will ""engage industry on node-specific problem solving in the coming weeks. We will also look into claims about unusually high prices in these nodes.""
""Demand for chips is high. It is getting higher,"" Raimondo said, adding demand is now about 20% above 2019 levels. ""There is not a lot of good news"" in this survey, she added.
Raimondo said the survey did not show evidence of hoarding.
The department said median inventory for consumers for key chips has fallen from 40 days in 2019 to less than 5 days in 2021.
""Five days of inventory. No room for error,"" Raimondo said. ""That tells you how fragile this supply chain is.""
House Democrats are expected as early as later Tuesday to introduce legislation aimed at increasing U.S. competitiveness with China and spending $52 billion on semiconductor production and research, sources told Reuters, after the Senate approved funding in June.
President Joe Biden has been pressing Congress to approve more funds to boost chip production in the United States as shortages of the key components used in autos and computers have exacerbated supply chain bottlenecks.

Well, it's looking like another miserable day for stock markets on Monday, with the Dow down 1.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq off 2.6%. Once again, semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is leading tech stocks lower as its shares had slumped 6.6% by 10:25 a.m. ET today.
The most obvious answer is that investors are favoring ""cheap"" semiconductor stock Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) over ""expensive"" semiconductor stock Nvidia today, especially because Intel had some good news to report last week.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
On Friday, Intel announced that it has chosen to locate two new chip factories near Columbus, Ohio, picking the city from a field of 40 locations that had competed for the investment. Construction will commence later this year, and production should start in 2025. And as The Wall Street Journal, reports, the $20 billion that Intel will be investing in Ohio is only part of a $100 billion investment plan for building out new fab capacity.
Intel says its intention is to grow its share of the $500-billion-a-year market for semiconductors, which by implication means it plans to take share away from Nvidia. Helping it with that task will be economic incentives from the State of Ohio, which says it has offered Intel ""tax breaks linked to job creation and infrastructure spending, including for site construction,"" the Journal says.
Now what
So good news for Intel might be bad news for Nvidia -- one possible reason Nvidia stock is down today. On the other hand, Intel stock is also down today, losing 1.2%. So today's sell-off isn't entirely a case of ""what's good for Intel is bad for Nvidia,"" at least not entirely.
Most likely, what we're seeing today is a confluence of three factors pushing down the value of Nvidia stock: first, the good news for Intel; second, a generally red stock market that's hitting shares of all stripes this morning; and third, the fact that Nvidia, with a P/E ratio of 74, just plain looks a lot riskier than Intel, which costs only 10 times earnings.
On a day when investors seem to be fleeing risk, it only makes sense that Nvidia stock would get hit harder than Intel stock.

This video was recorded on Jan. 13, 2022.
Chris Hill: Today on Motley Fool Money from housing to office space, We'll take a look at real estate trends and investing opportunities to go along with them. All that and more coming up right now.
I'm Chris Hill, joined by Motley Fool Senior Analyst John Rotonti. Thanks for being here!
John Rotonti: Thanks for having me on the show, Chris!
Chris Hill: We've also got an update on semiconductors, but let's start with a big day in the housing industry. Shares of home builder KB Home up more than 12% this morning after 4th quarter profits came in solidly higher than expected. Revenue was a little light, but KB Home says that 2022 is going to be a good year. When you consider how much we've all been talking about supply chain issues, John, this guidance out of KB Home, I understand why the stock is up.
John Rotonti: I consider this a beat and raise quarter. Like you said, revenue was a little light, but they crushed earnings and then they raised their guidance. They're expecting guidance of midpoint 30% revenue growth for 2022. They've also increased their guidance for return on equity, which is a measure of profitability. In 2021, they did 20%, they're expecting to do 26%, so a 600 basis point improvement year over year. That's just incredible, and I think it shows the pricing power that homebuilders have right now, given the supply demand imbalance. If we go back to microeconomics 101, almost the first day of class, you learn about how supply and demand effects price, and right now, Freddie Mac estimates were 4 million homes short in the US, because we underbuilt coming out of the global financial crisis. I've seen estimates that were anywhere from four million to actually six million homes short at the same time that we're seeing a surge in demand, because millennials are now at that prime home buying age.
That on top of the fact that COVID and the pandemic has changed living patterns, and now people want to move outside of the cities. Some people want to move outside of the cities to more suburban rural areas where they have more room and more space to work from home, play from home, exercise from home in a socially distanced way. So the combination of massive shortage of supply and surging demand is giving homebuilders pricing power, and so we're seeing an increase in ASPs, average selling prices. Yeah, that's the story with KB Home, and hopefully this is a read through for the rest of the industry that the other homebuilders will have a good quarter as well.
Chris Hill: We'll get to the other homebuilders in a second. For a brief moment there, when they were talking about their guidance, I had this crazy idea that it meant good things for people looking to buy homes, because much like the used car market and therefore the new car market, the homebuying market has just been on fire. Anecdotally, I think we all know people out there who have tried to buy a new home, a bigger home, and have gotten priced out very quickly or ended up paying more than they probably would've in normal times. But to your point on the deficit in homes, it really does seem like when you're talking about nationwide, 4-6 million homes short. Are we going to see the housing market on fire like this for years to come or does it start to cool off at some point?
John Rotonti: There's two views to this. I do think that we're going to see an extended upcycle gross, an extended upcycle, because inventory is so low, because supply is so low. But if you look at where KB Home is trading, it's trading at a price to earnings ratio of six. That suggests that the market thinks we could be at peak earnings. It's an interesting enigma with the homebuilders right now. I'm of the view that we're going to see an extended upcycle for all the reasons we just discussed, the supply demand imbalance, but the market seems to think that we are approaching a peak and that earnings could start trailing off, because a PE of six it's the only explanation I can think of.
Chris Hill: Let's move to a homebuilder that is nearly 10 times the size of KB Home and that's Lennar. No earnings report out of Lennar, but they're increasing their annual dividend by 50%. How good are they at capital allocation? We've seen plenty of times where the news is someone is increasing their dividend by a penny, a couple of percentage points. You got to be confident if you're going to make this stick, if you're going up 50% for an annual dividend, right?
John Rotonti: This is a signal that the management team has a lot of confidence in the company's ability to generate strong and stable cash flows across the cycle so that they can sustain this dividend. No management team wants to have to reduce, suspend, or cut a dividend because that's going across stock no management team wants that and so yes, this is a signal that they think they're going to have really strong, robust cash flows going forward. It is a 50% increase. It's an increase I love to see, because this is a company that I actually admire a lot, Lennar. But to put it into perspective, their dividend payout ratio is very low. They had a lot of room to increase. Before this announcement, I think their dividend payout ratio was well less than 15%, meaning they're paying out less than 15% of their net income as a dividend. This increase will take Lennar's dividend yield, which is different than the payout ratio. The payout ratio is the%age of earnings that they pay out as a dividend. The yield is the dividend divided by the stock price. This will take their dividend yield from about 1% to about 1.4%. It is a nice boost in the dividend yield, but that dividend payout ratio is still very low, and so actually that indicates they have room to improve this dividend much further over time.
Chris Hill: I think you used the word admire with respect to Lennar. We talked previously about KB Home, D.R. Horton is a major homebuilder. What is it about Lennar and the way they run their business that makes you like them more so than the others?
John Rotonti: If I had to put one thing on Lennar that I like more than the others, they have a division which is called LEN X or Lennar X, which is basically a venture capital division, where they invest in different home related technologies, one of which is Opendoor, the leading iBuying company in the world, now that Zillow has closed its iBuying business. We're left with Opendoor and Redfin, and they own a minority stake, but a substantial stake in Opendoor and then a variety of other venture-like investments as well. I like the industry as a whole because they are moving from a asset-heavy land-heavy business model, where they would own and develop land which required a lot of debt to one that is much more land light, so they're owning and developing less land and focusing more on returns on invested capital and returns on equity. We saw that in KB's guidance, where they're increasing their return on equity from 2021 levels by 600 basis points.
Chris Hill: Before we move on to semiconductors, I need you to cure me of something, and you referenced Zillow. When I hear the phrase iBuying, unfortunately I think of Zillow and the debacle of Zillow attempting to roll out their iBuying program and then cutting it back and then suspending it. It was breath taking the speed with which they launched and shutdown their iBuying program. I feel like iBuying is one of those things. My default thoughts should not be Zillow and its debacle with iBuyer. How should investors think about iBuying either on the consumer side or just as something to watch within this industry?
John Rotonti: I don't know, I was bullish on the potential for iBuying to really transform the home buying and selling experience from a consumer standpoint until the Zillow debacle. Now, I'm much less bullish on iBuying. One thing I'll say about Opendoor is they are a pure-play iBuying company. Zillow started as something else. Zillow started as a basically advertising-driven search engine for homes. Then they try to shift into iBuying. Maybe Opendoor will have a better go at it because that's all they do. Maybe they're just better at it. Maybe they are better managed when it comes to that, better organized when it comes to that. The thing I like about Lennar and owning a stake in which I don't have a stake in Lennar, personally. But the thing I like about investing through Lennar is you get some exposure to iBuying through their investment in Opendoor. But you're paying, once again, like a PE of seven or eight or something like that.
Chris Hill: Taiwan Semiconductor posted record profits in the 4th quarter. They also offered upbeat guidance and said they plan to spend up to $44 billion this year to increase their manufacturing capacity. For those unfamiliar with Taiwan Semiconductor, they're the supplier for Apple, Qualcomm, and others of that size and ilk, shares up more than 5% this morning. Is it the record profits, the guidance, the commitment to investing the money or is it some combination of all three that's pushing this stock higher?
John Rotonti: It's all three. Taiwan Semiconductor, and I don't like to speak in superlatives, is probably the most important company on planet earth.
Chris Hill: Wow, really?
John Rotonti: Yeah. Every electronic device in the world has something from Taiwan Semiconductor in it. They manufacture over 50% of all the world's contracted semiconductors, but they manufacturer 90% of the most advanced technological chips, 90%. So they're a really, really important company, especially as we get more and more digital and electronics start pushing into more and more of our daily lives. The other thing I'll say is $44 billion in CapEx is probably, I'd have to check this, the most capital-intensive business on Earth. I'm not aware of another company spending $44 billion in property plant equipment in one year. There may be a few, but I can count on my hand. So there's not a lot. What that signifies, Chris, what that signals, $44 billion in CapEx, that's the demand that they see for their products. They need to build this capacity in order to satisfy demand. Along with that increase in CapEx guidance for 2022, they also increase their long-term revenue guidance from 10-15% up to 15-20%. That's a substantial jump. You see how important a company is when they need to invest $40 plus billion a year in capital to satisfy demand. This is a demand story. It's incredible. The world is short semiconductors and Taiwan Semiconductor is trying to take share and fill that demand.
Chris Hill: This seems like one of those bits of data that whether you're bullish or bearish on semiconductors in the global supply chain, you've got something to work with here because on the bullish side, you look at them raising guidance. You speak of the demand. On the bearish side, they're investing this money, it's not going to increase capacity in the next 12 months. This is a long play and I think that for a company of this size, you want to see this type of investment. But this isn't going to dramatically move the needle on semiconductor production in 2022, is it?
John Rotonti: No. You're exactly right. Some of this CapEx is going to go toward building next-gen chips, which they aren't even selling yet. So these three nanometer and these two nanometer chips, right now the size of the chips they're selling are in the seven nanometer and five nanometer space. So a lot of this, like you said, far out, it takes over a year and between $10 and $20 billion to build one of these fabrication facilities. It's extremely capital-intensive. Currently, Taiwan Semiconductor only has one competitor for the world's most leading edge chips and that's Samsung. They will soon have Intel as well. Intel says they are going to get into the space. But right now it's a duopoly and Taiwan Semiconductor is far and away the leader. They have 90% market share of the world's most advanced chips.
Chris Hill: Last thing and then I'll let you go. Taiwan Semiconductor, I feel like they are akin to NVIDIA in the sense that both companies are worth more than $600 billion each. But they're not nearly as well known to consumers and even investors as other companies of that size. When you think about consumer names like Facebook, I'm sorry, Meta Platforms, that we're supposed to call it now. But these are enormous companies. From a stock perspective, it's had a tremendous run. Do you look at Taiwan Semiconductor as a stock people should look at right now or is this one of those times where, it's like, I don't want to say you have to have a strong stomach, but it's a little frothy right now maybe?
John Rotonti: No, sure. If you have a long enough time horizon, which I'll define as at least five-years. You're willing to hold the stock for five years, Yes. I think now is a good time to look at Taiwan Semiconductor. Thirty seconds, I'll just say you mentioned NVIDIA. Taiwan Semiconductor is a platform that they allow their customers to acquire much more value than Taiwan Semiconductor keeps for itself. For example, Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA has a quote and it's, ""There's basically air and Taiwan Semiconductor."" That's how important NVIDIA sees Taiwan Semiconductor to its own business. It was a platform before Amazon Web Services was a platform.
Chris Hill: This is why I love talking to John Rotonti. Thanks for being here.
John Rotonti: Thank you, Chris. I hope I can come back soon.
Chris Hill: After an historic year for real estate investing, what can investors expect in 2022? Among other things, a sea change in commercial real estate. Deidre Woollard has more.
Deidre Woollard: Thanks Chris. I'm Deidre Woollard, and I'm here with Lead Real Estate Analyst, Matt Argersinger. Matt 2021 was a pretty strong year for real estate in the stock market.
Matt Argersinger: It certainly was Deidre, If you look at the Vanguard Real Estate ETF, which is a benchmark that we follow when we're looking at real estate investments, it was up over 40%, it was its best year ever, and that index has been around for about 16 years. If you look at the National Association of REITs, which is another index, it had its second best year on record of 41%, extraordinary year for real estate, and REITs in 2021. REITs have a great track record for those listening who might not be familiar with REITs, real estate investment trust. If you factor in 2021, they've returned on average 13.5% per year since 1972, so almost 50 years worth of data that outperforms S&P 500. It was a great year for real estate in 2021, but really, real estate investing has been doing well for investors for decades.
Deidre Woollard: REITs were bouncing back from a pretty hard 2020, and some of the impact of COVID-19.
Matt Argersinger: Yeah. Fair to point that out, I think 2020 was a difficult year for real estate. It was one of those sectors that was more acutely affected than other industries. Just because, if you think about retail real estate, hotels, hospitality, office, is one that's still suffering from the effects of the pandemic. 2020 was a very, very difficult year, REITs were down in the high single digits on average that year. I expected, I think as you did, that 2021 was going to be better, and it certainly was. I don't think we thought it was going to be this good or historically good as it was though.
Deidre Woollard: Exactly, well, let's talk about some of those trends that were most interested in. The first one, I feel like is one that's both pandemic-driven, but also was already in process for years before that, and that's Sun Belt migration. People moving to Texas, Florida. Redfin came out with their hottest neighborhoods recently, I think most of them were in Florida. Lot of really interesting activity happening in the Sun Belt right now.
Matt Argersinger: Yeah, that's right. I mean, as you said, this was happening before the pandemic. We saw all trends population. If you look at U-Haul data, which is a cool dataset that you and I look at now and then it was all heading down toward the Sun Belt markets to Southeast to Southwest, away from the coast, and what the pandemic did is, it really just accelerated that trend. Suddenly you had a lot of workers who are used to living in the big coastal gateway markets. Your San Franciscos, Los Angeles's, your New Yorks, your Bostons, and all of a sudden, they had a lot more flexibility with their job, and they can work remotely wherever they thought would be best for them, and that meant looking for, in lot of cases, cheaper places in the South-Southwest or in the inner parts of the country, or just places that they have a better life, they prefer to live and still be a productive employee.
Those trends really, really took off with the pandemic, they've not ceased, and we'll continue to see this big swell, population rolled down to those other markets, and what you're also seeing in a lot of those places is there's just not enough houses. There are not enough houses at all in the country to meet the demand out there. But especially in those markets as hot demand markets, you mentioned Florida and Texas. If you look at places like Austin, Texas, Houston Dallas, Fort Worth, or if you go to Florida, and you look at Miami or Tampa, there's just so much demand for housing, there's not a lot of it. There's demand for apartments, you're seeing home prices go up, you're seeing apartment rent surge, and unfortunately developments just not going to be able to meet that demand. You're going to see, I think, again, rising home prices, rising rents, especially in those markets.
Deidre Woollard: Cheaper rents, hopefully bigger apartments, warm weather, if investors were looking to bet on some of those trends, what's one idea they could take a look at?
Matt Argersinger: I think one idea that comes to mind is Mid-America Apartment Communities, tickers, MAA, it's the biggest owner operator of apartments in the country actually. But they have so much exposure, about 90% of their assets are in the ""Sun Belt region"", and that's where they've been focused for for decades now. As the largest apartment owner and operator in those markets, I think they've been a huge beneficiary of this demand, their occupancy rates are at record, rents, in a lot of their markets are up double-digits, if not even 20% more in a lot of places, and I think that's going to continue. Mid-America Apartment Communities, it's had a nice run as a stock, but I could see more upside as this trend plays out.
Deidre Woollard: Now, our last trend, I feel like it's pretty much COVID-driven, and that's the impact of remote work on the office real estate sector. A lot of companies we're planning to have people come back in January that's been pushed back. Some companies have just given up on announcing deadlines of return at all, and yet at the same time, I've seen a flurry of big office leases from companies like Meta, Roku, in markets like New York, and Los Angeles. What's going on here?
Matt Argersinger: It is the most confusing part of the real estate market, for a lot of reasons, as you pointed out Deidre. I mean, we know what the pandemic has done with the work from home, and hybrid work schedules, and what that means for office occupancy, which is so low right now. Yet a lot of these technology companies out there, and life science companies out there are leasing office space at record paces, and to me that's not surprising. But I think if we step back, and look at the office market, I really do think if we past peak office, so to speak. No matter where you look, what surveys you read or what economists you read, the prevailing thought is that companies are going to lease less office space today, and in the future than they did prior to the pandemic.
It's a real major sea change for the industry. I don't think we understand the full implications of this, but the real short-term implication is that we have too much office square footage in this country, a lot of it needs to be transitioned to probably apartments, as you're seeing in certain cities, or maybe even to hospitality, or maybe that office just gets converted to co-working spaces. It's not necessarily a dedicated corporate office or corporate headquarters anymore, it's a place where employees come to collaborate on an offer team basis, and so that's the state of office right now. Now, there are parts of the office market that I think can do well. Technology, R&D, life science, medical offices. We're actually in a position after pandemic to actually need more of that kind of office. There are parts of the office market that I think are going to work. Again, co-working is probably going to do well, medical office flex spaces. But the traditional office building, I think, is going to probably become a thing of the past, believe it or not.
Deidre Woollard: Well, you can't do your medical research at home, and that's one of the reasons that you, and I are both excited about life sciences, and the growth in that sector. I know that you, and I both have a favorite in this category, let's talk about it.
Matt Argersinger: Sure, my favorite has always been for a long time, and that's Alexandria Real Estate Equities, ticker ARE, it's the leading real estate REIT for life sciences, and technology, They really cater to, if you think about companies like Moderna or Pfizer who led the vaccine front, or companies like Facebook, that are doing all innovations, Meta, I keep calling it Facebook, Google, these are the companies that really lease from Alexandria Real Estate, and we see that demand has not fallen off. Alexandria Real Estate occupancy has never been higher, it's had no problem collecting rents throughout the entire crisis, which is such a departure from other office REITs which did suffer. I love it, it's got a founder-led management team, or even outperforming the market for decades now at this point, and even though the stock has had a really nice run, and it's a little bit expensive, maybe from just some valuation points of view, but it's one that I like very much, and it's really taking advantage of this trend toward life science office.
Deidre Woollard: Absolutely. They had recent big deal with Moderna in Cambridge Massachusetts, they're really focused in all of the markets where life science is booming.
Matt Argersinger: That's right. You mentioned Moderna, I think it's a 500,000 square foot new headquarters of building in Cambridge, and it's going to be owned, and operated by Alexandria Real Estate.
Deidre Woollard: Love it. Well, always a pleasure to talk real estate with you. Thanks, Matt.
Matt Argersinger: Thanks, Deidre.

However, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a video interview that Chipzilla has put AMD in the ""rearview mirror"" in the client CPU market with its Alder Lake processors.
Gelsinger went on to add that AMD will ""never again"" be in Intel's ""windshield"" as the latter is now ""leading the market."" Intel's CEO seems quite upbeat about his company's prospects in the new year, and hasn't minced any words about AMD's future in the client CPU market. However, Intel bears may feel that Gelsinger has started celebrating too early. Let's see why they may be right.

AMD could still pull ahead of Intel in 2022
The reason why Intel's Alder Lake client CPUs are gaining ground against AMD is that they are based on an enhanced 10-nanometer (nm) process that's reportedly better than the latter's Ryzen 5000 processors, which are based on a 7nm process. PC Gamer, a magazine and website covering the personal computer (PC) gaming industry, points out that Intel's 10nm process has a higher transistor density than AMD's 7nm process.
Not surprisingly, Intel has taken the lead from AMD, with third-party reviews stating that Chipzilla has now regained its gaming crown. AMD, however, could still turn on the heat, as the chipmaker is expected to launch a new generation of processors later this year based on the Zen 4 architecture.
AMD's Ryzen 7000 series processors could hit the market in the second half of 2022, and they could take the wind out of Intel's sails as they will be based on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (TSMC) 5nm manufacturing process. So AMD looks all set to move to a more advanced manufacturing node in 2022 that could help it accelerate ahead of Intel on the technology front.
That's because TSMC's 5nm process is expected to be significantly denser than Intel's 10nm offerings, which means that the former's chips will pack more transistors -- which should ideally result in higher computing performance and low power consumption.
Hence, AMD could start eating into Intel's market share once again later this year, especially considering that Chipzilla's competing chips -- the 7nm Meteor Lake processors -- are expected to hit the market only in 2023, and that's if they don't run into any delays. As a result, Gelsinger's belief that Intel has left AMD behind in the client CPU market may not hold by the end of the year.
Intel bulls, however, have reason to cheer as well, since Gelsinger's approach shows that the company is going all out to defend its turf.
Chipzilla investors need to focus on the bigger picture
The discussion above indicates that it is too early to say that Intel has regained its manufacturing lead and raced ahead of AMD. Investors, however, should focus on the fact that the company's long-term product roadmap does indicate that it could eventually get ahead of its rivals.
The company plans to retake its manufacturing crown from rivals by 2025, which is when it intends to introduce the Intel 20A process. The chipmaker will move to a new transistor architecture with Intel 20A, which would be its first new transistor architecture since 2011. In all, Intel plans to upgrade its manufacturing technologies in the coming years, which could help it make powerful chips on the back of billions of dollars' worth of investments.
This would be great news for Intel's client computing group (CCG), which accounts for most of Intel's revenue and seems to be on the verge of a turnaround already. CCG revenue for the first nine months of 2021 increased only 4% over the prior year to $30.4 billion, as the company had to contend with lower average selling prices on account of discounts to sell more processors.
But now that Intel has reduced the technology gap and forced AMD to slash the price of Ryzen processors, it looks set to enjoy a mix of strong volumes and pricing this year. For instance, in the third quarter of 2021, Intel witnessed higher average selling prices in both desktops and notebooks, recording 16% and 10% year-over-year growth, respectively.
And if Intel continues to execute on its turnaround and eventually regains its manufacturing lead, it could turn out to be a top semiconductor stock in the long run.

2022-01-24 00:00:00+00:00,Will Lower Aggregate Revenues Hurt Intel's (INTC) Q4 Earnings?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-lower-aggregate-revenues-hurt-intels-intc-q4-earnings,,,"Intel Corporation INTC is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2021 results on Jan 26, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 54.1%. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 60 cents.

The Santa Clara, CA-based company is expected to have recorded year-over-year lower aggregate revenues due to headwinds in the enterprise business of the data center segment.
Factors at Play
During the quarter, VMware partnered with Intel to deliver security, maintenance and intelligent analytics for commercial PCs. Nokia launched an industrial edge solution that utilizes Intel’s innovations to help enterprises achieve digital transformation goals.

Amazon Web Services announced the availability of its latest cloud service powered by the Intel Xeon Scalable processors. Microsoft unveiled its newest Azure Confidential Computing Virtual Machines, DCsv3, powered by the 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors and Intel Software Guard Extensions.

Snowflake and Intel collaborated to provide performance across multiple public clouds to joint customers. Intel collaborated with Inspur, Ruijie Networks and Silicom to develop new FPGA-based infrastructure processing unit solutions that deliver highly customized solutions to cloud and networking customers. These developments are likely to have aided Intel’s performance.

For the December quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $18,305 million, which indicates a decline of 8.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share is pegged at 90 cents, which suggests a decrease of 40.8%.

2022-01-24 00:00:00+00:00,Tesla (TSLA) Headlines Busiest Week of Earnings So Far,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tesla-tsla-headlines-busiest-week-of-earnings-so-far,,,"It's a big week for the earnings calendar, with about 20% of S&P 500 companies set to report. Among them is electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA, $961.11), which will report its fourth-quarter earnings after the Jan. 26 close.
TSLA stock went on a tear in the second half of 2021. However, the shares really put the pedal to the metal following the firm's third-quarter report in late October – surging from around $865 per share on Oct. 20 to a record closing high of $1,229 on Nov. 4. More recently, the stock has slipped back below the $1,000 mark amid broad-market headwinds.

Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois (Buy) calls Tesla's fourth-quarter results ""critical."" Why? They will be used to ""validate (or not) the Q3 profit dynamics that could see Tesla 1) carve out meaningful share from legacy [original engine manufacturers] busy protecting their own share by ramping up [battery electric vehicles] and 2) claim a disproportionate share of the industry profit pool,"" he writes in a note.
Analysts are expecting solid results for Tesla's fourth quarter. Consensus estimates are for earnings of $2.26 per share, +182.5% year-over-year (YoY), and revenues of $16.4 billion – a 52.2% increase over the year prior.
Analyst Says Buy Any Post-Earnings Weakness in Apple Stock
All eyes will be on Apple (AAPL, $163.76) when the iPhone maker unveils its fiscal first-quarter earnings report after Thursday's close. The Wall Street pros, on average, are calling for earnings per share (EPS) of $1.88 (+11.9% YoY) and revenues of $118.4 billion, which would mark a 6.3% improvement over its year-ago results.
AAPL stock has struggled alongside the broader market in 2022, down 7.1% for the year-to-date. But Morgan Stanley analysts Katy Huberty (Overweight, equivalent of Buy) says she sees any additional post-earnings weakness as a buying opportunity. 
Apple will likely ""post upside to Street forecasts for the December quarter and guide to a relatively in-line March quarter on the back of improving iPhone production into year end and modest services outperformance,"" she writes in a note. She also expects management to address the status of the supply chain in theearnings call which ""will be important in helping investors understand at what point hardware supply and demand will become more balanced.""
Microsoft Earnings Due on Heels of Activision Acquisition
It's been an exciting year already for Microsoft (MSFT, $301.54). On Jan. 18, the tech titan said it was buying gaming giant Activistion Blizzard (ATVI) for $68.7 billion – MSFT's largest-ever acquisition – as it looks to gain exposure to the quickly expanding metaverse.
The tech giant's fiscal second-quarter earnings report, due out after Tuesday's close, will likely garner plenty of headlines, as well. Analysts, on average, are looking for a 13.8% pop in earnings to $2.31 per share and an 18% jump in revenues to $43.1 billion.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives (Outperform) is targeting even higher earnings of $2.29 per share. Ives also believes Microsoft will show strong cloud figures, with the company ""poised to beat Azure whisper growth numbers of ~43% this quarter."" And despite potential valuation and interest rate-related headwinds, the analyst sees MSFT's share price heading higher over the next six to nine months, ""as the Street is still underestimating the underlying growth story in Redmond in our opinion.""
Conservative Guidance Could Lead to Intel Earnings Beat
Intel (INTC, $52.47) is slated to unveil its fourth-quarter earnings report after the Jan. 26 close. Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson sees the possibility for a Q4 beat. This is due to management setting a ""modest bar with conservative Q4 guidance, with Street consensus and our numbers mirroring this outlook,"" as well as positive PC trends late in the quarter.

Over the long term, though, Bryson anticipates further struggles for the chipmaker. ""While Intel is doing the right thing in lifting investment to try and restore manufacturing and product supremacy, the required increase in spending over the next few years will necessarily weigh heavily on company results,"" he writes in a note. The analyst has an Underperform rating on the Dow Jones stock, which is the equivalent of a Sell.
Overall, consensus estimates for Intel's fourth quarter are for earnings to arrive at 90 cents per share (-40.8% YoY) and revenue to land at $18.3 billion (-8.3% YoY).
Chevron Set for Skyrocketing Earnings, Revenue Growth
Chevron (CVX, $127.69) has benefited from surging energy prices – a message that's been made abundantly clear in the oil major's surging share price. CVX stock is up almost 34% in the last 12 months to trade at levels not seen since early 2018.
Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins (Outperform) thinks Chevron's fourth-quarter earnings report – due out ahead of Friday's open – will further underscore the momentum in the integrated oil name. ""Efficiency drivers are set to improve profitability into 2022, while a 'block and tackle' capital program over the next few years should further improve competitiveness, even without more help from the macro environment,"" he writes in a note. 
Chevron has ""the strongest financial base of the majors, coupled with an attractive relative asset portfolio,"" he adds. As such, CVX ""offers the most straightforwardly positive risk/reward, in our view.""
As for Chevron's upcoming report: The pros, on average, expect EPS of $3.13 per share, compared to a per-share loss of 1 cent in the year-ago period, and revenues of $45.6 billion (+80.7% YoY).

2022-01-23 00:00:00+00:00,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Asia shares brace for hawkish Fed, Ukraine tensions",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/global-markets-asia-shares-brace-for-hawkish-fed-ukraine-tensions,,,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Asian share markets slipped on Monday as investors braced for a Federal Reserve meeting at which it is expected to confirm it will soon start draining the massive lake of liquidity that has supercharged growth stocks in recent years.
Adding to the caution were concerns about a possible Russian attack on Ukraine with the U.S. State Department pulling out family members of its embassy staff in Kyiv.
The New York Times reported President Joe Biden was considering sending thousands of U.S. troops to NATO allies in Europe along with warships and aircraft.
That might be one reason EUROSTOXX 50 futures STXEc1 slipped 0.5%, while FTSE futures FFIc1 fell 0.4%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS eased 0.8% and Japan's Nikkei .N225 0.6%. Chinese blue chips .CSI300 fell 0.4%, getting little traction from a recent easing in policy by Beijing.
However, Wall Street futures bounced after last week's drubbing, with the S&P 500 futures ESc1 up 0.7% and Nasdaq futures NQc1 0.8%.
Edgy markets are now even pricing in a small chance the Fed hikes rates this week, though the overwhelming expectation is for a first move to 0.25% in March and three more to 1.0% by year end. FEDWATCH
""With inflation eye-wateringly high, the Fed is on course to steadily remove the ultra-accommodative monetary policy that has been a key prop to stock prices for over a decade now,"" said Oliver Allen, a market economist at Capital Economics.
The prospect of higher borrowing costs and more attractive bond yields took a toll on tech stocks with their lofty valuations, leaving the Nasdaq down 12% so far this year and the S&P 500 nearly 8%.
The rout was exacerbated by a slide in Netflix NFLX.O, which tumbled almost 22%, shedding $44 billion in market value.
Such was the scale of the losses that Treasuries actually rallied late last week on speculation the bonfire of market wealth might scare the Fed into being less hawkish, a variation of the old Greenspan put.
However, Allen noted that even with the recent drop the S&P 500 was still 40% above where it ended 2019, and the Nasdaq 60%.
""Investors may not be able to rely on a so-called 'Fed put' this time around, given that the central bank's tightening cycle has not even begun, and that the strength of the U.S. economy suggests that much tighter policy is warranted.""
Indeed, the first reading of U.S. gross domestic product for the December quarter is due this week and forecast to show growth running at an annualised 5.4% before Omicron put its foot on the brakes.
Earnings season is also well under way and companies reporting this week include IBM IBM, Microsoft MSFT.O, Johnson & Johnson JNJ, Intel INTC.O, Tesla TSLA.O, Apple AAPL.O and Caterpillar CAT.
Around a fifth of the S&P 500 are expected to provide quarterly updates this week.
While Treasuries did bounce late last week, 10-year yields are still up 22 basis points on the month so far at 1.77% US10YT=RR and not far from levels last seen in early 2020.
That rise has generally supported the U.S. dollar, which added 0.5% on a basket of currencies last week and last stood at 85.647 =USD. The euro was stuck at $1.1324 EUR=, having failed to sustain a recent rally to near $1.1500.
""The risk is the Fed's statement portrays an urgency to act soon, likely in March, in the face of very high inflation,"" said Joseph Capurso, CBA's head of international economics.
""That could even encourage markets to price a risk of a 50 basis point rate hike in March and, under that scenario, we expect a knee-jerk reaction above its 4 January high of 96.46.""
The Japanese yen tends to benefit from safe haven flows as stocks crumble, keeping the dollar at 113.84 JPY= and uncomfortably close to last week's low of 113.47.
Gold held up at $1,835 an ounce XAU=, having hit a six-week peak of $1,842 last week. GOL/
Oil prices were rising again having climbed for five weeks in a row to a seven-year peak on expectations demand will stay strong and supplies limited. O/R

SYDNEY, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Asian share markets slipped on Monday with the Federal Reserve expected to confirm it will soon start draining the massive liquidity that has fuelled the huge gains in growth stocks in recent years.
Adding to the caution was concerns about a possible Russian attack on Ukraine with the U.S. State Department pulling out family members of its embassy staff in Kyiv.
The New York Times reported President Joe Biden was considering sending thousands of U.S. troops to NATO allies in Europe along with warships and aircraft.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS eased 0.1% and Japan's Nikkei .N225 1.0%. However, Wall Street futures were trying to bounce after last week's drubbing, with the S&P 500 futures ESc1 up 0.4% and Nasdaq futures NQc1 0.7%.
Edgy markets are now even pricing in a small chance the Fed hikes rates this week, though the overwhelming expectation is for a first move to 0.25% in March and three more to 1.0% by year end. FEDWATCH
""With inflation eye-wateringly high, the Fed is on course to steadily remove the ultra-accommodative monetary policy that has been a key prop to stock prices for over a decade now,"" said Oliver Allen, a market economist at Capital Economics.
The prospect of higher borrowing costs and more attractive bond yields took a toll on tech stocks with their lofty valuations, leaving the Nasdaq down 12% so far this year and the S&P 500 nearly 8%.
The rout was exacerbated by a slide in Netflix NFLX.O, which tumbled almost 22%, shedding $44 billion in market value.
Such was the scale of the losses that Treasuries actually rallied late last week on speculation the bonfire of market wealth might scare the Fed into being less hawkish, a variation of the old Greenspan put.
However, Allen noted that even with the recent drop the S&P 500 was still 40% above where it ended 2019, and the Nasdaq 60%.
""Investors may not be able to rely on a so-called 'Fed put' this time around, given that the central bank's tightening cycle has not even begun, and that the strength of the U.S. economy suggests that much tighter policy is warranted.""
Indeed, the first reading of U.S. gross domestic product for the December quarter is due this week and forecast to show growth running at an annualised 5.4% before Omicron put its foot on the brakes.
Earnings season is also well under way and companies reporting this week include IBM IBM, Microsoft MSFT.O, Johnson & Johnson JNJ, Intel INTC.O, Tesla TSLA.O, Apple AAPL.O and Caterpillar CAT.
While Treasuries did bounce late last week, 10-year yields are still up 22 basis points on the month so far at 1.77% US10YT=RR and not far from levels last seen in early 2020.
That rise has generally supported the U.S. dollar, which added 0.5% on a basket of currencies last week and last stood at 85.647 =USD. The euro was stuck at $1.1341 EUR=, having failed to sustain a recent rally to near $1.1500.
""The risk is the Fed's statement portrays an urgency to act soon, likely in March, in the face of very high inflation,"" said Joseph Capurso, CBA's head of international economics.
""That could even encourage markets to price a risk of a 50 basis point rate hike in March and, under that scenario, we expect a knee-jerk reaction above its 4 January high of 96.46.""
The Japanese yen tends to benefit from safe haven flows as stocks crumble, keeping the dollar soft at 113.66 JPY= and uncomfortably close to last week's low of 113.47.
Gold held up at $1,833 an ounce XAU=, having hit a six-week peak of $1,842 last week. GOL/
Oil prices were rising again having climbed for five weeks in a row to a seven-year peak on expectations demand will stay strong and supplies limited. O/R
Brent LCOc1 added 74 cents to $88.64 a barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 rose 70 cents to $85.84.

2022-01-23 00:00:00+00:00,"Weekly Preview: Earnings To Watch this Week (AAPL, AMD, INTC, MSFT, TSLA)",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/weekly-preview%3A-earnings-to-watch-this-week-aapl-amd-intc-msft-tsla,,,"E
videnced by Friday’s continued punishment in stocks, investors are seemingly less confident that the upcoming earnings results from the most-influential companies in the S&P 500 won’t be impressive enough to reverse the recent slide, particularly in tech stocks. Stocks have been under pressure in the first three weeks of the year, driven by several headwinds. Aside from high inflation, there are also rising interest rates and uncertainty regarding the direction of Fed Reserve policy.
Rising 10-year Treasury yields have also caused investors to run for the exits, especially riskier assets. The 10-year is up about 25 basis points this year near 1.74%. All of this makes a perfect recipe for sustained volatility. At the same time, however, this has also created an environment for value seekers to scoop up several beaten-down names, especially in technology, that now offer compelling prices, considering the fact that the Nasdaq Composite Index is now down 12% year to date.
This puts the Nasdaq Composite not only in correction territory (measured as at least a 10% decline from its recent record close), it has also breached its 200-day moving average — which is often considered a bearish technical trend. This is something the index had not done since April of 2020. All told, the Nasdaq ended Friday down 2.72%, losing 385.10 points to close at 13,768.92. It ended the week down 7.6%, and is on track for its worst start to a year in thirteen years. The S&P 500 index, which was down 5.7% for the week, on Friday gave up 1.89%, losing 84.79 points to close at 4,397.94, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3%, losing 4.6% for the week.
The main question heading into the week is whether this punishment will continue, particularly as Big Tech comes into focus with Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) slated to announce their results. The guidance they provide for the current quarter and beyond will reveal their level of confidence in navigating supply chain headwinds, among other woes. Understandably, given the many areas of uncertainty, stocks are responding cautiously. I suspect this will continue to be the case. Here are the names to keep an eye on for this week.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - Reports after the close, Tuesday, Jan. 25
Wall Street expects AMD to earn 76 cents per share on revenue of $4.52 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earning were 52 cents per share on $3.24 billion in revenue.
What to watch: Having surpassed both revenue and profit estimates in ten straight quarters, it appears AMD is finally getting the respect it deserves. But not everyone believes AMD’s success can last. AMD stock was under pressure last week, falling some 7% amid the tech selloff. Analysts at Piper Sandler fanned more bearish flames by downgrading the stock and slashing their price target. Citing several areas of concerns, including a decline in the PC market, analyst Harsh Kumar rated AMD down from Overweight to Neutral. Kumar also reduced his 12-month price target to $130. The analyst also expects potential headwinds with earnings and revenue growth from AMD’s recent deal for Xilinx (XLNX). In the meantime, investors are wondering is the decline the beginning of a trend or a buying opportunity; assuming the company’s growth metrics have not drastically decelerated, it would be a mistake to part with AMD stock.
Microsoft (MSFT) - Reports after the close, Tuesday, Jan. 25
Wall Street expects Microsoft to earn $2.31 per share on revenue of $50.88 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earning were $2.03 per share on $43.08 billion in revenue.
What to watch: Microsoft has announced its Metaverse presence with some authority with its announced deal for video game giant Activision Blizzard (ATVI). Paying almost $69 billion, the all-cash deal is not cheap, but it is one that the company had to make not only to strengthen its grip in building its metaverse. Activision now gives Microsoft a massive ramp in the mobile gaming industry, among other things. Wall Street has broadly applauded the deal, which many expect to receive few regulatory challenges. Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan has Microsoft on his Conviction Buy List with a $400 target, representing more than 30% upside from current levels. ""As Activision has built a number of best in class franchises (Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo and Candy Crush) and engages millions of users (its mobile segment, King has 245m MAU), Microsoft stated that it sees opportunities to be a key player in the future metaverse era,"" Rangan wrote in a note to clients. Needless to say, this will be a major topic on the earnings call with analysts on Tuesday. Microsoft must also not only deliver goods on its current business segments, and better-than-expected guidance.
Intel (INTC) - Reports after the close, Wednesday, Jan. 26
Wall Street expects Intel to earn 90 cents per share on revenue of $18.32 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $1.52 per share on revenue of $19.98 billion.
What to watch: Rumors of Intel’s (INTC) death have been exaggerated. Not only is the chip giant alive and kicking, it is deploying its massive cash stockpile to regain its lead in chipmaking technology. The company on Friday announced a whopping $20 billion investment for a new manufacturing facility near Columbus, Ohio. The company said it will build at least two semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs, on the 1,000-acre site. Construction will begin this year and the plant should be operational by 2025. Intel also retains the options to scale up to 2,000 acres and to support eight fabrication plants. But will investors be patient enough to allow the company time to execute its strategy, especially at a time when rivals rivals AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) are striving in several important chip developments? Intel shares have fallen 6% over the past six months, compared to 3% rise in the S&P 500 index. The stock is down about 11% over the past year, lagging the S&P 500’s 16% gain. Intel on Wednesday must prove the naysayers wrong, while selling the upside potential of its recent manufacturing plants.
Tesla (TSLA) - Reports after the close, Wednesday, Jan. 26
Wall Street expects Tesla to earn $2.26 per share on revenue of $16.2 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 80 cents per share on revenue of $10.74 billion.
What to watch: Tesla shares have been under pressure, heavily selling amid the recent punishment in tech stocks. The stock is down more than 10% in the past week and is off more than 23% from its 52-week high. Can Tesla shares rebound? I would not bet against it, especially when considering that both Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are due to start ramping up production this year. Without question, Tesla’s increased focus on its growth strategy, namely production and profit margins, have been a major factor in the company’s recent success. And the expected 185% rise in full-year profits underscores Tesla’s level of execution and efficiency. We know Tesla’s Q4 numbers are going to be strong. The question is, what will be the production and delivery forecast, along with financial guidance for the first quarter and full year 2022? There are also rumors that the Cybertruck might be delayed until 2023. These are the topics that will likely drive the stock on Wednesday.
Apple (AAPL) - Reports after the close, Thursday, Jan. 27
Wall Street expects Apple to earn $1.89 per share on revenue of $118.28 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $1.68 per share on revenue of $111.44 billion.
What to watch: The iPhone maker recently became the first company in history to reach a valuation of $3 trillion, when its shares reached $182.86 earlier in the month. While the $3 trillion market cap milestone was an impressive accomplishment, driven by successful new product launches, including its pivotal iPhone 13, there were questions being raised, suggesting this could be as good as it will get for Apple stock. Since that achievement, Apple stock has gotten sliced, falling some 12%. Shares are down 8.5% year to date, trailing the 7.73% decline in the S&P 500 index. In 2021, Apple saw gains of 35%. Is this an overreaction? The market is re-assessing tech valuations and Apple has seemingly gotten caught in that. The Street forecasted revenue for January quarter to grow just 6.5%, while the subsequent quarters may struggle due to the chip shortage. This, however, highlights the importance of Apple’s Services business, which now accounts for almost 30% of total revenue. Investors are hoping for more clarity and conviction on Thursday.

2022-01-23 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Stocks to Buy After the Market Selloff,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-stocks-to-buy-after-the-market-selloff,,,"Another week, another steep drop in tech and growth stocks. 2022 is off to a terrible start, and for many high-growth companies, 2021 wasn't all that great either. Investing is hard, especially when it comes to managing emotions and expectations.
That being said, many businesses are still quite healthy, contrary to what their stock chart might be indicating. If you're looking for a great long-term investment after the sell-off, three Fool.com contributors think Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) are worth a serious look right now.

""Buy on the dip,"" they say
Anders Bylund (Netflix): You know that old adage about buying certain stocks on the dips? Well, video-streaming veteran Netflix offers a perfect opportunity to do exactly that today.
The stock looked mildly undervalued as Netflix approached its fourth-quarter earnings report. Trading at 46 times trailing earnings on Wednesday evening, Netflix's valuation stood at a six-year low:
NFLX Normalized PE Ratio data by YCharts
One solid earnings report and a 22% stock plunge later, Netflix trades at 35 times trailing earnings. Yes, the subscriber additions forecast for the first quarter of 2022 came in below expectations as consumers around the world continue to struggle with the coronavirus pandemic. Netflix's management kept growth projections on the conservative side in this unpredictable market environment.
But the long-term business opportunity is still incredible. Cash profits have broken through to the positive side and are only expected to grow in the coming years. The most inspiring growth story on the stock market continues as Netflix moves into a new era of consistent cash flows. And you can pick up Netflix shares at prices not seen since the spring of 2020. Intelligent investors should pounce on this rare opportunity.
This best-in-class semiconductor equipment stock has sold off for no reason
Billy Duberstein (Lam Research): Etch and deposition equipment leader Lam Research spiked to all-time highs last week, but has subsequently sold off more than 15% this week on absolutely no news. Keep in mind, this sell-off arrived after large customer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) delivered blowout earnings and gave above-consensus guidance for its 2022 capital spending plans.
After the fall, Lam Research trades at just 17.8 times 2022 estimated earnings. But keep in mind, Lam Research's fiscal year ends in June, so that is practically a trailing number. That P/E multiple is well below not only high-growth tech stocks, but even the market at large.
Some may be wondering if the current boom in semiconductor production will eventually lead to a bust, but that really doesn't seem in the cards for at least another year. Besides TSM's big spending plans, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) also announced a massive new factory last week, to be built in Ohio. Meanwhile, a recent Digitimes article pointed to an impending rally in DRAM and NAND prices due to supply constraints. Lam Research is especially relevant for NAND flash production, and healthy NAND capital expenditure (capex) seems to be in the cards for 2022.
Additionally, Lam Research generates an outsized proportion of its revenue from services, at roughly 32% of its revenue last quarter. Those services revenues are somewhat recurring and tied to the company's ever-growing installed base. So, the massive growth in equipment sales last year and this year should lead to consistently growing services revenue going forward, even if there's a pause in equipment sales at some point.
Basically, there's no fundamental reason for the Lam sell-off. The company will release its December quarter figures on Wednesday, Jan. 26, so investors may wish to look at this top semiconductor stock before it reports.
Mobile chips are expanding way beyond smartphones
Nicholas Rossolillo (Qualcomm): During its investor day presentation in November, Qualcomm talked a lot about how the entire computing industry is starting to converge on smartphone architecture. Mobility is now a given, and smartphones are a potent combination of computing power and energy efficiency. Their design can be adopted by other mobile devices too.
That's where Qualcomm comes in, as the global leader in mobile chips. Nearly every smartphone on the planet has some Qualcomm circuitry in it, and the 5G mobile network upgrade cycle has reinvigorated the chip designer's marquee segment with renewed life. But the company thinks it has a lot to gain in other areas of technology in the coming years, especially in the automotive industry, wirelessly connected industrial equipment, smart home devices, and network infrastructure.
While the smartphone business continues to chug higher thanks to 5G, Qualcomm thinks its semiconductor designs for autos and other mobile devices will soar in the coming years. This internal revolution is already underway. The company reported a 51% gain in sales in its auto division in 2021, and a 67% gain in IoT (Internet of Things). Each segment is a small percentage of overall revenue, but that is poised to change in dramatic fashion in the course of the next decade as it sees both areas growing at a fast double-digit percentage pace for the foreseeable future.
That tees up Qualcomm as a steady and highly profitable stock to own for the 2020s. But shares are being beat up along with the rest of the tech sector so far this year. Shares are 11% down from their all-time high registered in the last month. That values the stock at less than 22 times trailing-12-month free cash flow, a real steal considering management is forecasting at least a 22% increase in year-over-year revenue and a 34% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings per share to kick off fiscal 2022. I'm a buyer after the market punishment of Qualcomm.

2022-01-21 00:00:00+00:00,Europe waits its turn as Intel commits to new U.S. chip factories,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/europe-waits-its-turn-as-intel-commits-to-new-u.s.-chip-factories,,,"By Nadine Schimroszik and Supantha Mukherjee
BERLIN/STOCKHOLM, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Intel's INTC.O announcement that it will invest more than $20 billion in two new semiconductor plants in the United States is in sharp contrast to its silence on European plans originally flagged last year.
The company said in September that it could invest as much as $95 billion in Europe over the next decade and announce the locations of two major new European chip fabrication plants by the end of 2021.
But no announcement has been made, while Intel on Friday laid out plans to build a massive new manufacturing site near Columbus, Ohio.
Analysts said the company could be waiting for the introduction of new legislation before deciding on a European location. The European Chips Act aims to reduce the continent's dependence on Asian suppliers for advanced semiconductors by subsidising the local development of large chip factories.
Intel has been in talks with governments of various European countries as it scouts for a location, including those of Germany and Italy.
""We are excited about the conversations we are having ... Details are confidential, but we will make an announcement as soon as possible,"" an Intel spokesperson said.
Gartner chip analyst Alan Priestley said that with the planned Ohio site, pressure on Intel to locate a site in Europe could have reduced.
""They could also delay the decision if they expect the European Chip Act to have material impact on the financing,"" he added.
The European Commission will propose the legislation in early February, and industry analysts expect it to pass later this year.
However, any additional capacity would need to start being built out now, as it can take three to four years for a chip factory to reach a significant output level, said Ondrej Burkacky, a senior partner at McKinsey.
Germany tops the list of potential candidates with the local governments of Penzing in Bavaria and Magdeburg and Dresden in eastern Germany trying to tempt Intel.
However, the mayor of Penzing told Reuters in December that he never heard back from Intel.
European carmakers were forced to cut production due to chip shortages last year as they jostled with consumer electronics makers to buy semiconductors.

10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology
When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*
They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Micron Technology wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of January 10, 2022
Jose Najarro: Micron eyes a new manufacturing location. This is a trend I think we're seeing pretty often or a lot recently. Micron Technology, many might know as the manufacturer of memory. They currently have two manufacturing plants here in the United States, one in Boise, Idaho, and one in Manassas, Virginia. Right now, they have about $150 billion that they're going to spend globally to build new manufacturing plants.
There are reports that they are eyeing maybe somewhere in Texas or Arizona. Nothing has been confirmed. But in the past two years, right. We've seen Taiwan [Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM)], I believe, go a little bit heavier in Arizona. We saw Samsung entered Texas recently, and then we have also Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) that's also focusing in Arizona. Do you guys think this trend is going to continue for a few more years, or is this something that's going to stay?
Billy Duberstein: Go ahead, Nick
Nicholas Rossolillo: Yeah, I think it's going to last awhile, especially with Micron because on their lastearnings call they're actually not planning on building this factory within the next couple of years. They're actually earmarking the spending for a few years down the road on this chip capacity increase. This really is a long-term trend. We're looking at the chip industry in a microcosm right now because of the chip shortage. But this is really a long-term trend that will play out over at least the next decade because so many chips are needed.
Billy Duberstein: Yeah, I'd also say that this is probably contingent on them getting subsidies from the government. The chips act is making its way through Congress. It might have been tied to the defense authorization bill at the end of last year. At least double-check that. But anyway, it's likely the subsidies are coming because the U.S. wants capacity on its own shores.
Most of Micron's capacity is in Taiwan and Japan and East Asia. Their headquarters and research and development is in Idaho. And their Virginia plant, I believe, is for auto and mature-process chips. Not the most leading-edge, but one where there's still a lot of growth. Most of their manufacturing is still in East Asia. They're likely earmarking this probably with the caveat that they would need to get some subsidies to make it cost-effective.
Jose Najarro: I think Nick made a great point there about the long term of these factories, right, where it's under the microscope. We're just looking at the semiconductor industry right now.And we think, hey, they're building a factory plant, next year, they're going to start producing. But most of these plants, it takes about five to six years before they go to full capacity of production. Even though we might be talking about the semiconductor shortage here, Nick made a great point that this is a long-term thing, that these are companies focusing five years from now that there's still going to need these plants. That's great, great news.

2022-01-21 00:00:00+00:00,Intel to Launch Bitcoin Mining Chip,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-to-launch-bitcoin-mining-chip,,,"By Landon Manning
In a move that could spell dramatic change for the bitcoin mining industry, American tech conglomerate Intel (INTC) is moving to execute newly-released plans on an “ultra-low-voltage energy-efficient Bitcoin mining ASIC” chip.
This news first appeared on January 18, with the ASIC — or application-specific integrated circuit, a computer chip that is central to the machines that “mine” bitcoin — and Intel reportedly plans to present more details on the chip at the upcoming International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC). 
The schedule for the 2022 ISSCC conference was released on January 18 as well, including among its features a presentation from Intel set for February 23. Titled “Bonanza Mine: An Ultra-Low-Voltage Energy Efficient Bitcoin Mining ASIC,” the talk is notably being presented by three different campuses and research centers run by Intel, all scattered across the West Coast. Already, this announcement has created a stir among the Bitcoin community.
This information comes on the tail of an interview conducted with Raja Koduri, senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics (AXG) group, in late December 2021. 
“GPUs will do graphics, gaming, and all those wonderful things,” he said. “But being able to do much more efficient blockchain validation at a much lower cost, much lower power, is a pretty solvable problem… We are working on that, and at some point in time, hopefully not too far into the future, we will share some interesting hardware for that.” 
However, whether this ISSCC presentation will truly fulfill this promise of presenting “interesting hardware,” or will only offer some smaller piece of conjecture or proofs of concept, is not immediately clear.
However, on January 19, paperwork filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in September finally became public record, and more details emerged. According to Fox Business, an Ohio-based crypto mining company GRIID is set to go public on the New York Stock Exchange in upcoming weeks, with an initial value around $3.3 billion. In an S-4 filing with the SEC dated September 8, “GRIID entered into a supply agreement… pursuant to which GRIID may purchase Intel-designed BZM2 ASICs,” with the acronym BZM2 referring to Intel’s Bonanza Mine ASIC chips. 
In other words, rather than just providing some technical demonstration, it is becoming increasingly clear that Intel’s Bonanza Mine project will be hitting the market soon, with a first major buyer already lined up. GRIID is, according to the agreement, entitled to buy at least a quarter of these BZM2 chips produced from now until 2025, with Intel agreeing to provide an initial shipment of chips in 2022. Many of the other details, such as the chips’ exact specifications or some of the financial underpinnings of this deal, remain yet unpublished, however.
Still, it appears that this new chip could have a major impact on Bitcoin’s most critical industry. The COVID-19 pandemic’s impacts on supply chains and the burgeoning interest in bitcoin has had a substantial effect on the availability of chips capable of mining bitcoin, and a new offering from a company like Intel could crack that dilemma wide open. And there are still questions as to just how low-voltage and energy efficient this new chip could really be. Regardless, it seems clear that the development and rollout of Intel’s new project will be nothing but good news for Bitcoin.
