2022-01-21 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel's move into Ohio brings new tech kudos, competition for talent",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-move-into-ohio-brings-new-tech-kudos-competition-for-talent,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee and Timothy Aeppel
OAKLAND, Calif./NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s INTC.O plan to build a $20 billion chip-making complex on the outskirts of Columbus, Ohio is the clearest sign of a burgeoning tech sector in the U.S. Midwest, a development that is sure to raise corporate competition for workers and resources.
The Intel investment is the state's largest ever, but the Columbus suburb of New Albany, where Intel will build two chip factories, already has seen an influx of data centers, including from Amazon.com IncAMZN.O, Facebook parent Meta FB.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google.
Just last August, Google raised its investment in New Albany by $1 billion.
""Facilities like (the Intel factories), all of these jobs are high skilled jobs,"" said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo speaking at the announcement in Ohio. ""All of this manufacturing at every level, not just the PhDs, require some amount of training,"" she added, calling for more apprenticeship programs.
The first two Intel chip factories will create 3,000 jobs, and the company plans as many as eight factories over time. It has committed $100 million to work with Ohio universities and community colleges for building up a workforce in the chip industry.
While other rust belt centers have suffered over the decades, Ohio’s state capital Columbus with Ohio State University and six Fortune 500 companies, including Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. [RIC:RIC:MNUIC.UL] and Cardinal Health Inc CAH.N, has fared well.
In addition, it has been an early winner in the build up of the logistics and warehousing industry thanks to its location near the important interstate highway 70 that cuts across the U.S.
Ample water and stable power resources were also key to winning the deal as Intel needs enormous natural resources, though it has said it aims to be powered 100% by renewable energy and achieve net positive water.
""Ohio for years has been saying we have an abundance of water and that would be a strength for industry in this country. And it came in as an advantage here for us,"" said JP Nauseef, president of JobsOhio, which was instrumental in bringing the Intel investment to the state.

According to recent reports, PetSmart may undergo a $14 billion merger with SPAC KKR Acquisition Holdings I (NYSE:KAHC).
This is an investment company that went public last March in a $1.2 billion IPO.
The SPAC was created by KKR (NYSE:KKR) and Glenn Murphy, the chairman of Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU).

On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down by 150 points. The Nasdaq fell for a third straight session, ending Thursday nearly 12% below its latest record close in November. Investors are also swapping out their growth and technology stocks that thrived in the early days of the pandemic. This along with investors jitters on the Fed’s plans to increase interest rates to combat raging inflation. However, IMF head Kristalina Georgieva says that the interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve could throw cold water on the already weak economic recoveries in certain countries.
She says that an increase in U.S. rates could have significant implications for countries with higher levels of dollar-denominated debt. She also says that it was therefore hugely important for the Feds to communicate its policy plans to prevent surprises. In other news, Under Armour (NYSE: UAA) is up after Citi (NYSE: C) upgraded the stock to a Buy rating, saying that the company is emerging from the pandemic in a strong position in North America.
Among the Dow Jones leaders, shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are down 0.33% today while Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is also down by 0.62%. Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and Nike (NYSE: NKE) however, ticked higher on Friday. Among the Dow financial leaders, Visa (NYSE: V) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) are trading lower at 0.30% and 0.78% respectively.
Shares of electric vehicle (EV) leader Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are down by 2.06% on Friday. Rival EV companies like Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) are also down by 1.58% and 1.98% today. Chinese EV leaders like Li Auto (NASDAQ: LI) and Xpeng Motors (NYSE: XPEV) are trading lower at 3.43% and 4.80% respectively.
Dow Jones Today: Treasury Yields And Jobless Claims Unnerving Investors?
Following the stock market opening on Friday, the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq are trading 0.72%, 0.52%, and 1.06% lower. Among exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) is down by 1.33% on Friday, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: SPY) is up by 0.77%.
Today, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury ticked below 1.8% on Friday morning. This comes after hitting 1.9% on Wednesday, with investors trailing on the Federal Reserve’s timeline for raising interest rates and broadly tightening monetary policy. Also, a pullback in central bank economic support measures along with rising inflation has pushed investors to sell out throughout the week.
Bitcoin And Cryptocurrencies Tumble
Bitcoin prices fell sharply yesterday, dropping to below $40,000 while Etherium prices also dived, wiping out nearly $150 billion from the crypto market. The declines in cryptocurrencies seem to follow Wall Street losses on Thursday. This goes against the investment case for Bitcoin serving as a hedge against rising inflation as a result of government stimulus. Analysts point out that the risk is that a more hawkish Federal Reserve may damper the prospects of investing in cryptocurrency.

Intel Reveals $20 Billion Plan To Expand Manufacturing Capabilities In Ohio
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) could be worth keeping an eye on in thestock market today This could be the case given the chipmaking goliath’s latest announcement. Notably, Intel is now looking to invest $20 billion in efforts to expand its chip manufacturing capabilities. In detail, this will take place via the construction of at least two semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs). Also, these fabs will be built on a 1,000-acre site nearby Columbus, Ohio. On top of that, Intel also currently has the option to expand on the current construction operation. This could ideally see the firm grow its construction project to up to 2,000 acres and eight fabs.
For the current plans, Intel is planning to begin construction of the first plant this year. Should things go smoothly, the firm sees the new facility beginning work by 2025. In an interview with Time magazine, CEO Pat Gelsinger also revealed Intel’s plans with the space. He starts by saying that Intel is aiming for it to be the largest fab globally. Additionally, he comments, “We helped to establish the Silicon Valley. Now we’re going to do the Silicon Heartland.”
Overall, the current move would be in line with the U.S.’s plans to increase domestic chip production figures. With the semiconductor shortages significantly impacting key markets like the automotive industry, this is understandable. As such, I could see investors eyeing INTC stock when considering possible long-term growth names in the market today. Now, INTC stock is currently gaining by 0.82%.

Netflix Slumps Over 20% On Disappointing Subscriber Growth Outlook 
In other news, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) is making waves in the stock market now after its latest quarterly earnings report. To begin with, the company’s top-line results are worth noting. Namely, Netflix posted earnings of $1.33 on revenue of $7.71 billion for the quarter. For earnings per share, the company smashed consensus projections of $0.82. Regarding quarterly revenue, it was mostly in line with Street estimates. However, the real metric investors seem to be focusing on now is the company’s latest subscriber growth figures.
In its latest quarter, Netflix added a total of 8.28 million subscribers, topping analyst forecasts of 8.19 million. This would mark a notable decrease from the 3.98 million subscribers it added back in Q1 2021. Moreover, the company also provided a less-than-ideal outlook for subscriber growth in the current quarter as well. According to Netflix, it will likely add 2.5 million new paying subscribers to its current base. This translates to less than half of forecasts of 6.93 million. Because of all this, NFLX stock is currently sliding by 23.23% as of today’s opening bell. 
All in all, Netflix cites growing competition in the streaming space for this ‘safe’ guidance. Nevertheless, it is also important to note these results are in comparison to pandemic era peaks. As such, the sell-off in NFLX stock could make for a good entry point now.

2022-01-20 00:00:00+00:00,Intel plans $20 bln chip manufacturing site in Ohio - sources,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-plans-%2420-bln-chip-manufacturing-site-in-ohio-sources,,,"By David Shepardson and Jane Lanhee Lee
WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O on Friday is set to announce it will invest $20 billion in a massive new manufacturing site near Columbus, Ohio to develop and manufacture advanced semiconductor chips, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.
The planned investment includes 3,000 permanent jobs on the 1,000-acre site in New Albany, Ohio. Time magazine, which first reported the news, said Intel will build at least two semiconductor fabrication plants.
President Joe Biden is making remarks Friday on the U.S. government's efforts ""to increase the supply of semiconductors, make more in America, and rebuild our supply chains here at home,"" the White House said earlier.
Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger is set to appear with Biden on Friday at the White House, sources told Reuters. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
The initial $20 billion is the first step of what could be an eight-factory complex costing tens of billions of dollars.
Intel declined to comment on its plans but said in a statement that Gelsinger would disclose details Friday of ""Intel’s latest plans for investment in manufacturing leadership"" as it works ""to meet the surging demand for advanced semiconductors.""
Chipmakers are scrambling to boost output after manufacturers around the world, from autos to consumer electronics, faced shortages of chips. Intel also is trying to win back its position as maker of the smallest and fastest chips from current leader TSMC 2330.TW, which is based in Taiwan.
Gelsinger last fall also said he planned to announce another U.S. campus site before the end of the year that would eventually hold eight chip factories.
He told the Washington Post the complex could cost $100 billion over a decade and eventually employ 10,000.
Gelsinger is driving Intel plans to expand, especially in Europe and the United States, as it seeks to heat up competition with global rivals and respond to a worldwide microchip shortage.
Intel and Italy are intensifying talks over investments expected to be worth around 8 billion euros ($9 billion) to build an advanced semiconductor packaging plant, Reuters reported late last year.
The Biden administration is making a big push to convince Congress to approve $52 billion in funding to dramatically increase chip production in the United States. The Senate in June voted 68-32 for the chips funding as part of a broader competitiveness bill, but it has been stalled in the House.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday she hopes to ""go to conference"" on the chips funding measure soon.
Still, Intel's plans for new factories will not alleviate the current demand crunch, because such complexes take years to build. Gelsinger previously said he expected the chip shortages to last into 2023.
In September, Intel broke ground on two factories in Arizona as part of its turnaround plan to become a major manufacturer of chips for outside customers. The $20 billion plants will bring the total number of Intel factories at its campus in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler to six.
Intel told Time it considered 38 sites before picking New Albany, Ohio in December. Ohio has agreed to invest $1 billion in infrastructure improvements to facilitate the factory, Time said.

10 stocks we like better than Intel
When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*
They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Intel wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of January 10, 2022
Billy Duberstein: It [Intel] has a new CEO with a new plan. These things will take time, especially because he wants Intel to be a fab [factory] for other companies. It can take several years to build one of these fabs that they're going about now. Like I said, it might be a little bit early, but definitely interesting with the introduction of the GPU that they're going to try to go toe-to-toe with AMD. It will be pretty interesting to see.
Nicholas Rossolillo: I'm in wait-and-see mode on Intel. I have my doubts. Falling behind on the technology curve is hard. It's hard to come back from. The one issue that I take with Intel's strategy is it's not a fair comparison because AMD was a tiny company, but when they got into a ton of trouble during the financial crisis, they basically picked between their chip design business and their manufacturing business, because they used to be like Intel. They used to mirror Intel a lot more closely than they do now because they did both. They designed, and they had fabs.
The company that we now know as GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: GFS), that used to be part of AMD. They spun it off, and they focused completely on just chip design. That's how they caught up to and now have started eating Intel's market share. Intel is a different story because it's huge. It's starting from a different place. It's not a tiny company. It's still the world's largest semiconductor company by revenue. It's huge. It's over $70 billion a year or almost, excuse me, almost $80 billion per year in revenue. It's massive. It's going to be a really, really difficult thing to get that ship, that massive ship turning in the right direction.
I have my doubts that if they do turn it around, I think long term, it will just be an industry performer. It won't outperform. I think there might be a spike for a few years. Maybe it outperforms the industry when it gets things right, and then just like industry-performs after that. If you're looking for growth, all-out growth, I'm not buying it. Maybe I'll be wrong. But like Billy said, if you want a cheap dividend stock, Intel might be your ticket.
Jose Najarro: You mentioned a great point there, Nick: how AMD and Intel both starting in different places. AMD, for example, to get into all these laptops and desktops and OEMs [original equipment manufacturers]. It had to really work its butt off to make great relations with these companies. To some extent, that might be a strength or weakness to Intel, where now they have this new graphics card. They already have great partnerships because of their processors with all these OEMs. To some extent, they could probably heavy-hand that: ""Hey, for you to really get our processors, maybe you should really take a look at some of our graphics cards as well to incorporate."" Might be to some strength, but if at the end of the day, if the product doesn't do as well, the customer and the market decides if that's something that they should continue.
Billy Duberstein: You're going to have to pick the AMD ecosystem or the Intel ecosystem. It's going to be more even, I think, going forward. But it's coming from a place where Intel was 90, and AMD was 10. Now, it's going to be probably closer to 50-50 for a while. We'll see if Intel can get its act together over the next few years. It's hard to come back from falling behind in technology. But the new CEO is attracting a lot of talent. They certainly have the financial means to invest a lot in R&D, so it'll be interesting to watch.

2022-01-20 00:00:00+00:00,7 Dividend Stocks Trading at Attractive Valuations,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-dividend-stocks-trading-at-attractive-valuations,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
In general, investors look for capital gains from high-growth stocks. Dividend stocks, meanwhile, often don’t provide significant upside. However, investors who prefer regular cash flows tend to go overweight on dividend stocks.
Of course, there are exceptions among dividend plays, from the perspective of healthy capital gains as well as dividend gains. My focus in this column, though, is on dividend stocks that seem to be trading at attractive valuations.
It’s worth noting that the S&P 500 currently trades at a cyclically adjusted price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 39.6. As such, I have screened dividend stocks that trade at a significant discount to broad market valuations. Over the next six to 12 months, these picks have headroom for meaningful upside. Investors can therefore enjoy the double benefit of regular cash inflows as well as capital growth.
I would also add that most of these names are low-beta stocks. With liquidity tightening around the corner, there is a case for some correction in the markets. In a bearish sentiment scenario, these picks are likely to be outperformers.
7 Best Mutual Funds to Buy for the Coming Rate Hikes
So, without further ado, let’s take a deeper look into these seven attractively valued picks.
Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)
Altria Group (NYSE:MO)
Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)
British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Chevron (NYSE:CVX)
Ford (NYSE:F)
Dividend Stocks to Buy: Pfizer (PFE)
Source: pio3 / Shutterstock.com
First up on this list of dividend stocks is PFE stock, which has surged by 35% over the past six months. The breakout came after an extended period of consolidation. At a forward P/E ratio of 12.6, Pfizer still looks attractive. Furthermore, PFE stock has an annual dividend payout of $1.60, which implies a healthy dividend yield of 2.99%.
From a growth and cash flow upside perspective, there are two points to note.
First, Pfizer expects revenue of $36 billion in 2021 from the Covid-19 vaccine segment. With the omicron variant, booster doses and vaccination for teenagers, segment revenue should remain robust throughout 2022 as well. In particular, vaccine sales will have a meaningful impact on cash flows.
Furthermore, this company has a deep pipeline of drug candidates. Currently, PFE has 29 candidates in Phase 3 and another 29 in Phase 2. It expects to deliver double-digit earnings per share (EPS) growth through 2025 as these drugs become commercialized (Page 11).
It’s also worth noting that, with healthy growth in its cash buffer, Pfizer has been active on the acquisition front. In the last few months of 2021, the company has announced two acquisitions. This is another factor likely to boost growth.
Overall, PFE stock looks attractive considering the growth visibility. Additionally, as cash flows swell, the company is positioned to pay higher dividends.
Altria (MO)

Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.com
MO stock has trended higher by 22% over the last 12 months. This pick of the dividend stocks yields 7.19% and still looks attractive from a valuation perspective. Altria stock trades at a forward P/E of 10.88.
I agree that growth has been a concern for Altria lately as the company pursues its business transformation. However, its core business of combustible products continues to deliver healthy cash flows.
For the first nine months of 2021, Altria reported $5.7 billion in operating cash flows. Additionally, the company has around $3 billion in cash and equivalents. Therefore, there is ample financial flexibility here for dividends and investments in its business transformation.
It’s also worth noting that the company’s oral tobacco and e-cigarette segment has witnessed steady growth. Plus, another potential catalyst for Altria is the company’s stake in Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON). The possible federal legalization of cannabis in the United States could help Cronos gain growth traction.
7 of the Top-Rated Pharmaceutical Stocks for Q1
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also postponed its decision on the company’s Juul vaping products. Any positive outcome on this front could take MO stock higher. Overall, this pick is trading at attractive valuations and dividends are likely to sustain, even with some business headwinds.
Dividend Stocks to Buy: Lockheed Martin (LMT)
LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California."" width=""300"" height=""169"">

Next up, LMT stock has also been an underperformer in the last 12 months, trading largely sideways. However, this company’s annualized dividend of $11.20 is both attractive and sustainable. At a forward P/E of 14.15, this one of the dividend stocks looks positioned for a breakout on the upside.
An important point to note here is that the defense sector is relatively immune to global economic shocks. As a matter of fact, global defense spending increased even during the pandemic year. With Lockheed Martin expanding clients beyond the United States, its growth outlook looks positive.
This point is underscored by the fact that Lockheed reported an order backlog of $134.8 billion as of the third quarter of 2021. The backlog provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility.
For the last year, Lockheed has guided for operating cash flow (OCF) of $8.3 billion. Further, for 2022, the company has provided OCF guidance of $8.4 billion. Clearly, cash flows will likely remain stable. This will ensure that dividends sustain.
Finally, on international growth, Lockheed Martin is already delivering F-35 jets to the U.S. as well as 14 other international allies. For 2021, the company beat its guidance for F-35 deliveries. With geopolitical tensions remaining high, allied defense spending should act as a catalyst for order backlog growth.
British American Tobacco (BTI)

British American Tobacco is the next entry on this list of dividend stocks. BTI stock was trading at around the $34 level back in November 2021. Since then, this pick has witnessed a sharp rally, currently trading at nearly $43.
However, from a valuation perspective, the forward P/E here of just 9.68 still seems very attractive. I expect further rallying for BTI stock. Further, investors will also benefit from its dividend yield of 6.9%.
Similar to Altria, British American Tobacco has also been pursuing portfolio transformation with a focus on non-combustible products. It’s product, Vuse, is already a leading vapor brand globally.
For the first half of 2021, this company reported 50% growth from new category products. British American Tobacco also claims to have 16.1 million non-combustible customers. Further, BTI reported operating cash flow of £2.25 billion (around $3.1 billion) for the first half of 2021. This would imply an annualized cash flow potential of £4.5 billion pounds ($6.1 billion). The company therefore has robust flexibility for dividends and deleveraging.
7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy and Hold Until 2030
Finally, back in October 2021, British American Tobacco made an investment of $3.5 million in an energy drink start-up. It’s very likely that this company will diversify even more moving forward as it pursues portfolio transformation. However, the combustible segment will continue to be a key cash flow driver for the next few years.
Dividend Stocks to Buy: Intel (INTC)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
INTC stock is another quality name among the dividend stocks that trades at an attractive valuation. At a forward P/E of 10.14 and a dividend yield of 2.59%, these shares are worth considering even after a rally of 6% in the past one month.
It’s true that Intel has been a laggard in terms of investments and innovation. However, things seem to be changing and this will have a positive impact on INTC stock. For 2022, Intel has planned investments of between $25 billion and $28 billion. The company has also guided for higher investments in the next few years.
From the perspective of innovation, Intel will be launching its first AISC-based infrastructure processing unit (IPU). Further, the company’s next-generation discrete GPU for gaming will likely be launched in Q1 of this year.
Another catalyst for INTC is the potential listing of Mobileye. Intel plans to take the self-driving car unit public in 2022 and it’s likely that the business will command a valuation of more than $50 billion. This will unlock value for shareholders.
It’s worth noting that, for the first nine months of 2021, Intel reported operating cash flow of $24.2 billion. The company also reported cash and short-terms investment of $11.9 billion as of Q3 2021. Therefore, there is ample financial flexibility here for big investments and sustained dividends.
Chevron (CVX)
Source: tishomir / Shutterstock.com
Chevron is the next name on this list. With oil trending higher, CVX stock has witnessed a strong rally in the last 12 months. However, relative to the broad markets, CVX still seems attractively valued. This pick also offers a healthy dividend yield of 4.16%.
A key reason to include Chevron among the top dividends stocks is its cash flow potential. For Q3 2021, the company reported operating cash flow of $8.6 billion. With Brent trending higher, the annualized cash flow potential is in the range of $35 billon to $40 billion.
These cash flows will ensure healthy dividends and sustained share repurchases. Additionally, it’s worth noting that Chevron reported a net-debt ratio of 18.7% as of Q3 2021. The balance sheet is robust and allows CVX to pursue aggressive investments in order to benefit from higher oil prices.
7 Undervalued Stocks to Buy Before Wall Street Catches On
In terms of asset base, Chevron has 6P resources of 84 billion barrels of oil equivalent (bboe). The company also has had a reserve replacement ratio (RRR) of 99% in the last five years. Therefore, with a robust reserve life, there is clear cash flow visibility here. Low break-even assets ensure that EBITDA margin remains strong even if there is some correction in oil prices from current levels.
Dividend Stocks to Buy: Ford (F)
Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com
Last up on this list of dividend stocks, F stock has witnessed a big rally in the last 12 months. During this period, the stock has surged more than 120%. However, Ford rallied from oversold levels and still trades at an attractive forward P/E of 11.86. F stock also has a dividend yield of 1.78%.
One important point to note here is that Ford is pursuing a significant portfolio transformation towards electric vehicles (EVs). Over the next few years, the company has big investments planned. This is likely to be a catalyst for upside and possible dividend growth.
In terms of investments, Ford and SK Innovation are already planning to invest $11.4 billion in production sites in both Tennessee and Kentucky. The investment will be targeted towards growth in battery capacity and higher-production capacity for the F-150 Lightning truck.
In China, Ford has also already opened 25 stores exclusively for EVs. The company plans to increase the number of stores to 100 over the next five years. The company has also already started delivering “locally produced” Mustang Mach-E models in China.
Finally, though, Ford has a healthy balance sheet. As of Q3, the company reported a total liquidity buffer of $47.4 billion. Additionally, it has continued to report positive adjusted free cash flows. This balance sheet allows ample financial headroom for Ford to invest and benefit from positive industry tailwinds.

Investors are finally bearish on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock. After a fairytale run in the last few years, shares are losing steam. However, several catalysts can bring it back to life. The contrasting starts of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD illustrate that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to investing.

Growth stocks are having a tough time of it in the new year. But AMD’s outlook for the coming quarter might provide some relief to worried investors. The company will report its fourth-quarter results in about two weeks. And it will be intriguing if there are enough good news items in the earnings report to arrest the stock’s decline.
The company expects a major boost from the increased demand for graphics cards, gaming consoles, and data center segments. Over the last five years, the company has built up an enviable position in its core markets. It has taken away substantial market share from Intel in the processors market. At the same time, it is expanding into new areas to diversify revenues. All of this is leading to significant shareholder interest.
But now Intel is fighting back. It is a company with an aggressive product roadmap and massive capital spending. This makes it the perfect bet for investors looking to buy tech stocks that have long-term potential at affordable prices, which also happens to be what Intel has in store. The company’s new line of processors is doing exceptionally well. And their upcoming chips are even faster. That will lead to a better valuation for AMD. Something value investors have been waiting for.
AMD’s Operating Metrics Are Great
AMD’s revenue comes from two reportable segments. The first one includes sales on their consumer GPU and CPU product families, accounting for almost 56% in the last quarter alone. Since introducing its highly successful Ryzen microprocessor, this segment has performed exceptionally well. The Ryzen microprocessor was a revolutionary design that overcame many obstacles to become one of today’s market’s fastest and most affordable processors.

The chipmaker’s second reportable segment, namely Enterprise and Semi-Custom division, accounted for 44% of its sales last quarter. This includes EPYC server SKUs and custom chips built specifically to meet the demands in gaming consoles or other specialized applications. The recent performance of the company’s business has been impressive, with no signs of cyclicality.
The gaming console market is projected to continue growing this year. The new season is starting to bring some exciting changes, with sales for Sony’s (NYSE:SONY) PlayStation 5 and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox Series X/S consoles growing exponentially this year. Both of these top-of-the-line gaming consoles use AMD chips to power their operation. And both have been, for the most part, out of stock in throughout 2021. This indicates that there is strong customer demand as it pertains to these devices.
The data center market is a great opportunity for AMD this year. Analysts are forecasting AMD’s share of the server market is projected to grow by 25% this year, which would be an excellent opportunity for AMD’s top-line given their impressive share of the lucrative industry. The growth could also give them more leverage when competing against Intel, the dominant company in this segment.
Intel Is Finally Competing Well With AMD Stock
Intel’s Alder Lake processors are a game-changer, helping it regain a significant chunk of lost market share. These new CPUs are reportedly 30% faster than their AMD counterparts and sport affordable prices. This has caused AMD to reduce the cost of its Ryzen processor line. But Intel still prices aggressively compared to peers.
Intel is also breaking new ground by releasing a range of processors designed to power laptops and desktops alike. These 60 Alder Lake Series CPUs will be featured in hundreds of different computer models, all coming out this year alone. Intel is going to get back at AMD in a big way. The new Arc GPU has been getting a lot of attention, with Intel reporting more than 50 design wins. Intel is getting ready to take away market share from AMD in the graphics card space because their technology is just as good, if not superior than competitors.
Meanwhile, AMD’s recent notebook processors power some of the fastest laptops on earth. AMD has finally introduced their new Ryzen 6000 CPUs for laptops at CES 2022, which is powered by the company’s upgraded Zen 3 Plus architecture. This latest model features a 6 nm process node and comes with RDNA 2 graphics architecture.
Intel’s stock has been on a surprising start this year, up despite the turmoil in technology. Wall Street is betting that Intel will turn things around and recover its former glory days as one of America’s leaders in semiconductors production once again. Intel’s latest offerings in the Alder Lake lineup take on AMD and provide more than enough power for gamers. So, there is the reason for this optimism.
However, do not expect AMD to give Intel a walkover.
Expect Big Things From AMD in 2022
The year 2022 is shaping up to be one of the most interesting for laptops as both AMD and Intel announced full slates at CES that will likely power almost any major computer released this season. This year’s Ryzen 6000 chips use a slightly upgraded architecture from last year’s 5000 series. The new Ryzen 7 5800X3D is coming soon to take on Intel’s current leading chip, the i7 8700K, with its chips set to outpace the Ryzen 5900X by 15%.
AMD’s new Ryzen 7000 Series chips will be the first of their kind to use a 5nm process and ship with an updated socket. They are also set for release later in 2022, though there’s going to be quite some time before they reach stores since they’re using AMD’s new Zen 4 architecture.
The fight between Intel and AMD over whose processors offer better performance has been reignited with the release of their newest chip, Alder Lake. This new processor from Intel shuts down competitors at an excellent price point.
Nonetheless, expect things to get better for AMD as the year progresses.
Let AMD Stock Lose More Steam
There are many ups and downs for this industry-leading manufacturer. But they’ve still managed to grow their market share significantly with new releases. Intel has finally hit back, and their investors are rejoicing. Along the way, it has taken the shine off AMD stock. And that’s a good thing.
Great tech stocks are rarely available at a discount. After a very long time, AMD stock is available at somewhat of a discount. That’s not to say this is a value stock. By all means, this is an expensive company. However, it can grow into its valuation.
Therefore, it’s the best time to buy this one.

2022-01-20 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia Stock Is a Buy on Every Dip as It Heads Toward a Trillion,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-is-a-buy-on-every-dip-as-it-heads-toward-a-trillion,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Investors in the artificial intelligence (AI) and chip darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock saw mouth-watering returns in 2021.
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Over the past 12 months, NVDA stock has returned around 82%. By comparison, the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index returned a little more than 18%.
In November 2021, Nvidia shares hit a record high of $346.47. Yet, since then, it has come under pressure, and currently hovers around $250—down about 14% year-to-date (YTD).
The stock’s 52-week range has been $115.67 – $346.47, while the market capitalization (cap) stands at $627 billion.
Wall Street pays close attention to shares of the chip giant as Nvidia has also moved into disruptive technologies, such as robotics, AI, autonomous driving and the metaverse.
Despite the recent slide in price, buy-and-hold investors with two- to three-year horizons could consider investing in NVDA stock now. Here’s why.
How NVDA Stock’s Q3 Earnings Came
Management announced Q3 results in Nov 17. Revenue was $7.10 billion—a record number, and was up 50% year-over-year (YoY). The company reports revenue in three main segments:
Data Center (record revenue of $2.94 billion, an increase of 55% YOY);
Gaming (record revenue of $3.22 billion, an increase of 42% YOY);
Professional Visualization (record revenue of $577 million, an increase of 144%).
Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.17, up 60% YOY. Free cash flow (FCF) for the quarter was over $1.27 billion.
7 Best Mutual Funds to Buy for the Coming Rate Hikes
Wall Street was pleased to see that Nvidia’s efforts to gain market share with data centers was going well. Enterprises, as well as cloud providers, are increasingly relying on its graphics processors.
Following the announcement, CEO Jensen Huang expressed his content with the metrics and highlighted the ways companies rely on Nvidia’s products.
Management also gave a robust forecast for revenue for the current quarter that will end this month. Sales should reach $7.4 billion in Q4.
Before the release of the quarterly results, NVDA stock was shy of $300. Following the announcement, shares saw an all-time high (ATH) of $346.47. But now, they are around $267.50, down around 20%.
Adding Nvidia Stock To Portfolios
Among 43 analysts polled, NVDA stock has a “buy” rating. Also, the consensus of 38 analysts for the 12-month median price target stands at $350, implying an upside potential of over 33% from current levels.
The 12-month price estimates currently range between $200 and $400.
Nvidia shares trade at 58.82 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E)  and 31.51x times trailing sales. These valuation metrics imply that despite the recent steep decline in price, NVDA stock is not necessarily cheap.
By comparison, these numbers for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are 42.19x and 11.42x. The comparable metrics for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) stand at 25.38x and 11.31x. Finally, Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC), numbers are 13.97x and 2.64x.
Long-term investors who are not concerned about short-term volatility in NVDA stock could consider investing around $250, or even below. Their price target should be analysts’ estimate of $350.
Others who are interested in Nvidia stock but want to diversify their portfolios could instead buy an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that also holds NVDA.
Examples would include the Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXQ), the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ:BOTZ), the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:META), or the Volt RoboCar Disruption and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:VCAR).
An Options Trade on NVDA Stock
Finally, those readers who are experienced in options could also consider putting together an options trade, such as a bull call spread. This strategy may be appropriate if you are bullish on NVDA stock at this time.
However, readers should note that options trading is not suitable for most retail portfolios, and thus the discussion below should mostly be taken as an educational piece.
In a bull call spread, the trader typically buys a call and then sells an out-of-the-money (OTM) call. The trade profits when the underlying stock rises in price.
Both of these calls have the same expiration date. And the options trader establishes the spread for a net debit (or net cost). At trade entry, the investor always knows the maximum profit and loss potential.
As I write, NVDA stock is hovering at $250.80. For example, the trader could buy the Mar. 18 260 call and sell the 270 call. The trade cost (or maximum loss) would be $380 (difference in the option premiums multiplied by 100).
Similarly, the maximum potential profit would be $620 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid). Understandably, these numbers do not account for brokerage costs or potential taxes.
On Mar. 18, if NVDA stock closes below 260, the most this trade would lose is the $380 premium paid. And, at expiry, the trade would breakeven (i.e., neither gain nor lose money) at a stock price of $263.80.
Finally, the potential gain will also be capped above $270. Put another way, it does not matter how high Nvidia shares could go up as the trade’s maximum profit potential is $620.
The Bottom Line
Nvidia has become one of the most important chip and AI names in the past several years. However, along with many other hot tech shares, NVDA stock is currently under significant pressure.
High-growth names like Nvidia occasionally become vulnerable due to a prior rapid increase in price. After a year like 2021 that saw NVDA shares almost double in price, some short-term profit-taking was to be expected.
We now have a busy earnings season in front of us. Therefore, the current volatility could easily continue for several more weeks. As Wall Street gets ready to hear quarterly metrics from the semiconductor industry, Nvidia shares will likely stay volatile in the near future.
Yet, long-term investors, who can handle such short-term choppiness, could regard further drops in NVDA stock price as a good opportunity to buy into this growth company.

2022-01-20 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Too Late to Buy Taiwan Semiconductor Stock?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-too-late-to-buy-taiwan-semiconductor-stock,,,"Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM) surged 6% higher two days after the company announced its Q4 earnings. As the world's largest semiconductor foundry, it has become one of the world's largest and most influential companies.
However, it has grown to a market cap of $730 billion, which is a concern to some investors, since a massive size can slow growth rates. Will it remain a compelling investment as the chip shortage eases?
Image source: Getty Images.
The state of TSMC
TSMC continues to dominate the foundry space. It accounted for 53% of the entire foundry market in the third quarter of 2021, according to TrendForce. Moreover, it serves fabless chip companies such as AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Most of the industry depends heavily on TSMC. Due to its technological lead over Samsung and other peers, TSMC is likely the most essential company in the semiconductor industry and arguably the world's most indispensable company in any industry.
In addition to its market power, it also continues to benefit from an ongoing chip shortage, and its spending plans are mind-boggling. To that end, it reported in April that it would invest $100 billion in new foundries over the next three years. Also, in the latest report, TSMC announced that it plans to spend between $40 billion and $44 billion in 2022 alone to increase production as artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), Internet of Things (IoT), and other emerging industries demand more chips.
As long as the chip shortage persists, the added capacity should add to the top and bottom lines. Still, should supply catch up to demand, it could eventually reduce TSMC's pricing power, reducing or possibly reversing the company's revenue growth.
Industry headwinds
Nonetheless, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), who is also a TSMC client, has entered the foundry business and made similar moves to add capacity. Also, peers such as UMC and GlobalFoundries have made expansion plans. This could hurt profitability later as the chip supply catches up to demand.
Intel claims it can catch up to TSMC by 2024 and reclaim the technical lead in 2025. Longtime industry analysts may recall that Intel lost its technical leadership in the early 2010s when development cycles expanded beyond two years. Moreover, AMD took a technical lead in some areas after many investors had left it for dead as recently as 2015. TSMC stockholders should not write off the possibility of Intel or another peer making such a comeback.
TSMC's financials
Taiwan Semiconductor reported revenue of $57 billion in 2021. This amounted to a 19% increase compared with 2020 and led to a net income of $21 billion, 15% more than last year. Although the cost of revenue and operating grew at a slower pace than revenue, non-operating income dropped by 27% during the year to $470 million, cutting into profit growth.
Additionally, analysts forecast consensus revenue in 2022 of $75 billion, a 31% increase. Thanks mainly to the post-earnings bump, TSMC stock is up by just over 7% over the last year.
TSM data by YCharts
Furthermore, TSMC stock currently trades for 36 times earnings. This is significantly below its key clients. AMD sells for a 42 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio while Nvidia is at 83 times earnings. Nonetheless, Qualcomm sells for 24 times earnings, and client-competitor Intel trades at an 11 P/E ratio, indicating a moderate valuation for the company.
Is it too late to consider TSMC?
TSMC continues to dominate and lead its industry. Admittedly, with both TSMC and its peers adding capacity, the chip shortage could abate in the foreseeable future, which could eventually reduce the company's revenue. Also, the emerging Intel threat could also point to competitive challenges later.
However, Intel remains far behind TSMC technically and has yet to prove it can catch up. With a moderate valuation and a substantial revenue growth set to continue despite its size, investors can likely still beat the market with this chip stock.

2022-01-19 00:00:00+00:00,Earnings Preview: Intel (INTC) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-intel-intc-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline,,,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Intel (INTC) reports results for the quarter ended December 2021. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.
The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 26, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world's largest chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.90 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -40.8%.
Revenues are expected to be $18.39 billion, down 7.9% from the year-ago quarter.
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.
Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Intel?
For Intel, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.
So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Intel will beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Intel would post earnings of $1.11 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.71, delivering a surprise of +54.05%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
Intel doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

2022-01-19 00:00:00+00:00,Top Dividend Stocks To Buy In 2022? 3 Reported Earnings Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-dividend-stocks-to-buy-in-2022-3-reported-earnings-today,,,"3 Dividend Stocks To Potentially Add To Your Watchlist Right Now
Even while the stock market appears to be recovering on news of positive earnings today, dividend stocks remain a viable play. For the most part, this is likely due to numerous factors dampening the current growth story in stocks. From the upcoming interest rate hikes and soaring inflation to bond yields holding above 2-year highs, this is apparent. Because of all this, some investors could be overlooking the current earnings season for more defensive stocks. Notably, this would be where the top dividend stocks in thestock market todaycome into play.
Overall, dividend stocks, in theory, offer investors a more predictable source of income. This is, mostly, in the form of quarterly dividend payouts per share. In this space, investors will likely be eyeing massive companies that have long and strong dividend-paying histories. For example, we could look at the likes of 3M (NYSE: MMM). The multinational conglomerate currently boasts an annual dividend yield of 3.32%. This is after increasing its dividend consistently for the past 62 years. Not to mention, there is the fact that the company’s offerings play crucial roles in vital industries worldwide. After considering 3M’s dividends alongside the relevance of its products, I could understand the appeal.
If that wasn’t enough, there are also some dividend-paying firms making plays now as well. Evidently, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) are bolstering their current partnership. So much so that Intel will be buying the first unit of ASML’s latest chip manufacturing system. All in all, there is no shortage of dividend stocks for investors to consider now. As such, here are three to check out in thestock market today
Top Dividend Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] This Week
Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC)
Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS)
Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG)
Bank of America Corporation
Bank of America is a multinational investment bank and financial services company. In fact, it is one of the world’s leading financial institutions, serving individual consumers and small and middle-market businesses. Its services include a full range of banking, investment, asset management, and other financial and risk management products and services. Impressively, it serves approximately 66 million consumer and small business clients with over 4,000 retail financial centers and approximately 17,000 ATMs.
Today, the company reported its fourth-quarter financials. Diving in, net income for the quarter rose to $7 billion, or $0.82 per diluted share. This reflects strong operating leverage as revenues grew faster than expenses. Revenue for the quarter was $22.1 billion, increasing by 10% year-over-year. A significant chunk of this quarter’s income was from its Consumer Banking segment, at $3.1 billion. This comes after deposit balances were up 16% to more than $1 trillion. Consumer investment assets were also up to $63 billion or 20% to a record $369 billion.
The company also recently reported a dividend of $0.256 last week. “Our fourth-quarter results were driven by strong organic growth, record levels of digital engagement, and an improving economy. We grew loans by $51 billion and added $100 billion of deposits during the quarter, further strengthening our position as the leader in retail deposits,” says CEO Brian Moynihan. Given this piece of news, is BAC stock worth investing in right now?

Following that, we have Morgan Stanley, a multinational investment bank and financial services company. It also provides a wide range of investment banking, securities, wealth management, and investment management services. With offices in more than 41 countries, the company continues to serve millions all over the world.
Today, the company also reported its fourth-quarter financials. Diving in, net revenues for the quarter were $14.5 billion. Net income for the quarter was $3.7 billion or $2.01 per diluted share. Notably, its Wealth Management segment reported a revenue of $6.3 billion, up by 10% from a year ago. This reflects higher asset levels driven by market appreciation and strong positive fee-based flows. The company says it has been an outstanding year for the firm as it delivered record net revenues of $60 billion and Wealth Management grew client assets by nearly $1 trillion to $4.9 trillion this year.
Last month, the company announced a dividend of $0.70 per share. It also presented a strategic update for the year 2022. In it, Morgan Stanley says that it has significant growth opportunities in the workplace as it continues to build new relationships and grow unvested assets. It continues to expand its grounds with the necessary fundamentals in place. All things considered, is MS stock a top dividend stock to consider buying?

Procter & Gamble Company
Topping off our list today is the Procter & Gamble Company or PG for short. In a nutshell, it is a multinational consumer goods company. Through its vast portfolio of consumer goods, the company operates across 70 countries worldwide. Among its more notable brands are Ambi Pur, Bounty, Febreze, Gillette, Head & Shoulders, Oral-B, SK-II, Vicks, and Tide.
Due to its core offerings falling under the consumer staples sector, I could see investors eyeing PG stock now. This could especially be the case as the company posted solid figures in its latest quarterly earnings report. In essence, PG posted earnings of $1.66 per share, just above consensus estimates of $1.65. Furthermore, the company also raked in a total revenue of $20.95 billion, exceeding forecasts of $20.34 billion. Also, the company’s organic revenue jumped by 6% for the quarter from increased prices on select products.
In summary, CEO Jon Moeller notes that PG delivered “very strong top-line growth,” while making sequential progress despite cost headwinds. As a result of all this, the company is raising its earnings outlook for the fiscal year. With PG’s current momentum in mind, would you consider adding PG stock to your portfolio?

2022-01-19 00:00:00+00:00,Watch for a Buy Point in Advanced Micro Devices,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/watch-for-a-buy-point-in-advanced-micro-devices,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Since the start of 2022, a multi-year semiconductor market pattern has reversed. Shares in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock are down almost 5%. Shares in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are up almost 7%.
Source: flowgraph / Shutterstock.com
The move has to do with valuation, not the dynamics of the market. AMD shares are now worth 11 times the company’s expected 2021 revenue of almost $15 billion. Intel is worth less than three times its expected 2021 revenue of $78 billion. AMD’s market cap is just $61 billion behind that of Intel.
It’s Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all over again. As with electric car stocks, investors in AMD are being told not to look down.
A Look at AMD Stock
I began pounding the table for AMD as soon as Lisa Su became CEO in 2014. Back then AMD was selling for $2/share. It had been the “little brother” to Intel for a generation.
Today the situation is reversed. AMD’s Ryzen chips now define the state of the art for microprocessors. AMD also designs the Radeon, the best graphics processor not named Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The stock rose 57% in 2021 as it continued to gain market share.
7 of the Top-Rated Pharmaceutical Stocks for Q1
Ryzen and Radeon delivered gross profits of 48% in the third quarter of 2021. Net income was $923 million, meaning 21% of its $4.3 billion of revenue became net income. Revenue for the third quarter was 54% higher than a year earlier.
But there’s a limit to what anything is worth. A recent bullish call from Keybanc gave AMD a $155/share price target. That’s just 12% higher than where it closed Jan. 14, which was at about $138.
Intel Coming Back?
Chip producers have reacted to the latest “super cycle” with super-sized investment.
AMD has been supply constrained because it sold its production capacity in 2009, creating GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS), which came public last year. AMD switched most of its production to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) in 2018.
Taiwan Semiconductor will put $40 billion to $44 billion into capital spending this year. Intel, meanwhile, is expected to put $25 bnillion to $28 billion into capital spending this year, with huge new investments in the U.S. and Europe. One $20 billion plant near Columbus, Ohio is already being described as a “little city.”
Intel has also laid out an aggressive roadmap of chip improvements, which includes measuring circuit distances in “angstroms,” or one-tenth of a nanometer.
How Big the Boom?
Semiconductors traditionally go through a cycle of boom-and-bust. But there hasn’t been a bust for years.
Instead, cloud czars and device makers have scooped up all the high-end silicon companies like AMD could design, and TSM could manufacture. The question is whether that will remain the case once Intel’s production ramps up.
If it does, then Intel is the play. The stock is dirt cheap compared with AMD and sports a dividend yielding 2.5%. If demand doesn’t show up, and if past performance is any indicator, then AMD is the stock to buy. That’s because, when push comes to shove, the fastest chip design wins. In decades past that was always Intel. Now it’s AMD.
The Bottom Line
Investors have begun 2022 cautiously. They prefer the conservative valuation of Intel to the bubbly prospects of AMD.
But that’s what is happening on Wall Street. In the marketplace, AMD is still winning. It was recently able to increase the price of its EPYC data center chips by 10% to 30% after production of competing Intel silicon was delayed.
While the chip shortage is continuing, Wall Street is positioning itself for chip abundance. Looking at 2024 right now, Intel is undervalued. But that doesn’t make AMD wildly expensive. Let the long-term expectations settle, then look for a buy point in AMD.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock had a blowout 2021.

The chip designer’s shares gained 57% last year and were among the top-performing tech stocks. Considering AMD’s growth trajectory, 2022 is likely to be no different. Its incredible revenue growth and increasing profitability will take AMD stock to new heights.
With such massive gains last year, the obvious question around AMD relates to its valuation. Its mega-market capitalization of over $159 billion is sure to petrify any investor. However, when you boil it down to brass tacks, the stock seems fairly valued in line with its peers, and in fact, has immense upside ahead. For instance, AMD stock trades at roughly 9.x times forward sales, whereas Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock trades at a whopping 25x forward sales.
Given AMD’s architecture upgrades and robust product launches this year and beyond, the company is poised for multi-bagger returns ahead.
Incredible Growth Ahead
AMD saw rapid revenue growth last year across its core businesses and raised its outlook in the past couple of quarters. It saw a healthy 54% bump in revenues from the prior-year period in the third quarter, generating $4.31 billion due to its robust execution.
7 of the Top-Rated Pharmaceutical Stocks for Q1
The company’s enterprise business revenues grew 69% on a year-over-year basis to $1.69 billion during the third quarter. Moreover, its computer and graphics division also showed impressive momentum, with 44% growth from the prior year.
Supply shortages and high selling prices had plagued 2021 for gamers. However, AMD believes that it will observe lower prices by improving the supply and demand dynamics. AMD recently revealed its latest graphics card in hopes of gaining a much larger piece of the burgeoning gaming market.
Over the years, AMD has focused primarily on its data center business, gaining tremendous traction last year. With massive success for its 7nm process, AMD is now looking to expand into the Zen-4 5nm process this year. These developments will help the company improve its position against its chief competitor in Nvidia.
Moreover, with its entry-level GPU, AMD will also make a sizeable dent in the broader gaming market. Therefore, there’s a lot to be excited about with AMD this year and beyond.
The Xilinx Deal
After much delay, AMD’s highly anticipated Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) deal is expected to close out in the first few months of the year. AMD’s acquisition of Xilinx will expand its technological portfolio and grow its data center business. Chinese regulators are still under the deal, which is likely to decide soon. AMD has re-assured the anti-trust regulator that the deal won’t be hurting the competition.
The Xilinx acquisition will help AMD significantly expand the number of chips it produces, posing an even bigger threat to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). AMD has gained a lot of ground across multiple verticals and now appears to be in a position to push on. The addition of Xilinx will help the company further refine its products for multiple growth avenues.
Additionally, Xilinx boasts incredible profitability and cash flow margins which will significantly improve AMD’s margins. Moreover, it is expected that both companies will cut annual costs by an added $300 million on an annual basis.
Bottom Line on AMD Stock
AMD was among the crème de la crème of the stock market last year, and this year shouldn’t be any different judging from the recent CES tech conference. AMD CEO Lisa Su states that the company can achieve a long-term sales growth rate of 20%.
Once we digest her commentary at the CES, it’s easy to understand why she’s so confident about the future. AMD stock remains a solid buy at this stage.

2022-01-19 00:00:00+00:00,Will 2022 Be Another Great Year for AMD?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-2022-be-another-great-year-for-amd,,,"In this video, I will be talking about Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), the recent analyst upgrades, its partnerships with Big Tech, and its third-quarter financials. You can find the video below but here are the highlights.
AMD's $35 billion acquisition of Xilinx will be concluded in Q1 of 2022. Xilinx is the leader in field-programmable gate arrays and together they'll most likely take more market share from Intel.
AMD recently got two upgrades. One is from KeyBanc, which upgraded to overweight from sector weight with a $155 price target. And another is from Goldman Sachs, where the analyst has a $170 price target on the stock.
As far as partnerships with Big Tech, AMD does very well. Meta Platforms will use AMD chips to power the metaverse and help run its data centers. Tesla's new Model 3 and Model Y vehicles will be equipped with the new AMD Ryzen chip in 2022. And earlier this month AMD announced that Amazon Web Services has expanded its AMD EPYC processor-based offerings with the general availability of the new Amazon EC2 Hpc6a Instances, which are purpose-built for high-performance computing workloads in the cloud.
With deals like these, investors can get excited for what is still to come.
Last quarter, AMD reported earnings per share of $0.73, beating estimates of $0.67, and revenue of $4.30 billion, beating estimates of $4.12 billion.

2022-01-19 00:00:00+00:00,Intel orders ASML machine still on drawing board as chipmakers look for an edge,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-orders-asml-machine-still-on-drawing-board-as-chipmakers-look-for-an-edge,,,"By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Intel INTC.O has placed the first order with ASML ASML.AS for an advanced chipmaking machine that is still on the drawing board and won't be delivered for years, as semiconductor manufacturers look to get ahead in a booming industry.
Alongside better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings, ASML said on Wednesday it had now received orders for five of its next generation of lithography machines, plus an order for the even newer model that is still being designed.
In a separate joint press release, the companies said Intel was the buyer.
ASML's most advanced commercial machines, known as EUV lithography systems because of the ""Extreme Ultraviolet"" light waves they use to map out the circuitry of computer chips, are the size of a bus and cost around $150 million each.
A cutting-edge chip plant needs 9-18 of them, making them one of chipmakers' biggest capital expenditure costs.
ASML is the only maker of such machines and its EUV customers include the world's biggest chipmakers, TSMC 2330.TW of Taiwan, Samsung 005930.KS of South Korea and Intel, among others.
ASML said it had now received orders for five of the next iteration of the system, known as ""High NA"" EUV machines, which will have a different lens system with a higher numerical aperture, will be even larger and cost around $300 million each.
The first prototypes are to be shipped in 2023. They are not expected to be used in volume manufacturing until 2025.
Intel, which is trying to win back its position as maker of the smallest and fastest chips from current leader TSMC, had previously identified itself as the first buyer of a High NA machine, ASML's EXE:5000, which is expected to help manufacturers shrink chip sizes later this decade.
Intel said on Wednesday it would buy the first EXE:5200 as well, which is expected to make several improvements including higher productivity. Neither company mentioned the price tag.

Berlin fire will not impact shipments - CEO
Doubles 2021 dividend to 5.50 euros
Adds CEO's quote, details from statement, share performance, dividend plans
AMSTERDAM, Jan 19 (Reuters) - ASML Holding NV ASML.AS, a key supplier to computer chip makers, on Wednesday reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings of 1.77 billion euros ($2.01 billion) and said it expected sales growth of 20% in 2022.
""The expected impact of the fire in part of a building at our Berlin site is included"", in the 2022 growth forecast, the Chief Executive Officert Peter Wennink said in a statement.
""Based on our current insights, we believe we can manage the consequences of this fire without significant impact on our system output for 2022.""
Analysts had expected net profit of 1.51 billion euros ($1.72 billion), up from 1.35 billion euros a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data. The earnings beat came from better than expected margins of 54.2%, as sales of 5 billion euros was slightly below analyst estimates of 5.1 billion euros.
ASML is trying to expand production as its customers, which include TSMC 2330.TW, Samsung 005930.KS Intel INTC.O, invest heavily in new capacity to try to ease a global semiconductor shortage.
The company said it would continue to struggle to meet demand this year, and forecast first-quarter sales of 3.3-3.5 billion euros.
The lower number comes amid some of its systems being shipped to customers before they have gone through final testing, which means 2 billion euros in extra revenue will be recognised in future quarters, it added.
In September, it said it was benefiting from long-term trends in the electronics industry and expected double-digit annual sales growth throughout the 2020s.
The company also said on Wednesday it would double its 2021 dividend to 5.50 euros.
However, investors received a shock at the start of 2022, when the company suffered a fire at a factory in Berlin.
The Veldhoven, Netherlands-based company's shares, which quadrupled over 2018-2021, closed at 641.4 euros on Tuesday and are down 9.2% this year.
