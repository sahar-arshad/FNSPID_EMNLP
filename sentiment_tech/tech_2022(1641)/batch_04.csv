2022-12-06 00:00:00+00:00,Intel's Dividend Isn't Growing Anytime Soon,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-dividend-isnt-growing-anytime-soon,,,"Chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is playing catch-up, and catch-up is expensive.
Third-party foundry TSMC has pulled ahead of Intel in terms of manufacturing technology. That leaves Intel in a tough spot for two reasons. First, it gives competitors like AMD access to superior manufacturing tech, which puts the company in an uphill battle to maintain its dominant CPU market share. Second, it adds risk to Intel's plan to build its own world-class foundry business.
Intel will spend roughly 35% of its revenue on capital expenditures in 2023 and 2024. Combined with the impacts of a tough PC market and extensive cost cutting, the net result of this investment binge will be essentially no free cash flow in those years. It's only in 2025 and beyond that Intel expects to get its free cash flow margins back to approximately 20%.
For those who invested in Intel for its dividend, that should sound concerning. While Intel is unlikely to cut the dividend unless it has no choice, investors should not expect a dividend increase for the foreseeable future.
""At the level we want""
Intel CFO David Zinsner spoke at the UBS 50th Global TMT Conference on Monday, and while much of the back-and-forth with analyst Tim Arcuri focused on Intel's strategy, investments, and cost-cutting initiatives, the dividend came up.
Intel has taken great pains so far to avoid cutting the dividend. The company announced a sweeping plan to reduce costs by $10 billion by the end of 2025, which will free up cash for investments. Intel has also forged a unique partnership with Brookfield Asset Management to fund nearly half of the planned expansion of its factories in Arizona. A dividend cut could have been another source of fresh cash, but Intel has instead pursued other options.
Because Intel's stock has tumbled since peaking last year, the dividend yield is now right around 5%. That high yield is one thing keeping investors on board through this difficult period, and Intel knows it. Zinsner had this to say about the dividend: ""I think it is important. I think the Board feels it's important. It gives investors a yield when we're in an investment phase with the Company.""
While the goal is to keep the dividend intact, it definitely won't grow until free cash flow rebounds. ""But I would say that our thinking, given the amount of investment that we've got to make, is that growing the dividend, obviously, it doesn't make a ton of sense,"" Zinsner added.
Zinsner also didn't completely rule out a dividend cut if the cash flow situation deteriorates, saying, ""...if something got dramatically different in terms of our cash flow, of course, that might change the calculus on the dividend...""
Intel is more than a dividend stock
The best-case scenario for Intel investors is for the dividend to stay at the same level until 2025 or 2026, depending on when the company starts seeing cash flow recover. If the payoff from these manufacturing investments takes longer than expected to materialize, the dividend might be stuck where it is for even longer.
A stagnant dividend isn't ideal for investors, but the main reason to invest in Intel today is not the dividend, but the potential for the company to reclaim its dominance in the PC and server CPU markets while creating a multibillion-dollar foundry business.
Global foundry revenue was around $85 billion in 2020, and TSMC held a market share above 50%. Intel is betting that foundry customers want another option, and that its position as a U.S. company will give it a meaningful advantage. As foundry customers look to lower their dependence on Taiwan, Intel has an opportunity to steal away business.
If you want a steadily growing dividend, Intel is not the stock for you. Instead, Intel is a high-potential turnaround play with a steady, high-yield dividend to reward investors for sticking around. That's not a bad deal in my book.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-12-03 00:00:00+00:00,Should You Buy the 3 Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks in the Dow Jones?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-the-3-highest-yielding-dividend-stocks-in-the-dow-jones,,,"During down markets like the one we are going through, investors tend to gravitate more toward income stocks -- stocks that pay out high dividends.
Good dividend stocks not only pay you to own them every quarter, but they are also typically those of stable, established companies that have solid long-term track records. If you are looking for stocks from these types of companies that produce good dividends, the Dow Jones Index is not a bad place to start, considering it includes 30 blue chip companies.
Stocks that have the highest dividend yields are not always the best income stocks because some may be paying out more in dividends than they can reasonably handle -- which means they will ultimately have to cut the dividend down the road. The yield may also be inflated by a sinking stock price. This is what is called a dividend trap.
Let's take a look at the three highest-yielding dividend stocks in the Dow Jones --- Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), Dow Inc. (NYSE: DOW), and Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) to see whether or not the payouts are sustainable.
The 3 highest-yielding dividends on the Dow Jones
Verizon is, of course, a leading wireless and telecommunications provider. As of Dec. 1, it has the highest dividend yield on the Dow Jones at 6.70%. On Dec. 1, Verizon declared a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share for the first quarter of 2023, which is the same as the previous quarter, but up from $0.64 per share a year ago. 2022 marked the 18th straight that Verizon has increased its annual dividend, as it paid out $2.57 per share in dividends for the year.
Is the 6.7% yield too good to be true? It looks as though Verizon should be able to sustain its payout based on a couple of factors. Its payout ratio -- which is the percentage of earnings that go to the dividend -- is 48.6%, which is a little on the high side, but it should be sustainable. That's because the company generates lots of free cash flow and has a plan to reduce expenses to pay down some of its debt. In addition, it has been growing revenue and adding customers and has a growth opportunity in expanding its 5G coverage. The stock is also very cheap, trading at just 7.5 times forward earnings.
The stock with the second-highest dividend yield on the Dow Jones is Dow Inc., the chemical company and manufacturer of plastics and other materials.
Dow has a dividend yield of 5.49% with a quarterly payout of $0.70 per share -- an amount it has maintained since 2019, when it spun off from DowDuPont, now DuPont De Nemours. It also has a manageable payout ratio of 35%. While it just spun off a few years ago, the company has been around for more than 100 years and is literally a household name, with many products that are probably in your household right now. It has been hurt by the global economic slowdown, but this is a company that has been around through various cycles, and it's not going anywhere.
I'm not sure this is a stock that will produce much long-term capital appreciation, but Dow does have a steady dividend. However, it has not raised that dividend in three years.
Finally, there's Intel, the world's leading manufacturer of semiconductor computer chips. Intel pays out a yield of 4.86% with a current quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share. This year, it has maintained that $0.37 through all four quarters for an annual payout of $1.48 per share. It has raised its annual dividend every year since 2014.
Intel currently has a payout ratio of 50.8%, which is significantly higher than it has been in recent years. That is due to the fact that revenue and earnings have dropped significantly, as has the stock price, down about 42% year to date.
INTC data by YCharts.
Intel is the leading chipmaker in the world, but it has been losing market share. In 2022, it is projecting a 19% to 20% decrease in revenue compared to the previous year, and it faces an uncertain period where there is the potential for a recession or economic slowdown, as well as the prospect of continued supply chain issues to hurt demand. This could all lead to continued earnings headwinds.
The verdict
Of these three current yield leaders on the Dow Jones index, your best bet for a good sustained high-yielding dividend stock is Verizon.
It may not maintain that massive yield it has now, as earnings come back, but it has the type of cash flow and growth opportunities to keep increasing its dividend, as it has for the past 18 years.
The other two have their issues and challenges that make them less appealing as income generators. You could probably find some better options elsewhere on the Dow Jones.

2022-12-02 00:00:00+00:00,Jobs Data Weighs on Markets: What You Need to Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jobs-data-weighs-on-markets%3A-what-you-need-to-know,,,"What's good for the economy, isn't always good for the equities market. It's a topsy-turvy world in which stock traders are looking for signs of a slowdown in U.S. hiring so that the Federal Reserve will have an excuse to pause its interest-rate hikes or even pivot to interest-rate cuts next year.
Even though Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech from a few days ago was this week's most impactful market event, this morning's employment-data report was also significant. So, let's see what the numbers indicate and how it could potentially affect your investments now.
Nonfarm Payrolls Print Comes in Hotter than Expected
At first glance, the Labor Department's report for the month of November might not seem noteworthy. After all, the 3.7% unemployment rate was perfectly in-line with what economists had anticipated. Yet, there's more to the story here. As it turns out, nonfarm payrolls in the U.S. increased by 263,000 during the month of November. That's a lot higher than the 200,000 that economists had projected.
On top of that, average hourly earnings increased 0.6% year-over-year in November. Economists, meanwhile, had modeled an increase of 0.3%. In other words, a surprisingly high number of people are working and they're getting paid more than the experts had anticipated.
In order to slow down its trajectory of interest-rate increases, the Federal Reserve wanted to see signs of a cooling economy, which would help to tamp down inflation. However, given the aforementioned labor data, stock traders feel that the central bank will be less inclined to pause or pivot in the near future.
These Stocks are Impacted the Most
All of the major stock-market indices are down, with the Nasdaq falling further than the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. As of 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, the Nasdaq was down 1.3%.
Clearly, last year's high flyers are at risk. The Nasdaq is dominated by 2021's growth stocks, such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). These stocks, which had elevated P/E ratios last year, are vulnerable as the Federal Reserve continues to tighten its monetary policy.
Also, chipmakers are feeling the heat today as shares of semiconductor manufacturers Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Micron (NASDAQ: MU) are falling fast. Historically, chipmakers have tended to be susceptible to changes in interest rates.
There really are no safe havens in this environment, as even the less tech-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average is in the red today. Investors might consider less volatile stocks for the time being, such as Walmart (NYSE: WMT), which generally has all-weather appeal.

2022-12-02 00:00:00+00:00,3 Takeaways From the November Jobs Report,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-takeaways-from-the-november-jobs-report,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The Labor Department just released its November jobs report this morning, and stock traders aren’t pleased with the data. You might assume that what’s good for the economy should be good for the financial markets. However, the usual rules don’t necessarily apply as a strong jobs report could prompt more aggressive interest rate raises.
First, let’s take a glance at the Labor Department’s need-to-know data points. The U.S. unemployment rate for the month of November was 3.7%. That’s in-line with what economists had expected.
So far, there’s nothing particularly notable here. Here’s where it gets interesting, though. In November, U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 263,000, versus economists’ forecast of 200,000. In other words, a lot more people are working and getting paid than the experts had anticpated.
Additionally, average hourly earnings increased 0.6%, while economists only thought the increase would be 0.3%. Hence, not only are plenty of Americans working, but they’re also getting paid more than expected.
What the Jobs Report Means for Investors: 3 Takeaways
One thing that investors can take away from the November jobs report is that, until further notice, good news is bad news. By that, I mean financial traders will sell stocks, but also bid up the U.S. dollar and bond yields, whenever there’s positive news for the nation’s economy.
That’s because, in order to tamp down inflation, the Federal Reserve is hiking interest rates on government bonds. Stock traders don’t like high bond yields, so they want to see the Federal Reserve slow down its pace of rate hikes — but the Fed won’t likely back down until it sees signs of a cooling economy.
This leads to the second takeaway, which is that technology stocks are particularly vulnerable now. For instance, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was down significantly this morning in response to the jobs report.
The reason for this response is because 2021’s high flyers are susceptible to steep declines when the Fed tightens its monetary policy. Among last year’s strongest performers are tech stocks, so they could continue to decline over the coming weeks.
Finally, investors should consider that diversification is essential during times of monetary-policy tightening. For instance, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock didn’t decline much, compared to shares of many technology stocks.
Walmart is an all-weather business that can withstand monetary-policy tightening. This helps to explain why WMT stock is holding up relatively well today. Hence, it might make sense for investors to consider allocating away from more cyclical, interest-rate-reactive stocks and into less volatile assets for a while.

The bond market is enduring its worst year on record, while the growth-dependent Nasdaq Composite, which led the broader market higher for much of the past decade, has plunged as much as 38% over the trailing year.
Yet amid this carnage, the 30-component Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) has performed reasonably well. Through last week, the Dow was lower by just 5.5% year to date. That's a testament to the quality of companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

But just because the index hasn't plunged as much as the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 doesn't mean there aren't amazing deals hiding in plain sight. Here are three Dow stocks that make for phenomenal end-of-year buys.
Walt Disney
The first Dow Jones Industrial Average stock that makes for a stellar end-of-year buy is media giant Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS).
The normally sure-footed House of Mouse has been highly prone to slip-ups since the COVID-19 pandemic began. In addition to reduced attendance at its theme parks, Disney is dealing with lower movie theater attendance. The icing on the cake is that streaming service losses have come in wider than expected, at a time when investors have been more critical of bottom-line results than at any point over the past decade.
But if Walt Disney has demonstrated anything over many decades, it's that the company is resilient. This is due to a multitude of competitive advantages.
For example, few companies have the ability to engage with consumers quite like Walt Disney. Whether it's a 4-year-old visiting Disneyland for the first time or a grandparent watching a Disney movie with their grandchild, the company's products, services, and characters are designed to connect people of all ages through the use of imagination.
This leads to another key point: Walt Disney has superior pricing power. Since Disneyland opened in Southern California in 1955, the price of the cheapest admission ticket has climbed 10,300%! Comparatively, that's about 10 times the rate of inflation in the U.S. since 1955. People have shown for nearly seven decades that they're willing to pay a premium for the experience Disney can offer them, their family, and their friends.
The company's streaming segment can also become a key growth driver by mid-decade. Despite large near-term losses tied to its expansion, Disney+ has tallied more than 164 million subscribers in less than three years after its launch. According to the company, streaming services should become profitable by 2024.
Though Walt Disney's stock has taken a beating this year, it's given patient investors a dream entry point.
Intel
The second Dow stock that represents a phenomenal end-of-year buy is semiconductor stock Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
Shares of Intel have declined by more than 50% since early 2020 because of two concerns. First, the company has been losing central processing unit (CPU) market share in personal computers (PCs), mobile, and data center servers to key rival Advanced Micro Devices. Secondly, Intel is a cyclical company. A weaker U.S. growth outlook, coupled with supply chain issues and historically high inflation, is generally bad news for its revenue and profit outlook.
While there's no doubt Intel is facing some very tangible near-term headwinds, the company has positioned its puzzle pieces for long-term success.
For example, Intel broke ground on two chip manufacturing plants in Ohio earlier this year. This $20 billion project, set to begin production in 2024, is designed to expand Intel's Foundry Services segment. Best of all, with President Joe Biden signing the CHIPS and Science Act into law in August, nearly $53 billion in subsidies are now available to aid with the construction of domestic chip manufacturing sites.
Pessimists have also, arguably, made a mountain out of a molehill when it comes to Intel's lost CPU market share. While no lost market share should be taken for granted, Intel is still very much in the driver's seat in PCs, mobile, and data center servers. The cash flow being generated from these arenas is what's helping to fuel the company's superior dividend (5% yield), as well as its investments in higher-growth initiatives.
One of the more exciting opportunities for Intel is the growth of autonomous vehicle company Mobileye Global. Intel acquired Mobileye for $15.3 billion in 2017 and remains the majority shareholder following Mobileye's initial public offering in late October. Mobileye has been generating record sales, with annual run-rate revenue now up to $1.8 billion.
For long-term investors, Intel offers an exceptional risk-to-reward at its current share price.

Salesforce
The third and final Dow stock that makes for a phenomenal end-of-year buy is cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). CRM software is used by consumer-facing businesses to improve existing client engagement and boost sales.
Like the other Dow components on this list, Salesforce stock has been bludgeoned in 2022. Shares are down 40%, which is considerably worse than the noted (5.5%) year-to-date return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This weakness can primarily be blamed on the U.S. economy and hawkish monetary policy. The growing likelihood of a recession, coupled with the removal of cheap capital as interest rates rise, probably means Salesforce will see a slowdown in demand for its CRM software.
Of course, Salesforce wouldn't be on this list if it didn't possess clearly identifiable competitive advantages that can sustain double-digit growth and make its patient shareholders richer over time.
The first thing to note about Salesforce is just how dominant it's become in the CRM space. Not only has the company been the No. 1 ranked global CRM software provider for the past nine years, according to IDC, but it's been steadily expanding its industry-leading market share for pretty much the entire time. It ended 2021 having accounted for 23.8% of global CRM spending. That's more than its four closest competitors on a combined basis.
To build on this point, CRM software is a sustained double-digit growth opportunity. Though service-oriented companies are the most logical customer, we're seeing increasing usage of CRM software from the industrial, financial, and healthcare sectors. Translation: Salesforce has a hearty organic growth opportunity on its plate.
On top of steady organic growth, co-founder and co-CEO Marc Benioff has helped orchestrate a number of key acquisitions. Some of the best-known deals include Tableau Software, MuleSoft, and Slack Technologies. Although these deals provide new revenue channels for the company, it's really about expanding the Salesforce service ecosystem and adding cross-selling opportunities.
With its share price taking a serious haircut, Salesforce looks like a bargain for growth-oriented investors at approximately 27 times Wall Street's forecast earnings for fiscal 2024.

2022-12-02 00:00:00+00:00,"Amazon Just Announced New Innovations to Take On Snowflake, Nvidia, and More",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-just-announced-new-innovations-to-take-on-snowflake-nvidia-and-more,,,"Every November, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) holds its Re:Invent conference. where it unveils new innovations under Amazon Web Services.
AWS is the first-mover in cloud computing, a juggernaut that is likely Amazon's most valuable segment, and with tremendous resources to continue innovating. At this year's Re:Invent, Amazon unveiled some eye-opening high-end products and services built completely in-house, which should perhaps make its current third-party hardware and software suppliers nervous.
Vertically integrating more in-house software and hardware on AWS is akin to Amazon releasing private-label products to compete with high-end brands on its retail platform. However, due to AWS' ability to tightly integrate software and semiconductors with its underlying infrastructure, the vertical integration could end up being even more effective.
New in-house chips to power high-performance computing
One of the ways in which Amazon can lower costs for customers is by having them run workloads on its in-house processors. Amazon bought Annapurna Labs in 2015 in order to develop its own ARM-based semiconductor designs, and AWS has been building its chip capabilities ever since.
At first, Amazon used in-house processors to execute simple tasks at low costs; however, in recent years, Amazon's in-house processors have become more advanced. This year, AWS unveiled its latest Graviton 3E chips, which now have the capability to execute high-performance computing in the most advanced workloads, such as weather prediction and drug discovery. That's normally the arena of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
Additionally, Amazon unveiled its second-generation Inferentia chip, which enables a system to learn from vast arrays of data, a process in AI called ""inference."" That puts Amazon in competition with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) GPUs, which are currently the gold standard in artificial intelligence processing.
While it's difficult to compare the new AWS chips with the current industry leaders, it seems likely that Amazon's silicon could be used to power workloads for customers highly concerned with cost and price-performance.
Make no mistake, the current chip leaders are very advanced as well, with tremendous research budgets at their disposal, and should retain their leadership status for the highest-performance workloads. However, if high-performance computing becomes more commoditized as time goes on, it's possible Amazon may be able to steal market share in highly advanced computing applications.

New data analytics offerings to take on software leaders like Snowflake
In addition to vertically integrating its server systems with its own chips, AWS also unveiled more vertically integrated cloud software services, which take on some of the world's top data analytics software companies. Examples of new offerings include AWS DataZone, AWS Clean Rooms, and AWS Supply Chain, among several others.
AWS DataZone is a service that enables customers to link up their data from AWS, on-premises data centers, and other third-party data sources more seamlessly than current solutions. AWS Clean Rooms allows companies to collaborate by analyzing their combined datasets, without revealing private or sensitive underlying information within each set, thereby enabling greater data insights through collaboration. And AWS Supply Chain is a new software platform that analyzes data from a multitude of supply chain systems, allowing for real-time insights and collaboration across a company's entire supply chain, to get a better handle on the current state of supply and aligning it with changing customer demand.
The new DataZone services seem to put Amazon in competition with software juggernauts like Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), with its Tableau and Mulesoft services. Amazon Clean Rooms appears to take on Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) and its Snowflake Data Exchange service. And AWS Supply Chain takes dead aim at enterprise resource planning juggernauts like SAP (NYSE: SAP).
Vertical integration brings many benefits to AWS and its customers
Could these new competitive services turn off the world's leading software companies and chipmakers from working with AWS? Probably, but the fact that AWS is the leading cloud infrastructure platform means these companies can't afford to boycott Amazon. AWS has a leading 33% share of the global cloud infrastructure market, according to Statista, and even more when you exclude Chinese vendors in their closed-off market.
For AWS customers, they benefit from having more choice. Third-party hardware and software companies will remain attractive for their concentrated R&D efforts and the ability to work across multiple clouds. However, the more in-house services Amazon can provide, the more attractive AWS becomes, as it provides optionality and bargaining power for AWS customers with these other vendors.
Amazon won't all of a sudden dominate the hardware or software space, but its vertical integration efforts certainly give investors in top tech stocks like AMD or Snowflake something to think about. After all, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was able to completely cut out the once-dominant Intel processors for Macs, and it's working to fully replace Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) chips for the iPhone by next year with its own in-house designs.
Amazon will likely never cut out its software and hardware partners, because it will want to offer choice and selection, whereas the iPhone is just a single device. Still, the total addressable market for leading semiconductor and software firms in advanced computing and data analytics, the encroachment of AWS, and perhaps other vertically integrated clouds for that matter, is certainly something to consider for the long term.

2022-12-02 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Expands Collaboration With Viettel Group for 5G Network,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-expands-collaboration-with-viettel-group-for-5g-network,,,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD recently announced the expansion of its partnership with Viettel High Tech (Member of Viettel Group) to deploy a 5G network field to serve the latter’s more than 130 million mobile customers globally.
Viettel is using AMD Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC devices to enable the development of its 5G networking system for mobile devices and meet the rising demand for 5G solutions globally. AMD expects the completion of Viettel’s 5G mobile network by the end of 2022.
The recent collaboration reflects how AMD is benefitting from its acquisition of Xilinx. AMD’s acquisition of Xilinx strengthened its technology portfolio and expand its rapidly growing data center business. The buyout also helped AMD address other high-growth market segments like 5G networking, gaming, communications, automotive, industrial and aerospace, high-performance computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).
As AMD looks to transition out of the slowing PC market, it is seeking to address other high-growth markets to boost top-line growth and improve margins.
AMD reported third-quarter 2022 revenues of $5.7 billion, an increase of 29% year over year.
Its results reflect lower-than-expected client segment revenues resulting from reduced processor shipments due to weaker demand in the PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain.
The volatile macroeconomic situation created by the high inflation, rising interest rate hikes, the Russia-Ukraine war and uncertain forex situation, has the broader tech sector in the doldrums, specifically reflected by AMD’s semiconductor peers NVIDIA and Intel INTC, which also bore the brunt of the situation.
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Quote
In the year-to-date period AMD, NVDA and Intel’s shares have all underperformed the Zacks Computer and Technology sector which have fallen 48.6%, 46.7%, and 39.8%, respectively. The Zacks Computer and Technology sector declined 12.4% in the same period. AMD, currently has Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
However, AMD’s third-quarter 2022 results also reflect solid rise in high-growth business segments like data center and gaming.
AMD Addressing Megatrends to Boost Prospects
AMD has constantly been improving the performance of its Ryzen, Xilinx and Pensando processors to help address the increasing proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in industries like cloud, gaming and data center.
However, as it ventures into new markets, the company faces rising competition from the likes of Intel.
Intel is still the leading name in the consumer PC market and is the major competitor of AMD in this segment. INTC is gradually reducing its dependence on the PC-centric business by transitioning to data-centric businesses such as AI and autonomous driving.
To beat the rising competition and drive top-line growth in the coming quarters, AMD partnered with Meta Platforms META to venture into the metaverse.  AMD’s radio chip Xilinx Zynq UltraScale RFSoC will be utilized to develop multiple Evenstar radio units (RU) to expand 4G/5G mobile network infrastructure, which is crucial for the metaverse.
AMD’s collaboration with Meta will aid the company in expanding its semi-custom chip business, which will help to increase its foothold in high-growth markets like AI and ML.
AMD is also addressing high-performance computing (HPC) in partnership with Hewlett Packard HPE and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory by building the Frontier supercomputer, which can make 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 calculations per second.
AMD’s partnership with HPE bodes well, as it helped the former to build the world’s fastest supercomputer.
AMD has taken a major space in the HPC segment as AMD powers 5 of the top 5 HPCs. This is expected to positively impact AMD’s top-line growth in the coming quarters.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""

2022-12-01 00:00:00+00:00,How Artificial Intelligence Is Transforming Healthcare,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-artificial-intelligence-is-transforming-healthcare,,,"A
rtificial Intelligence (AI) is already transforming industries from banking and retail to transportation and energy and has the potential to significantly improve every industry it touches. Since some version of “improve my health” will likely be near the top of many New Year’s resolution lists next month, here are some ways AI is being used in healthcare.
Will the machines take over? 
Before we go any further, let’s address the big fear that accompanies every major leap in technology. Will AI cause mass unemployment? From what we are seeing so far, the answer is a definitive no, and here is an example of why. Back in 2017, Alphabet’s (GOOG) DeepMind Go-playing AI defeated the world’s number one human player, Ke Jie, by winning the first two games in a three-part match. If you haven’t already seen the documentary AlphaGo on YouTube and want to understand more about AI, I highly recommend it. The defeat was an emotional blow to the global Go-playing community, but the fallout was not what many expected. AlphaGo had taught itself to play using strategies that had never been seen before, which ended up improving the sophistication of the game as played by those who studied the famous match, raising the bar for everyone. What we learned from the experience is that rather than replacing us, AI can be used to spark innovation, to see things in novel ways that the human brain may not. AI is simply the next tool in mankind’s ongoing quest to augment our own capabilities, just as was the case with the wheel, the ax, the steam engine, the abacus and the La-Z-Boy (LZB) recliner.
Why Now? 
Investing in AI is making new record highs.
Worldwide funding for AI companies hit a record $66.8 billion in 2021, more than double the total in 2020, according to CB Insights, with healthcare accounting for about a fifth of the overall funding. While quarterly AI funding did decline 12% from Q4 of 2021 to Q1 of 2022, it was significantly less than the 19% decline in total funding over that same period.
Gartner Research estimates that global healthcare IT spending in 2021 reached $140 billion, with AI and robotic process automation identified as the top spending priorities.
The past year has seen a profound acceleration in AI capabilities, many of which are illustrated in this year’s State of AI report. Today, for example, there are 18 drugs in clinical trials that have been developed using an AI-first approach. In 2020 there was not a single one.
Experts believe we are at an inflection point. For example, Jeffrey Dean, a Google Senior Fellow and Distinguished Fellow at the Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence wrote a paper this spring called, “A Golden Decade of Deep Learning” in which he looks at the “tremendous” progress made in AI over the past decade and what we may expect in the future.
The future impact will be profound. PWC estimates that by 2030, AI could contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy. The healthcare sector is particularly in dire need of improvement, representing around a fifth of the total U.S. economy in 2020, higher than any other country, while having significantly worse outcomes than most. The U.S. Health System is ranked 69th in the world by the Legatum Institute and has an average life expectancy well below most developed nations. Accenture estimates that by 2026, AI applications could potentially generate $150 billion in annual savings for the U.S. healthcare system. 
Healthcare Administration
The U.S. has the highest per capita healthcare spend but below average outcomes, making Healthcare Administration a prime area for improvement. Administrative expenses are estimated to account for somewhere between 15% and 25% of total national healthcare costs. Here, AI can be used to both streamline processes and detect fraud, similar to the way banks detect unusual transactions. One of the companies offering solutions in this field is Oracle (ORCL), which offers AI to improve operations, the patient experience, healthcare finances and healthcare data management.
Synthetic Data
AI algorithms learn by analyzing huge amounts of data, but in some areas of the economy, the data it needs is heavily restricted due to compliance or privacy concerns, creating the need for Synthetic Data. Synthetic data is realistic, but not real. It can be defined as “annotated information that computer simulations or algorithms generate as an alternative to real-world data,” and while it may be artificial, research is finding that it can be as good or even better for training an AI model. According to Gartner Research, by 2030, Synthetic Data will likely surpass real data in AI models. Israel-based MDClone, a synthetic medical data startup, raised $63 million earlier this year and is working with MCI Onehealth Technologies (DRDR.TO) to convert MCI’s real-world datasets into synthetic files that while entirely artificial, are statistically comparable to the original data, thus can be used in research without any privacy concerns. This isn’t happening just in healthcare, but also in other data-sensitive sectors such as financial services where, for example, JP Morgan (JPM) is training financial AI models with fake data. 
Diagnostics
One of the most powerful applications of AI in healthcare is in diagnostics, where it has the potential to scan better and faster than even the best diagnosticians. For example, about 90% of those who develop breast cancer have no known genetic mutation, making the disease’s emergence highly unpredictable. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has developed Mirai, an artificial intelligence system that has been, for example, able to scan a mammogram and flag the patient as being at high risk for breast cancer within the next five years. The flagged patient had indeed developed breast cancer just four years after the image had been taken. Other algorithms have been developed to predict lung cancer by looking at CT scans or heart disease by looking at MRI images earlier than is possible for a human alone.
Digital Diagnostics has developed an AI technology that evaluates images of the back of a patient’s retina to evaluate the extent of damage to blood vessels due to diabetic retinopathy, typically without the need for the eyes to be dilated. Similarly, the company also has an AI product that can detect serious skin conditions earlier, when they are more treatable, but difficult to for the human eye to detect.
Medtronic (MDT) is the exclusive distributor for the first FDA authorized AI-assisted system for colonoscopy, developed by Cosmo Pharmaceutical (CMOPF). The system is available in Europe, parts of Asia, Australia and the Middle East. The system, GI Genius, identifies regions of the colon within the endoscope’s view where colorectal polyps might be located. I think we can all agree that if one is undergoing the joy of a colonoscopy, we’d prefer it to be as effective and efficient as possible.
These solutions, far from replacing doctors, will instead give more time for patient interaction rather than spending hours poring over images themselves looking for signs of disease or abnormalities in blood samples. Doctors will be able to spend more time treating and less time diagnosing. 
AI Chips 
We cannot talk about AI without mentioning the microchips that make these AI applications possible. The roughly $21 billion AI microchip market was once dominated by Nvidia (NVDA) but is becoming increasingly competitive. Some of the other major players include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC) and Micron Technology (MU). The sector is attracting many startups as well, such as Cerebras Systems, which claims to have built the largest chip in existence, with 2.6 trillion transistors and 850,000 AI cores, to power what it says is the fastest AI accelerator to date. Others include Horizon Robotics and SambaNova Systems. 
The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Healthcare
Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to tackle some of the most pressing problems in healthcare. AI can help reduce costs, improve efficiency and outcomes, promote medical research, and above all—improve patient care.
Reduce costs: AI systems can identify patients who are at risk earlier and flag them for further testing or intervention. This prevents costly mistakes that might otherwise go undetected.
Improve efficiency: In hospitals where nurses spend more than half their time doing administrative tasks such as scheduling appointments, managing medications and communicating with doctors about previous cases, an automated system could take over these tasks freeing up valuable time for other patient-centric activities like visiting patients in person or providing emotional support during difficult times.
Improve outcomes: AI algorithms can analyze large amounts of data from different sources to track patterns that may lead to better treatment options for individualized cases based on specific symptoms (e.g., identifying patients who could benefit from surgery instead of medication). They also provide real-time analysis capabilities, so health workers can immediately make decisions when they need it most – especially important when lives are at stake. By identifying problems earlier, when they are more easily treated, outcomes will be improved and lives saved.

2022-12-01 00:00:00+00:00,2 Top Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Before 2023,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-top-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-hand-over-fist-before-2023,,,"Semiconductor stocks had a forgettable 2022, as the 32% decline in the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index so far this year shows us. The drop is mainly due to the slowdown in the personal computer (PC) and smartphone markets that knocked the wind out of the sails of major players in this sector. But recent action shows that the sector is set to end the year on a high.
The PHLX Semiconductor Sector is trading up 10% in the past month. This sharp recovery can be attributed to signs of cooling inflation, the Federal Reserve's stated intent to reduce the pace of rate hikes, and some solid quarterly reports from industry bellwethers indicating that the industry didn't lose all of its momentum.
The sector's performance in the past month rubbed off positively on shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI). While AMD stock shot up 18% in the past month, NXP is up 8%. It wouldn't be surprising to see these chipmakers continue their bull runs in 2023.
That's why investors may want to buy these two semiconductor stocks hand over fist before the new year. Let's look at the reasons why AMD and NXP Semiconductors could soar higher in 2023.
1. Advanced Micro Devices
Advanced Micro Devices was hamstrung by the slowdown in the PC market this year, but the company found growth in other areas. This explains why AMD was able to record 29% year-over-year growth in revenue in the third quarter of 2022 to $5.6 billion. The chipmaker is on track to finish 2022 with $23.5 billion in revenue, which would be an increase of 43% over last year.
There are a few simple reasons why AMD has been able to record such impressive growth.
The first is the data center business, which is showing no signs of slowing down. AMD's data center revenue increased 45% year over year to $1.6 billion in Q3 thanks to the healthy demand for its Epyc processors. The segment generated $4.4 billion in revenue in the first nine months of 2022, indicating that AMD could generate just under $6 billion in data center revenue this year based on the quarterly revenue run rate.
AMD's data center revenue could keep soaring in 2023. That's because the company is gaining market share against Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in this space. Its server processor market share increased to 17.5% in the third quarter, with Intel holding the rest, according to Mercury Research. The year-over-year increase in AMD's server market share stood at 7.3 percentage points.
That was a huge increase, and analysts are expecting AMD to sustain that momentum in 2023 as well. KeyBanc analyst John Vinh said he expects AMD to take more market share away from Intel next year, as the former's latest Genoa server processors -- which were released this month -- are reportedly 55% faster and 48% more power efficient compared to Chipzilla's offerings. With Intel's next-generation Sapphire Rapids server processors caught up in delays and yet to hit volume shipments, the road is clear for AMD to take more market share in the lucrative server processor space.
As such, don't be surprised to see AMD's 2023 server share exceed market research firm TrendForce's forecast of 22%, given that it has already exceeded the 15% market share it was expected to clock in 2022.
The embedded business is going to be another key growth driver for AMD next year. The segment's revenue increased nearly 1,550% year-over-year last quarter to $1.3 billion, driven by the acquisition of Xilinx that AMD completed earlier in 2022. This move helped AMD unlock a massive growth opportunity, as Xilinx's chips are used for accelerating workloads in multiple areas ranging from data centers to 5G infrastructure to automotive to aerospace and defense.
The demand for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), for instance, is expected to increase at an annual pace of 14% through 2027 to $15.5 billion. With Xilinx being the leading player in this market, it could substantially boost AMD's revenue in the long run.
All this indicates that AMD has enough catalysts in the bag to sustain its growth in 2023 and beyond, which is why investors should consider buying this semiconductor stock before it goes higher.
2. NXP Semiconductors
NXP Semiconductors has been winning big from the growing adoption of chips in the automotive space, as the company gets more than half of its revenue from this niche. In the third quarter of 2022, for instance, NXP's total revenue jumped 20% year over year to $3.45 billion. The automotive business did the heavy lifting, as this segment's revenue increased 24% year over year to $1.8 billion.
The good news for NXP investors is that the automotive business is set up for another solid year in 2023. That's because the Dutch chipmaker's non-cancelable and non-returnable (NCNR) order book for 2023 exceeds its supply capability, and its automotive chips are sold out for next year. More importantly, the automotive market should be a long-term growth driver for NXP, as the company sees this segment's revenue jumping from $50 billion in 2021 to $150 billion by the end of the decade.
The industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) market is turning out to be another key growth driver for NXP. The segment's revenue was up 17% year over year last quarter to $713 million, accounting for almost 21% of the company's top line. Just like the automotive business, NXP's industrial chips are sold out for 2023, suggesting that this segment's growth is here to stay.
As such, NXP Semiconductors stock seems well-placed to sustain its rally in the new year thanks to the lucrative semiconductor niches it serves. What's more, investors are getting a great deal on the stock right now, as it is trading at just 16 times trailing earnings and 12 times forward earnings. Those multiples represent a discount to the S&P 500's earnings multiple of 19, suggesting that investors shouldn't delay any further and consider buying the stock before it runs higher.

2022-11-30 00:00:00+00:00,Report warns U.S. chip design market share to plunge without government support,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/report-warns-u.s.-chip-design-market-share-to-plunge-without-government-support,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
Nov 30 (Reuters) - The United States has been a leader in microchip design with dominant companies like Nvidia, Intel and Qualcomm, but it risks a big drop inglobal marketshare without government support for the sector, warned a report released on Wednesday.
The U.S. share of chip design revenue has been slipping in recent years, dropping to 46% in 2021 from over 50% in 2015. Without government support, that could drop to 36% by the end of this decade, according to the analysis released by U.S. industry body Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and Boston Consulting Group.
The United States has already lost its lead in chip manufacturing, prompting the Biden administration to pass the CHIPS and Science Act this year. An earlier report by SIA and BCG in 2020 showed the U.S. share of modern global chip manufacturing capacity had fallen to 12% by that year, down from 37% in 1990.
While companies like Intel Corp INTC.O both design and manufacture chips, so-called fabless chipmakers like Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O design chips that are made by the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. 2330.TW.
The report also said government support is helping companies in countries like China and South Korea to gain market share in chip designing as well.
It said federal investment in semiconductor design and R&D of $20 billion-$30 billion through 2030, including a $15 billion-$20 billion investment tax credit for chip design, would be needed to maintain U.S. leadership in the long-run.
While the CHIPS and Science Act included $39 billion in manufacturing grants for chip production and $13 billion for R&D, nothing was tagged for chip designing specifically, according to a spokesperson for SIA.
The report also said the U.S. chip industry will face a shortage of 23,000 design workers by 2030, but funding from the federal government could help support training up a workforce.

2022-11-29 00:00:00+00:00,Time to Buy Beaten-Down Chip Stocks?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/time-to-buy-beaten-down-chip-stocks,,,"Semiconductors, commonly referred to as microchips, are a bright highlight of technology, existing in nearly every aspect of our lives.
Over the last several years, chip stocks have exploded in popularity, and for an easy-to-understand reason – they have been stellar investments.
However, the fun has seemingly come to a screeching halt in 2022, with many of these once beloved stocks residing deep in the red year-to-date.
Three widely-popular chip stocks include Advanced Micro Devices AMD, NVIDIA NVDA, and Intel Corp. INTC. Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
As we can see, it’s been anything but fun for these once high-flyers in 2022.
It raises a valid question: deep in the red, have investors been presented with a substantial buying opportunity? Let’s take a closer look.
NVIDIA
NVIDIA is a worldwide leader in computing technologies and is credited as the inventor of the highly successful GPU (Graphic Processing Unit).
Analysts have primarily pulled back their earnings outlooks over the last several months, landing NVIDIA into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
It’s no secret that NVDA shares are expensive; the company’s forward earnings multiple currently sits at 70.5X, well above its 49.2X five-year median and its Zacks Computer and Technology sector average of 22.2X.
The company carries a Value Style Score of an F.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
NVDA’s earnings are forecasted to take a sizable hit in its current fiscal year (FY23), with the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $3.27 suggesting a 25% Y/Y decrease.
However, the company’s top-line looks to marginally improve, with the $26.9 billion revenue estimate for FY23 indicating a 0.1% Y/Y increase.

Advanced Micro Devices
Advanced Micro Devices’ extensive product portfolio includes microprocessors, graphics processors, motherboard chipsets, and others. The company carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
Analysts have lowered their earnings outlook across all timeframes over the last several months.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
AMD’s forward earnings multiple has slid down to 24.7X, a fraction of its 50.7X five-year median and modestly above its Zacks sector average.
While the current value may steer away value-focused investors, it’s at least nowhere near historical levels.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
AMD posted mixed earnings results in its latest print, reporting EPS in line with expectations and missing revenue estimates by a marginal 0.3%. The results snapped a long streak of positive surprises on both the top and bottom lines.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Intel Corp.
Intel is the world’s largest semiconductor company and primary supplier of microprocessors and chipsets. Gradually, the company has reduced its reliance on the PC-centric business by moving into data-centric businesses.
The company has seen its near-term earnings outlook turn sour over the last several months, landing INTC into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The company’s growth profile leaves some to be desired; earnings are forecasted to decline 64% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and a further 2% in FY23.
The projected earnings declines come on top of forecasted revenue decreases of 18.6% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and a further 3% in FY23.
Still, its dividend helps set the company apart from other chip stocks; INTC’s annual dividend currently yields a solid 5.1% paired with a 5.4% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Bottom Line
Semiconductor stocks had a fantastic run leading up to 2022 until the music was seemingly shut off, undoubtedly impacting many portfolios.
Still, it raises a valid question – are they worth another look now?
Currently, all three stocks above – Advanced Micro Devices AMD, NVIDIA NVDA, and Intel Corp. INTC – carry either a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell), telling us that their near-term business outlook is under pressure.
For those interested in these once-beloved stocks, a great approach would be to wait until we start seeing positive earnings estimate revisions roll in.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-11-29 00:00:00+00:00,"Near 52-Week Lows, These Beaten-Down Dividend Stocks Look Like Bargains",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/near-52-week-lows-these-beaten-down-dividend-stocks-look-like-bargains,,,"The stock market has been steadily heading lower for most of the year. Because of that, many stocks are currently at or near their 52-week lows. One of the benefits of those lower share prices is that yields on dividend-paying stocks have risen to their highest levels in quite some time.
Three dividend stocks that have taken a beating this year are 3M (NYSE: MMM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Verizon (NYSE: VZ). That makes them look like bargain buys for income seekers these days.
Dividend royalty at a much lower price
Shares of 3M have tumbled more than 25% this year. That sell-off has pushed the industrial giant's dividend yield up to 4.6%. That's near its highest level this decade.
3M has faced its share of headwinds this year. Sales were down 4% in the third quarter due to foreign exchange fluctuations, economic uncertainty, and asset sales. The company has also faced some legal issues.
However, 3M is taking action to improve its operations. It recently sold its food safety business and is in the process of spinning off its healthcare business. Meanwhile, despite its headwinds, the company continues to generate lots of free cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion in the third quarter. The company returned $1 billion of that money to investors via share repurchases and its dividend. The industrial company has increased its payout for 64 straight years, putting it in the elite class of Dividend Kings. With a cash-producing business, strong balance sheet, and refocused operations, 3M should be able to continue growing its high-yielding payout for years to come.
Slashing costs to protect its cash flow
Shares of Intel have tumbled about 40% this year. That shellacking has sent its dividend yield up to 5%, its highest level this decade.
Like 3M, Intel is facing several headwinds. Economic conditions worsened in the third quarter, causing revenue to slump by 20%. However, the company is taking steps to address that issue by cutting costs. It expects to reduce expenses by $3 billion by the end of next year, with cost savings rising to $8 billion-$10 billion by the end of 2025. That should help grow its free cash flow, putting Intel in an even stronger financial position to invest in building new manufacturing capacity.
The company is investing heavily in building new manufacturing complexes in the U.S. and elsewhere. It recently secured a funding partnership with Brookfield Infrastructure to cover half the $30 billion investment for two factories in Arizona. That will free up Intel's cash flow and balance sheet strength so that it can sustain and grow its dividend during this heavy investment phase.
Investing to cash in on 5G
Verizon's stock price has slumped 25% this year. That has driven the telecom giant's dividend yield up to 6.7%, the company's highest in the last decade.
This big-time payout is on a firm financial footing. Verizon has generated $28.2 billion in cash from operations this year. That covered its $15.8 billion of capital expenditures and $8.1 billion dividend outlay with room to spare, enabling Verizon to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet.
Verizon has been investing heavily to build out its faster 5G network, which will help drive growth in the coming years. That should help grow its free cash flow so Verizon can continue increasing its high-yielding dividend. The telecom giant has expanded its payout for 16 straight years, the longest current streak in the U.S. telecom space.
Attractive options for income-seeking investors
Shares of 3M, Intel, and Verizon have tumbled this year and are currently near their 52-week lows. While they face some headwinds, their dividends are on rock-solid ground. Because of that, they look like bargain buys for dividend-seeking investors since their dividend yields have gone in the opposite direction and are currently at their highest levels over the last decade.

2022-11-28 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel, and Qualcomm Fell Today",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-taiwan-semiconductor-intel-and-qualcomm-fell-today,,,"What happened
Shares of leading semiconductor companies Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) all fell today, declining 2.9%, 2.6%, and 3.6%, respectively, as of 3:37 p.m. ET.
The synchronous moves likely had to do with the same broader macroeconomic forces and sector news. First, widespread protests in China over COVID-19 restrictions erupted this past weekend, putting pressure on any stock with exposure to China or products made there. Second, a report from a leading tech industry research company predicted a bigger decline in overall semiconductor revenue next year than it had forecast just four months ago.
So what
On Monday, research industry watcher Gartner came out with its annual forecast for the 2023 semiconductor industry. In the report, Gartner forecast an overall industry decline of 3.6% in 2023 to $596 billion, after an estimated 4% growth in 2022, following the 26.3% growth seen in 2021. The findings mark a striking revision from Gartner's prior $623 billion 2023 forecast given in July, when it anticipated 7.4% growth this year and then just a 2.5% decline in 2023.
Gartner Vice President Richard Gordon explained, ""The short-term outlook for semiconductor revenue has worsened. Rapid deterioration in the global economy and weakening consumer demand will negatively impact the semiconductor market in 2023.""
Certainly, high inflation and rapid interest rate increases are weighing on purchases of consumer electronics, especially as consumers loaded up on PCs and smartphones during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021.
In addition, an especially large decline in demand is coming from China this year, as widespread COVID-related lockdowns, a crackdown on the country's technology sector, and the pop of China's real estate sector are all conspiring to sap consumer confidence and limit demand from Chinese consumers and businesses, which have been a big source of global chip demand.
This past weekend, widespread protests broke out in China against the country's ""zero-COVID"" policy. Under that policy, China had resorted to strict lockdowns of entire cities in order to control local omicron variant outbreaks, which have surged since October. However, as these have been going on since March, it appears a wide swath of Chinese citizens have had enough.
More specifically, unrest over COVID-19 at Apple supplier Foxconn's Zhengzhou plant this past weekend caused a shutdown in iPhone production, which could hurt iPhone sales during the busy holiday shopping season. TF International Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo estimated that 10% of iPhone production is affected by the unrest, and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said Apple is losing $1 billion a week in iPhone sales as long as the plant is shut down as a result.
That could affect revenue for Taiwan Semi and Qualcomm this quarter, as TSMC manufactures the Bionic iPhone processor and Qualcomm supplies the iPhone's modem.
Now what
The semiconductor industry, which is prone to booms and busts, is in the midst of a downturn. However, the decline could be an opportunity for long-term investors to buy these stocks on the cheap, with an eye toward an eventual recovery in 2024. After all, that's what Warren Buffett recently did in buying TSMC stock last quarter.
However, investors should make sure the stocks they buy can survive the current bust. For instance, while Intel may look very compelling from a valuation standpoint, it is trying to pull off a very tricky and expensive turnaround, made all the more difficult by the current PC bust. Recently, Intel has experienced some setbacks, making its outlook over the long term much murkier.
One silver lining in the Gartner report is that while the overall semiconductor industry is projected to decline 3.6% next year, the memory industry, which accounted for about 25.8% of 2022 semi industry sales and is even more cyclical than the overall chip industry, is projected to decline 16%. That leaves non-memory sales growing about 1% next year, according to Gartner's predictions.
Furthermore, Gartner expects consumer electronics to continue to be weak next year, but for enterprise spending on semis to be stronger, as organizations continue to invest in digital transformation. So, for those looking to buy this dip in semis, non-memory chip companies with high exposure to enterprise and industrial applications may be the best places to look.

2022-11-28 00:00:00+00:00,The Time to Buy INTC Stock Is Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-time-to-buy-intc-stock-is-now,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Microprocessor manufacturer Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is roundly disliked on Wall Street. This might scare some traders away from INTC stock, but I invite you to consider a contrarian position. Besides, a couple of corporate insiders are buying up shares, and that’s a sign of confidence in the company.
Do you consider yourself a follower or an independent thinker? It’s not easy, psychologically speaking, to zig when others zag. Since analysts don’t see a prosperous future for Intel, selling is a natural instinct for many investors.
On the other hand, Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett profited handsomely over the years by buying when “there’s blood in the streets.” If you can control your emotions and see Intel’s true value proposition, you’ll surely agree that now is the time to buy, not sell.
What’s Happening With INTC Stock?
Oct. 27 provided a textbook example of what can happen when practically everyone’s on one side of the proverbial boat. Many traders had positioned themselves for Intel to post disastrous third-quarter 2022 earnings stats. Since the actual results weren’t so bad, INTC stock rallied 10%.
Even with that price bump, the shares still trade at a deep discount compared to their 52-week high of $56.28. Moreover, Intel’s trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is quite reasonable at 9.08x.
It’s also worth noting that Intel pays a generous forward annual dividend yield of 4.92%. Despite that benefit, a number of experts on Wall Street don’t recommend buying INTC stock.
HSBC analyst Frank Lee, for example, gave Intel a “reduce” rating (which is similar to “sell”) and a harsh $23 price target. Lee observed that Intel has lost market share in microchips for personal computers and central processing units.
Intel Has a Plan to Slim Down
However, the market-share-slippage issue isn’t a secret among investors. It’s already priced into INTC stock; that’s how it got so cheap.
J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur also cited Intel’s market share loss and gave Intel an “underweight” (also similar to “sell”) rating along with a more reasonable $32 price target. Meanwhile, Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay raised concerns about Intel’s data-center market share loss and assigned the shares a tepid “market perform” rating and a $31 price target.
On the other hand, Intel isn’t just sitting around and allowing its competitors to take over the industry. The company is trimming its workforce as part of a plan to create $3 billion worth of cost reductions next year.
And, even while some analysts are bearish or neutral at best on Intel, a couple of insiders are putting their money where their mouths are. Specifically, CEO Pat Gelsinger held 8,830 shares of Intel, and Director Lip-Bu Tan reportedly owned 100,500 shares after recent purchases.
What You Can Do Now
It certainly seems like Wall Street has already priced Intel’s loss of market share into the stock. Now, there’s a bargain that some corporate insiders seem to recognize, even if the analyst community doesn’t.
So, bona fide contrarians have an opportunity that might not last much longer. INTC stock is trading at a low valuation, and the company offers a healthy dividend yield. If you’re prepared to swim against the tide, there’s no need to wait — feel free to pick up some Intel shares today.

Importantly, INTC stock has lost substantial value in 2022 (down about 41%) and has consistently underperformed the benchmark index in the last five years. Given its underperformance and ongoing demand weakness, investors should take caution before going long on INTC stock. 
Is INTC a Buy, Sell, or Hold?
Due to the ongoing challenges ad uncertainty, most analysts prefer to remain sidelined on INTC stock. It has a Hold consensus rating on TipRanks based on three Buy, 19 Hold, and eight Sell recommendations. 
The graph below shows INTC stock’s performance relative to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), an ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) that aims to deliver returns similar to the S&P 500 Index (SPX) in the last five years. Learn more about SPY here.
Despite the correction, INTC stock trades at a forward Enterprise Value/EBIT multiple of 16.25x, marginally higher than the sector median. Moreover, it is also higher than the five-year average of 11x. 
Intel’s valuation is unappealing. Further, weakness in the PC market, competitive headwinds, and economic uncertainty could continue to pressure INTC stock in the foreseeable future. 
Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said Intel witnessed “increased challenges” in the server and PC segment, with “server CPU ramps delayed to 2023 and softening PC demand.” 
Rakesh added that Intel gained “some share in PCs.” However, “in the key high-margin server/data center segment it continues to see market-share loss into 1H23.”
Rakesh recommends a Hold on INTC stock. His price target of $32, implying 9% upside potential. 
Bottom Line 
The softness in demand, market share losses, and competition will continue to limit the upside in Intel stock. Analysts’ average price target of $29.44 is roughly at par with its closing price on November 25. 
In comparison, analysts see Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stocks as better alternatives to INTC stock. NVDA sports a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks, while AMD has a Moderate Buy consensus rating.
