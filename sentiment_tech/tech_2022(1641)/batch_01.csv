2022-12-31 00:00:00+00:00,25 Tech Stocks to Buy Before They Take Off in 2023,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/25-tech-stocks-to-buy-before-they-take-off-in-2023,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The stock market has been unforgiving for investors looking for tech stocks to buy in 2022. Unfortunately, the turbulence will linger in early 2023 as recession fears remain entrenched until a meaningful U-turn in monetary policy. Tech stocks are cyclical in nature, and market movements will disproportionately affect them in both directions. This means the trough is always the best time to look for tech stocks to buy, and 2023 will be no different.
We may already be in a recession, but there is no telling whether or not the worst is behind or in front of us. However, there are some arguments for why it may not be all doom and gloom for the stock market. First, the stock market bottoms out six months before the economy does. If we look at 2008, the recession was officially declared a year after it began. By that time, the S&P500 was already >40% down, and it only went down another 14% before rallying.
Second, last year’s selloffs have turned many tech stocks into value stocks. A further downturn will not be as severe for these stocks already changing hands at a hefty discount. Instead, we may see many tech stocks surge in late 2023 or early 2024 once the Federal Reserve reverses its monetary policy. Thus, 2023 will likely deliver the best time to buy the following 25 tech stocks:
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Cloudflare (NYSE:NET)
Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL)
ANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS)
Fiverr (NYSE:FVRR)
PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN)
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)
Micron (NASDAQ:MU)
Visa (NYSE:V)
Mastercard (NYSE:MA)
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM)
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL)
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)
Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)
Spotify (NYSE:SPOT)
Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY)
Intel Corporation (INTC)

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the largest semiconductor manufacturers in the world, and one of the top tech stocks to buy . Its products are used in various industries, including automotive, aerospace, industrial, and healthcare. The company is currently trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio of 8x after a selloff that began in April last year, now down 62%.
The current valuation of the company looks very compelling. Intel’s long-term growth is expected to come from its data center business. These fast-growing data centers are significant consumers of Intel’s processors and are expected to increase their spending on CPUs. As the cloud and data segment delivers robust growth, Intel is set to benefit from the increased demand in the long run. Its partnership with Mobileye is also making it benefit from the expansion of self-driving cars.
Furthermore, Intel’s stock is a good bet for investors looking for tech stocks to buy during the next market rebound, as the firm has been hit disproportionately hard by the selloffs. This is due to Intel having difficulties competing with its 2021 figures. However, as 2023 comes around, Intel will likely turn a corner and start growing once more investors realize the long-term value of this stock.
Cloudflare Inc (NET)

Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) provides Internet solutions geared towards privacy. The company sells two main products: CDN and DNS. CDN allows customers to host their websites on Cloudflare’s servers to protect themselves from DDoS attacks and save on bandwidth costs. On the other hand, Cloudflare’s DNS aims to safeguard user anonymity while providing a fast resolver to browse the internet.
Cloudflare is still going through an aggressive expansion phase by acquiring new clients, expanding its workforce, and increasing its global reach despite the market downturn. The company’s financials also have remarkable growth despite slowing down. Revenue growth is still hovering around 50%, while losses are narrowing, and sustaining such growth rates will compel investors to pay a significant premium for NET stock as the economy rebounds.
Moreover, the CDN market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.0% from 2022 to 2030. This is expected to drive Cloudflare’s revenue and profit as we advance.
Tyler Technologies (TYL)

Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) is a leading enterprise infrastructure software and services provider. The company offers various products, including enterprise asset management, mapping and GIS, public safety, detention management, and court case management systems. The company is now growing its business by acquiring new firms and increasing its product offerings. It has a strong presence in North America and the Caribbean. The company is expected to benefit from the growing demand for infrastructure software in the coming years.
Investing in TYL stock is a great opportunity for investors looking to diversify their portfolios, being a global leader in providing software and technology solutions for the public sector while trading 41% down from its all-time high. Investors will resume paying a premium for the stock once the company continues its strong track record of financial performance and growth.
First and foremost, Tyler Technologies has an impressive revenue growth rate despite short-term hurdles. Over the past decade, Tyler Technologies has consistently grown its revenue over a double-digit clip. This demonstrates the company’s ability to expand and acquire new customers, as well as its ability to manage its existing customer base effectively.
Secondly, Tyler Technologies has a diverse portfolio of products and services, which provides investors with numerous options for diversifying their portfolios. The company currently offers solutions for public sector organizations in finance, human resources, and enterprise resource planning. Tyler Technologies’ solutions are also designed to easily integrate existing systems, allowing customers to reduce costs and increase efficiency.
ANSYS (ANSS)
ANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS) is a tech company with robust financials. It develops and markets engineering simulation software and services to the automotive, electronics, semiconductors, aerospace and defense, energy, healthcare, and consumer products industries. In the last three years, the company’s revenue has increased at a growth rate of 12.9%, and I expect revenue will continue to increase at a double-digit clip in the long term.
Of course, ANSYS’ share price has had a rocky road over the past twelve months, with a 39% decline. However, a closer look at the company’s strong financials and impressive net margin suggest that the stock could be a good long-term buy. ANSYS’ net margin stands at 23.1%, ranked better than 93.31% of 2676 companies in the Software industry. That net margin is still growing while most companies are facing margin compression.
Investors also should watch for signs of increased revenue and profits, which could result in a boost in ANSYS’ share price. Its solid financials is enough to prompt a surge once investors start being more aggressive.
Fiverr (FVRR)

Fiverr (NYSE:FVRR) is a global online marketplace for entrepreneurs and freelancers. The company helps people do graphic and web design, writing and translation, video and voiceovers, coding, marketing, and other services at as low as $5. Fiverr is expanding its business and growing its user base by increasing its marketing activities. The company focuses on developing its user base, increasing revenue, and expanding its global reach. Fiverr is expected to benefit from the growing popularity of its services and the burgeoning freelance industry.
FVRR stock is among the worst hit from the tech selloff, which could disturb some investors. However, the company has top-class customer retention and lightning-quick sales growth. Fiverr is narrowing its losses and becoming gig workers’ go-to platform. Once the company fully recovers from its post-pandemic setback, I expect FVRR stock to surge.
PayPal (PYPL)

PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a leading online payment company. The company provides online payment and money transfer services to individuals and businesses. Much like Fiverr, PayPal’s stock is down significantly from its previous high. It is also down nearly 43% from its pre-pandemic stock price. However, PayPal is still a highly profitable business, and its top line continues to accelerate while profitability has picked up. The company is a widely used payment method that won’t go out of relevancy due to these short-term hurdles.
Overall, PayPal provides a great opportunity for investors to capitalize on its strong growth prospects. With a strong management team, a well-positioned digital payments market, and a growing buy now pay later (or BNPL) and cryptocurrency sector, PayPal is well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. The current trough provides an excellent entry point for the stock.
Texas Instruments (TXN), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron Technology (MU)

Cyclical stocks are prone to selloffs during market downturns. This is because demand for their products experiences a slowdown during recessions. Especially those in the semiconductor space are usually among the worst affected by recession fears. However, they rebound faster and offer a better entry point. Such stocks include Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), Broadcomm Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU).
The semiconductor business is the largest segment of these companies’ overall operations. While this sector has cooled down a lot, it still offers many opportunities going forward as it serves multiple end markets, including communications, industrial, automotive, computing, and the remarkably fast-growing cloud computing market. All of these areas have tremendous potential, and these stocks have fallen significantly in the past few months, making them excellent choices for tech stocks to buy.
Moreover, semiconductors are still in high demand, as evidenced by these companies’ robust sales growth. Another plus point is the CHIPS act aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor production. Thus, investors won’t mind paying a higher premium for these stocks once the economy inevitably starts turning its gears again.
Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA)

Investing in Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) stocks can be smart for any investor looking to diversify their portfolio. Both companies are leaders in the financial industry and have a strong track record of growth and profitability. Many consider both of them to be tech stocks due to their accelerating digital payments system. Thus, if you are looking for safer tech stocks to buy, these two should be on the top of your list as they benefit from rate hikes and are significantly less risky than tech companies that depend on semiconductor sales or ad revenue.
Furthermore, both of these companies wield remarkable net margins. Visa’s is over 50%, and its revenue growth is near 19% in the latest quarter. Mastercard does have slightly weaker financials, but the effect on its stock price is negligible, and both move in correlation.
Investors can assess each company’s metrics, innovation, and dividend strength to decide which is the better fit for their particular investment goals. However, both companies offer nearly equal potential for investors and are viable investment options.
IBM (IBM)

Another safe tech stock to buy is IBM (NYSE:IBM). While Big Blue won’t make you a millionaire with outsized returns, it also won’t crash as severely during a recession. This old company has continued to retain many clients who’ll continue to buy services from IBM even during challenging economic conditions, forming an inelastic revenue segment.
Moreover, IBM focuses on higher-growth segments such as cloud computing, AI, and the blockchain. These segments have already become the key driver, with the hybrid cloud segment having revenue growth of 15%. In comparison, software and consulting grew at 7% and 5%, respectively. If the trend continues, this company can catch up with the rest of the market in the long run.
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers a wide variety of products and services, from books and clothing to groceries and music. It is the leading online retailer and a major player in cloud computing, offering a wide variety of services and tools.
Cloud computing is quickly becoming Amazon’s most significant growth driver. It is able to consistently generate strong free cash flow, allowing it to invest in growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders. Even cryptocurrency networks such as Ethereum (ETH-USD) and many governments extensively use Amazon’s servers.
Moreover, its primary segment, e-commerce, is facing short-term difficulties. But that’s expected, as many pandemic-driven customers haven’t returned. Once that segment readjusts to a more normal long-term growth trend, I see AMZN stock stabilizing and growing again. The stock is below pre-pandemic prices and is set to deliver strong returns in the long run.
Apple (AAPL)

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a leader in innovation for decades, and its products are known for their quality and usability. The company’s reputation is simply unshakeable, and when you invest in Apple, you can benefit from its long-term success in the tech industry. The stock has consistently performed well over the years and has seen stellar returns except for the current short-term decline.
The company is constantly innovating and creating new products and services. New iPhones every year form a very inelastic revenue segment due to Apple’s closed-loop ecosystem and remarkable customer retention. Moreover, its products are a symbol of prosperity, especially in third-world countries where other luxury products aren’t as popular. This is a definite competitive advantage for Apple that almost no one has.
Its financials also reinforce the company’s strength. Both the top and bottom lines expanded by 8.14% and 0.83% in Q3. Furthermore, unlike most other tech companies, Apple relies very little on ad revenue or highly cyclical segments. The company is still hiring, albeit at a reduced pace, and hasn’t announced layoffs. That signals solid fundamentals in these conditions, which is why I think AAPL stock is perfect for investors looking for tech stocks to buy that balance potential upside and risk.
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are perfect if you’re looking for more established tech stocks to buy. Microsoft is a leading computer software company offering everything from computer operating systems to business software. It also owns several other tech companies, including LinkedIn, which will help boost its value in the long term. Thus, Microsoft is an excellent long-term tech stock for both beginners and experienced investors. The company’s products, such as Microsoft Office and Windows, are a must for white-collar businesses.
Alphabet also offers a wide variety of services, including search, cloud computing, and autonomous vehicles. Alphabet is one of the most innovative tech companies in the world, making it a great long-term investment. The company also owns Google and YouTube, guaranteeing that Alphabet remains relevant for years, if not decades, to come.
All in all, they are evergreen investments firing on all cylinders and expanding their top lines. They have both struggled in the short term due to the economic landscape causing ad revenues to shrink and margins to compress, but they won’t disappoint over the long run. Their relevancy will continue to make them grow alongside the economy and trade at a premium.
NVIDIA (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com
Both NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are computer hardware companies specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are a critical component in computer gaming, making them solid long-term gaming investments. On top of their computer hardware, both NVIDIA and AMD also offer artificial intelligence (or AI) tools. AI is becoming increasingly important as more companies and services use it. Thus, NVDA and AMD are excellent long-term tech stocks to buy for both gamers and AI experts.
Of course, both are down substantially from their previous peaks due to them being very cyclical.
Last year, both companies saw profits surge due to a chip shortage. Cryptocurrency miners and scalpers contributed to this shortage by ordering large amounts of GPUs and using them for mining or selling them for more. However, The Ethereum network’s shift to a proof-of-stake consensus and Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ‘s fall in value contributed massively to GPU demand plummeting. This has caused an oversaturation of GPUs as miners and scalpers try to sell them, and it is now hurting both companies.
For 2023, AMD is the best of the two. The company offers a more diverse product portfolio of computer components. Thus, the current downturn is a great buy opportunity for AMD stock. I recommend NVIDIA if you are a risk-taker.
Salesforce (CRM)

Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a cloud computing company focused on customer relationship management (CRM). CRM is a popular business software that helps keep track of sales and marketing efforts. As the tech industry shifts towards cloud computing, CRM is becoming a more cloud-based system. Salesforce had a 57% decline from its peak, which seems oversold for a cloud computing stock.
Recent acquisitions and partnerships have made Salesforce an even more attractive option for investors. The company has acquired several smaller businesses that have helped it expand its reach and broaden its portfolio. Salesforce has partnered with companies such as Slack, Google, and Amazon to create a comprehensive platform that can integrate with other services. This has allowed Salesforce to create a robust platform that businesses of all sizes can use.
Adobe (ADBE)

Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a software company focused on graphic design, video editing, and marketing. It makes some of the most popular design software in the world, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. Thus, its popularity makes it among the best tech stocks to buy if you are looking for an established company with long-term relevancy.
Additionally, Adobe has strong and consistent financial performance, room to grow, and operating efficiencies and share repurchases that should help to improve its financials even further. In Q4 2022, Adobe reported a double-digit increase in revenue and a 0.27% increase in operating income, while its net income decreased by 4.6%. Moreover, the company is more reliant on selling software subscriptions, a growing segment.
Not only that, subscriptions provide cash continuously for software that needs very little server-side upkeep. The company also has a cloud segment which could become a significant growth driver in the long run.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.com
While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) might look like a falling knife to many after its 70% decline from its peak, it is reaching highly oversold territories. The stock might look traditionally overvalued due to its high PE, but investors should remember that its profits are doubling yearly. Its top-line growth is also consistent, near 50% growth. That should justify a much higher premium than its current value.
Simply put, Tesla’s financials should not warrant a selloff of this scale lasting too long. It is also by far the most established electric vehicle company in the world. Thus, I highly recommend the stock for 2023 as it offers a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity. Once the global economy picks up again, Tesla could surge much higher.
Netflix (NFLX)
Source: xalien / Shutterstock
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has recovered substantially from its selloff, but it still has a long way to go. The company has not only retained its pandemic subscribers but is now growing again, including a 6% top-line growth. That is impressive, considering not many people are binge-watching Netflix after 2020, and competition is getting tougher for streaming companies.
In addition, Netflix is taking smart steps to narrow its losses by introducing ads, cutting headcount, and cracking down on account sharing. That might not be the best experience for some customers, but it is great news for investors as it opens up more revenue sources for the company. Beating expectations by a healthy margin is another major plus.
Therefore, despite the strong recovery, the stock still provides an excellent long-term buying opportunity. Its stock price is still 20% below pre-pandemic prices, while its profits have more than doubled since.
Meta Platforms (META)
Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.com
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on the receiving end of a much harsher punishment than Netflix. That is because Netflix has taken smart steps to improve its profits, but Meta has done little. The biggest concern for investors with this company is its metaverse project. It is not easy to find anyone interested in such a project.
Likewise, its metaverse segment is a money pit with little revenue generation. In the first three months of 2022, sales from the Reality Labs segment were only $285 million. That’s $3.67 billion in operating losses.
Of course, that’s not a healthy segment, but it also shouldn’t warrant a 68% selloff. Meta owns Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger. Those four apps generated $9.3 billion in the first nine months of 2022, which puts total operating income at $5.66 billion. That deserves a much higher valuation in the long run.
Spotify (SPOT)
Source: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com
Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) has seen a turbulent ride since its IPO in 2018. Despite missing analysts’ expectations for ad revenue and subscribers in its most recent earnings report, Spotify has posted some positive numbers. In Q3 2022, the company’s revenue growth was 21.4%, and the company is in a very favorable position to execute numerous catalysts that could drive long-term upside. One is the Euro regaining its strength.
Spotify’s paid listeners are roughly two times more profitable than free listeners, and if the company can grow its paid subscriber base, it could bring significant long-term upside. Additionally, the company has much more room to grow in developing countries where it is still not popular.
If the company can execute its catalysts, then it could see a significant long-term upside. With the right management and strategic decisions, SPOT stock could become a lucrative long-term investment. Especially once ad revenues recover, Spotify can turn a corner and surge.
Tencent Holdings (TCEHY)
Source: Shutterstock
Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is one of the leading tech companies in China and is often overlooked by investors. The company offers a variety of products and services ranging from social media, cloud computing, gaming, fintech, and video streaming. Tencent’s stock has declined more than 73.9% due to regulatory issues and a sluggish zero-covid economy in China. However, as China abandons the policy and reopens, it has surged 67.6%.
In the most recent quarter, Tencent reported a 1.6% YoY decline in revenue. However, its cloud services business (Tencent Cloud) is accelerating, ranking top 2 in China’s “Public Cloud Service Market.” Of course, Tencent is not without risk, as it relies heavily on China for growth. However, as China reopens and approves new games, TCEHY is undoubtedly among the top tech stocks to buy.

2022-12-31 00:00:00+00:00,3 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy in January,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dividend-paying-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-january-0,,,"The tech sector's meltdown in 2022 -- which was mainly driven by inflation, rising interest rates, and other nerve-wracking macro headwinds -- highlighted the value of consistent profits, reasonable valuations, and reliable dividends during uncertain times. Many speculative tech stocks that lacked those strengths quickly surrendered their pandemic-era gains.
That was a painful learning experience for many investors, but it still isn't too late to add a few reliable dividend tech stocks to your portfolio as the new year begins. I believe International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) can deliver consistent returns throughout 2023 even if other higher-growth tech stocks falter.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. IBM
IBM generated anemic growth for years before it spun off its struggling managed infrastructure services unit as Kyndryl in November 2021. But today, the ""new"" IBM looks a lot more promising as a long-term investment as it expands its higher-growth hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence businesses.
Instead of going toe-to-toe against public cloud giants like Amazon and Microsoft, IBM is wedging its open source services between public and private clouds to analyze all the data that flows through that ""hybrid"" space. That flexible approach enables IBM to profit from the growth of the cloud market -- regardless of which company owns the largest cloud platform.
Analysts expect IBM's revenue and earnings to grow 5% and 15%, respectively, in 2022 even as the rising dollar, its decoupling from Kyndryl, and supply chain headwinds all curb its near-term growth. They expect its revenue and earnings to grow 1% and 6%, respectively, in 2023 as it fully decouples from Kyndryl and expands its higher-growth businesses.
IBM expects to generate about $10 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in 2022, which should easily cover the $5.9 billion in dividends it paid over the past 12 months. Its forward dividend yield of 4.7% makes it one of the highest-yielding blue chip tech stocks in the S&P 500, and its stock still looks cheap at 15 times forward earnings. That high yield and low valuation should make it a great stock to own as the bear market drags on.
2. Texas Instruments
Texas Instruments produces a wide range of analog and embedded chips for consumer electronics, communication infrastructure, connected cars, and industrial machines. It generates most of its growth from the auto and industrial markets, so it's shielded from the post-pandemic slowdown of the PC market that is hurting other chipmakers like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.
Unlike Intel and AMD, which both produce more advanced processors, TI sells cheaper chips for a wide range of wireless and power management applications. Instead of ramping up its research and development costs to produce cutting-edge chips, TI mainly focuses on improving its cost efficiency. TI's ongoing shift from 200 millimeter to 300 millimeter wafers has already reduced the costs of its unpackaged parts by roughly 40%. What's more, TI should receive subsidies and tax breaks from the recently passed CHIPS and Science Act because it already manufactures most of its own chips in the United States.
TI's expanding gross margin and robust FCF growth enabled it to buy back nearly half of its shares over the past 18 years while raising its dividend annually for 19 consecutive years. It currently pays a forward yield of 3%, and it intends to spend all of its future FCF on buybacks and dividends.
Analysts expect TI's revenue and earnings to rise 9% and 12%, respectively, in 2022. Its growth is expected to cool off next year as it laps the post-pandemic recovery of the auto and industrial markets, deals with COVID-19 lockdowns in China, and navigates other macro headwinds -- but its stock still looks reasonably valued at 21 times forward earnings.
3. Cisco Systems
Cisco is the largest provider of networking routers and switches in the world. It also bundles its own cybersecurity services, other enterprise applications, and communication tools with its own hardware. Cisco's core hardware businesses operate in a highly commoditized market, but it's been expanding its higher-growth software businesses to offset that slowdown. It's also repeatedly acquired smaller companies to expand that ecosystem and reduce its overall dependence on routers and switches.
Cisco's growth was throttled by supply chain disruptions and component shortages over the past year. However, it repeatedly assured investors that the market's demand for its products continues to outstrip its supply -- so its growth should stabilize once it resolves its supply chain problems.
For fiscal 2023, which ends in July, Cisco expects its revenue to rise 4.5% to 6.5% as its adjusted earnings per share grows 4% to 7%. It also reaffirmed its guidance for achieving 5% to 7% annual revenue growth over the long term. It attributed that optimistic outlook to the eventual resolution of its supply chain challenges, ongoing campus and data center network upgrades, and the expansion of its software and subscription services.
At 13 times forward earnings, Cisco's stock still looks dirt cheap relative to its near-term growth. It also pays an attractive forward yield of 3.2%, and it spent less than half of its FCF on those dividend payments over the past 12 months.

2022-12-30 00:00:00+00:00,ASML Stock Falls on News of a Huawei Patent Application. Time to Sell?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/asml-stock-falls-on-news-of-a-huawei-patent-application.-time-to-sell,,,"After a strong rally from multiyear lows in early October, shares of leading chip equipment maker ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) are falling once again. While tech stocks have been selling off in general in the final days of 2022, ASML shareholders have extra reason for worry: Chinese tech giant Huawei just filed for a patent on the same type of advanced chipmaking equipment ASML has a monopoly on.
For years, it's been a closely held belief among chip industry insiders, tech researchers, and Wall Street analysts that ASML's lead is so great that no competitors will be able to catch up. On the surface, Huawei's patent in China suggests ASML could lose its privileged status, but not so fast. There's a lot more to this story.
A patent is nothing more than a legal document
According to a report from Taiwanese media outlet UDN, Huawei has filed a patent on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment in China. Currently, actual working EUV technology is ASML's realm to rule, though its predecessor technology, which involves deep ultraviolet (DUV), has some competition.
EUV is incredibly important: It enables the manufacture of chips with transistors (the tiny switches in a chip that handle the computing process in a computer) just a few nanometers in size. Chips designed at this microscopic level are what power our smartphones and high-performance computing like AI in data centers. Decades of research and a handful of key acquisitions have put ASML many years in the lead when it comes to EUV technology know-how.
As critical as EUV has become, it's mind-bogglingly complex equipment to develop -- let alone to manufacture and operate. Only a handful of companies actually make use of (or are planning to make use of) ASML's EUV setups, including the world's largest chip fabrication company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), South Korea's memory chipmakers Samsung and SK Hynix, Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) (which just delayed the use of EUV until 2025), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) (where production should begin in 2023). Huawei would seemingly jeopardize ASML's relationship with these key chipmaking partners.
However, filing a patent -- especially a patent solely for use in China -- is not the same thing as actually building a working piece of equipment. It took ASML many years to complete a working EUV prototype, and many more years after that to actually commercialize its most advanced machines. If the patent is granted, Huawei merely possesses a legal document. It will still need to build its EUV machine. Which, mind you, requires many thousands of critical and specialized parts, some of which are made in the U.S., where there are restrictions on exports of advanced chipmaking technology to China.
Suffice it to say, Huawei still has a steep hill to climb.
Ultraviolet with envy
In addition to Huawei not being an imminent threat, there's also the matter of ASML's current China business. It hasn't been able to sell EUV machines to mainland China for the last few years, and there's no indication that will change anytime soon since the U.S. and the Netherlands (ASML's home base, which is acting largely at the behest of the U.S.) have imposed new restrictions on exports to China in recent months. So even should Huawei succeed, ASML isn't selling EUV to Chinese customers in the first place. In other words, you can't lose something you don't have.
And as for a long-term threat that Huawei could export EUV equipment from China and compete with ASML on the international scene, it would first need to convince companies like Taiwan Semi, Samsung, Intel, and the like to ditch a very deep and long-term relationship with ASML. With decades of experience under its belt, I doubt ASML would lose many orders. After all, an EUV lithography machine costs hundreds of millions of dollars apiece. That's far too expensive a piece of equipment to take a gamble on.
For any ASML shareholders who have considered panic-selling on this Huawei news, I'd caution against that. The company is under no imminent threat -- at least from this particular source. The long-term growth outlook for ASML remains intact as the semiconductor industry continues its multi-decade rise.

2022-12-30 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Stocks Worth Buying for the Long Term in 2023,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-stocks-worth-buying-for-the-long-term-in-2023,,,"Most investors will be happy to turn the page on 2022 and get a fresh start in 2023, and I count myself among that group. I don't know how the economy will fare in 2023, or what geopolitical events may surface, so I don't know if the market will remain in ""risk off"" mode or return to more of a ""risk on"" appetite, and I don't try to make any directional call on the market itself.
Instead, I try to look for stocks that I think will do well over a multi-year time frame, and that will hold up well even if 2023 is another challenging year. I have my sights set on profitable companies with stocks that trade at attractive valuations. I'm also looking for stocks that pay a dividend, buy back shares, or ideally both. I'm also looking for businesses that have solid long-term growth prospects.
With that in mind, here are my top three stocks worth buying for the long term in 2023.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Ermenegildo Zegna
This year renewed my appreciation for businesses that have true long-term staying power and a real moat, as many previously high-flying stocks sputtered out once interest rates rose.
Ermenegildo Zegna N.V. (NYSE: ZGN) certainly fits this bill -- the Italian luxury house has been around for 112 years, and it has earned a reputation for quality and craftsmanship in that time. True luxury brands have some of the best moats out there -- and it takes a long time for a new company to achieve such recognition.
The luxury market is also more resilient than one might expect. Luxury brands cater to consumers at the upper tiers of the economic spectrum, and these customers tend to have more disposable income that isn't as affected by inflation or a slowing economy.
But investing in luxury goods stocks isn't just about playing defense. This a good space to be in over the long term -- Statista calls luxury goods a $312 billion market and predicts that it will grow at a 5.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years. Euromonitor forecasts that the personal premium goods market will grow 6% to 8% over the next three years as it grows into a $370 billion industry.
Zegna is growing at an impressive rate, with 27.5% year-over-year revenue growth last quarter. It's on fire in the Middle East and Africa (86.4% revenue growth), the U.K. (61.6%), North America (33.2%), and Latin America (33.2%). China is a key market for the company, and while sales there were only up 3%, Zegna should be a major beneficiary when China's economy fully reopens, hopefully sometime in 2023.
Zegna trades at a reasonable forward valuation of about 22 times earnings, and it recently initiated an annual dividend payment.
2. Restaurant Brands International
My next top pick for 2023 is Restaurant Brands International (NYSE: QSR). The parent company of Burger King, Tim Hortons, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, and Firehouse Subs has outperformed the market in 2022, with a gain of 7% year to date.
This is a defensive, resilient business -- even if customers are tightening their belts, fast food restaurants like Burger King are a fairly economical option. Furthermore, Restaurant Brands is an asset-light franchisor that receives royalty payments from its franchisees based on revenue, which helps to give it some protection from inflation.
While this is a defensive stock, there is plenty of room for long-term growth, especially internationally. Tim Hortons now has over 1,500 locations outside of its native Canada, and recently entered the Indian market. During the past quarter it opened its 50th location in Mexico. Burger King continues to enjoy strong international performance with double-digit comparable sales growth in markets like France, Spain, and the U.K. Meanwhile, Popeyes is getting ready to enter lucrative new markets like South Korea and Indonesia.
Even after this year's outperformance, shares of Restaurant Brands look palatable at about 21 times earnings and with a dividend that yields 3.3%.
One final kicker that makes Restaurant Brands stock even more appealing is the presence of former Domino's Pizza CEO Patrick Doyle as the chairman of the board. Doyle has skin in the game, having purchased $30 million worth of shares, and he is aligned with investors, forgoing a salary and instead being awarded performance stock units based on the stock price rising over the next five years, which I view as tremendously bullish for the stock.
3. Taiwan Semiconductor
Semiconductor stocks have been hammered this year as a glut of supply has weighed on the space. I don't know if this trend will resolve itself in 2023, but I do know that I like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the world's largest contract manufacturer of semiconductors, anyway because over the long term, this is still a space that I want exposure to.
Rival Intel forecasts that global spending on semiconductors will grow from $600 billion today to $1 trillion annually by 2030, so over the long term, there is still tremendous growth potential for this market.
Taiwan Semiconductor makes the world's smallest and most advanced chips, giving it a tremendous moat. Not many companies can simply set up shop and start competing with it. The company's top customers are a who's who of top semiconductor companies, including Apple, Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices. Taiwan Semiconductor's chips serve a wide variety of lucrative end markets including high-performance computing, smartphones, automotive, artificial intelligence, and more.
Thanks to short-term issues, shares of Taiwan Semiconductor are down 38% in 2022 and now trade at just 13.5 times earnings, which is well below the average multiple for the S&P 500. This seems like an attractive valuation for a company with Taiwan Semiconductor's moat and secular growth prospects. Taiwan Semiconductor is also a dividend payer and the shares currently yield 2.4%.
Need one more reason to consider investing? Warren Buffett recently initiated a large investment in Taiwan Semiconductor.
I'm looking forward to a fresh start in 2023, and while I don't know how the market will perform, I believe that these three stocks will be good investments for 2023 and well beyond based on their palatable valuations, returns to shareholders, and long-term growth prospects.

2022-12-30 00:00:00+00:00,Don't Wait for a Market Crash: These 2 Top Stocks Are on Sale,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dont-wait-for-a-market-crash%3A-these-2-top-stocks-are-on-sale-4,,,"As market pundits repeatedly beat the ""recession 2023"" drum, investors might be tempted to delay buying high-conviction names on their watch lists. Yet there has already been a mini-recession in the form of a mass exodus out of big tech names and into perceived all-weather investments.
Some technology businesses aren't necessary all-weather because supply chain disruptions (coupled with, oddly enough, gluts of certain tech components) could persist well into next year. This concern, along with a not-so-accommodative Federal Reserve and other company-specific problems, are already well known among the trading community.
Many tech stocks have already been severely beaten down, but two names in particular -- Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- offer attractive valuations and decent dividends. And there's no need to wait for conditions to deteriorate further before taking a long position.
Intel is still a giant among domestic chipmakers
If you're going to brace for a market crash, it makes sense to have some cash handy but also stay invested in famous names that are trading at compelling valuations. Intel has been absolutely reviled in 2022, with the company's critics reiterating ad nauseam that it has lost market share to Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia, and others.
The market's reaction has been extreme: The stock's price was cut in half this year. But this presents a value investing opportunity. Just a few years ago, it would have been unimaginable that Intel's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio would fall to 8 and the stock would trade barely above book value per share.
In other words, Intel stock has the worst-case scenario already priced in, and then some. The company remains a chipmaking giant and a likely beneficiary of the federal CHIPS Act.
Besides, it's not as if Intel is just sitting around and letting the competition steal its market share. During 2022's third quarter, it gained 4% of the discrete GPU market, versus virtually 0% in the year-earlier quarter.
And the company split its graphics-hardware operations into two separate divisions: One will focus on high-performance computing, while the other will be geared toward the gaming market. Hopefully, this divide-and-focus strategy will allow Intel to be more competitive in those niche tech fields and thereby steal back some of its lost market share.
Take a bite out of Apple while sentiment is shaky
Meanwhile, Apple is having its own meltdown, with its shares recently hitting a 52-week low. Again, big tech is flailing, but this should pique the interest of value seekers. Apple's P/E ratio is quite rare and attractive at just 21.
It feels as if market-crash conditions have already been priced into the shares, even though Apple has met or exceeded Wall Street's quarterly earnings-per-share forecasts for two years running.
Moreover, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Apple reported record revenue for that period of $90.1 billion, up 8% year over year, despite recession fears, supply chain disruptions, and sticky inflation.
Nonetheless, J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee is cautious since Apple's China-focused smartphone shipment numbers ""confirm industry headwinds."" It certainly isn't helping that iPhone component supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry, better known as Foxconn, has operations in China amid on-and-off COVID-19 lockdowns.
But there's talk that Apple plans to ramp up its production in India, while also potentially deploying factories in Vietnam in 2023.
In any event, J.P. Morgan analysts have observed iPhone supply ""improving and inching slowly towards parity with demand."" If China's lockdowns ease in 2023 and/or Apple finds a workaround for its supply issues, the company could provide its loyal investors with a relief rally. In the meantime, value hunters can scoop up shares of the technology giant at nearly market-crash-level prices.

2022-12-30 00:00:00+00:00,"Near a 52-Week Low Now, This Stock Could Be One of the Biggest Winners of 2023",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/near-a-52-week-low-now-this-stock-could-be-one-of-the-biggest-winners-of-2023,,,"2022 may have been a painful year for investors in equities, but some stocks were punished more than they deserved despite operational resilience. One such glaring example is Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE: BIP), a top-notch dividend growth stock that is now trading near its 52-week low. The stock's price drop has pushed its dividend yield to two-year highs of 4.6%.
If you're looking to buy stocks for 2023, you simply can't miss this beaten-down stock. But before I tell you why, note that I'm referring to the limited partnership here and not the corporate shares that trade as Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation. Although the two are the same corporate entity, owning units of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners in tax-deferred accounts like IRAs has some tax implications.
However, that doesn't warrant the steep recent fall in shares of the partnership, and the stock looks primed to rebound and rally in 2023 as the company prepares for a record year.
This stock is inflation-resistant and recession-proof
Brookfield Infrastructure does invest in infrastructure, but what sets it apart is that most of its assets are stable cash-generating machines like utilities, midstream energy, rail and toll roads, telecom towers, and data centers.
To put some numbers to that, almost 90% of Brookfield Infrastructure's cash flows are regulated or contracted, so a recession may not hurt much. Also, nearly 70% of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) is indexed to inflation, which means its tariffs increase with inflation and flow through its bottom line.
And, this is precisely what makes Brookfield Infrastructure such an attractive stock right now.
We're in the midst of a high inflationary environment with fears of a recession looming large. Brookfield Infrastructure, however, continues to make money. In the third quarter, for example, it generated record funds from operations (FFO) of $525 million, up 24% year over year. Of that, 10% was organic growth that came from ""elevated inflation levels impacting tariffs and the commissioning of approximately $1.2 billion of capital projects"" in the past 12 months.
So even if the economy slips into a recession in 2023, Brookfield Infrastructure's FFO, as well as dividends, should keep rising. The company aims to increase its dividend per unit by 5% to 9% every year, which looks like an easy goal going by its track record of the past decade.
Image source: Brookfield Infrastructure Partners.
The real catalyst for FFO and dividend growth in 2023
Of course, there's more to Brookfield's high-quality FFO growth than just contractual tariffs and inflation. Its core business strategy, in fact, is asset recycling, which means the company regularly sells mature assets to reinvest the proceeds in high-margin businesses.
Brookfield Infrastructure expects to net nearly $2.4 billion in proceeds from the sale of assets in fiscal-year 2022. As for reinvesting, it already identified growth opportunities worth $1.2 billion as of the third quarter, including the acquisition of a portfolio of 36,000 telecom towers in Europe and a home services company called HomeServe, as well as a partnership with technology giant Intel to build a semiconductor foundry in Arizona.
Over the next few months, Brookfield Infrastructure expects to add almost $4 billion of new capital projects to its backlog.
This stock could earn you double-digit returns in 2023
All of this makes one thing evident: highly visible growth for Brookfield Infrastructure for 2023, which should also mean solid returns for investors, as in the past.

So by buying Brookfield Infrastructure stock now, you'll be investing in a company that could easily grow its FFO per unit by 10% or more even amid high inflation, rising interest rates, and a slowdown, and increase its dividend by at least 5% in 2023. Also, you get to enjoy a 4.6% yield right now.
It couldn't get much better, and with the stock trading near 52-week lows, at less than 12 times its projected 2022 FFO, and just about 10 times its 2023 FFO estimate, Brookfield Infrastructure could turn out to be a big winner in 2023.

2022-12-30 00:00:00+00:00,Check Point (CHKP) & Intel Collab on Endpoint Security,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/check-point-chkp-intel-collab-on-endpoint-security,,,"Check Point Software CHKP recently extended its collaboration with Intel Corporation INTC to provide enhanced anti-ransomware capabilities to Check Point Harmony clients.
Integrating the Threat Detection Technology (TDT), available on Intel’s vPro(R) platform into Check Point’s Harmony Endpoint solution offers processor level anti-ransomware security to the enterprises at both the hardware and software levels without any additional cost. The Harmony Endpoint from CHKP is a complete endpoint security solution built to protect remote workforce from imminent threats like ransomware, phishing or drive-by malware, that quickly minimizes breach impact with autonomous detection and response.
The TDT technology from Intel enables CHKP’s Harmony Endpoint to employ artificial intelligence and machine learning for analyzing CPU telemetry and recognizing ransomware encryption commands before time in the attack flow. This, in turn, stops any operational or financial damages generated by the inflow of ransomware attacks. The integrated solution, which will ensure enterprise customers get access to expanded protection surface, will be made available in early 2023.
Check Point collaborated with Intel Corporation in August 2022 to avail Check Point Quantum IoT Protect solution within Intel’s new platform for IoT device developers, Intel Pathfinder for RISC-V. This enabled the IoT developers to integrate cybersecurity conveniently without hampering its product performance.
In third-quarter 2022, Check Point's subscription revenues jumped 13.4% to $215.5 million, driven by double-digit revenue growth in CloudGuard and Harmony solutions. The company intends to accelerate its future revenues through these subscription-based solutions and services.

2022-12-29 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel, and Qualcomm Stocks Popped Today",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-taiwan-semiconductor-intel-and-qualcomm-stocks-popped-today,,,"What happened
All's well that ends well in the stock market -- and as trading winds down in what has been a miserable year for semiconductor investors, shareholders of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) are getting a reprieve of sorts.
So far this year, TSMC has lost 39% of its market cap, Qualcomm 41%, and Intel is down 51%. But for various reasons, shares of TSMC are enjoying a 3.6% bump on the second-to-last day of trading this year, as of 12:22 p.m. ET. Qualcomm is gaining 2.9%, and Intel is up 2.2%.
So what
TSMC is today benefiting from a report by Taiwan's DigiTimes that says the company will begin to scale its production of industry-leading 3 nanometer semiconductor chips as early as mid-2023. ""Multiple customers"" are said to be ordering TSMC's newest chips, which suggests that even if the rest of the semiconductor industry has fallen into an inventory glut, TSMC, at least, appears to still have the potential to grow in the new year.
Similarly, Intel is benefiting from good news from Reuters, which reports that patent-holding company VLSI Technology has agreed to drop a $4 billion patent violation lawsuit against Intel -- apparently without Intel paying VLSI anything. Although Reuters admitted that Intel ""did not provide additional details"" on the companies' settlement, investors are taking the announcement at face value, and bidding up Intel stock on the assumption it will not need to pay VLSI any more money.
In contrast, the news on Qualcomm today isn't obviously good for the company. According to DigiTimes, Qualcomm may be forced to cut prices on its midrange and entry-level Snapdragon processors in 2023. Presumably, this is a move by Qualcomm to cut inventories and goose sales. Still, even if a price cut succeeds in keeping sales rising, it also threatens lower gross margin for Qualcomm in the new year.
Now what
That being said, proactive moves by Qualcomm -- especially if imitated by others -- could turn out to be good news for the semiconductor industry in the long term. Rather than drag out a situation in which the industry is in a state of oversupply, quick price cuts to clear out stale product, combined with reductions in volume of new product produced, could end up being good news for all participants, including Qualcomm itself.
Granted, this doesn't change the fact that the cuts could hurt both revenue and margins for semiconductor stocks in the short term. But viewed in light of the expected timeline for TSMC's introduction of its newest chips (i.e., mid-2023), it would appear that investors are looking at six months of lean times for semiconductor stocks -- followed, possibly, by a return to growth in the second half of the new year.
From my perspective, that's actually not too long to ask investors to wait. After all, semiconductor stocks look pretty attractively priced today, with TSMC trading for 13.2 times trailing earnings, Qualcomm costing only 9.6 times earnings, and Intel the cheapest of the bunch at a mere 8 times earnings. For investors with the patience to wait at least six months to see how things shake out, today just might be a good time to start placing bets of a revival for semiconductor stocks in 2023.
Fingers crossed.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-12-28 00:00:00+00:00,Intel's Memory Chip Exit Looks Like a Genius Move,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-memory-chip-exit-looks-like-a-genius-move,,,"While the past decade or so has been generally positive for the memory chip industry, with muted downturns and periods of soaring prices, the fundamental nature of the industry is once again rearing its ugly head. Memory chips are commodities, and manufacturing them is capital intensive, making booms and busts inevitable. The current bust, which follows an extreme pandemic-era boom, is the worst since the global financial crisis.
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) faces plenty of its own problems. The company has been losing market share across the board to rival AMD; demand for PCs is falling off a cliff; execution issues in its server chip business have delayed key launches; and a multiyear manufacturing investment cycle is running into a tough macroeconomic environment. In short, Intel has a lot on its plate.
Getting out of memory
One thing Intel doesn't have to deal with, at least not directly, is the downturn in the memory chip markets. The company has exited its various memory chip businesses over the past few years, and CEO Pat Gelsinger is adamant about staying out for good. ""I never want to be in memory, you see I'm doing everything I can to exit our memory businesses in that regard,"" Gelsinger said in an interview earlier this year.
Intel began its exit from memory before Gelsinger was appointed CEO in early 2021. The company announced in late 2020 that it had struck a deal with memory chipmaker SK Hynix to unload its NAND business. It was a complex arrangement, with an initial $7 billion payment in 2021 in exchange for the solid-state drive business and Intel's NAND memory manufacturing facility in China, and a final $2 billion payment expected sometime in 2025 in exchange for IP and the workforce at that facility. Intel will continue to manufacture NAND wafers until the final closing, although the facility itself is now owned by SK Hynix.
NAND chips, which are used in solid-state drives and flash memory, are in severe oversupply at the moment. Micron reported that its NAND bit shipments were down by a mid-teens percentage in its most recent quarter on a sequential basis, even as average selling prices tumbled more than 20%.
While NAND is a commodity, Intel's other memory business initially held more promise. Intel worked with Micron to develop 3D XPoint memory, which was first announced in 2015. 3D XPoint was an interesting product. It was nonvolatile like NAND, meaning that it stored data even when the power was cut, but it was dramatically faster and more durable.
Unfortunately, 3D XPoint never gained very much traction. Intel announced in mid-2022 that it was winding down the 3D XPoint business entirely, writing off more than half a billion dollars' worth of inventory. Selling the business would have made no sense, since the underlying technology was essentially dead.
If Gelsinger has his way, 3D XPoint will mark Intel's last foray into the memory chip markets.
Focusing on logic and manufacturing
There's little in the way of a durable competitive advantage that can be gained in cyclical, commodity markets like memory chips. Memory chip manufacturers have essentially no pricing power, and even the low-cost producer will suffer severely during times of oversupply.
CPUs, GPUs, and bleeding-edge semiconductor manufacturing, on the other hand, are not commodities. Intel already leads the CPU market, although it's facing serious competition from AMD. In the GPU market, Intel successfully launched its first discrete graphics cards in decades. And in manufacturing, Intel is pouring tens of billions of dollars into building out its own foundry business to provide manufacturing services to other companies.
These are all areas where Intel already has or can potentially gain durable competitive advantages. There will still be cycles, but an Intel CPU is not the same as an AMD CPU. In the memory chip business, there's very little differentiating products from different manufacturers.
For Intel, memory chips were a distraction. With demand and prices now crashing, Intel's decision to get out of the memory business for good looks prescient.

2022-12-28 00:00:00+00:00,Intel's (INTC) New GPUs Pose Threat to AMD's Market Share,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-intc-new-gpus-pose-threat-to-amds-market-share,,,"Intel Corporation INTC recently re-entered the discrete graphics processing unit (GPU) market after a two-decade absence and captured 4% of the market in the third quarter of 2022, according to Jon Peddie Research (JPR), the industry's research firm for graphics.
Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Nvidia currently dominate the discrete GPU market, with Nvidia controlling the higher-end market and AMD the lower-end market, per a report from The Motley Fool.
Intel's expansion into the discrete GPU market could potentially hinder AMD's long-term growth as Intel targets many of the same lower-end PC gamers.
Intel Corporation Price and Consensus
Intel Corporation price-consensus-chart | Intel Corporation Quote
Intel's Xe discrete GPUs are a new generation of graphics processors introduced in late 2020 and early 2021. These GPUs were designed to challenge AMD's Radeon and Nvidia's GeForce in the high-end PC gaming market. Also, these GPUs are produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and are built using a 7nm process.
According to recent industry benchmarks, Intel's Arc A380 GPU has proven to deliver better performance than AMD's Radeon RX 6400 across a wide range of games.
This is significant because the RX 6400 is more expensive than the A380, which retails for around $140, while Nvidia's comparable GTX 1630 costs about $200. Hence, this may make the A380 an attractive option for consumers looking for good performance at a lower price point.
Intel's market share of discrete GPUs has increased, which is concerning as the overall GPU market has declined 42% year on year to 14 million units in third-quarter 2022. This is due to a shrinking PC market, and Intel, AMD, and Nvidia are all competing for a decreasing market.
Intel designs and manufactures computer chips and other electronic components. Its products are used in a wide range of devices, including personal computers, servers and mobile devices.
For 2022, the company expects non-GAAP revenues to be $63-$64 billion, down from prior expectations of $65-$68 billion, owing to challenging macroeconomic conditions with high uncertainty. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be $1.95 per share, down from prior expectations of $2.30.
At present, INTC carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has lost 49.9% in the past year compared with the sub-industry’s decline of 43.7%.

2022-12-28 00:00:00+00:00,"Even in a Struggling Market, a Specific Type of Stock Can Still Produce Massive Returns",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/even-in-a-struggling-market-a-specific-type-of-stock-can-still-produce-massive-returns,,,"As 2023 approaches, most investors likely want to put 2022 behind them. Amid massive stock declines and high inflation, some investors worry that the market has entered a period of stagnation comparable to the 1966 to 1983 time frame when the Dow Jones Industrial Average could not consistently stay above 1,000.
That sentiment may or may not come to pass. However, under such conditions, a few growth stocks still produced outsize returns. By learning to identify such stocks early, investors could earn considerable gains, even when the broader indexes do not.

Growth in a stagnant market
Growth investors could have an unexpected ally in the P/E ratio. Between the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the average S&P 500 stock sold at a P/E ratio of less than 10. Admittedly, such valuations may not seem to help investors in a stagnant market, especially considering that the average S&P 500 P/E ratio is about 20.
Nonetheless, investors should remember that a P/E ratio is a stock's price divided by its earnings. That means if earnings climb and a stock's price stays the same, that ratio will fall. At an earnings growth rate of 50%, it would take a P/E ratio from 20 to just 6 if the stock's price were to stay the same over three years.
EFFECTS OF EARNINGS GROWTH ON A P/E RATIO, ASSUMING STABLE STOCK PRICES
YEAR PRICE EARNINGS PER SHARE (ASSUMING 50% GROWTH) P/E RATIO
0 $200 $10 20.0
1 $200 $15 13.3
2 $200 $22.50 8.9
3 $200 $33.75 5.9
Chart by author.
In the short term, trader emotions could stay negative, and investors might ignore such a growth rate for a time. However, famed investor Warren Buffett's mentor, Benjamin Graham, described the market as a ""voting machine"" in the short term and a ""weighing machine"" in the long term.
As those valuations come down, at some point, the ""weight"" of the stock will probably receive due consideration. At some point, investment gains become a near certainty since high growth at a low valuation is attractive in almost any market.
Leveraging innovation
Moreover, such increases can occur because of one seemingly enduring phenomenon in American business -- innovation-led growth. Even in the 1970s, investors can find numerous examples of this. Enterprises such as Intel and Southwest Airlines experienced massive growth as they revolutionized their industries.
Also, during the 1970s, investors began to pay more attention to an Omaha-based investor named Warren Buffett. As late as 1976, they could buy his Berkshire Hathaway A shares for under $100 per share, a stock that rose to about $425 per share by 1980. Today, A shares sell for about $450,000 per share.
However, the easiest of these to understand may be the rise of Walmart. At the time of its 1970 initial public offering (IPO), it was a small-town retailer with 38 stores in the south-central U.S. Over time, its then-innovative small-town department stores and IT-driven supply chains drew customers and investors alike.
Between the IPO and the fourth stock split in November 1980, the stock would rise by over 48-fold, well above the 29% gain in the Dow during that time frame. That set the stage for accelerated growth in subsequent decades. Although Walmart's high-growth days are probably over, its stock has increased by nearly 18,000-fold since its inception.
Benefitting from history
Investors should study history not to buy the growth names of the past, but to discover where to find growth in the future. Innovation has not stopped, and new ideas continue to drive the creation of new companies. Artificial intelligence, DNA sequencing, energy storage, robotics, and blockchain are some of the industries that could spawn such growth.
Whether a new bull market is coming or not, investors should hone their investing skills to find these emerging industry leaders. If investors think strategically, stay on top of financials, and understand how competitive advantages evolve, they can prosper regardless of the S&P 500's near-term direction.

This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.41%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.11%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 6.67%.
Coming into today, shares of the world's largest chipmaker had lost 9.17% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 6.38%, while the S&P 500 lost 4.4%.
Investors will be hoping for strength from Intel as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Intel to post earnings of $0.20 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 81.65%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $14.5 billion, down 25.76% from the year-ago period.
Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $1.95 per share and revenue of $63.51 billion. These totals would mark changes of -64.35% and -18.6%, respectively, from last year.
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Intel. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.
Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.21% higher. Intel is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Intel has a Forward P/E ratio of 13.35 right now. This represents a no noticeable deviation compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 13.35.
Investors should also note that INTC has a PEG ratio of 1.78 right now. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Semiconductor - General was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.85 at yesterday's closing price.
The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 69, which puts it in the top 28% of all 250+ industries.

2022-12-27 00:00:00+00:00,Is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Stock a Buy?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-stock-a-buy,,,"The revelation that Warren Buffett bought 60 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) in the third quarter changed the way investors and the market viewed this leading manufacturer of semiconductor chips.
Although it has a market share of over 50% in the contract chip manufacturing industry, the combination of a global chip shortage, trade issues, and geopolitical tensions with China has weighed heavily on its stock, which at one point this year had fallen by 60% from its peak. However, a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report and Buffett's stock purchase have propelled the shares back upward, though they are still down 37% year to date.
Despite the surge in the share price that took place over the past month, investors may still want to take a close look at Taiwan Semiconductor for their own portfolios now, because it may be a long time before it's this cheap again.
Image source: Getty Images.
Business done differently
The semiconductor company's business model differs in several key ways from that of other chip stocks, such as that of its main competitor, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
One major difference is that Taiwan Semiconductor operates as a pure-play foundry, meaning it manufactures chips for other companies rather than producing its own branded products. This allows it to focus on its core competency of chip production while leaving product development and marketing to its clients, among which are ""fabless"" chip designers such as Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, and Nvidia.
In contrast, Intel is both a foundry and a design company -- it both manufactures its own chips and produces chips for other companies. But even Intel contracts with TSMC for some of its manufacturing.
The chipmaker's business model has proven to be highly successful, and it has consistently reported strong financial results. In 2020, TSMC's net income reached a record high of $18.2 billion, an increase of 57% from the previous year. It increased it another 17% in 2021, and over the last 12 months, its net income rose 45% year-over-year to $30.5 billion.
A growing, global footprint
In addition to its strong financial performance, Taiwan Semi has also been making efforts to expand its manufacturing footprint in the United States. In 2020, the company announced plans to construct two new foundries in Arizona, with a total original investment of $12 billion, but recently said it would triple that to $40 billion. These foundries will be used to produce advanced chips using 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer process technology.
Image source: Getty Images.
Taiwan Semi is also in talks with suppliers about building its first European plant.
The chipmaker's expansion into the U.S. is part of a broader trend of companies seeking to diversify their supply chains and reduce their reliance on manufacturing in China. It's also doing that in response to China's efforts to boost its own semiconductor industry, which has been aggressively expanding in recent years.
Overall, Taiwan Semi's business model of operating as a pure-play foundry has proven to be highly successful, leading to strong financial performance and attracting the attention of even investing legends such as Buffett. The company's plan to add manufacturing capacity in the U.S. is also a smart strategic choice that will help it better serve its customers and maintain its edge in an increasingly globalized and competitive market.

Despite this, Taiwan Semiconductor's stock is as cheap now as it has been since 2016, trading at 13 times trailing earnings, 12 times next year's estimated earnings, and a fraction of its estimated long-term earnings growth rate.
Demand for semiconductor chips for smartphones and other electronic devices should remain strong, and the increasing use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data centers provides further tailwinds for the sector. As such, Taiwan Semiconductor stock is a buy at these prices.

2022-12-27 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Is Losing Ground to Intel in This Key Chip Market,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-is-losing-ground-to-intel-in-this-key-chip-market,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) hold a near-duopoly in discrete GPUs. Nvidia controls the majority of the market with its higher-end chips, while AMD remains the persistent underdog in the lower-end market. However, that duopoly could soon be threatened by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which recently returned to the discrete GPU market after an absence of more than two decades. According to JPR, Intel captured 4% of the discrete GPU market in the third quarter of 2022, compared to roughly 0% a year earlier. AMD's share dropped from 17% to 8%, while Nvidia's share rose from 83% to 88%.
It wasn't surprising to see AMD cede some of its market to Nvidia, but its losses to Intel are troubling because the latter has been targeting many of the same lower-end PC gamers as AMD. Let's see why Intel is expanding into discrete GPUs again, and how that expansion could throttle AMD's long-term growth.
Image source: Getty Images.
Why is Intel selling discrete GPUs?
Intel is still the largest maker of GPUs in the world, thanks to the integrated GPUs that are directly baked into its CPUs, but those chips can't handle graphically advanced games and applications. That's where powerful discrete GPUs, which are installed separately as add-in boards, come in.
Two decades ago, the discrete GPU market was dominated by Nvidia and ATI, which would be acquired by AMD in 2006. Intel attempted to break into the market with the i740 GPU in 1998, but it flopped and was discontinued after just a few months. It tried to return to the market with a new discrete GPU in 2009, but that project was ultimately scrapped.
The lack of a powerful GPU has been a sore spot for Intel, since AMD now bundles together its CPUs and discrete GPUs in APUs (advanced processing units) for PCs, Sony's PS5, and Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X consoles. Intel even licensed Nvidia's GPU technology for its own integrated graphics chips until that deal expired in early 2017.
That's why Intel finally launched a new generation of Xe discrete GPUs in late 2020 and early 2021. That first batch included its Iris Xe MAX chips for mid-range laptops, as well as other Xe GPUs for desktops and servers. Those chips paved the way for the arrival of its more powerful Arc GPUs, which challenge AMD's Radeon and Nvidia's GeForce in the high-end PC gaming market, in early 2022. Like AMD and Nvidia, Intel outsources the production of those 7 nm GPUs to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
Several recent industry benchmarks reveal that Intel's Arc A380 delivers much better performance than AMD's Radeon RX 6400 across a wide range of games. That's a bright red flag for AMD in the low-end market, since the RX 6400 costs about $10 more than the A380, which retails for around $140. Nvidia's comparable GTX 1630 costs about $200.
How could Intel hurt AMD in the GPU market?
Intel's market share gains wouldn't be too troubling if the entire GPU market were still expanding. But discrete GPU shipments actually plunged 42% year over year to 14 million units in the third quarter of 2022, according to JPR, as the PC market shrank. Therefore, Intel, AMD, and Nvidia are all fighting for a shrinking market.
Intel's return to discrete GPUs also coincides with a cyclical slowdown for AMD. AMD's revenue rose 45% in 2020 and increased another 68% in 2021 as people bought new PCs to work remotely, attended online classes, and played more PC games. Analysts expect its revenue to rise another 43% this year, partly driven by its acquisition of Xilinx in February, but to slow to just 6% growth in 2023 as it laps that purchase and faces a slowdown now that pandemic fears have eased.
Starting in the second quarter of 2022, AMD began reporting its gaming revenue separately from its CPUs and other embedded chips. Its gaming revenue increased 32% year over year in the second quarter, but only grew 14% year over year (and stayed nearly flat sequentially) to $1.6 billion in the third quarter. During both quarters, AMD said its robust sales of its semi-custom APUs for gaming consoles offset its declining sales of gaming GPUs for PCs.
AMD expects that slowdown, which is also weighing down its CPU business, to continue for the foreseeable future. Therefore, Intel's Xe and Arc GPUs could cause even more headaches for AMD's gaming business as the broader PC market sputters out.
But AMD's pain isn't Intel's gain
Intel has seemingly landed a surprising blow against AMD in the GPU market, but that victory doesn't address its core problems of sluggish CPU sales and its inability to manufacture smaller and more power-efficient CPUs than AMD, which also outsources the production of its CPUs to TSMC.
Instead, it merely highlights Intel's hidden dependence on TSMC, its top competitor in the foundry market, and reveals that it can't manufacture superior discrete GPUs through its own foundries yet. AMD might face some fresh headwinds from Intel's discrete GPUs, but investors shouldn't assume those headwinds will generate significant tailwinds for Intel either.

2022-12-26 00:00:00+00:00,5 Sleep-at-Night Microchip Stocks With Growing Passive Income,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-sleep-at-night-microchip-stocks-with-growing-passive-income,,,"It has been a rough year for semiconductor stocks, but all may not be lost. After all, semiconductors power all of today's big technology applications, from artificial intelligence, to the Internet of Things, to the Metaverse and electric vehicles. While somewhat cyclical, semiconductor stocks are usually generally quite profitable, and their stocks are less expensive than the high-flying software sector.
Despite this year's historic slump in PCs, smartphones, and consumer electronics, several top chip stocks have the right products and end-markets to grow through the current downturn, and pay you a rising dividend along the way. Here are five names you don't have to worry about, and can look forward to collecting a rising annual dividend payment year in and year out.
Image source: Getty Images.
The leading edge will still lead the way
First, while overall chip demand may decline in 2023, category leaders will always want their new products to be on the latest and greatest technologies. That's where the two indispensable global companies that enable leading-edge chip production, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (NYSE: TSM) and ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML), should continue to grow through any 2023 downturn. That means investors can probably look forward to another increase for TSMC's 2.4% dividend, as well as a dividend increase for ASML's 1.2% payout.
Although acknowledging the industry headwinds in the first half of 2023, TSMC's management also said on its October conference call, ""We expect our business to be supported by stronger demand for our differentiated and leading advanced and specialty technologies, and for 2023 to be a growth year for TSMC.""
That TSMC will be able to grow next year is certainly impressive, considering the booming growth it's seen over the past two. Last quarter, TSMC recorded 48% revenue growth and 81.5% operating oncome growth. Given a cyclical sector like semiconductors, growing at all after a year like that would be quite the feat.
However, TSMC's process technology lead over all other foundries, which has only grown in recent years, is helping this industry leader defy the gravity of the business cycle. That important technology lead is probably why Warren Buffett bought into the stock earlier this year.
TSMC itself, of course, is dependent on equipment from ASML, which has a monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) needed to make chips with transistors 7 or fewer nanometers apart.
TSMC rivals Samsung and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are also racing to catch up, and DRAM memory production is just now beginning to use EUV, whereas logic and foundry chips started using EUV a few years ago. That means demand for EUV is rising, and that growth curve will continue for years. In fact, demand for EUV is outstripping ASML's capacity to supply it, despite the recessionary economic environment.
On its third-quarter conference call, ASML management noted:
I have to say the lion's share of our customers really [keep] on pushing us in terms of getting the tools and getting them sooner rather than later. There [are] a few customers that are indicating a preference for some delay, but the lion's share of the customers are really pushing and they are raising their hands to say if there is a delay someplace else, then please get the tools to us even earlier.
There is a technical reason ASML should also grow next year. Because of shortages, ASML has been shipping tools to customers before final qualifications. ASML can't recognize revenue of a shipped machine until it is qualified at the customer, which takes longer. So ASML's recognized revenue has been lower than its orders this year; for instance, while ASML recorded only 5.8 billion euros in sales last quarter, its order book came in at 8.92 billion euros. However, that revenue will be recognized next year, which bodes well for growth even if the semiconductor market softens further.
Auto and industrial are still booming
The semiconductor sector may seem confusing to many, as some parts of the market are in drastic oversupply, such as memory and GPUs, whereas other headlines point to a huge ""chip shortage.""
The shortage is mostly on mature node chips that largely fuel automotive and industrial applications. Even if many are downbeat on the auto sector next year, electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles require more semiconductor content than internal combustion engine cars do, and EVs and autonomous applications will make up more and more of the car market with each passing year. The same goes for industrial chips that fuel automation, and given the rise in labor costs amid this year's inflation, industrial automation chips will also remain in high demand no matter what the economic environment.
That's why two dividend semiconductor companies, NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI) and Microchip Technologies (NASDAQ: MCHP), each with outsize exposure to the auto and industrial sectors, may be in better shape.
NXP gets about 50% of its revenue from auto end markets and another 22% of revenue from Internet of Things (IoT) applications, so it's well situated. On its recent third-quarter conference call, management also noted that more than 70% of its products have lead times over 52 weeks, and that it's already sold out for 2023 in those key auto and industrial markets. That seems to mitigate risk in this chip company in 2023, which yields 2.1% and trades at just 15.7 times trailing earnings.
Meanwhile, peer Microchip is also a large player in auto and IoT chips and is also projecting resilient operating results next year. CEO Steve Sanghi noted that the industrial, automotive, aerospace and defense, data center, and communications infrastructure end markets all remain strong, and those end markets make up 86% of Microchip's sales. This is why Microchip was able to grow over 25% last quarter, and why it still believes it will be supply constrained going into 2022. For the current fourth quarter, management's midpoint of guidance pointed to 22.7% year-over-year growth.
Microchip's solid results are even enabling it to invest in capacity increases next year, despite the possibility of recession. Microchip currently yields 1.8% and trades at just 12.3 times next year's earnings estimates.
Communications infrastructure continues to grow at a solid pace
You may have noticed that Microchip identified not only auto and industrial markets but also communications infrastructure as a solid growth area, despite the macroeconomic headwinds. The buildout of edge communications, as well as the expansion of broadband and 5G infrastructure happening next year, helped along by government subsidies, should enable growth for chips focused on this infrastructure buildout, too.
Enter Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), which has been one of the more impressive dividend growers over the past five years. Under CEO Hock Tan's acquisition strategy, in which Broadcom buys semiconductor or software companies and efficiently folds them into its corporate umbrella, free cash flow has doubled over the past four years. Even more impressive, Broadcom's 3.3% dividend has surged as incredible 9.5 times over since 2016 – a 38% annualized growth rate.
Image source: Getty Images.
Not only that, but Broadcom's large exposure to infrastructure and networking chips are keeping management's projections strong for next year. When pressed on the company's outlook on its recent conference call, Tan said:
Infrastructure, by looking at it, comes from hyperscale, in building their data centers and components to their data centers; in service providers, like telcos, where we see our strength in broadband access, gateways and broadband. And I know people are finding hard to imagine, we're seeing it even in enterprise, where we do not -- that's why I made a comment earlier, we do not see across a cross-section of large enterprises a reduction in the IT spending for 2023.
Tan noted that even if the economy slows, companies are still investing in IT to make themselves more efficient. Currently, Broadcom is also trying to buy VMware (NYSE: VMW) in a massive $61 billion deal, which would make the company essentially half software, half semiconductors. But regardless of whether the deal gets approved, Broadcom's history of smart acquisitions, targeting of attractive, recession-resistant markets, and excellent execution should enable further dividend growth even in a down 2023 for the chip sector.
The whole sector has sold off, but these dividend stocks look like bargains
Given the selloff across the semiconductor sector, these stocks have also declined in 2022. Still, the producers of chips exposed to leading-edge, auto and industrial, and communications infrastructure chips appear set for resilient profits through next year. That means their dividend growth should be secure, making their stocks look like bargain-priced gems today.

2022-12-26 00:00:00+00:00,"Where to Invest $5,000 for the Next 5 Years",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-to-invest-%245000-for-the-next-5-years-4,,,"It's tough knowing where to invest right now. The stock market has been in the doldrums all year, and 2023 isn't looking much better. There are serious concerns that the Federal Reserve will push interest rates too high and cause a steep economic downturn.
But if we look past all this uncertainty, we can see a few longer-term growth trends that should remain strong over the coming years. Three of the biggest megatrends are:
Decarbonization: The economy is transitioning to lower-carbon energy sources.
Digitization: Businesses are undergoing digital transformation initiatives to bring more of their business processes online.
Deglobalization: Countries are shifting their supply chains onshore to improve their resilience.
Because of that, companies working to capitalize on these themes should thrive in the coming years. That's why the best place to invest $5,000 (or any other amount) is across these megatrends. Here are five companies aligning their businesses to capitalize on one or more of these themes.
The data infrastructure leader
American Tower (NYSE: AMT) is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts (REITs). The company operates 222,000 communications sites worldwide and over two dozen U.S. data centers.
This infrastructure is crucial for increased digitization. Growing data use from 5G, streaming, cloud computing, and other digitization trends is driving the need for more mobile-communications infrastructure and data centers. According to one estimate, companies must invest $1 trillion over the next five years to upgrade global data infrastructure.
That should enable American Tower to add more tenants to its existing towers and data centers, develop new sites, and continue to acquire locations. These drivers position the REIT to continue growing its cash flow and dividend at above-average rates over the next few years.
The megatrend infrastructure investor
Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) is a global infrastructure investor with operations across the utility, energy midstream, transportation, and data sectors. The company is increasingly focused on investments aligned with the digitization, decarbonization, and deglobalization trends.
Brookfield has built a leading data infrastructure portfolio with towers, fiber optic networks, and data centers. It's also capitalizing on deglobalization by helping semiconductor giant Intel onshore manufacturing capacity by financing the construction of two new plants in the U.S.
On top of that, it's investing in several decarbonization initiatives. The company expects these themes to power organic growth at or above the top end of its 6% to 9% annual target range in the coming years. That should support 5% to 9% annual dividend growth.
Securing the digital transformation
Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) is a global leader in cybersecurity. Network security is becoming increasingly important as more companies digitize their businesses and hybrid work becomes the norm.
Meanwhile, cyberthreats are growing more complex and costly. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, global cybercrime costs will balloon to $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion in 2015. Palo Alto Network built a three-platform strategy to help clients secure their digital transformation. That's leading it to gain market share as customers consolidate their network security with the company's integrated platform and best-of-breed capabilities.
The logistics real estate leader
Prologis (NYSE: PLD) is the global leader in logistics real estate, with 1 billion square feet of space across 19 countries. Demand for warehouse space has skyrocketed since the pandemic, driven by the accelerated adoption of e-commerce and shifting inventory-management practices to improve supply chain resiliency.
These digitization and globalization drivers have the REIT expecting to grow its same-site net operating income at an 8% to 10% annual rate for the next few years as legacy leases expire and are repriced to higher market rates. In addition, the company expects to develop additional warehouse capacity.
According to global commercial real estate company CBRE, the U.S. will need an additional 330 million square feet of distribution space by 2025 to handle the expected growth of e-commerce sales alone.
The clean energy king
NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) is the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy and a global leader in battery storage. It's investing billions of dollars annually to grow its renewable energy capacity and build additional clean energy infrastructure.
These investments have the utility on pace to grow its adjusted earnings per share by as much as 10% per year through 2025. That should support around 10% annual growth in its dividend through 2024. Overall, the company sees upward of $4 trillion in investment opportunities to fully decarbonize the U.S. economy over the next 30 years.
Positioned to prosper
Over the coming years, companies will invest trillions of dollars in digitizing, decarbonizing, and deglobalizing their operations. That will benefit the companies focused on capitalizing on these megatrends, like American Tower, Brookfield Infrastructure, Palo Alto Networks, Prologis, and NextEra Energy. Because of that, investors could do very well by investing $5,000 across those five stocks over the next five years.

2022-12-23 00:00:00+00:00,How AI is Delivering the Next Evolution of Agriculture,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-ai-is-delivering-the-next-evolution-of-agriculture,,,"T
homas Malthus’ predictions that population growth would outstrip food production may now be widely disproved, but with the world’s population rising and questions about sustainability looming, it’s a prudent time to rethink and tweak agriculture. Some estimates suggest we’ll need to feed around 10 billion people by 2050
Phrases like fintech and biotech have practically become household names for many, but agri-tech has remained largely off the radar. That may be changing, with various agriculture innovations springing up over the last couple of years.
Introducing AI and agriculture 
Agriculture has traditionally involved a high number of manual and repetitive tasks to ensure that crops grow healthily, in good conditions, and according to the yields expected. On the scale of huge farms growing large amounts of crops, this can result in the need for significant time and money investments. Yet artificial intelligence may be stepping in to save the day. Thanks to a combination of sensors, machine learning algorithms, robots, and other developments, AI promises to help with all of the following:
Pest and weed control 
Crop yield predictions and optimization
Insights about weather conditions to overcome seasonal issues 
Fertilization 
Monitoring of soil and crops 
Quality control
This becomes even more powerful when combined with other technological developments. For instance, if a sensor identifies weeds growing that could be a threat, the use of IoT and cloud technology could instantly send a notification to the device of farm owners or managers to ensure they can take action promptly.
All this can help produce greater amounts food more efficiently, with the potential for significant revenue for market leaders. Let’s take a look at some of the most exciting innovations and the companies getting involved.
IBM regenerative agriculture
Technology giant IBM (IBM) has launched IBM Regenerative Agriculture, which uses AI, data analytics, and predictive insights with IoT agricultural data to make decisions about crops. This improves quality crop output (e.g., increasing proteins in crops) and can also help with profitability and sustainability. For instance, IoT can help a farm adapt to the climate by offering weather data and making recommendations or warnings for the future.
The solutions also automate data sharing between stakeholders involved in the production process, from governments creating agricultural policies to insurance agents needing data for their claims processing. This helps everyone to make better decisions, and the specific solutions can be tailored based on a client’s needs.
Microsoft
Microsoft (MSFT) Research is working on Project FarmVibes, which aims to find high-quality solutions and tools to foster sustainable agriculture. 
So far, this includes a range of technologies, such as:
FarmVibes.Connect — takes data from drones, sensors, and equipment 
FarmVibes.Edge — processes this data 
FarmVibes.AI — takes the data and analyzes it
FarmVibes.Bot — communicates with farmers so they can receive instant answers about what’s happening with their crops.
As you can see, these tools work hand-in-hand and make a formidable combination. Although this is currently in the research and development phase, it shows that Microsoft may head further down this route in the future.
Intel
Intel (INTC) Labs and National Science Foundation (NSF) joined together to invest in various AI programs. The partners invested $220 million in various AI institutes, and one of the relevant research areas was AI-Driven Innovation in Agriculture and Food System (focused on improving food supply chains).
Intel also has its own Intel Geti platform, which enables teams to easily build computer vision models. In other words, users can upload inputs like images and train AI to make predictions or apply labels/concepts based on its instructions. This is suitable for various agriculture applications — for instance, you can teach Geti to count only ripe fruits and use that to predict yields.
Plus, it allows professionals to collaborate more easily since they can all access the information in one place.
Others
Although major corporations are often a good bet when investing in new technologies, some private companies are making headway in this space too. SAS Institute specializes in data software and has developed agriculture analytics, which can count yields from drones, prioritize integrated pest management strategies, and more. It prides itself on helping clients to understand what its algorithms are doing.
Then there’s V7 Labs, which already has a data platform for agriculture that it is offering clients. It has capabilities such as livestock health monitoring, grading crops, and detecting diseases — and the team may be able to tailor certain functionalities. Plus, teams can collaborate in real-time, have their own Customer Success Manager for more support, and integrate the solution with their workflow using an API.
What will the future yield?
As the global population continues to grow and questions about sustainability become more pressing, it is becoming increasingly important to adopt technological solutions like AI to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the agriculture industry. With both tech giants like IBM and newer companies such as V7 Labs getting involved, agri-tech is a space all investors should have on their radars.

2022-12-23 00:00:00+00:00,Is Micron Stock a Buy Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-micron-stock-a-buy-now,,,"Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) posted a disappointing earnings report on Dec. 21. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which ended on Dec. 1, the memory chipmaker's revenue plunged 47% year over year to $4.09 billion and missed analysts' estimates by $50 million. Its adjusted net loss of $39 million, which fell from a net profit of $1.62 billion a year ago, trickled down to a net loss of $0.04 per share, and also missed the consensus forecast by two cents.
Micron had already warned investors of a grueling cyclical downturn during its fourth-quarter report in late September, but it still failed to clear Wall Street's low bar. This also represented Micron's second consecutive quarter of declining revenue -- which ended a nine-quarter streak of rising revenues from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2022 -- and it expects that downturn to continue with a 49%-54% year-over-year decline in revenue in the second quarter.

Micron's stock dipped slightly following that report, and it remains nearly 50% below its all-time high of $96.83 per share in January. Should investors buy shares of Micron as its cyclical downturn drives away the bulls?
How bad was Micron's slowdown?
Micron is one of the world's leading manufacturers of DRAM and NAND (flash memory) chips. During the first quarter, it generated 69% of its revenue from DRAM chips and another 27% of its revenue from NAND chips. The remaining 4% came from other types of memory chips.
Micron's last growth cycle kicked off in the second half of fiscal 2020, driven by the arrival of new 5G devices, an acceleration in PC sales as more people worked from home during the pandemic, and data center upgrades to deal with the rising usage of cloud-based services. But as the following table illustrates, the memory market stalled out over the past year.

Data source: Micron. YOY = Year over year. *Non-GAAP.
Micron's growth sputtered out as the lockdown measures ended, sales of PCs and 5G devices cooled off, and the macroeconomic headwinds throttled enterprise spending on big cloud upgrades. The unpredictable COVID-19 lockdowns in China also exacerbated that pressure. It expects its non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) gross margin to slip to 2.5%-8.5% in the second quarter as that slowdown intensifies.
How long will this downturn last?
During the conference call, Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the memory chip market was ""experiencing the most severe imbalance between supply and demand in both DRAM and NAND in the last 13 years."" However, Mehrotra expects most of Micron's customers to reduce their inventories to ""relatively healthy levels by mid-calendar 2023,"" and that its second-half revenue will ""improve versus the first half of our fiscal year"" as the market's supply-demand balance is gradually restored.
But even if the market stabilizes in terms of revenue and bit growth, Mehrotra expects its ""profitability to remain challenged through calendar 2023"" as the cyclical downturn continues. To counter that pressure in fiscal 2023, Micron will lay off about 10% of its workforce, reduce its capex by roughly 40% year over year, and rein in its other operating expenses.
Micron didn't provide any precise guidance for fiscal 2023, but analysts expect its revenue to decline 42% this year with a net loss. For fiscal 2024, which will start in September 2023, they expect its revenue to rise 40% with a full-year profit. We should take those estimates with a grain of salt since a recession could easily prolong the pain, but Micron has withstood plenty of cyclical downturns throughout its 44-year history. Micron still manufactures denser and more power-efficient chips than its larger South Korean rivals Samsung and SK Hynix, so investors don't have to worry too much about direct competition.
If you believe Micron can ride out the near-term headwinds, it might look like a compelling buy right now at just 3 times this year's sales. But it's also easy to find even cheaper chipmakers in this bear market: Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which is in the process of selling its NAND business to SK Hynix, trades at less than 2 times this year's sales, while Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC), which competes against Micron in the NAND market, trades at less than 1 times this year's sales.
Is it the right time to buy Micron?
Micron is a well-run chipmaker that will profit from the long-term expansion of the DRAM and NAND markets. But its stock won't rally anytime soon, and it could decline even further in this difficult market for slower-growth tech companies. So for now I'd avoid Micron and stick with more balanced and well-diversified chipmakers until more green shoots appear.

2022-12-23 00:00:00+00:00,The Math Shows SPYD Can Go To $43,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-math-shows-spyd-can-go-to-%2443,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (Symbol: SPYD), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $43.20 per unit.
With SPYD trading at a recent price near $39.26 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.03% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SPYD's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC), VICI Properties Inc (Symbol: VICI), and LyondellBasell Industries NV (Symbol: LYB). Although INTC has traded at a recent price of $25.97/share, the average analyst target is 23.60% higher at $32.10/share. Similarly, VICI has 13.87% upside from the recent share price of $32.21 if the average analyst target price of $36.68/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting LYB to reach a target price of $92.16/share, which is 13.10% above the recent price of $81.48. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of INTC, VICI, and LYB:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF SPYD $39.26 $43.20 10.03%
Intel Corp INTC $25.97 $32.10 23.60%
VICI Properties Inc VICI $32.21 $36.68 13.87%
LyondellBasell Industries NV LYB $81.48 $92.16 13.10%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.
