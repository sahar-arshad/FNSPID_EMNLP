Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Ashish. And good afternoon, everyone. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Marvell team drove another record level of revenue at $1.45 billion, exceeding the midpoint of guidance, growing 8% sequentially and 74% year over year. We saw continued strength in bookings in all our data infrastructure end markets.
Higher revenue achievement was primarily driven by our datacenter market with additional strength from carrier infrastructure and automotive results both of which were also above forecast. Due to supply chain-related impacts, results from our enterprise networking market were below our guidance. However, growth was still very strong with revenue growing a robust 64% year over year and 9% sequentially. The Marvell operations team did a great job in navigating a tight supply environment that was further compounded by COVID-related manufacturing challenges at our suppliers in certain geographies.
Our team's efforts were a key enabler of our first quarter revenue, exceeding the midpoint of our forecast. We continue to make progress in securing additional capacity with our strategic partners to enable sustained revenue growth. Let me now move on to discussing our five end markets, starting with datacenter. In our datacenter end market, revenue for the first quarter was $640.5 million.
Leading our guidance, having grown 12% sequentially and 131% year over year. Strong performance was broad-based with multiple product lines contributing to excellent results. Cloud continues to be a source of Marvell's strength in the datacenter. We are enabling our hyperscale customers to add new use cases, bringing the benefits of AI and machine learning to businesses, increased process automation and productivity and drive deeper relationships with their customers.
Let me now discuss a number of Marvell product cycles driving strong growth in cloud, starting with electro optics. We are seeing strong demand for our PAM solutions inside datacenters and ZR pluggables between data centers. Inside cloud datacenters, lead Tier 1 customers are currently driving volume deployment of our PAM-based 200-gig and 400-gig solutions. The rest of the market has plans for starting deployments later this year and next year.
As bandwidth requirements continue to grow, we expect the role of PAM-based electro optics to expand, replacing legacy solutions and as a result, to grow our opportunity. We believe that the next generation of more powerful server CPUs will accelerate the need for PAM technology. In addition to this expansion, we are also increasing our content per module with our next generation of higher-speed solutions that we are now starting to ship. Driven by the growth in AI deployments, our first quarter results benefited from a ramp in volume shipments of our 800-gig PAM solutions at two large customers.
The bandwidth expansion inside datacenters is also driving a significant increase in connectivity between datacenters, creating a growing opportunity for our 400 ZR pluggable optics. Team is achieving great success by driving the adoption of these solutions at multiple customers, and we are projecting strong revenue growth from these products. Moving on to compute. Our cloud optimized design win momentum continued in the first quarter, and we won a custom SmartNIC at a hyperscale customer.
We are seeing more adoption of VPU-based architectures inside data centers, a trend that we are ideally positioned to address with our OCTEON platform, which is now in its tenth generation. This design win is one more example of the growing demand for cloud-optimized silicon, which we see as the largest incremental growth opportunity for Marvell inside datacenters. We are confident that we are uniquely positioned to win these opportunities with our leading portfolio of compute, networking, security, storage and high-speed electro-optics IT delivered on our five-nanometer platform. Moving on to storage within the cloud.
In the first quarter, cloud demand for high-capacity storage continued to increase, driving solid growth for our nearline HDD controllers and preamplifiers. Our SSD controllers also contributed to strong year-over-year revenue growth. We are now reaping the benefits from our datacenter SSD business, which we built from the ground up starting in 2016. We increased investment in critical IP development, accelerated our process technology cadence, and quadrupled our firmware team.
Working closely with the leading cloud companies, we optimized our SSD controllers to address their quality of service and security requirements. We developed state-of-the-art error correction for the most advanced NAND flash technologies coupled them with our in-house low-power fives, and accelerated our PCIe roadmap. All the leading SSD devices today are shipping PCIe Gen 4 solutions, Marvell has already won Gen 5 data center sockets at three key NAND OEMs. Additionally, we started investing in PCIe Gen 6 in 2019.
This development, coupled with our five-nanometer technology platform has enabled us to win a key NAND OEM for their Gen 6 SSDs. Our datacenter storage business has been built on a long and sustained period of technology investment, deep system knowledge, extensive customer relationships, and very sticky custom firmware delivered on our advanced process technology platform. We expect our position to continue to strengthen based on our proven technology platform and multiple secured design wins in the next generation of datacenter SSDs. We anticipate that the next big evolution in cloud datacenters will be the adoption of CXL or Compute XpressLink, an industry standard for connecting processors, accelerators in memory, and we are planning to enable that trend.
Last week, we held a tech talk in which we explained the fundamentals of CXL technology in its role in bringing new levels of performance to next-generation cloud datacenters. If you're unable to attend, I would encourage you to watch the recording posted in the investor relations section of our website. We described how silicon components based on CXL will facilitate new cloud architectures by addressing the multiple memory scaling challenges in current data centers. Put simply, CXL will finally allow DRAM memory to escape the constraints of being tied down to a single compute device such as a CPU and become a shared and pulled resource, utilizing the well-established PCIe fabric as the interconnect.
Marvell is uniquely positioned to address the CXL opportunity, given our deep relationships with memory OEMs, our growing position within hyperscale customers and our advanced PCIe roadmap. We recently bolstered our efforts in this area with the acquisition of Tanzanite, a leading developer of advanced CXL technologies. Their complementary IP and world-class team adds more resources to Marvell, accelerating our CXL road map to address opportunities in closed design wins, which are right in front of us at multiple customers. We see opportunities for a host of new products, including CXL expanders, cooling devices, switches and accelerators.
In addition, we see the potential to embed CXL IP in a broad range of our datacenter products, including ASICs, custom compute engines, DPUs, electro optics, retimers, SmartNICs, and SSD controllers. We see a multibillion-dollar PAM expansion opportunity driven by CXL overtime, and I look forward to updating you on our progress. Moving on to our expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from our datacenter end market, we are projecting continued growth to layer on top of the strong first quarter results. We project our data center revenue in the second quarter to grow sequentially in the low-single digits on a percentage basis and year over year grew approximately 50%.
We expect revenue from cloud to grow significantly faster than the on-premise market, both sequentially and year over year in the second quarter. As we progress into the second half of this fiscal year and beyond, we are looking forward to additional incremental contributions from our cloud Ethernet switches and to ramping our large set of cloud optimized custom design wins. Marvell's unique ability to offer all the critical datacenter IP under one roof, designed to work seamlessly together in a custom solution is proving very attractive to customers. As a result, our engagements with hyperscalers have moved well beyond pure ASIC programs to include various combinations of Marvell IP delivered in solutions tailored to each cloud's unique requirements.
Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the first quarter was $252 million, above our forecast, growing 5% sequentially and 50% year over year. We previously reported a substantial -- sequential step-up of over 30% in our 5G business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. From this strong base, it was great to see both sequential and year-over-year revenue growth for carrier continue in the first quarter.
The growth in 5G deployment, combined with Marvell product ramps, at multiple base station customers continue to fuel strong growth in this end market. In wired, we are seeing strong demand for our 400-gig coherent electro-optics portfolio driven by rapid adoption in the metro and long-haul carrier markets. Coherent technology is critical to enabling high-speed data transmission across long distances to meet the ever-increasing demand for bandwidth from operators. Earlier this week, we announced that we have shipped over 100,000 400-gig coherent DSPs, positioning us as the leading merchant provider of these products.
We are also aggressively focused on developing and launching our next generation of coherent products. This is a very key piece from the Inphi acquisition as the same technology powers the 400 ZR DCI cloud market you heard about earlier. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect revenue from the overall carrier end market to grow in the high-single digits sequentially on a percentage basis, while year-over-year growth is expected to remain strong at approximately 40%. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market.
Revenue for the first quarter was $286.6 million, growing 9% sequentially and 64% year over year as demand remains strong in this end market. While this end market represents our highest delinquency relative to the size of the business, we remain strongly focused on improving our ability to supply more products to our enterprise networking customers to help them meet their growing demand. Our growth has been driven by share gains and our increase in content starting to materialize as our customers began shipping their new platforms to address enterprise network modernization. We have seen a large increase in the adoption of our multi-gigabit fives, which have a significantly higher selling price compared to our gigabit products.
We expect the penetration of multi-gigabit ports will continue to increase a tailwind to our business. Our strong growth in enterprise networking is primarily the result of our own unique product cycles. Looking beyond this quarter, we expect growth to continue leveraging our refresh switch and PHY portfolio and incremental revenue from the ramp of custom silicon and our OCTEON ARM-based DPUs displacing alternative architectures. The second quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect a continuation of strong demand for our products from the enterprise networking end market and further improvements in supply.
As a result, we are projecting revenue to be up sequentially in the mid-teens on a percentage basis and year-over-year growth of approximately 45%. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue for the first quarter was $89.3 million, growing 12% sequentially and 94% year over year. All of the sequential growth came from our automotive business, which drove over 50% of the total revenue from this end market.
Although we are still unable to fully satisfy the growing demand for our Brightlane Auto Ethernet solutions, the results supported by incrementally better supply solutions exceeded our guidance. Our auto revenue growth is being driven primarily by our new product cycles. The adoption of Marvell Ethernet technology in cars is continuing to increase, as OEMs design in higher-speed solutions to address the increase in bandwidth, our dollar content per car is continuing to grow. We are also winning new customers and growing our content at existing customers.
We now have Ethernet design wins at eight of the 10 largest auto OEMs worldwide and 36 OEMs in total. Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 for the combined auto and industrial end market, we are projecting sequential revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis, while year-over-year growth is expected to be over 60%. We expect strong growth to continue from our automotive business with revenue projected to more than double year over year. Moving on to our consumer end market.
Revenue for the first quarter was $178.5 million, growing 7% year over year. The growth in this end market is being driven by our SSD controllers, partially offset by declines in our PC HDD business. On a sequential basis, revenue declined by 4% in our consumer end market, below our forecast for a flattish outlook due to a reduction in demand from the PC HDD market. While we are not the bellwether of global PC demand as it represents a relatively small amount of our revenue, we did see a rapid change in tone from the PC market, and we expect the weakness to continue.
From our perspective, the shift from HDDs to SSDs in the notebook PC market is almost complete, and our revenue from notebook HDDs in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was less than 1% of consolidated Marvell revenue. Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and our consumer end market, we expect revenue to sequentially decline in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis and be flattish year over year. In closing, we delivered record results for the first quarter and are guiding for continued strong growth in the second quarter. We are seeing robust demand for our products, and our design win momentum remains strong.
With 88% of our revenue coming from beta infrastructure, we are confident that Marvell's favorable end market exposure makes us one of the best positioned semiconductor companies to benefit from strong secular growth trends. In the second quarter, at the midpoint of the range, we are guiding our revenue to grow by 41% year over year, which is almost entirely an organic comparison. We expect a strong operating leverage in our business model to drive non-GAAP EPS at the midpoint of guidance to grow by 65% year over year, significantly faster than our projected growth in revenue. As you heard throughout this call, our unique product cycles have been a big part of our above-market revenue growth.
As we look into the second half of this year and beyond, we are confident that our unique growth drivers in our cloud, 5G, auto and enterprise networking end markets, and our strong track record of execution through economic cycles will continue to be a source of strength. You'll remember from our prior calls and our investor day presentation that we have already won a significant number of design wins, which we are projecting will add a substantial amount of incremental revenue to Marvell going forward. While the external environment is challenging, Marvell's business continues to be strong, including strong bookings in our core data infrastructure end markets. As we move forward, we intend to continue to act as we always have, be diligent about changes, react promptly and manage our business and costs aggressively.
On behalf of Marvell's leadership team, I thank our employees for their dedication in driving stellar results. Our employees are the backbone of the company, and we are excited that Marvell recently ranked third overall on the list of Best Places to Work in the Bay Area by the San Francisco Business Times and Silicon Valley Business Journal. Even this award is so special because it is the employees who decide the winners. We have an outstanding team, and this award reflects our culture, values and dedication to creating a collaborative workplace which fosters creativity and innovation.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the first quarter and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.447 billion, exceeding the middle point of our guidance, growing 8% sequentially and 74% year over year. Datacenter was our largest end market driving 44% of consolidated revenue.
Enterprise networking was next largest to be 20% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 18%. Consumer added 12% and the auto industrial at 6%. GAAP gross margin was 51.9%. Non-GAAP gross profit was $947 million or 65.5% of revenue, another record driven by rich product mix.
GAAP operating expenses were $681 million and include the cost of share-based compensation expenses. Amortization of acquired intangible assets, legal segment and acquisition, and divestiture-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $435 million reflecting the increase in R&D headcount and project expenses to execute design wins across all our data infrastructure end market. As we outlined at our investor day last year, we plan to continue to invest in R&D, given the tremendous opportunities we have in front of us, while keeping opex growth well below top line revenue growth to drive to our long-term target model.
GAAP operating income was $70 million, we achieved record non-GAAP operating profit of $512 million, up 123% from a year ago, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.4%. During the first quarter, our GAAP income tax expense was $205 million. This included the impact from a onetime non-cash tax charge of $240 million offset by other tax benefits in the quarter. The $240 million non-cash tax charge was due to the measurement of our net deferred tax asset as a result for obtaining and expansion of a lower foreign restriction tax incentives.
For the first quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.20. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.52, up 79% year over year, exceeding the middle point of our guidance. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $195 million as we increased our working capital investment to support the top line revenue growth in a very tight supply chain environment.
The increase in working capital was primarily driven by increase in inventory, especially raw materials and work in progress help us manage it through ongoing supply chain disruption. We also made $86 million in payments during the quarter to secure long-term capacity with our suppliers. As of the end of the first fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $465 million, and our long-term debt was $4.5 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times, and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was two times.
We returned $66 million to million in cash dividends and $15 million to share repurchase during the first quarter. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023 over the first three weeks of the second quarter, we repurchased additional $50 million of our shares through our 10b-5 program. We are pleased that we have restarted the share repurchase program as we believe it's in the best interest of the company and our long-term shareholders. In summary, the Marvell team executed exceptionally well delivering accelerated top-line revenue growth and strong earnings expansion significantly faster than revenue growth.
Turning to our guidance. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect the following results: revenue in the range of $1.515 billion plus or minus 3%. GAAP gross margin in the range of 49.6% to 51.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 65% to 65.5%.
GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $669 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $435 million, which assumes that we will complete the acquisition of in the second quarter. For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP tax rate of 6%. We expect our basic weighted average share outstanding will be 853 million, and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 862 million.
As a result, we expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.02 to $0.10. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.53 to $0.59. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. Our first question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. And congrats on the strong execution. Matt, I was hoping you could speak to your expectations for the second half, both from a demand perspective and a supply perspective.
I think last quarter, there was a little bit of confusion as it pertains to the full year outlook. So if you can kind of confirm how you're thinking about your overall business, but particularly datacenter into the second half, that would be super helpful. And then again, if you have the supply to support the strong outlook. Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Thanks, Toshiya. Great to hear from you. Yes, so we're pleased with the results and execution in Q2.
And -- I'm sorry, in Q1. And as you saw, we had a very strong quarter in datacenter, which I'll come back to in a minute. But just to kind of reframe from the demand side in all of our end markets, except consumer, we see very strong demand trends, Toshiya. Bookings have been very strong in the last two quarters.
Demand -- our demand outlook for the year continues to be strong. And with respect to datacenter specifically, we did have a strong Q1 better than expected. We still have pent-up demand and lack of supply there for the second quarter, but we expect actually a reacceleration in the datacenter in terms of our growth in Q3 and Q4, i.e., the second half. And on top of that, we have incremental new design wins that we've secured over the last 12 to 18 months, which we've sized roughly at, call it, $400 million incremental next year and $800 million the year after.
That's actually going to start layering in as well in the second half. So from our perspective, ex-consumer demand continues to be very strong. Datacenter in particular is going to have a great first half and a great second half. And then relative to supply, we really, first of all, credit to our operations team doing a great job in the first quarter, navigating all of the different impacts going on, in particular, in China and delivering a strong quarter.
Looking forward, we're starting to see the benefit of all the investment we put in over the last year into our supply chain. Whether that be the improvement in systems and tools, the relationships and the capacity that we've secured. And so we believe that, that's going to continue. And we do see a much improved supply outlook not only in the short term, as you can see from our results, both beating in our Q1 and then guiding strongly for Q2, but also in the second half, Toshiya.
And again, I think that's the result of a lot of hard work and transformation in our supply chain to meet our growth plans. So in summary, we have very strong demand driven by datacenter but also in 5G and automotive and the other things we've talked about and we've seen real improvements in our visibility into the supply we're going to get to go meet that customer demand.
Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Great. Thanks for all the details.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes.
Operator
The next question is from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the enterprise networking business. And I guess it came in a little below your expectations, but yet you're still speaking about supply constraints in that area.
Is that a situation where your customers are supply constrained elsewhere and you're waiting for them? Maybe just give some explanation of the dynamics in that part of the business.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Thanks, Chris. Yes, this was definitely a quarter where the mix wasn't exactly where we thought it was going to be from when we guided. As you could see, we overachieved in datacenter, and we underachieved on enterprise.
But as I pointed out in my comments, the delinquency and kind of the unfulfilled backlog relative to the size of the business is actually still the highest in enterprise. So this was really a case of just us being unable to execute our supply plan for the quarter nothing to do with demand. In fact, the demand from our enterprise customers continues to be very robust looking into the second quarter and throughout the year. So it was nothing to do with them.
They want more of our product. And you can see somewhat of a catch-up in Q2 with a very strong guide sequentially into the second quarter. But we see that continuing, Chris. So I know there's been a lot of noise out there around enterprise.
But from our perspective and talking to our customers, demand remains very strong. And in fact, we're behind in terms of our supply to catch up. But I think consistent with what Toshi was asking, we are looking to improve that in the second quarter and also through the second half.

The next question is from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Gary Mobley -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Hey, thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the good results. Wanted to ask about the supply situation and you just articulated improving supply coming online for the balance of the year. To what extent is that being driven by you perhaps giving your foundry partners a better forecast? How much of it is being driven by maybe you growing some more money their way in prepayments? And to what extent is it being influenced by some shifting of fungible capacity as the semiconductor market is no longer universally strong.
So maybe you're benefiting for redistribution of supply?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Excellent question. And I think there's probably a piece of all of that. I think when I look back over what we've accomplished, one is we had to do a fairly significant education process across the supply chain of Marvell's prospects, how all the different pieces have come together from the different M&A we've done, our end market focus, etc.
And so I think we did a good job of that of getting the broader supply chain ecosystem to understand the Marvell opportunity. And so, to a large extent, they're betting on us and they're supporting our growth. And you can see that, right, just in terms of the year-over-year growth we're achieving, which by the way, is off of a pretty strong year we had last year. So that's clearly a factor.
We have also signed agreements relative to securing capacity. And you can see some of those that have shown up in our Q or 8-Ks we've issued partnerships we've entered into. So some of that has been down payments and supply agreements to ensure that we have the right capacity. I think that's some part of it.
And then it's hard to say, but on the last part of it, the sort of fungibility that may be coming into play a little bit, but it's too early to say. And quite frankly, the supply we're seeing today is we can really mostly attribute that to sort of our own effort. I will say, and just to be very clear for everybody on the call, we're not out of the woods here. Our unfulfilled backlog has continued to grow each quarter.
We're definitely working that down. We're focused very much on the end demand and shipping to the right people. And we feel like we've done a good job of that in terms of keeping our customers' lines moving and not causing impacts and being very agile. But I think to the extent that on that third point, the fungibility side, if there were to be a true reduction or capitulation, let's call it, the PC and consumer end market and not needing all the supply they've consumed, that certainly could be an incremental thing we could look at in the second half.
But that -- that's not quite there yet, but maybe some of it is. We do see pockets of things opening up, but it's really hard when you sort of drill into it where it exactly came from. Hope that's helpful. Kind of a combination that you sort of nailed it comes of the mid.

The next question is from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks. Matt, I have just a broad question kind of on demand signals. To some degree, because supply has been so tight, it does create the potential that some of the orders, and I'm not saying for you, but I'm just saying broadly, are being placed just to secure their spot in line and not really backed by underlying sell-through at the customer or even the customer's customer level.
And it sort of creates the risk that the chip companies are going to see more of a delay in sort of the demand signals at this time. I think it's less of a risk for you. But I guess my question is, how do you assess that as a risk? And really, the question, I guess, is on the tenor of your discussions with your customers? Do you get the sense that there are some examples of customers placing bookings just to get in the queue because you have such long lead times? I asked because some of the big large cloud customers are beginning to slow some of their hiring, things like that. So I'm just wondering what the tenor is of your talks with them.
Thanks.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Tim. Yes. No, it's not unlike other cycles, where certainly the phenomena you point out, and this is the investor concern, right, more broadly in semis is have customers over-indexed on their order placements. And what happens when demand stops or slows down.
So we've taken this very seriously. I mean I just did a pretty much half a day review in the last few weeks with my entire team going through each of our product lines, going through to the customers and really kind of working through at an individual level where we still see the demand? Do we see any inventory building up? If so, what does it look like in that type of an exercise? And what I can tell you is there's no real examples I could point to, Tim, or anything thematic. I guess in some ways, we may have the benefit that we've been somewhat behind although I think we've done a good job of keeping everybody's lines moving. But certainly, we haven't been the company that's been swimming in capacity.
So I think as we look out now, especially where the kind of global economy is beginning to moderate. We're able to kind of take a look now and do a refresh, especially with our improved supply situation and really make sure we're allocating it to the right people. So it's a very active process, Tim, but I can't give you any nuggets of specific examples where I think thematically inventory may be building. But I guess I would conclude by saying we did -- we were pretty transparent in the prepared remarks about what we saw in the consumer segment, which albeit it's 12% of the business.
And of that, a smaller portion of it is really exposed to what I would call kind of true consumer like PCs and things like that, but that did very much slow down. There definitely was a change in demand. And as a result, some supply that had there some inventory that had built up but we've got other moving pieces even with consumer that's sort of offsetting it. So a long way of answering it.
I don't have any great examples, but we're on it. We're watching it. But I'd say the bulk of the meeting, to be honest, when I had it was the demand signals being very strong, right, across the cloud companies across our 5G business, enterprise wired. There's a lot of great opportunities for us.
And a lot of this, Tim, is driven on Marvell's product cycles. It's not necessarily an end market phenomena we're dealing with here. It's really the new product ramps that you're very aware of across these different segments, and those seem very much intact in aggregate.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Thanks, Matt. Yes, I mean, I think in the continuum of companies that have risk, you're at the kind of bottom of the list. But thanks for the questions or the answers. Thanks.

The next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to clarify, Matt, if you have seen already or are baking in any supply or demand effects of the China lockdown or Europe turmoil. But my bigger question is, how do we conceptually align this notion of rising delinquency or unmet demand with rising inventory at both on semiconductor company balance sheet and even at some of the large networking OEMs, at what point does this rising inventory across the supply chain start to become a concern?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Great. Thanks, Vivek. Yes. On the first question, again, we're -- as you know, based on the timing of our reporting, we're like everybody else who's going right now.
We had the month of April to comprehend in there relative to the China lockdown. And we navigated it really well. I think one of the reasons for us is that when COVID first happened, when the pandemic first began and there was major lockdowns everywhere China, including and also Southeast Asia, our operations team did a really good job of building up supply chain redundancy and resiliency over the last two years. So effectively dual sourced almost everything we can coming in and out of China and even some of the other regions over there.
So there was some impact. There was a little bit of product revenue where could we have gotten supply out of China, we could have fulfilled it, but it was very small, Vivek, to be honest with you. So we're able to be fairly agile in terms of moving things around. So that was a positive.
On the war in Ukraine and the impact on kind of in the again, I think you're hearing the data points, right? We don't see it directly, but certainly on the slowdown in the consumer segment, people's budgets being pinched, things like that. I think that's part of the issue with some of the consumer end market commentary. Again, we're not really in there. And we don't have operations in Ukraine or Russia.
So we didn't really have any impact on that. So I think we're OK there. On the commentary on rising inventory, look, I'm very aware of this. You can pull everybody's Qs out and look at -- and one simple thing we do is look and OEM companies' inventory growth.
And you can see across a wide range of companies and industries, growth in inventory far exceeding revenue growth. So that is something we're paying attention to. We're using that to dive in deep with our customers. But I would say that our view tends to be like a lot of our customers, which is the end demand, especially in enterprise, in cloud and in our product cycle in 5G, the demand looks pretty strong.
But there is -- there are missing pieces. There is the golden screw issue for sure that some of our customers have. We're just trying not to be the golden screw and also be very kind of clear eyed about where the inventory is and what does that mean for Marvell. And so I can tell you is we're digging into it at a part level detail and making sure that we're being prudent about where we allocate the supply.
But it is something we got to keep watching for sure.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. And to add to what Matt said is we actually chose to increase our inventory to support the revenue growth in the second half. We have a very broad set of product lines, and we see strong demand. So the flexibility we need to have raw materials and the way to support the revenue growth is really critical.
So we did choose that to make sure we can support the customers and the future revenue growth.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Do you have a target, Jean, on days of inventory?
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
The current level is what we are comfortable. We think we can help and manage the supplies for the second half. I think if the environment is normalized, we definitely will have a lower inventory like 120 days. That's what we think we should keep.
But right now, we definitely chose to increase it to provide more flexibility.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks very much.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Vivek, just to chime in on Jean's comments, I fully agree. If you look at just the steepness of the revenue ramp we're dealing with. Clearly, the WIP has to go up, right, just to sort of support the growth.
So that part we're comfortable with. And given the given the lockdowns and all the volatility, I think having that extra inventory carry for us is very prudent. And we watch it, and we'll certainly work it down. But I don't think you're going to see many companies go back to the good old days of 80 days or something like that, unless they truly get into trouble.
I just think for a while, we're all going to have to be mindful that there's a lot of volatility in the world. But we're sort of in the range now, and we're very conscious in terms of what we're doing here.

The next question is from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Matt Ramsay -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Matt, in part of your script, you had talked about the upcoming server launches that include a couple of new technologies, right, and then some CXL support for shared memory.
And I think you guys have done a great job of articulating what that might mean for your Accelerator business and given us some outlook there. I was curious if you might explain a little bit about what PCIe 5 might drive for support of that technology into the storage and network peripherals. Is that material to the growth in the back half? And how much visibility do you have there? Just -- and then just a quick follow-up, question I get all the time is visibility on cloud capex. If you guys look out in your cloud business, is it quarters, years? Like how long are we talking that you feel like you have visibility because there's definitely some concerns there.
I appreciate it. Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Matt. Good to hear from you, and good questions. Yes, I think you did nail it on one of the more important aspects of the upcoming CPU cycles is the IO, right, and the release of PCIe Gen 5 and we've certainly been preparing for that. That is a key part of the equation for us, particularly, as you can imagine, in our storage business and our datacenter storage business, which One of the key things we have to align to on our product roadmap is obviously nailing the PCIe IO road map, and it's not a trivial thing, not only the controller, but obviously the PHY and getting everything qualified and working.
And so our team has done a great job there. We're very well positioned in storage on PCIe Gen 5 actually said in my remarks, we've already got wins lined up on Gen 6. That's still a ways out, but that's going to be another leg of growth. And you're right, the PCIe standard is really going to be the fabric and the interconnect that CXL runs on top of.
And so a lot of the effort we put in on both Gen 5 and in the future, Gen 6 is going to give us tremendous leverage as we think about disaggregation, particularly of memory and these different solutions that are going to emerge around CXL. So it's very strategic. We do -- we always make make-or-buy decisions on things in terms of make versus buy, sorry, on technologies, but this is one, particularly on the PHY layer for PCIe that we've -- we do ourselves, and we have -- we're best-in-class in what we do here, and then we leverage that into our larger SOCs. So -- but I think the biggest impact from Marvell will be just driving broader adoption of our data center flash controllers, which again, are well positioned across a number of NAND OEMs.
And products defined directly with the cloud OEMs going back several years, right, to get all this lined up. So it's going to be a good cycle for us. And then sorry, on cloud capex, I don't have any insight. I -- we certainly look at all the publicly available data.
The most recent update certainly looked promising. But I would say for Marvell, Matt, and for the rest of the investors on the call, we're -- of course, the overall capex environment in cloud can certainly be a tailwind and that could be a headwind for anybody that supplies into there. But -- you got to remember, most of our revenue coming from the cloud is really in new product cycles that are very Marvell-specific in some cases. I mean, let's take let's take PAM, for example.
If you went back a year ago, you really had a couple of companies deploying it versus older NRZ-based solutions. You head into this year, there are now additional companies as well that are going to be driving that cycle on 200 and 400-gig. We have new applications like even 800-gig as an example, for AI clusters and things like that where we started ramping our 800-gig product. So whether the capex goes up or down, there's new applications and new replacement cycles that are going on.
And then there's just other things like, for example, in our Cloud Ethernet switch area, right? There was new wins we got through the Innovium team that joined us last year. We expect continued strong growth from that product area. We have new cloud optimized silicon in ASICs and DPUs that were designed in over the last couple of years. Those are going to be ramping up.
So we are very -- we're paying attention to it, Matt, but I would say that that it's a little bit like our 5G business. You can see things go up and down and lumpiness in the market. But when you have a strong product cycle with either content or share gain and new customers coming on, you can power through and that's our full expectation in the cloud. We have very strong conviction on our business there today, particularly in the second half and next year relative to the cloud hyperscale and we'll watch the capex trend, but most of our products are independent of that trend.

The next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks for letting us ask a question. Jean, I wanted to ask you one on the margin side of the equation. You guys always run a very tight ship in this, but there's lots of moving parts.
Matt's talked a lot about more supply coming on in the back half of this year. Sometimes that can come at a higher price these days. And then even the opex side of things, wage inflation, etc., and some acquisition integration that you talked about. So generally speaking, can you walk us through the puts and takes on the gross margin and the opex side of things for the rest of the year?
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Ross, thanks for the question. I think our team has been very disciplined to manage opex to make sure we follow our overall business model right, grow revenue significantly faster than opex growth and keep the gross margin right in the middle or even above the middle of our long-term target model, so we can drive the earnings expansion much faster than top line revenue growth. When you look at the opex in Q1, as I said earlier, we increased headcount and project expense to really execute on all the design wins we have won.
Q2, it's we keep it flat. In the second half, it's going to go a little bit higher, slightly higher, but it's largely because we are going to grow revenue in second half to support the revenue growth, you have certain variable expenses that will increase slightly in second half. In the longer term, you should continue to expect us to drive top-line revenue growth and opex around 50% slower than top line revenue growth. So we can continue to get the earnings expansion.
So in Q2, if you look at the midpoint of our guide, our operating margin is already above 36%. We are very, very driven to get our operating model to the 38% to 40% range.

Next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you, and congratulations on the strong results. Just had a follow-up on the storage question, but this time on Gen 6, not on Gen 5. So just, Matt, can you maybe frame a little bit Marvell's positioning here? I mean I think about the PAM4 IP you have, obviously, you talked about CXL.
I know it's still early days, but if you could just frame a little bit sort of layman's terms, you're positioned for PCI Gen 6, that would be great. Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Tore. Yes, Gen 6, as it relates to storage, you're absolutely right. Given the increase in IO throughput and data rate, you had to move to a PAM-based architecture. So that's played right into our strengths.
We've coupled that with our -- and we were early to do this, by the way, with our five-nanometer technology platform. And so there's just a whole lot of goodness and reuse there, as you can imagine. And it really put us in a strong position to get there early, and I give our storage business unit, a lot of credit for really having thought leadership here. I mean they probably jumped like two nodes on everybody, not that it's a whole node game, but in terms of just the power and the performance that we're getting out of these solutions.
And then, of course, the benefit we get to take the IO down to five-nanometer and leveraging PAM is actually a huge help, right, just given the given the complexity. And you saw that in our optical business, right, and kind of how Inphi drove performance over time as they've driven PAM on new process node, same thing over here. So I think that's going to be very strategic. And Yes, I think that that platform now -- again, we're early, right? We're just talking about launch today, but we do like to give color on our future leaning roadmap.
But it definitely plays to our strengths. And I think as you think about also what's going to be required in CXL. I think even things like closing the link and the need for retimers and redrivers, accelerators, pooling applications, they're all going to require robust Gen 6 IP and then be able to integrate those into various different SoCs. And I would just say even today, the CXL activity we're seeing in terms of our design opportunities is pretty broad, and it's almost all -- it really is all in our five-nanometer platform.
So it all kind of hangs together, Tore, and maybe I think you sort of see this, but I think others are as well. The combination of all the IPs that we brought together through the different acquisitions plus the Marvell technology platform has really created an opportunity for us to go-to-market with these semi-custom solutions and be very successful in this next wave of cloud optimized silicon.

Next question is from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Good afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution. I saw the announcement on -- and you mentioned this map on shipping 100,000 400-gig coherent DSP chipsets. You're pretty early days in this transition, but you guys have already shipped like according to my calculation, almost $200 million plus worth of products.
And the great thing about this family of products is that they've got the same underlying architecture and you've taken that and you're going after different markets, right? Datacenter interconnect with for 400 ZR, long-haul metro with your 400-gig Canopus solution. The adoption seems to be actually on a faster curve. Is this a driver of the upside in your datacenter and carrier franchises? And then I believe that your deployment is being driven by just one cloud titan, are you guys anticipating other cloud titans starting to fire as the year unfolds?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Thanks, Harlan, for the question. And maybe just to start at the top on coherent DSP. I'm not sure everybody quite understood.
Even the Inphi people that followed Inphi closely, how strategic this technology is. A little bit of background. They had had their own effort in coherent Inphi, and they ended up acquiring a company called ClariPhy a few years before we acquired Inphi. And ultimately, they chose to ClariPhy coherent DSP road map.
This is very, very difficult stuff to do, Harlan. And once you get it right and get it designed in, these are very, very long product life cycles, particularly in the metro long-haul type of markets, the telco type markets. And that's really what's driving -- that's really where the revenue is showing up today for this. The added benefit is obviously the same technology and chips are used in the ZR 400 the ZR market as well for DCI.
So there's a double benefit here. And so on the merchant side, we're a strong leader. We have a road map, obviously, beyond this to 800-gig. That's going to play in well to our next-generation DCI products as well.
And then even longer term, there's discussions longer term about the modulation technology eventually inside datacenter moving to coherent. So it's a very strategic technology for Marvell. And to answer your question on the ZR DCI side, we -- and I said it in my prepared remarks that it might have begun lost, but we do have multiple customers for this, not just one. And those will be ramping up over the next year or so, the additional customers.
We're already shipping and putting out record results on the DCI products as it is. We're really driven by one customer, but there's more coming. So we're pretty excited about this. And we have a whole ecosystem lined up, right? We have a number of module partners for different applications.
And so -- anyway, yes, it's something we'll be talking about more. Maybe we'll do a tech talk on that one, too, Harlan, but it's actually a really important technology that we got from Inphi. And it's obviously an outstanding team that really feeds a lot of the other things that we do inside the company.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Yes. Great insights. Thank you, Matt.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. And just one final thing, I would say, remember, too, this is a chip set as well. So it's not just the DSP, it's the driver, it's the TIA and there's even other components we're looking at to really optimize the solution. So when you hang all that together and you can deliver it as a platform.
It's very powerful.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

The final question today will be from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions and squeezing me in. I guess a question on gross margins. You guided down 25 bps sequentially.
Obviously, a very small amount. But just curious if there's anything mix-wise and/or higher input costs that we should be thinking about there? And then just as a quick follow-up to Jean, are we at the net leverage level now where you plan to return free cash flow via buybacks? Or is that still in more of the opportunistic phase? Thank you.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. So C.J., thanks for the question. First, on the net leverage, if you look at our Q2 guidance at the middle point of our guidance our net leverage ratio will be below two, gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be around two, but the net leverage will be below two. As I said earlier, we have restarted share repurchase program even after end of Q1, subsequently, we did purchase additional $50 million through our 10b-5 program.
So our capital allocation principle is still the same, right? We want to invest, but we are also committed to return more than 50% free cash flow to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase. On the gross margin, our gross margin, we are very pleased with the Q1 gross margin, which is a record in the Q2 guide it's all both above middle point for our long-term target. So the Q2 is really just a mix. We have so many different product lines quarter over quarter, you will see the mix change up and down of our middle point I would not predict that closely.
But in general, it should be around 65% sometimes higher.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
I'll just add, C.J. I totally agree with Jean, obviously. And just to remind everybody, we set a range of -- on gross margins as our target model of 64% to 66%. We had a record 65.3% in Q4.
Then we had another record of 65.5% in Q1, and then we're guiding 65.25% if you look at the midpoint in Q2. So it's kind of in in the range, if you know what I mean, I think run the company around that 65-ish is a really good place to be. If we can continue to grow the company the way we're growing it and drive leverage and drive design wins and stay competitive. So I think it's -- I think we're in pretty good shape.
I think obviously reasonable to ask the question, but I think, as Jean said, we're going to have little movements here and there on mix. And we're ultimately just focused on keeping it in the right range in the right strike zone and then just driving really strong top-line growth and driving operating leverage through the cycle we're in here.

U.S. stock futures are edging higher ahead of Friday’s opening bell this week. As stocks look to snap a 7-week losing streak, investors are likely focusing on the latest batch of retail earnings. Most of which were above consensus analyst estimates on Wall Street. This is apparent as firms like Macy’s (NYSE: M), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR), and Dollar General (NYSE: DG) all posted double-digit gains yesterday. Providing some insight into this is Charley Ripley, a senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management. He suggests, “Today’s relief rally is a signal to investors that despite the inflation headwinds that many companies are facing, consumers still have the wherewithal to spend.“
Moreover, Ripley continues, “The overall economy is still underpinned by a very strong labor market and while challenges to margins have emerged for some big-box retailers, there are other signals in the economy that show consumers still have the ability to spend. Overall, markets were hovering near oversold territory and today’s rally was a result of walking back some of the recent recession fears.” Following all of that, here is how the major U.S. stock index futures are doing now. As of 4:28 a.m. ET, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures are trading higher by 0.10%, 0.24%, and 0.36% respectively.

Ulta Beauty Gains Following Substantial Earnings Beat And Upbeat Guidance
Another company turning heads after reporting earnings now would be Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA). In essence, the beauty store chain operator posted commendable figures in its latest financial release. According to the report, Ulta’s quarterly earnings per share is $6.30. Additionally, the company’s total revenue for the quarter is $2.34 billion. For reference, consensus figures on Wall Street are an earnings per share of $4.46 on revenue of $2.12 billion. Following the notable beats across its top and bottom lines, ULTA stock would be gaining attention at today’s opening bell.
Speaking on all this in further detail is Ulta CEO, Dave Kimbell. He notes that “The Ulta Beauty team delivered exceptional first-quarter results, with better-than-expected sales and earnings growth, supported by double-digit comparable sales growth across all major categories.” All of which Kimbell says is thanks to solid strategy execution alongside strong consumer demand throughout the quarter.
While all this is great, Ulta does not seem to be slowing down anytime soon. Also in the press release, the company is raising its guidance for the fiscal year. Now, Ulta is anticipating revenue of between $9.35 billion to $9.55 billion. This would be in comparison to its prior guidance range of $9.05 billion and $9.15 billion. At the same time, the current consensus on Wall Street is $9.16 billion. Similarly, the company is also increasing its earnings per share estimate to a range of $19.20 to $20.10.

Chevron Stock Hits Record High After Company Reveals Corporate Streamlining Plans
In other news, shares of Chevron (NYSE: CVX) are trading at record levels in the stock market now. For the most part, this would be thanks to a generally upbeat start to the current year. This would be the case with surging energy demand and dwindling oil supplies worldwide. As the Ukraine-Russia war persists, countries across the globe would be turning to oil giants such as Chevron amidst the energy crisis. Broader industry tailwinds aside, Chevron also remains hard at work refining its core operations now. Evidently, the company revealed plans to further simplify its organizational structure yesterday.
According to the announcement, Chevron is consolidating its Upstream, Midstream, and Downstream business segments under a new executive. The executive in question will be the VP of Oil, Products & Gas; and will be responsible for the full value chain. Also, Chevron is planning to reorganize its Strategy & Sustainability, Corporate Affairs, and Business Development sections as well. These functions will be under the care of a new executive VP of Strategy, Policy & Development. In the words of CEO Mike Wirth, “these changes position us to further enhance execution across all aspects of our business as the energy system evolves.” After considering all this, I can understand why investors continue to flock to CVX stock now.

Costco Tops Analyst Estimates In Latest Quarterly Report; Losses Steam As Margins Slip
Meanwhile, Costco (NASDAQ: COST) appears to be experiencing some turbulence. Namely, the company’s shares are on the decline despite Costco having posted positive figures. Getting straight to it, the company posted an earnings per share of $3.17 alongside revenue of $52.60 billion for the quarter. This would be according to its latest quarterly financial report. To put things into perspective, this is against consensus figures of $3.03 and $51.71 billion respectively on Wall Street. Despite topping both of these marks, COST stock appears to be trading lower now.
To highlight, investors are likely focusing on the company’s decrease in gross margins for the quarter. According to Costco, rising freight labor costs continue to weigh in on its U.S. operations. Costco would join a growing group of major U.S. businesses experiencing headwinds from growing supply chain disruptions, COVID-19 lockdowns in China, and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. To help mitigate these pressures, Costco notes that it is increasing prices for certain food items. While the company weathers the currently choppy operating environment, long-term investors may be considering COST stock today.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.96%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $0.48 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.50, delivering a surprise of 4.17%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $832.28 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.

What's Next for Marvell?
While Marvell has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Marvell: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.55 on $1.48 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.29 on $6.1 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
Another stock from the same industry, UiPath (PATH), has yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2022. The results are expected to be released on June 1.

Marvell Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
Marvell Technology, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Marvell Technology, Inc. Quote
Factors to Consider
Marvell’s first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the solid demand for its networking products, primarily across the data center and 5G infrastructure end markets.
On its fourth-quarter conference call, Marvell stated that it anticipates strong sequential revenues in the first quarter, driven by the substantial contribution from the cloud data center end market, accelerated 5G adoptions in the United States and other regions and broad growth across multiple products.
Additionally, 5G and cloud product ramp-ups and revenues from the recently acquired Inphi Corporation business might have favored MRVL’s overall performance during the quarter under review.
Record bookings and the ramp-up of multiple Ethernet design wins in upcoming vehicles are anticipated to have driven revenues significantly in the fiscal first quarter. The consumer and industrial businesses are likely to have put up an impressive show in the quarter under review.
However, certain ongoing supply-chain challenges are anticipated to have acted as headwinds, which might have curbed Marvell’s ability to fully meet the increase in demand for some of its product offerings.
Marvell expects the first-quarter non-GAAP gross margin of 65-66%, while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated between $430 million and $435 million.

Much like most industries in the stock market, many semiconductor stocks have been in a correction from their pandemic-driven highs. Well, this has been going on for quite some time now. With that said, some investors may be wondering if the worst could be over soon. Notably, some of the biggest names, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Marvell Technologies will be reporting their earnings this week. Thus, it could be a good idea to keep a close watch on the industry. Mixed sentiments aside, there are still plenty of exciting developments within the semiconductor industry. 
For instance, GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: GFS) recently announced the launch of GF Labs. This is a new program that extends the development horizon of innovative semiconductor technology. Also, GF Labs will focus on long-term roadmap differentiation that will enable its customers to develop innovative products and accelerate their time-to-market. Meanwhile, a report by Bloomberg suggests that Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is in talks to acquire VMware Inc (NYSE: VMW). If true, the deal would catapult Broadcom into a specialized area of software. Overall, the industry is still moving on the right trajectory. So, here are some of the top semiconductor stocks to watch in the stock market today.
Semiconductor Stock To Watch Right Now
Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MRVL)
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD)
Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADI)
Marvell
Firstly, we have the semiconductor infrastructure supplier, Marvell. In detail, the company engages in the design, development, and sale of integrated circuits. The markets that it serves include data center, carrier infrastructure, enterprise networking, consumer, and automotive/industrial. Coming off a record fourth quarter to close off the fiscal year 2022, many investors will be keeping a close eye on its upcoming earnings result later this week. During the previous quarter, it reported a net revenue of $1.34 billion, up 68% year-over-year and exceeding the midpoint guidance provided by the company. Along with that, the company posted a non-GAAP net income of $429 million or $0.50 per diluted share. 
Furthermore, Marvell also announced a definitive agreement to acquire Tanzanite Silicon Solutions earlier this month. For those unaware, this is a leading developer of advanced Compute Express Link™ (CXL) technologies. With this addition, Marvell will strengthen its CXL development initiatives. Silicon components based on CXL will facilitate new cloud data center architectures with significant performance and efficiency benefits. Keeping these factors in mind, would you consider investing in MRVL stock ahead of its earnings release on Thursday, May 26, 2022?

Intel
Intel would be no stranger to most people around the world. The multinational tech giant is one of the world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturers. It is also the developer of the x86 series of microprocessors which are found in most personal computers (PCs) today. Despite mixed sentiments within the semiconductor industry, there has been plenty of excitement surrounding Intel this month. For starters, the company turned its focus to how it will meet the growing security needs of organizations during its inaugural Intel Vision event earlier this month. To help organizations better prepare for the challenges of tomorrow, Intel introduced an innovative service-based security implementation code-named Project Amber. This will provide organizations with remote verification in the cloud, edge, and on-premises environments. 
On top of that, the company also recently introduced an open-source tool to migrate code to SYCL through a project called SYCLomatic. Naturally, this will help developers to easily port CUDA code to SYCL and C++ to accelerate cross-architecture programming for heterogeneous architectures. Additionally, this open-source project would also enable community collaboration to advance the adoption of the SYCL standard. In fact, this is a key step in freeing developers from a single-vendor proprietary ecosystem. All in all, there are multiple reasons for optimism surrounding Intel right now. With that said, would you add INTC stock to your watchlist?
Advanced Micro Devices
Next on our list, we have Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a semiconductor company that continues to drive innovation in high-performance computing along with graphics and visualization technologies. In fact, its products are used by billions of people all over the world. Last week, the company announced a collaboration with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) to optimize the Qualcomm FastConnect connectivity system for AMD’s processor-based computing platforms.
The collaboration will begin with AMD Ryzen PRO 6000 Series processors and the Qualcomm FastConnect 6900. Jason Banta, CVP and General Manager, OEM Client Computing of AMD, had this to say, “AMD Ryzen™ PRO 6000 Series processors with Qualcomm FastConnect 6900 enable next-generation business laptops to have the processing and connectivity tools needed to perform in modern environments, offering professional-strength remote manageability for users in the new, hybrid workplace.” The collaboration also represents the first step in forging a strong relationship between the two companies to bring superior wireless connectivity to the AMD mobile computing roadmap. Given this piece of news, is AMD stock worth investing in right now?

Analog Devices
To sum up the list, we will be looking at another semiconductor giant, Analog Devices. Essentially, this is a company that designs, manufactures, and markets a portfolio of semiconductor solutions. This includes integrated circuits, software, and subsystems that leverage analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing technologies. Now, ADI stock has been trading sideways since the start of the year. That still compares favorably to the performance of some of the top names within the industry this year.
Last week, Analog announced the financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2022. Some of the notable highlights include revenue of $2.97 billion, which was up 79% year-over-year, and double-digit growth across all its end markets. Now, this marks the fifth consecutive quarter of record revenue by the company. This appears to be a testament to the unprecedented demand for Analog’s technology and its ability to meet those demands in a challenging supply backdrop. Aside from that, Analog also increased its share repurchases to $776 million and paid $398 million in dividends. With that in mind, would you consider ADI stock as a top semiconductor stock to watch?

2022-05-19 00:00:00+00:00,Add Up The Pieces: SMH Could Be Worth $318,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/add-up-the-pieces%3A-smh-could-be-worth-%24318,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SMH), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $318.45 per unit.
With SMH trading at a recent price near $228.00 per unit, that means that analysts see 39.67% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SMH's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are NVIDIA Corp (Symbol: NVDA), Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL), and Skyworks Solutions Inc (Symbol: SWKS). Although NVDA has traded at a recent price of $169.38/share, the average analyst target is 77.13% higher at $300.02/share. Similarly, MRVL has 70.63% upside from the recent share price of $55.01 if the average analyst target price of $93.86/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting SWKS to reach a target price of $155.06/share, which is 52.33% above the recent price of $101.79. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of NVDA, MRVL, and SWKS:
Combined, NVDA, MRVL, and SWKS represent 12.54% of the Semiconductor ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
Semiconductor ETF SMH $228.00 $318.45 39.67%
NVIDIA Corp NVDA $169.38 $300.02 77.13%
Marvell Technology Inc MRVL $55.01 $93.86 70.63%
Skyworks Solutions Inc SWKS $101.79 $155.06 52.33%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-05-16 00:00:00+00:00,Should iShares Russell MidCap ETF (IWR) Be on Your Investing Radar?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-ishares-russell-midcap-etf-iwr-be-on-your-investing-radar-2,,,"The iShares Russell MidCap ETF (IWR) was launched on 07/17/2001, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $27.55 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
Why Mid Cap Blend
Compared to large and small cap companies, mid cap businesses tend to have higher growth prospects and are less volatile, respectively, with market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.
Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.
Costs
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.19%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.27%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 16.30% of the portfolio. Industrials and Financials round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Marvell Technology Inc (MRVL) accounts for about 0.52% of total assets, followed by Pioneer Natural Resource (PXD) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC).
The top 10 holdings account for about 4.42% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
IWR seeks to match the performance of the Russell MidCap Index before fees and expenses. The Russell Midcap Index measures the performance of the mid-capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market.
The ETF has lost about -15.25% so far this year and is down about -6.59% in the last one year (as of 05/16/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $67.31 and $85.28.
The ETF has a beta of 1.08 and standard deviation of 25.47% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 833 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
IShares Russell MidCap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, IWR is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.
The Vanguard MidCap ETF (VO) and the iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF (IJH) track a similar index. While Vanguard MidCap ETF has $48.70 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF has $59.65 billion. VO has an expense ratio of 0.04% and IJH charges 0.05%.
Bottom-Line
Passively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Points.com: mixed.

Free Report: Top 7%+ Dividends (paid monthly)
Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-05-10 00:00:00+00:00,Marvell (MRVL) Enhances CXL Portfolio With Tanzanite Buyout,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/marvell-mrvl-enhances-cxl-portfolio-with-tanzanite-buyout,,,"Marvell Technology MRVL recently announced entering into a definitive agreement to acquire the privately-held tech start-up, Tanzanite Silicon Solutions Inc., in an all-cash transaction. However, the company didn’t disclose the terms of the all-cash transaction.
Marvell expects to complete the buyout in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the approval of Tanzanite shareholders.
Tanzanite Buyout to Boost Marvell’s CXL Portfolio
Tanzanite developed extensive expertise in Compute Express Link (CXL) technology that helps firms with infrastructure agility. The CXL technology is an open standard for the high-speed central processing unit (CPU) that helps maintain memory coherency between the CPU memory space and memory in attached devices.
In March this year, the California-based tech start-up showcased its architectural vision and product roadmap with a system-on-a-chip mapped to the field programmable gate array Proof-Of-Concept vehicle demonstrating Memory Expansion and Memory Pooling, with multi-host CXL-based connectivity.
Marvell believes that the future cloud data center will be built on fully disaggregated architecture utilizing CXL technology as it will require greater high-speed interconnectivity combined with optimized compute, networking, memory, security and storage chipset solutions. This technology helps data centers instantly allocate resources per workload requirements, thereby improving utilization while reducing the total cost of ownership.
Marvell Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus
Marvell Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Marvell Technology, Inc. Quote
Therefore, the buyout is likely to broaden MRVL’s silicon solutions portfolio and, in turn, enhance the company’s cloud data center business.
Noam Mizrahi, corporate chief technology officer at Marvell, said, ""The integration of CXL across our end-to-end, cloud-optimized silicon portfolio will bring new levels of data center efficiency, scalability and flexibility to power emerging metaverse and next generation AI applications.""
Marvell Ups Data Center-Focused Investments
The Tanzanite acquisition is in line with Marvell’s ongoing step-up investments in the data center business. Over the past few years, Marvell has been expanding its capabilities in the data center end-market semiconductor business. Until 2017, the company was known as the leading supplier of chips for hard disk drives used in PCs.
However, the acquisition of Cavium in 2018 helped Marvell expand its capabilities in the networking market and capture a significant market share in the fast-growing data center space.
The completion of the Inphi Corporation acquisition in April 2021 also opened up new avenues of growth for the company. The combination of Marvell, a leader in infrastructure semiconductor products, and Inphi, which makes high-speed data movement systems and has a strong presence among cloud customers, opened up new opportunities for Marvell's data processing unit and application specific integrated circuit products. Additionally, it reinforced Marvell's leadership position in data centers and extended its 5G network infrastructure.
Marvell further boosts its data center capabilities by completing the acquisition of the California-based high-performance, innovative switching silicon solutions provider for cloud and edge data centers, Innovium, in October 2021.

2022-05-05 00:00:00+00:00,MRVL June 24th Options Begin Trading,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mrvl-june-24th-options-begin-trading,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available today, for the June 24th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new June 24th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $56.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.63. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $56.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $53.37 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $58.67/share today.
Because the $56.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.70% return on the cash commitment, or 34.28% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $56.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.55. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $58.67/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.02% if the stock gets called away at the June 24th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.76% boost of extra return to the investor, or 56.61% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $58.67) to be 49%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Growth stocks are often expensive in terms of valuation multiples, but if expectations are matched these stocks can generate sturdy capital gains. These stocks grow at a faster clip than their respective markets and can be great long-term investments.
Growth stocks are also associated with high risks, that can trigger powerful drawdowns if the companies miss market growth expectations. Besides, some companies focus on growing revenues at any cost, which can be unproductive, especially in today’s equity market.
7 A-Rated Dividend Stocks to Buy Forever
In the past few months, investors walked away from growth stocks, preferring to invest in value stocks that tend to resist better in monetary tightening and inflationary economic conditions. This has accentuated the bearish momentum on these investments, creating opportunities to buy growth stock at cheaper prices.
In this context, here is a selection of stocks that could go parabolic by 2023.
MRVL Marvell Technology, Inc. $61.06
LI Li Auto Inc. $22.12
ZS Zscaler, Inc. $213.59

Marvell Technology, Inc. (MRVL)

Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) specializes in designing and marketing integrated communications and storage circuits intended for manufacturers of high-speed network equipment, hard disk, and consumer electronics. Since the beginning of the year, MRVL stock dipped 33.72% to $59.20 per share, after investors dumped the growth stock. Nevertheless, Marvell recently announced that it has more than doubled Cloud Data Center Ethernet Switch Port Shipments over the year, reaching a record high market share of 31% in Q4 2021.
Despite this poor performance, Marvell is expected to grow fast in the next two years, as demand for its cloud solutions remains sustained. Net sales are projected to advance 50.3% to $4.46 billion in 2022 and 46.7% to $6.1 billion in 2023.
On the other side, MRVL’s bottom line is estimated to weaken in 2022, posting a net loss of $421 million, before rebounding solidly in 2023 to $291 million. With this rebound, net margins are projected to advance to 4.76% per year, boosting MRVL’s stock price. Besides, the tech company is well balanced, with net debt of only $444 million in 2021, representing a low leverage ratio of 0.48x.
Moreover, analysts are bullish on the growth stock, offering a 12-month average target price of $91.2 or 57.59% appreciation potential. The valuation metrics of the company are however quite stretched, with a forward EV/EBITDA of 20.4x and a price-to-book multiple of 3.02x.
Li Auto Inc. (LI)

Li Auto (NYSE:LI) is a China-based new energy vehicles (NEV) maker principally engaged in the design, development, manufacture, and sales of smart electric cars. LI stock value has shrank more than 30% year-to-date to $22.12 per share, following declining investor interest in Chinese tech stocks prompted by Beijing’s crackdown on the industry.
Despite these impending regulatory risks, LI Auto has grown at a fast clip in the past years and is expected to continue on this path. Revenues are projected to lift by 93.2% in 2022 to CNY 52.1 billion ($7.86 billion) and by 69.2% to CNY 88.2 billion in 2023.
The company remains unprofitable, with an expected net loss of CNY 691 million in 2022, nevertheless, analyst projections indicate that it should turn things around in 2023, posting a net income of CNY 1.52 billion. If the Chinese EV giant maintains this guidance, the growth stock could go parabolic in 2023, providing strong support for the stock.
7 Biggest Loser Stocks That Could Become Surprising Buys
Besides, Li Auto has sufficient cash on hand to deliver on its growth prospects, with a net cash position of CNY 10.6 billion at the end of 2021. Despite that and even if the stock declined by more than 30% over the year, LI stock is expensive, exchanging at a massive forward EV/EBITDA of 282x and a 2022e P/B ratio of 3.74x.
Analysts maintain a constructive view on LI stock, offering a target price of $42.24 per share, an upside of 96.37% from today’s price.
Zscaler, Inc. (ZS)

Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) is a cloud security platform, designed on a zero-trust architecture. ZS stock lost 29.94% year-to-date to $209.02 per share, providing a cheaper entry point for investors looking to enter this fast-growing company. The cloud specialist released a research report earlier this month, showing a 400% increase in the past 12 months of phishing attacks on retail and wholesale industries.
With these findings, ZS’s cloud security solutions should get a boost, sustaining its fast top-line growth. In 2021, Zcaler’s net sales advanced rapidly, up 56.1% to $673 million. Going forward, revenues are estimated to grow 56.3% to $1.05 billion this year and 36% to $1.4 billion in 2023.
The bottom line is expected to deteriorate this year, posting a net loss of $372 million versus $262 million last year. Despite that, ZS’s EBITDA is projected to advance at a fast rate this year, up 28.7% to $139 million. In addition, the company has sufficient cash to grow its activity, with a net cash position of $589 million at the end of 2021 that is expected to increase 20.5% in 2022 to $710 million.
The growth stock has a moderate buy rating according to Wall Street analysts and the average target price stands at $311.22 per share offering a potential upside of 45.41%. The cloud security stock is however expensive, exchanging at 202x forward EV/EBITDA and 49.8x 2022e P/B.
Bill.com Holdings, Inc. (BILL)

Bill.com (NYSE:BILL) is a leading provider of cloud-based software that simplifies back-office financial operations for small and midsize businesses (SMBs). Since the beginning of the year, BILL stock declined more than 20% to $182.70 per share, amid tough market conditions for tech stocks and growth stocks.
The growth stock was beaten by the market participants due to weak profitability. BILL’s net loss reached $987 million in 2021, but is expected to reduce to $308 million this year. The software company is however growing at a fast clip. After growing 50.6% to $238 million in 2021, revenues are projected to bounce 149.6% to $594 million in 2022 and by another 35.7% to $806 million in 2023.
7 A-Rated Dividend Stocks to Buy Forever
Besides, Bill.com has a comfortable balance sheet. The net cash position of the company is expected to reach $1.03 billion this year, providing a wide cushion of security to extend its operations in the next years.
Recently, insiders sold a chunk of BILL stock, indicating that the company continues to be overvalued. This is not a surprise given that the company trades at elevated multiples, posting a forward EV/revenue of 28.4x and 2022e P/B of 4.65x.
Cloudflare (NET)

Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) is a global cloud services provider that delivers a range of services from security to software-as-a-service applications. NET stock lost 28.19% year-to-date to $90.59, outpacing the decline of tech stocks.
Cloudflare’s top-line growth is projected to remain solid in the next two years. Net sales are expected to jump 42.1% to $932 million this year and 32.7% to $1.23 billion in 2023. The bottom line of the cloud service specialist is also expected to improve. After posting a net loss of $260 million in 2021, NET is projected to reduce yearly losses to $189 million this year.

2022-04-26 00:00:00+00:00,"Here is What to Know Beyond Why Marvell Technology, Inc. (MRVL) is a Trending Stock",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/here-is-what-to-know-beyond-why-marvell-technology-inc.-mrvl-is-a-trending-stock,,,"Marvell Technology (MRVL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Shares of this chipmaker have returned -18.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -5.3% change. The Zacks Technology Services industry, to which Marvell belongs, has lost 10.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Marvell is expected to post earnings of $0.51 per share, indicating a change of +75.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.23 points to a change of +42% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.81 indicates a change of +25.9% from what Marvell is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +157.9%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marvell.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Marvell, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.43 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +71.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $6.15 billion and $7.18 billion estimates indicate +37.7% and +16.8% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Marvell reported revenues of $1.34 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +68.3%. EPS of $0.50 for the same period compares with $0.29 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.46%. The EPS surprise was +4.17%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Marvell is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marvell. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.
