2022-02-15 00:00:00+00:00,"Nvidia Leads the Nasdaq Higher, But This Winner's More of a Surprise",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-leads-the-nasdaq-higher-but-this-winners-more-of-a-surprise,,,"Volatility has been rampant on Wall Street in 2022, but it hasn't all been directed to the downside. Tuesday's big move higher stemmed from more positive news on the geopolitical front, overwhelming further troubling news on inflation that could weigh on longer-term prospects for the economy. As of 2 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) was up more than 2%.
One key gainer in the Nasdaq was Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which continued to regain ground after a sharp drop since November. However, even though it had a smaller gain on Tuesday, the rise in shares of international hospitality company Marriott (NASDAQ: MAR) was arguably a stronger indicator of the resiliency of the economy and the market. Let's take a closer look at both companies below.
Nvidia leads chipmakers higher
Shares of Nvidia were up more than 8% on Tuesday afternoon. The company benefited from more favorable sentiment about the semiconductor industry writ large, with a host of factors helping stocks like Nvidia.

Merger and acquisition activity in semiconductors has been on the rise, and a new deal today added to the excitement among investors. Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) decision to acquire Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ: TSEM) was just the latest in a series of moves taking place throughout the sector. The completion of Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) $35 billion acquisition of Xilinx is another example of the demand for consolidation.
For its part, Nvidia failed in its efforts to acquire Arm, with the planned $40 billion merger falling through last week. Yet in many ways, the failure has only stiffened Nvidia's resolve to keep fighting back, and continued shortages of key semiconductor products should mean that the chip giant will see healthy demand throughout 2022.
At its worst levels in late January, Nvidia had seen its stock fall about 35% from its November highs. Since then, though, the chipmaker has clawed back much of that lost ground, and many see Nvidia as having above-average prospects to return to all-time record highs before too long -- especially if favorable conditions in the semiconductor industry remain in place.
Marriott moves higher
Meanwhile, shares of Marriott International were up nearly 5% on the day. The hotel giant reported quarterly financial results that gave investors confidence about the travel industry's return to strength after a tough time in the opening year of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Marriott's fourth-quarter financial report showed considerable progress toward a recovery, although the numbers didn't return to pre-pandemic levels. Total revenue more than doubled to $4.45 billion, with net income of $468 million reversing a year-earlier loss. Earnings of $1.42 per share largely satisfied investors and capped a strong 2021 for the hotel chain. Revenue per available room soared 124.5% year over year, although it was down 19% from comparable figures from the fourth quarter of 2019 before the pandemic began.
Marriott hasn't given up on its expansion plans. The hotel company added 86,000 rooms in 2021, sending total rooms up almost 4% from the end of 2020. Marriott also reported having more than 200,000 rooms under construction as of year end.
CEO Anthony Capuano heralded the huge bounce in leisure demand while admitting that improvement in business travel has lagged behind. Nevertheless, Marriott is optimistic about the prospects for business travelers returning to the road in 2022, and that could give the hotel company another leg up in the coming year.

2022-02-15 00:00:00+00:00,Intel’s Tower deal comes up strategically short,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-tower-deal-comes-up-strategically-short,,,"Reuters
Reuters


NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Intel has a tower to climb. Buying an Israeli chipmaker of that name is a literal but probably ineffective way to do it.
Once the dominant cutting-edge chip firm, Intel has lost its technology lead. At the same time, the $200 billion company is undergoing a transformation as new-ish Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger attempts to turn it into a contract manufacturer for others’ products. As a statement of intent, Gelsinger’s $5.4 billion acquisition of Tower Semiconductor https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1527/intel-to-acquire-tower-semiconductor-for-5-4-billion shows his seriousness about the latter challenge. But with a year or more until closing, Intel can’t bet on this deal to fix its flaws – and Tower could introduce new ones.
True, Tower fits with Gelsinger’s plan to beef up Intel’s manufacturing business. The idea is to make that division sizeable enough to make chips for companies other than Intel itself. The company had also taken a look at $29 billion manufacturer GlobalFoundries, according to the Wall Street Journal. https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-is-in-talks-to-buy-globalfoundries-for-about-30-billion-11626387704?st=zikpzvlm8jjdjvf&reflink=article_copyURL_share Gelsinger investigated deals that would boost the other side of Intel, too – such as chip designer SiFive, an unlisted rival to industry disruptor Arm. Those talks ended in October, according to Bloomberg https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/intel-s-talks-for-chip-designer-sifive-said-to-end-without-deal.
Intel tried and failed to become a contract manufacturer before, under old boss Brian Krzanich. Bringing in Tower’s management would help to ensure that Intel has a team that knows how to run a foundry. Tower also broadens Intel’s appeal. Many customers don’t need Intel’s latest and greatest manufacturing technology, known as a process node. Instead, they want to use cheaper, older tech of the kind Tower offers. The high investment required to build such capacity from scratch means buying facilities rather than building new ones makes sense.
But Tower’s 22% gross margins badly lag Intel’s. And this is a very small company compared to its acquirer. The transaction also faces a hurdle: China. Chip deals involving U.S. firms can stall for upwards of a year awaiting antitrust approval in the country. In the meantime, existential threats to Intel’s business remain: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is better at building bleeding-edge chips, and Arm is displacing its designs. Intel needs to spend a lotto catch up. Tower is a nice addition, but it doesn’t much elevate Intel’s prospects.

Tower Semiconductor Surges As Intel Confirms $5.4 Billion Acquisition; AMD Completes Xilinx Takeover
Semiconductor stocks appear to be making prominent plays in thestock market todayas well. This is evident from both Tower Semiconductor’s (NASDAQ: TSEM) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) latest announcements. For starters, TSEM is surging by over 40% today thanks to news of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) acquiring the firm. As of earlier today, Intel will be purchasing TSEM for $5.4 billion. Safe to say, the current movement in TSEM stock is from investors looking to leverage the current acquisition news.
On the flip side, long-term investors could be eyeing INTC stock now as well. This would be the case as the TSEM acquisition serves to benefit Intel significantly. After all, we are amid a global chip shortage. For one thing, Intel’s latest move would be in-line with CEO Pat Gelsinger’s ongoing focus on bolstering production capacities. Through TSEM, the company would be gaining a strong foundation in the specialty tech fields. This includes but is not limited to radio frequency and industrial sensor hardware. Additionally, Intel is also planning to invest up to $100 billion towards building its mega-factory complex in Ohio.
Secondly, AMD is also in the news now as a result of the completion of its Xilinx purchase. To point out, this chip giant is acquiring Xilinx for about $50 billion, a record deal for the industry. Commenting on the all-stock transaction is CEO Dr Lisa Su. She notes that AMD is gaining access to “a highly complementary set of products, customers and markets combined with differentiated IP and world-class talent to create the industry’s high-performance and adaptive computing leader.” After considering all of this, semiconductor stocks could be a hot sector to watch today.

Virgin Galactic Soars First Reservations For Commercial Space Flight Services Open
Virgin Galactic (NYSE: SPCE) seems to be shooting for the moon at today’s opening bell. This is apparent from SPCE stock’s sizable gains of 13.10% out the gate. For the most part, the current movement in SPCE stock is likely due to Virgin Galactic opening up reservations for its first few commercial space flights. According to the company, the limited opportunity will be available starting February 16. For now, the price for a ticket to space is a cool $450,000, starting with an initial deposit of $150,000. In the larger scheme of things, Virgin Galactic is expecting to have its first 1,000 customers on board once operations kickoff in late 2022. 
Through the current set of reservations, potential buyers will have access to Virgin Galactic’s Future Astronaut membership community. The likes of which are curated to provide clients with  “money-can’t-buy experiences, events, trips and space-readiness activities while they await their spaceflight.” In detail, the flights will launch from Virgin Galactic’s Spaceport America in New Mexico. The company also notes this begins with several days of spaceflight preparedness activities. With Virgin Galactic kicking into high gear on the operational end, I can understand the hype with SPCE stock now.

NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher on Tuesday, as signs of de-escalating tensions along the Russia-Ukraine border sparked a risk-on session.
All three major indexes notched solid advances on the day, with market leading tech and tech-adjacent stocks providing the biggest boost and putting the Nasdaq, which gained 2.5%, out front.
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX jumped 5.5% in its largest one-day percentage gain since March 2021.
Geopolitical heat was turned down a notch after Russia said it had withdrawn some of its troops near the Ukraine border, prompting bullish equities sentiment and causing crude prices to slide on easing supply concerns. O/R
The announcement received guarded responses, and the United States and NATO said they had yet to see evidence of a drawdown.
Stocks briefly pared gains late in the session, when U.S. President Joe Biden said that while diplomatic efforts are ongoing.
""Nice rally today, thanks to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,"" said David Carter, managing director at Wealthspire Advisors in New York.
""Markets have been moving based on Putin or (Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome) Powell,"" Carter added. ""Putin and his intentions with Ukraine and Powell and his intentions regarding interest rates.""
The CBOE market volatility index .VIX backed down from a three-week high.
On the economic front, a report from the Labor Department showed producer prices surged in January at twice the expected rate, reinforcing economist expectations that the Federal Reserve will take on stubbornly persistent inflation by aggressively hiking key interest rates.
""Inflation data suggests prices are rising, but markets already knew this,"" Carter said.
The graphic below shows producer price index (PPI) data, along with other major indicators, and how far they have risen beyond the Fed's average annual 2% inflation target:
The market has now priced in better than even odds that the central bank will raise the Fed funds target rate by 50 basis points at its March monetary policy meeting.
""The market is now priced for a more aggressive Fed, and outside of geopolitics there’s reduced uncertainty,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky. ""But the market is never certain so you always dealing probabilities.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJIrose 422.67 points, or 1.22%, to 34,988.84, the S&P 500 .SPXgained 69.4 points, or 1.58%, to 4,471.07 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXICadded 348.84 points, or 2.53%, to 14,139.76.
Nine of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 closed green, with tech shares .SPLRCT enjoying the largest percentage gain, jumping 2.7%. Energy stocks, .SPNY weighed by sliding crude prices CLc1, LCOc1, fell 1.4%.
Fourth quarter reporting season is entering its last stretch, with 370 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 78.1% have beaten analyst estimates, according to preliminary Refinitiv data.
""It's nice to have that earnings strength underlying these macro issues,"" Mayfield added.
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index's surge followed Intel Corp's INTC.O announcement of a $5.4 billion deal to buy Israeli chipmaker Tower Semiconductor TSEM.TA.
Restaurant Brands International QSR.N rose 3.6% after the fast food operator beat quarterly profit and revenue estimates.
Hotelier Marriott International MAR.O also beat Wall Street expectations due to rising occupancy rates, sending its shares up 5.8%.
Other travel-related companies surged, with the S&P 1500 airlines index .SPCOMAIR and hotels/restaurants/leisure index .SPCOMHRL rising 5.9% and 2.4%, respectively.
Shares of cloud infrastructure company Arista Networks ANET.N jumped 5.8% after it forecast better-than-anticipated current quarter revenue.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.87-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 39 new highs and 70 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.63 billion shares, compared with the 12.60 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

2022-02-15 00:00:00+00:00,Single-Family Rentals Are Hot -- Here's Why and Where,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/single-family-rentals-are-hot-heres-why-and-where,,,"Last year was a record year for single-family rental (SFR) construction, and 2022 may well see more of the same. There's a good reason for that: The market is there, and the appeal is broad.
""There is a misconception that the majority of renters are millennials when, in reality, you have everyone -- including college students, empty nesters, families with kids, pet owners, and those wanting to downsize,"" Shannon Hersker, capital markets group director of Walker & Dunlop, told RentCafe in a new report titled ""Built-to-Rent Homes Expected to Hit All-Time High in 2022, Fueled by Need for Space and Privacy.""
The article contains several lists, including which metro markets and individual cities have the largest SFR inventories right now. They're all across the country, and what they have in common are thriving job markets.
That also means these areas likely have a lot of new people moving in and searching for homes, adding pressure to home prices. Indeed, rising home prices and interest rates have hampered affordability for many would-be homebuyers, but the relative privacy, space, and neighborhood feel that SFRs can provide are driving demand in that sector, too, and construction is soaring.
RentCafe says an estimated 13,910 built-to-rent homes are under construction in total in all the markets where data is available to the listing service's sister company, Yardi Matrix. That doubles the 6,740 built in 2021, a sharp jump from the 4,000 to 4,900 built each year nationally from 2016 to 2020.

Heading for the 'burbs
RentCafe says a recent survey of 3,300 renters from its listing site found 78% were interested in communities of single-family homes. The report says that if they act on that interest, they'll find about 720 such communities offering about 90,000 units, including detached single-family homes and an array of duplexes, townhomes, and quadruplexes.
According to RentCafe, searches for ""homes for rent"" on rentcafe.com tripled last year from the year before, and suburban areas -- with low-density land available but still relatively close to the big city -- account for 61% of such rental home communities.
Fast-growing Phoenix tops the list of the top 5 metro areas
The list of metro areas with the most SFRs in place right now includes these top five:
Phoenix -- 6,420
Columbus, Ohio -- 4,780
Dallas -- 4,290
Houston -- 3,600
Riverside, California -- 3,540
And these cities have the most SFRs within their city limits:
Las Vegas -- 2,250
Houston -- 1,620
Tucson -- 1,320
Phoenix -- 1,280
Dallas -- 1,270
How individual investors can get involved
Sunbelt cities dominate this list, but growth is not exclusive to that big swath of our country.
Take Columbus, for instance. One of its suburbs, Westerville is No. 6 on the list of cities with the most SFRs at 1,160. That side of Ohio's capital city region is about to see a whole lot more growth. Intel has just announced and is already hiring for a pair of new chip factories -- a $20 billion investment that's expected to create 3,000 jobs with an average wage of $135,000 a year.
The spin-off economic activity from something this massive will be considerable, and the demand for housing stock will just become that much more intense. Of course, a project like this hardly flies under the radar, so the savvy real estate investor will also need to sniff out the less-obvious factors driving the individual market they choose.
Or you can let the big guys do it. Publicly traded homebuilders and SFR specialists -- two sectors that have forged some interesting partnerships -- will be happy to sell you some stock of your own. Consider Invitation Homes and PulteGroup: The former is the largest SFR real estate investment trust (REIT), and the latter is one of the nation's largest homebuilders. The two have partnered on a deal for the former to buy 7,500 new SFRs from the latter through 2025.
Home is where the opportunities are
There are more residential REITs to consider, including multifamily specialists. Remember, apartment growth is happening for the same reason in those same hot markets. And you also could consider UMH Properties, a REIT specializing in manufactured home communities.
Of course, not all SFRs are in planned communities. In every market, the opportunity exists to buy your own rental property and build wealth that way or even to purchase vacant land to build your own. However, the liquidity, flexibility, and performance prospects of selectively investing in REIT and homebuilder stocks do make them hard to resist, Foolishly speaking.
I mean, it's not like needing a place to live is just a fad, right?

2022-02-15 00:00:00+00:00,US STOCKS-Wall St set to bounce on signs of easing Russia-Ukraine tensions,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-st-set-to-bounce-on-signs-of-easing-russia-ukraine-tensions,,,"By Devik Jain and Susan Mathew
Feb 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were set for a stronger open on Tuesday, led by gains in shares of megacap growth names and banks on signs of a de-escalation in tensions between Russia and Ukraine.
Russia said some of its military units were returning to their bases after exercises near Ukraine and mocked repeated Western warnings about a looming invasion, but NATO said it had yet to see any sign of de-escalation on the ground.
Megacap growth stocks including Apple Inc AAPL.O, Google-owner Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Meta Platforms Inc FB.O and Tesla Inc TSLA.O rose between 1.5% and 2.6% in premarket trading.
Big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Citigroup Inc C.N jumped 1% each. Occidental Petroleum OXY.N slipped 2.5%, leading energy shares lower as oil prices dropped from a seven-year high. O/R
The CBOE Market Volatility index .VIX, a gauge for investor anxiety, fell back after shooting up to its highest level in nearly three weeks in the previous session.
""In the short-term, stocks are moving in lockstep with headlines from the Russia/Ukraine situation, and any indication of thawing tensions between Russia and Ukraine is enough to spark a small rally in stocks,"" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer, the Bahnsen Group in Newport Beach, California.
At 8:52 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 349 points, or 1.01%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 55 points, or 1.25%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 240.25 points, or 1.69%.
The major indexes have had a rocky start to 2022, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC down over 11.8% so far this year as geopolitical tensions rattled investors' sentiment already hit by worries over aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed to combat surging inflation.
Data on Tuesday showed U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in January as supply chains remained snarled, another sign that high inflation could persist through much of this year.
""Those are bad numbers,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.
""The Fed is going to have to start to handle (rising inflation) quickly, and the quicker they do it, the worse it's going to be for the stock market.""
Markets are pricing a 60.5% chance of a 50 basis point hike and a 39.5% chance of a 0.25% hike at the central bank's March meeting. Minutes from the Fed's January policy meeting are due on Wednesday.
Arista Networks ANET.N jumped 8.3% after the cloud infrastructure supplier forecast current-quarter revenue above estimates.
A $5.4 billion deal to buy Israeli chipmaker Tower Semiconductor TSEM.TA sent shares of Intel Corp INTC.O up by 1.1%. The deal gives Intel access to more specialised production, better positioning it to take advantage of demand for semiconductors.
Shares of other chipmakers also rose, with Nvidia Corp NVDA.O gaining 3.2% ahead of its results on Wednesday.
Battered travel stocks including those of carriers and cruise operators also rallied.
Marriott International Inc MAR.O added 3.2% after its fourth-quarter results topped analysts' expectations, as increasing vaccination rates and holiday-season traffic boosted occupancy rates across its hotels.

2022-02-14 00:00:00+00:00,"Down 30% From Its High, Is Nvidia a Buy?",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/down-30-from-its-high-is-nvidia-a-buy,,,"Shares of high-performance chip specialist Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are currently down by around 30% from the all-time high of $346.47 they hit in November.
Much of that drop-off can be attributed to traders shifting their funds away from growth stocks and into value stocks in response to the Federal Reserve's plans to hike interest rates and reduce its balance sheet in 2022. A stronger-than-expected January jobs report and surging inflation can be expected to strengthen the Fed's resolve to go ahead with tightening monetary policy -- and that's not a positive sign for capital-hungry growth companies.
Further, at its elevated valuation, Nvidia is also exposed to significant headline risk. Its stock price slid briefly Tuesday after news broke that it was abandoning its planned acquisition of mobile-chip designer Arm.
The U.S. Commerce Department has recently highlighted the fragile nature of the global semiconductor supply chain in 2022. However, the agency also expressed the possibility of new manufacturing capacity coming online as early as the second half of 2022, which may help somewhat in reducing the chip shortages. With Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and Samsung having already planned huge investments in capacity expansion, we may see increased pricing pressures in the semiconductor industry in the next few years.
While none of these challenges should be taken lightly, there are still many tailwinds that can make Nvidia a winning pick in 2022. Let's look at some important ones.

Gaming and data center segments remains unparalleled
Since fiscal 2019, ended Jan. 31, 2020, Nvidia's revenues and free cash flow have more than doubled, while gross margin and operating margin are up by 490 basis points and 920 basis points, respectively. This terrific growth has been mainly driven by increasing demand for the company's graphics cards and artificial intelligence (AI) processors in gaming and data center segments.
Nvidia currently accounts for almost 80% of the gaming GPU market. The company's GeForce RTX-powered laptops are being increasingly used not only in gaming but also in areas such as esports, digital content creation, and streaming. Nvidia estimates that only one-fourth of its installed base has adopted RTX GPUs. There remains much opportunity as existing GeForce gaming users continue to upgrade from legacy GTX cards to RTX laptops. Thanks to these tailwinds, Nvidia saw its gaming revenues jump 72% year over year to $9 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2021, ended Jan. 31, 2022.
Nvidia also accounted for almost 80.6% of the global cloud and data center AI processors market in 2020. With the company's chips considered the gold standard in high-performance computing, AI, edge computing, and analytics, Nvidia is well-poised to target the data center market estimated to be worth $100 billion by 2024. In the first nine months of fiscal 2021, the company's data center revenues soared by 53% year over year to $7.4 billion. Increasing revenue exposure to the data center segment is also helping improve the company's gross margin profile.
Automotive and the metaverse opportunities
The automotive business is increasingly seen as the next big growth catalyst for Nvidia. The company offers a complete platform solution, which includes hardware, software, and infrastructure (servers, computing power, and data centers) required to support autonomous vehicles. The company estimates its design win pipeline for autonomous driving and artificial intelligence cockpit platform to be over $8 billion. With Nvidia's automotive business generating only $441 million in revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2021, there is still much runway ahead for the company in the coming quarters.
Nvidia is also well-poised to capture a big chunk of the evolving metaverse opportunity, estimated to be in the range of $1 trillion to $30 trillion depending on the source. The company's high-throughput GPU chips, data center CPU, and next-generation Bluefield data processing unit will play a major role as the hardware technology needed to support the metaverse. Nvidia has also introduced a scalable, real-time software platform called Omniverse. It enables designers working on diverse software platforms to virtually collaborate and develop 3D simulations of real-time objects.
The recent pullback is an entry opportunity
Analysts expect Nvidia's revenues in fiscal 2022, ending Jan. 31, 2023, to be $31.54 billion, while generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share is expected to be $5.18.
Based on these forecasts, Nvidia is trading at 19.5 times fiscal 2022 revenues and 47.4 times fiscal 2022 earnings. Although not very low, these valuation multiples have declined significantly compared to their highs in November 2021.
Hence, against the backdrop of several secular tailwinds, a solid operational and financial model, and reduced valuation, Nvidia can be a smart pick in 2022.

Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) stock is getting a boost Monday as traders over on Reddit’s WallStreetBets take notice of the company.

WallStreetBets has been worth keeping an eye on for investors ever since they launched prices of GameStop, AMC Entertainment, and other meme stocks last year. Now, traders on the subreddit are spending a good bit of time talking about PLTR stock.
So what exactly are investors excited about with PLTR stock today? It’s likely that upcoming earnings news is serving as a catalyst for investors to pump up shares prior to its release.
Palantir Technologies is set to release its earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2021 on Thursday. That report will drop before markets open with a conference call taking place at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time that morning.
The 7 Highest Dividend Stocks for Income Investors
Investors watching for the earnings release on Thursday will want to keep a few financial targets in mind. Wall Street is looking for PLTR to post earnings per share of 4 cents on revenue of $413.99 million during the period. Some are expecting the American software company to easily beat these estimates while also posting a strong outlook for 2022.
It’s worth noting that the extra chatter for PLTR stock isn’t translating to heavy trading today. Instead, only about 28 million shares of the stock have changed hands. That’s a good bit below its daily average trading volume of about 42.5 million shares.
PLTR stock is up 2.1% as of Monday afternoon.

Let’s take a look at that news below!
These new EVs are being made in combination with Benteler EV Systems, Beep Inc., and Mobileye, which is an Intel company.
The EVs are shuttle buses that will fill micro-transit roles in urban areas.
The idea here is that these can assist with last-mile transportation.
That could help reduce road congestion while improving road safety and mobility access.
The goal is for these to operate in the U.S. starting in 2024.
Intel’s big contribution to these plans is Mobileye’s experience with creating autonomous systems for vehicles.
That includes having shipped over 100 million of its computer vision solutions for the driving-assistance market.
It also already has autonomous fleets operating across several countries.
Among those are Israel, Germany, Japan, China, France, and the U.S.

Hinrich Woebcken, an advisory Board member at Beep, as well as the former CEO of Volkswagen North America, said this about the EV plans.
“Multipassenger micro-transit needs are ever-increasing in our cities and towns globally and must be addressed in order to reduce road congestion, protect the environment and provide safe, reliable mobility for all to access. Bringing to market an affordable, automotive-grade, electric, autonomous mover is a solution that will transform mobility as we know it today.”
INTC stock started off strong this morning on the EV news. However, shares have slipped since then and are currently down roughly 1% as of Monday afternoon.

San Francisco, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Intel Corp's INTC.O Mobileye unit plans to build and deploy self-driving electric shuttle vehicles with its partners in the United States in 2024, in a bid to scale up its automated driving systems beyond taxis and delivery vehicles, executives told Reuters.
Mobileye, Benteler EV Systems and Beep will launch the on-demand driverless shuttles, which will feature 12 to 14 seats and no steering wheel or pedal.
The shuttles will be operated in ""contained geo-fenced areas"" where speed limits are 35 miles an hour or less, Hinrich Woebcken, advisory board member for Beep, a mobility service provider, said.
They expect to have a couple of hundred of the vehicles on U.S. roads in the first year of their deployment, with a goal to boost the number to between 10,000 and 15,000 globally, the executives said.
Mobileye plans to deploy robotaxis in Israel and Germany by the end of this year pending regulatory approval. It is also working with Silicon Valley startup Udelv to put automated electric delivery vehicles into service in the United States by 2023.
Mobileye will prove to U.S. federal and state regulators that its self-driving system would be safer than a human driver, said Johann Jungwirth, vice president of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) at Mobileye.
""On a technology perspective, we feel very, very bullish and very strongly that the technology is actually close to being ready,"" he said.
The executives said shuttles will help save on driver costs and address driver shortages, as well as addressing urban problems such as emissions and congestion.
""We see the interesting opportunities and growth of this autonomous mover, autonomous shuttle market. So we see it as a blue ocean,"" Marco Kollmeier, managing director of Benteler EV Systems GmbH, said.
Benteler EV Systems, part of German automotive parts group Benteler International AG, will build the shuttles that meet automotive industry and safety standards for public roads.

2022-02-14 00:00:00+00:00,AMD closes record chip industry deal with about $50-bln purchase of Xilinx,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-closes-record-chip-industry-deal-with-about-%2450-bln-purchase-of-xilinx,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
Feb 14 (Reuters) - Semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD)AMD.O said on Monday it has finalized the purchase of Xilinx Inc XLNX.O in a record chip industry deal valued at about $50 billion.
The closing of the deal comes on the heels of Nvidia Corp NVDA.O abandoning its plans to buy SoftBank-owned 9984.T Arm Ltd, citing regulatory hurdles.
AMD's transaction moved ahead with all necessary approvals for the acquisition, it said.
The deal, announced in October 2020, was originally valued at $35 billion, but the rise of AMD stock has pushed up the price tag, according to AMD.
The purchase of Xilinx helps AMD ""capture a larger share of the approximately $135 billion market opportunity we see across cloud, edge and intelligent devices,” said AMD CEO Lisa Su in a statement.
The transaction comes as AMD intensifies its battle with Intel Corp INTC.O in the data center chip market. The combined company will have over 15,000 engineers and a completely outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW.
The two U.S. companies have benefited from a more nimble approach to grabbing market share from Intel, which has struggled with internal manufacturing.
AMD has long been Intel's chief rival for central processor units (CPUs) in the personal computer business.
AMD's Su will lead the combined company as chief executive, with Xilinx's CEO Victor Peng as president of the newly formed Adaptive and Embedded Computing Group.
The companies expect the deal to generate $300 million in cost savings.

2022-02-14 00:00:00+00:00,Strong Graphic Chip Demand to Aid NVIDIA's (NVDA) Q4 Earnings,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/strong-graphic-chip-demand-to-aid-nvidias-nvda-q4-earnings,,,"NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Feb 16. The company’s fourth-quarter results are likely to reflect the benefits of strong demand for its graphic chips from gaming and data center markets.
NVIDIA is benefiting from the pandemic-induced work-from-home and online-learning wave. A surge in Hyperscale demand is a tailwind for the company’s data center business. Moreover, robust growth in the GeForce desktop and notebook graphics processing units (GPUs) is boosting NVDA’s gaming revenues.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the data center segment’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.17 billion, indicating a jump of 66% year over year and 8% sequentially. Its gaming division’s sales are expected to surge 35% year over year and 4% sequentially to $3.36 billion.
Click here to know how NVIDIA’s overall fiscal fourth-quarter performance is anticipated to be.
NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise

Strong Gaming Chip Demand
In the last reported quarter, revenues from the gaming business unit shot up 42% year over year and 5% sequentially to $3.22 billion on higher sales across the company’s notebook and desktop gaming GPUs and game console system-on-chips.
The pandemic-induced stay-at-home instructions are spurring demand for NVIDIA’s gaming chips as people are surfing games to stay engaged and entertained indoors.
Additionally, better visualization and speed are needed for a thrilling gaming experience, which NVIDIA successfully provides through its portfolio of Pascal architecture-based GPUs. Moreover, with the massive emergence of multiplayer online games and Gaming-as-a-Service concepts, demand for GPUs has been shooting up exponentially. The trend is likely to have positively impacted Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) NVDA’s gaming business during the to-be-reported quarter.
You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Continued Momentum in Data Center Business
The data center business presents solid growth opportunities for NVIDIA. As more businesses are shifting to the cloud, the need for data centers is surging. This is likely to have supported NVIDIA’s quarterly performance. The increase in Hyperscale demand and growing adoption in the inference market are anticipated to have acted as tailwinds as well.
The rising adoption of Conversational AI among hyperscale customers is likely to have been a key driver during the period in discussion. NVDA considers Conversational AI to be a powerful catalyst for the company in both training and inference. Also, the rising adoption of Natural Language Processing by cloud players is expected to have been an upside during the fiscal fourth quarter.
Additionally, NVIDIA’s data center business is likely to have continued the growth momentum during the fourth quarter on the accelerated adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the remote-working and online-learning trends.
Lockdown, travel restrictions and social-distancing measures adopted by governments worldwide to contain the spread of COVID-19 have boosted the usage of online and e-commerce services globally. Also, the pandemic-induced work-and-learn-from-home wave is stoking demand for cloud storage. Therefore, data center operators are enhancing their capacities to accommodate this demand spike for cloud services.
The growing adoption of the company’s T4 GPU in public clouds makes NVIDIA optimistic. Solid public cloud deployments and higher demand for AI video analytics applications are fueling demand for its T4 GPUs.
Strong Earnings Season for Semiconductors
Strong chip demand amid the ongoing work-and-learn-from-home and accelerated digitalization trends has led to a great earnings season for semiconductor companies. Let’s take a quick look at the latest quarterly performance of major semiconductor players – Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Qualcomm QCOM and Intel INTC.
Advanced Micro Devices’ adjusted earnings increased 77% year over year to 92 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2021 and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.7%. Revenues of Advanced Micro Devices surged 49% to $4.83 billion, exceeding the consensus mark by 6.7%.
Advanced Micro Devices expects first-quarter 2022 revenues of $5 billion (+/-$100 million), which indicates year-over-year growth of 45% and a quarter-over-quarter improvement of 4%. For 2022, AMD expects revenues to increase 31% year over year to $21.5 billion.
Qualcomm’s first-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings of $3.23 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22 cents. Also, Qualcomm’s non-GAAP revenues of $10.7 billion beat the consensus mark of $10.45 billion.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, Qualcomm expects GAAP revenues between $10.2 billion and $11 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) for QCOM’s second-quarter fiscal 2022 are forecast in the range of $2.80-$3.00.
Intel’s fourth-quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings of $1.09 per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 21.1%. Non-GAAP revenues of Intel were up 3.5% year over year at $19.53 billion and surpassed the consensus mark by 6.7%.
For the first quarter of 2022, Intel expects non-GAAP revenues of about $18.3 billion. INTC projects non-GAAP EPS of 80 cents for the first quarter.
While Advanced Micro Devices sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present, Qualcomm and Intel carry a Zacks Rank #2 and #3 (Hold), respectively.

The demand for semiconductor chips is tremendous and growing, while the world’s largest chipmakers are rushing to dramatically increase their production. That makes Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) stock a great play here.
Source: Shutterstock
The company, which makes equipment used in semiconductor production, also has a lot of fans on Wall Street.
Multiple analysts are very bullish on the shares, while the stock’s valuation is reasonable. Taken together, these points make Applied Materials very attractive for some tech investors looking for exposure to the chip space.
With semiconductor sales forecasted to jump 9% in 2022, the demand for chips is obviously expected to surge. That’s hardly a surprise, given the increase in the number of connected devices owned by those in developed countries.
Meanwhile, a slowdown in the demand for PCs has been seen as one of the main threats to AMAT stock and other names in the chip sector.
Hard-disk drive maker Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) recently reported that  PC demand has remained strong, and that shipment forecasts are robust and ahead of pre-pandemic levels.
7 Industrial Stocks to Buy As Tech Stocks Tumble
Meanwhile, a number of the world’s largest chipmakers are increasing their capacity to meet the surging demand for semiconductors.
In April 2021, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), announced it would spend $100 billion by 2024 to support the manufacturing and R&D of advanced semiconductor technologies.
For its part, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) plans to spend $20 billion on two new chip plants in Arizona.
Research firm Bain predicts the capital spending among chipmakers over 2021-2025 will jump almost 100% above 2016-2020 production levels.
It may take another year or two for Applied Materials’ results to benefit a great deal from these production increases. Still, for patient, long-term investors, that’s not a problem. Moreover, the market could start pricing the positive, long-term production outlook into AMAT stock just six months from now.
Multiple Analysts Are Upbeat on AMAT Stock
In December, Cowen analyst Krish Sankar named Applied Materials a top pick for 2022. Sankar expects the company to benefit from stepped-up spending on chipmaking equipment.
“We believe product momentum should help AMAT ride the waves of memory and foundry/logic (chip) spending,” Sankarsaid. The analyst placed an “outperform” rating and a $190 price target on the shares.
Also upbeat was Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis, calling Applied Materials one of the top names in the chip-equipment sector. Lipacis predicted that the company’s free cash flow would jump 34% this year. The analyst expects its free cash flow to remain strong for many years to come.
Lipacis started coverage of the shares with a “buy” rating and a $197 price target. AMAT trades around $132 today.
Citi analyst Atif Malik named AMAT stock as his top pick in the semiconductor sector. Malik expects the company to benefit from increased spending on chipmaking equipment, as well as higher  government spending on chips.
The Bottom Line
The company is well-positioned to benefit from the strong demand and rapidly increasing supply dynamics in the semiconductor sector. Analysts’ bullishness on the company also reflects well on it.
Applied Materials also has a reasonable valuation. The price-to-earnings ratio is only 22, according to Marketwatch.
I see the shares as a good play for long-term investors with intermediate risk tolerance who are looking for exposure to the semiconductor space.
Those with low risk tolerance should buy the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQGM:SOXX).

U.S. inflation hit a 39-year high of 7%, and to curb this inflation, the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates as many as seven times in 2022, according to Wall Street.
These measures may bring inflation down to 4.6% this year, but will have adverse effects on the stock market. In a situation of rising interest rates, investors prefer to invest in safer and more defensive options, such as fixed income or defensive equities.
Indeed, high-growth stocks are frequently among the S&P 500’s top performers. However, inflation fears and supply chain problems could result in an upending of valuations this year. At least, that’s the worry many growth investors have. Accordingly, the search for top defensive growth stocks is on.
7 Industrial Stocks to Buy As Tech Stocks Tumble
As it happens, there are a number of great defensive growth options in today’s market. However, paring down one’s list into seven top options may be difficult.
Here are seven of my top picks, as far as long-term, defensive growth stocks go. These are all companies I think are worth a look in February on the recent market turmoil, given these companies’ excellent long-term prospects.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT)
International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN)
Ford (NYSE:F)
Atmos Energy (NYSE:ATO)
Defensive Growth Stocks to Buy: Walmart (WMT)

Retail giant and the world’s largest private-sector employer, Walmart accounts for 9% of the USA’s retail sales. Even though WMT only grew 0.39% in the past year at the time of writing, this retail king remains amongst the market’s best defensive stocks because of its continuous expansion.
To counter the pandemic blues and takeover its e-commerce rivals, Walmart launched a subscription service like Amazon Prime.
Through Walmart Plus, users can order groceries, electricals, and various other goods at discounted rates and get them delivered within a day. This doubling-down on e-commerce is one of the key defensive factors many investors like with Walmart. Should shoppers fail to return to stores en masse, the hope is that online ordering will continue to provide for growth.
Rising inflation has hurt input costs, which Walmart has had to pass on to customers. However, looking at the company’s recent results, it’s clear that customers were willing to accept these higher prices.
Walmart pushed through supply chain issues, delivering revenue growth of 4.3% this past quarter, totaling more than $140 billion. Importantly, e-commerce sales rose 8%, and same-store sales rose 9.2%. These are very bullish numbers, spurring strong performance with WMT stock.
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)

This company might not be as famous as it was five years ago, but IBM is known for being consistent.
It has had its fair share of ups and downs but displays the potential to bounce back.
International Business Machines provides services like hardware, software, and cloud solutions. With its impressive dividend yield of 4.8%, 41 hedge fund holders include IBM in their portfolios. The company’s cash flows currently comfortably cover this dividend.

However, investors may want to look forward to this company’s growth profile. Over the past quarter, IBM brought in revenue growth of 6.5%, a meaningful amount in the post-pending world. Earnings per share also beat estimates, leading to a bullish outlook on this stock.
This is one large-cap “legacy” company that’s worth a look at these levels. Should the company continue to grow its cloud business, IBM could be a sleeper stock at these levels.
Defensive Growth Stocks to Buy: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

With a dividend that has increased for 59 consecutive years, Johnson & Johnson is a true Dividend Aristocrat. This dividend (currently yeilding around 2.5%), has provided investors in JNJ stock with stability for decades. I don’t expect that to change any time soon.
A true global conglomerate in the consumer staples and pharma space, Johnson & Johnson provides a business model that’s very defensive. Since JNJ consumer products are considered essentials, JNJ stock has been one of the steadier large-cap stocks out there during the pandemic.
For those worried about volatility moving forward, JNJ stock is a great pick. This company’s recent results show just how strong the company’s core business is.
Johnson & Johnson brought in double-digit revenue and earnings growth, beating expectations and bouncing materially on these results.
I think more of this is to come. As the company’s medical devices and pharmaceutical businesses expand, investors essentially pick up this exposure for free. This is more than a vaccine stock, and investors are starting to catch on.
Intel Corporation (INTC)

A massive supplier of semiconductor chips mainly used in the PC sector, Intel has been hit by a number of headwinds of late.
There are the macro-related headwinds hitting all stocks, but Intel’s market share has been eroded by competition. There are also concerns that its margins may not be as robust as investors initially thought.
Rivals such as AMD and Nvidia have established market dominance. Combine this with chip shortage worries, and the potential for competitors to pick up market share, and investors have what appears to be a listing proposition.
The 7 Highest Dividend Stocks for Income Investors
However, INTC stock has held up quite well over the past five years. Indeed, this company has proven to be a bond-like play on technological growth.
With a dividend yield of 3% at the time of writing, Intel provides investors with steady income over time, along with some small capital appreciation upside potential.
For defensive investors looking to benefit from long-term growth trends, Intel is a stock worth considering. This company is more of a dividend play than anything else in my book. However, for stability, there are few better options in this space, in my view, at this valuation.
Defensive Growth Stocks to Buy: Amgen (AMGN)

As the world’s largest biotech drugmaker Amgen is also an excellent option for investors seeking defensive growth stocks.
Amgen’s performance in 2021 created negative investor sentiment, but AMGN is back on its upward trend and is trading at just below $230 after falling to $198 in November.
With its above-average dividend yield and recent drug approvals, Amgen could outperform the broader market for the remainder of 2022. Investors in this company enjoy an annual yield of 3.4%, which is highly appealing during a time of peak market uncertainties.
Furthermore, in May 2021, Food and Drug Administration approved Amgen’s lung cancer drug called Lumakras. By next year, this drug could bring in sales of $1.4 billion and be a game-changer in the market.
Additionally, another drug for severe asthma called Tezspire, which can treat millions of patients, was recently approved by the FDA.
Lastly, adding to its rebound journey is Amgen’s $365 million investment in a new packaging and assembly factor in Ohio. This will improve their production scale and help them attain a price target of $255 in 2022.
Ford (F)

After beating Tesla, Ford became the auto industry’s top growth stock in 2021. Despite market volatility and a massive chip shortage in the electric vehicle industry, F grew 136% last year.
It reached its two-decade peak of more than $25 per share last month but has since fallen precipitously since then. Analysts consider this correction vital for Ford’s future growth, and I tend to agree.
What makes the stocks of this automobile manufacturer interesting in 2022 is its focus on becoming a leader in the EV market.

By 2030, Ford aims to generate 40% of its revenue from its EV segment. To do this, the company is leveraging its most famous brands, the Mustang and the F-150 pickup. In 2021, Ford delivered 27,140 Mustang Mach-E EV SUVs, and it will begin the sale of F-150 Lightning in 2022.
In fact, Ford had to shut down orders for its $20,000 Maverick pickup truck as a result of consumer demand. This shows the potential that this company has in the EV market. Compared to its competitors, Ford has a higher brand value and a reasonable stock price.
With its promising dividend yield of 2% and tremendous growth potential, Ford can continue its 2021 momentum into 2022.
Defensive Growth Stocks to Buy: Atmos Energy (ATO)

This S&P 500 company’s stock has risen 12% in the last three months. Atmos Energy Corporation is currently trading at a fair value of $107 and offers an annual dividend yield of 2.5%, which has grown 8.8% since last year.
Investors in ATO have received constant dividend payments for the last five years, at an annual increase of 8.75%.
In 2022, Atmos’ business displays massive upside potential, with an estimated earnings growth of 6.84%. This company is one of the USA’s largest natural-gas distributors. In its final quarter of 2021, Atmos reported revenue of $568 million, which represents a 19.6% year-over-year increase.
Atmos distributes natural gas in nine states and to more than 1,400 communities. Thus, most of this company’s revenue comes from its distribution segment. Last quarter, it brought in $523.9 million and witnessed a 21.8% year-over-year growth.
ATO is a perfect choice for risk-averse investors who wish to steer clear of market volatility. More than 90% of ATO’s investors start earning returns within six months of investing, and 99% receive profits within 12-months. This year experts estimate Atmos to offer earnings of $5.47 per share.

2022-02-14 00:00:00+00:00,"Global chip sales hit record in 2021, will grow 8.8% in 2022 -SIA",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/global-chip-sales-hit-record-in-2021-will-grow-8.8-in-2022-sia,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
Feb 14 (Reuters) - The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) on Monday said that global chip sales hit a record in 2021 at $555.9 billion, up 26.2% on the year, and it forecast 8.8% growth for 2022 as chip makers continue to build up production capacity to meet demand.
""It’s still really trending very strongly towards increased demand. We're just not going to get this kind of slingshot effect that we had in the pandemic,"" said SIA CEO John Neuffer of the much slower growth projected for 2022.
Sales in 2020 grew 6.8% over the prior year, while 2021 was the first year since 2018 that the number of chips sold exceeded 1 trillion, he said.
While major semiconductor manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 5425.TWO, Samsung Electronics Co 005930.KS, and Intel Corp INTC.O have announced tens of billions of dollars in investments for new factories in the past year, Neuffer said the digitalization trend ramped up by the pandemic would continue to drive demand higher.
“We think in the foreseeable future that there’s going to be plenty of demand for us to do very, very aggressive plant construction,” he said.
In 2021 1.15 trillion semiconductors were sold, with the biggest growth among auto-grade chips that can withstand heat and other physical challenges, Neuffer said. Sales for that segment rose 34% over the prior year at $26.4 billion. Unit sales rose 33%, he said.
China remained the largest individual market for semiconductors, with sales totaling $192.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 27.1%, the SIA said.
