WASHINGTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The White House is seeking to improve President Joe Biden's low approval ratings by launching a campaign to highlight some of the recent key policy wins by the administration ahead of the November midterm elections.
Cabinet members of the Biden administration will be taking 35 trips to 23 states through the end of August, a memo showed on Monday. Biden will hold a fourth Cabinet meeting of his presidency before Labor Day. He will also head to Ohio to attend the groundbreaking of a new Intel INTC.O megaplant.
The memo said the White House will also organize ""hundreds of town halls and roundtables"" in collaboration with Democratic lawmakers in the Senate and the House of Representatives to highlight the recent legislative wins.
Biden's public approval, while rising last week to its highest level since early June, still remains very low as only 40% of Americans approve of his performance, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll completed last Tuesday.
Biden's approval rating has been below 50% since August last year as Americans grapple with high inflation and an economy still scarred by the COVID-19 crisis.
Biden's Democrats face an uphill battle to retain their narrow control of the House and Senate in the Nov. 8 elections. However, Democratic victories in recent weeks on major legislative priorities like climate change, gun control, semiconductors and drug pricing as well as falling gasoline prices and tempered inflation have given Biden and his team hope that voters will not turn their backs on the party in November.
A $430 billion bill, seen as the biggest climate package in U.S. history, was passed this month by Congress and will soon be signed into law by Biden.
Political analysts have said that Republicans are poised to win a majority in the House, but the race for control of the Senate appears much closer.
Republican control of one or both chambers could thwart much of Biden's legislative agenda for the second half of his four-year term.
Details of the travel and media campaign plan were outlined in a White House memo from Deputy Chief of Staff Jen O'Malley Dillon and senior adviser Anita Dunn to Chief of Staff Ron Klain.
Biden approval rises to 40%, highest in two months, Reuters/Ipsos shows
Flush with wins, finally COVID-free, Biden to hit the road ahead of U.S. midterms

2022-08-14 00:00:00+00:00,Should Nvidia and AMD Investors Worry About Intel's Dire Warning About Chip Demand?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-nvidia-and-amd-investors-worry-about-intels-dire-warning-about-chip-demand,,,"A lot of hope is being placed in Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) Foundry Services business and for good reason. It's not just a pillar of chipzilla's plan to recapture semiconductor industry dominance, it's also an important endeavor as countries around the globe try to localize chip manufacturing.
But Intel has fallen on hard times, and it hasn't provided a super rosy outlook for the immediate path ahead. Numerous other chip companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and memory chipmaker Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) have stated that some end markets for semiconductors (consumer electronics like PCs and smartphones in particular) are in decline after a couple of years of record spending during the pandemic.
In terms of overall sales, Intel is still a titan. But does its latest warning spell trouble for top growth names Nvidia and AMD?
Intel's big competition problem
First, a quick primer on the chip industry and how it works. Intel rose to dominance over decades by handling all of its own chip design, manufacturing, and distribution. Over the decades, though, some smaller chip companies began to focus on a specialty, handling either just design (known as a ""fabless"" chip business, essentially an engineering firm) or manufacturing (known as ""chip fabs,"" with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) now being by far the largest).
Meanwhile, Intel's operating model of vertical integration has been steadily in decline in recent years. Companies like Nvidia and AMD, which solely focus their resources on design work, have leap-frogged Intel on the technological front. And specialists like Taiwan Semiconductor have done a superb job building up their capabilities as trusted third-party manufacturing partners for fabless peers. For a long while, Intel was able to mask the fact that smaller companies had caught up on the technological front thanks to its massive scale (it's easy for customers to keep buying more Intel chips if old Intel chips are what need replacing) and high profit margins.
But after a decade of cloud computing development, the pandemic set off a massive wave of IT infrastructure upgrades. Intel's outdated hardware was not prepared to take advantage of the boom over the last couple of years, and now a cyclical downturn in consumer electronics is cropping up. Intel revenue in Q2 2022 fell 22% year over year to $15.3 billion, and operating margin went from a positive 28% a year ago to a negative 4.6% in Q2 this year.
The full-year 2022 outlook isn't great either. Intel expects overall revenue to decline 16% from 2021 at the midpoint of guidance, and for earnings per share to be cut in half.
A deteriorating economy can certainly be blamed for the dreadful quarter and outlook. Other chip companies are suffering too. But even Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger admitted Intel's problems aren't everyone else's problems.
""The sudden and rapid decline in economic activity was the largest driver of the shortfall, but Q2 also reflected our own execution issues in areas like product design, DCAI [data center and AI group] and the ramp of AXG [accelerated computing and graphics group] offerings.""
It's a humble admission from Gelsinger, but the issues really predate his return as CEO in early 2021. Check out how Intel's operating segments have done against smaller Nvidia and AMD's comparable segments in the last couple of years.

Things might get bad for everyone, but especially Intel
The immediate-term outlook isn't great for the entire semiconductor space that sells to the consumer electronics end-market. However, Intel's forecast is particularly troubling. On the consumer side, new processors are set to launch later this year -- just in time for the global consumer to wind down its two-year work-from-home spending boom on PCs and laptops. And on the data center end, the part of the industry that's still hot right at the moment, Gelsinger had more bad news on the last earnings call:
""Turning to DCAI [data center and AI group], as we stated at investor day, over the next couple of years, as we rebuild our server product portfolio, we expect to grow slower than the overall data center market. It's not a fact we like but the forecast we see.""
Basically, AMD and Nvidia could be in for some tough times on their consumer-facing product portfolio -- for AMD, in processors and graphics chips, and graphics chips for Nvidia. For the time being, data centers and other enterprise AI should keep Nvidia and AMD on a growth trajectory. That doesn't appear to be the case for Intel, as it itself expects to lose market share to its competitors for the next couple of years.
Nvidia and AMD shareholders should pay attention to Intel's warning on weakening demand for chips. However, Intel's troubles are unique and not reflective of the semiconductor industry overall. Plus, Intel is focusing much of its investments on Foundry Services, a sub-industry of the chip world that its peers don't participate in. Intel Foundry Services made up less than 1% of total revenue in Q2, and will take years to ramp up to be a meaningful part of the business. In the meantime, I expect Nvidia and AMD's superior chip design portfolio to be far more resilient during the upcoming consumer electronics cyclical downturn than Intel will be.

2022-08-13 00:00:00+00:00,3 Semiconductor Stocks That Could Help Set You Up for Life,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-semiconductor-stocks-that-could-help-set-you-up-for-life,,,"Many semiconductor stocks slumped this year as investors fretted over concerns about slowing sales of PCs and smartphones, the potential overproduction of chips in response to the global chip shortage, and more conservative enterprise spending in a tougher macro environment. Rising interest rates exacerbated that pressure by driving investors away from higher-growth tech stocks.
As a result, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector index has declined about 24% this year as the S&P 500 retreated just 12%. However, investors who can tune out the near-term noise should still pick up some semiconductor stocks as the bulls shun the sector -- since the global demand for new chips will likely pick up again and accelerate over the long term.
Image source: Getty Images.
I personally believe these three well-balanced semiconductor stocks are great ways to profit from that secular trend: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), which is more commonly known as TSMC, the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML), and the diversified American chipmaker Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN).
1. TSMC
TSMC is the largest and most technologically advanced contract chipmaker in the world. Its 5nm and 7nm nodes are currently used to manufacture the world's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips for ""fabless"" chipmakers like Apple, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and Nvidia. It plans to start mass producing 3nm chips later this year and move on to 2nm chips by 2025.
TSMC generated 51% of its revenue from its 5nm and 7nm nodes in the second quarter, and that percentage should continue to rise next year. It still generated 38% of its revenue from the smartphone market -- which leaves it exposed to a cyclical downturn in handset sales -- but it's also diluting that concentration by accepting more orders from the HPC (high-performance computing), data center, automotive, and Internet of Things (IoT) markets.
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) wants to catch up to TSMC in the process race by 2025, but TSMC plans to maintain its lead by boosting its annual capex by $10 billion to $40 billion this year. Even with its forthcoming subsidies from the CHIPS Act, Intel will likely struggle to match TSMC's spending power.
TSMC is bracing for slower near-term growth as the chip sector faces a cyclical slowdown, but its stock is still cheap at 13 times forward earnings and its growth should eventually accelerate again.
2. ASML
TSMC is able to maintain its technological superiority because it started installing ASML's top-tier EUV (extreme ultraviolet) photolithography machines long before Intel and other major foundries.
Photolithography systems are used to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers, and ASML is now the industry's market leader. It's also the only producer of EUV systems -- which cost up to $200 million each and are required to manufacture the smallest and densest chips. Its next-gen ""high-NA"" EUV systems will enable TSMC and other foundries to eventually manufacture chips beyond the 2nm node.
ASML's monopolization of a key chipmaking technology makes it a linchpin of the semiconductor sector and gives it tremendous pricing power. Like TSMC, it expects to experience a near-term slowdown as the market's appetite for new chips wanes.
Yet ASML still expects to generate 24 billion to 30 billion euros ($31 billion) in revenue by 2025 -- based on its ""low"" and ""high"" expectations for the chip market -- which implies its top line could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of up to 13% over the next four years. Its stock isn't cheap at more than 40 times forward earnings, but its market dominance easily justifies that premium valuation.
3. Texas Instruments
Like Intel, Texas Instruments is an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) which manufactures most of its own chips instead of outsourcing them to third-party foundries like TSMC. It also produces most of its chips domestically -- which qualifies it for big subsidies under the CHIPS Act.
However, TI doesn't manufacture high-end chips like Intel or TSMC. Instead, it mainly produces lower-end analog and embedded chips which are used for power management and wireless features. These chips cost less to manufacture than more advanced chips, but they're just as important and widely used by TI's automotive, industrial, personal electronics, communications, and enterprise customers.
TI generates most of its growth from the automotive and industrial markets -- which together accounted for 62% of its revenue last year -- so it isn't heavily exposed to the recent headwinds in the PC and smartphone markets. It's also been upgrading its plants from 200mm to 300mm wafers to reduce the costs of its unpackaged parts by about 40%.
TI's broad diversification, scale, and consistent gross margin expansion enable it to generate plenty of cash for big buybacks and dividends. That's how it reduced its share count by 46% between 2004 and 2021 while raising its dividend annually for 18 straight years. It's also grown its free cash flow per share at an average annual rate of 12% during that same period.
In other words, TI is a great blue-chip stock to buy and hold for investors who simply don't want to worry about all the cyclical headwinds or the ongoing capex wars between the top-tier chipmakers.

Editor's note: This article has been corrected. RingCentral provides software as a service (SaaS) solutions that help businesses keep their  workforces connected. 
Even with some recent recovery in the market, many growth stocks are down precipitously from their highs. The growth-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is still teetering on the edge of a bear market, but for investors willing to take on potential volatility, the good news is that some very promising businesses are still trading at huge valuation discounts.
To help put investors on the trail of growth stocks capable of delivering explosive returns, a panel of Motley Fool contributors has profiled top picks trading at attractive valuation levels. Read on to see why they believe long-term investors can score big wins by investing in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.80%), Cloudflare(NET -0.36%), and RingCentral (RNG -4.40%) at today's prices. 
A lesson in growth versus value
Daniel Foelber (Advanced Micro Devices): AMD stock is down nearly 40% from its all-time high, which is worse than the 27% decline the iShares Semiconductor ETF has endured. However, AMD continues to gobble up market share and grow its top and bottom lines at a breakneck pace while sustaining a high gross profit margin. The five-year chart says it all, as AMD's trailing-12-month revenue has more than tripled in five years, and profits have increased more than 37-fold.
AMD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
AMD's most recent quarter included better-than-expected results and strong long-term guidance that supports the narrative that AMD continues to take market share from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in the PC processor industry. For several years now, AMD has underpromised and overdelivered while Intel has spent the better part of the last decade facing delays, failed projects, and slowing growth. Intel stock has paid the price, underperforming the market in recent years, and has failed to pass its all-time high set in the year 2000, right before the dot-com bust. Intel has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 7.5 and a dividend yield of 4.1%, while AMD's P/E ratio is a much more expensive 42.5 and it doesn't pay a dividend.
AMD stands out as the better company and the faster grower, while Intel is the cheaper stock with a dividend to boot. But Intel believes the worst is behind it. On its second-quarter 2022 earnings call, Intel CFO David Zinsner said: ""the market turbulence and updated outlook are disappointing. However, we believe our turnaround is clearly taking shape and expect Q2 and Q3 to be the financial bottom for the company.""
Unfortunately for Intel, it failed to embrace the smartphone revolution and has fallen behind in its core categories. The chip business is extremely fast-growing where just a few years make a big difference. AMD has given investors every sign that it is leading the next wave of semiconductor technology, while Intel has given every reason why it should continue to underperform. Until Intel can make good on its promises, AMD stands out as the better buy despite being a more expensive stock. Comparing AMD to Intel is a good lesson in what ""value"" really means. If AMD continues to gain market share, it could one day surpass Intel in revenue and earnings. Long-term investors are more interested in where a company will be in 10 years than where it is today. Under that logic, AMD seems like a better value than Intel even though its current earnings relative to its market cap are much lower.
Invest in the evolution of the internet
Keith Noonan (Cloudflare): When it comes to making sure your favorite internet destinations are accessible and running smoothly, few companies are more important than Cloudflare. The web specialist provides content delivery network (CDN) services that speed up the ability to send and access internet information. It also provides protection from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, as well as a variety of other cloud-based software offerings that help ensure users are able to smoothly access websites and applications. 
However, Cloudflare also has a highly growth-dependent valuation, and it's seen dramatic sell-offs as inflation, rising interest rates, and other factors have caused investors to become much more risk averse. The stock now trades down roughly 64.5% from the lifetime high that it hit last November.
Despite the big sell-off, Cloudflare has continued to post impressive business results and looks primed for more big growth over the long term. Sales climbed 54% year over year in the second quarter to reach $234.5 million, and the company increased its large-customer count by 212 to reach 1,749 in the period. With large customers now accounting for 60% of sales, Cloudflare's growth engine is looking very strong, and the business's non-GAAP (adjusted) gross margin of 78.9% last quarter points to big earnings growth potential down the line. 
The business should be able to continue posting strong sales growth because it's providing services that are virtually essential for the information age. With more websites and applications coming online all the time, and internet services only becoming more central to business and everyday communications, Cloudflare stock looks primed to deliver big wins for long-term investors.
That's opportunity ringing your doorbell
James Brumley (RingCentral): I understand why investors began selling their RingCentral shares in earnest early last year. The virtual-meeting and online-collaboration company's stock soared during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were spending so much more time working at home rather than at the office. Once lockdowns began to ease, though, the market began to understand that this ticker's 2020 run-up of 124% following 2019's 100% advance was simply too much, too fast.
This stock's 89% pullback from 2021's peak, however, is just as over-the-top... for the opposite reason.
Largely lost in the noise of all this volatility is that this company is still growing, and doing so mostly thanks to its subscription business.
Last quarter's numbers put things in perspective. The top line was up 28% year over year, pushing non-GAAP profits up from $0.32 per share to $0.45. The company's looking for revenue growth along the same lines for the remainder of the year, but RingCentral upped its profit guidance from a range of $1.83 to $1.87 to a range of $1.91 to $1.95 per share for 2022. Notably, subscription revenue accounts for 95% of its total top line now, which is usually high-margin revenue since once they're in the fold these customers don't need to be won over again.
In this vein, a big increase in sales and marketing spending is the key reason the company's still losing money under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
For investors who can look further down the road, the opportunity is there. It's just going to take a little more for RingCentral to achieve the scale it needs. With the bulk of its value being wiped away, however, the stock could start to rebound well before that happens, in anticipation of such a development.

2022-08-12 00:00:00+00:00,SK Hynix to break ground on new U.S. chip packaging plant early next year -sources,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sk-hynix-to-break-ground-on-new-u.s.-chip-packaging-plant-early-next-year-sources-0,,,"By Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - South Korea's SK Hynix aims to select a U.S. site for its advanced chip packaging plant and break ground there around the first quarter of next year, two people familiar with the matter said, helping the United States to compete as China pours money into the burgeoning sector.
The plant, whose estimated cost would be ""several billions,"" would ramp up to mass production by 2025-2026 and employ about 1,000 workers, one of the sources said, declining to be named because details about the plant have not been made public.
It would likely be located near a university with engineering talent, the person said.
The company is ""hoping to make a selection of the site and break ground somewhere around the first quarter of next year,"" one of the people said.
SK Group, South Korea's second-biggest conglomerate, owns memory chipmaker SK Hynix 000660.KS and announced the new plant last month as part of a $22 billion U.S.-based investment package in semiconductors, green energy and bioscience projects.
The announcement, heralded by the White House, said $15 billion would be allocated to the semiconductor industry through research and development programs, materials, and the creation of an advanced packaging and testing facility.
""R&D investments will include building out a nationwide network of R&D partnerships and facilities,"" the source said, adding that the packaging facility would package SK Hynix's memory chips with logic chips designed by other U.S. companies for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.
The company, following the Reuters story about the timing of the groundbreaking, confirmed it plans to select a site for the plant in the first half of next year but said no decision has been made on when to begin construction.
The United States long ago ceded most basic, low value chip packaging operations to overseas factories mostly in Asia, where chips are placed into protective frames which are then tested before being shipped to electronics manufacturers.
But fresh battle lines are being drawn in the race to develop advanced packaging techniques, which involve placing different chips with different functions into a single package, enhancing overall capabilities and limiting the added cost of more advanced chips.
""While the United States and its partners have advanced packaging capabilities, China's massive investments in advanced packaging threaten to upend the market in the future,"" the White House said in a 2021 report.
An executive at China's top chipmaker SMIC 0981.HK, which was added to a U.S. trade blacklist in 2020, said last year Chinese companies should focus on advanced packaging to overcome their weaknesses in developing more sophisticated chips, according to the report.
SK Group's move comes after Biden signed into law the CHIPS Act this week, providing $52 billion in subsidies for chip manufacturing and research, as well as an estimated $24 billion investment tax credit for chip plants. The sources said the R&D facilities and the chip packaging plant would both qualify for the funding.
There has been a flurry of expansion plans announced by chipmakers in the United States in recent years, from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW to Samsung Electronics 005930.KS and Intel INTC.O.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-08-11 00:00:00+00:00,Sonos shares hit a low note on revenue forecast cut,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sonos-shares-hit-a-low-note-on-revenue-forecast-cut,,,"Aug 11 (Reuters) - Sonos Inc SONO.O shares tumbled about 17% on Thursday after the speaker maker cut its full-year revenue forecast, citing a weakness in consumer spending on electronic items ahead of the crucial holiday season.
Americans are spending money saved during the pandemic more on travel and other leisure-related activities rather than on discretionary items such as TVs and speakers, roiling the electronic industry.
""Changing consumer spending patterns influenced our retail partners' outlook who in turn are taking a cautious approach to their inventory position,"" Chief Executive Officer Patrick Spence told analysts on Wednesday.
Supply chain issues, which has been a bugbear of the industry for nearly two years now, continued to hurt Sonos' premium offerings such as its Amp and Beam speakers, while its newly launched speaker Ray was greeted with tepid demand.
""We were wrong to believe Sonos would be more insulated from macro weakness given their exposure to a higher-end consumer, and expect they will continue to face headwinds in the near-term,"" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said.
Sonos cut its annual revenue estimate to a range of $1.73 billion to $1.76 billion from $1.95 billion to $2 billion projected previously, echoing forecast cuts at chip suppliers including Micron Technology MU.O and Intel Corp INTC.O.
Sonos now expects inventory levels to improve only after the holiday quarter.
The company also said Brittany Bagley is stepping down as chief financial officer and that Chief Legal Officer Eddie Lazarus will take over the role on an interim basis.
Shares of California-based Sonos were trading at $18.96 in trading before the bell.

2022-08-10 00:00:00+00:00,Semiconductor ETFs Tumble: What Lies Ahead?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/semiconductor-etfs-tumble%3A-what-lies-ahead,,,"The semiconductor space saw brutal trading on Aug 9, after another chipmaker warned of slowing demand, sparking concerns that the industry might be heading into the worst downturn in at least a decade. Excessive valuation, excessive inventory build, and recession fears continued to weigh on the chip stocks.

As such, semiconductor ETFs like Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF PSI, First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF FTXL, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ and SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF XSD fell nearly 5% each on the day.
What Happened?
Memory-chip maker Micron Technology MU became the latest chipmaker to forecast weakening revenues. The company expects sales in the current quarter to be at the low end or below its target range. The move follows a similar announcement made by Nvidia NVDA last week when the graphics chipmaker slashed its revenue guidance for the fiscal second quarter on weak gaming-chip sales (read: Nvidia Tumbles on Fiscal Q2 Revenue Warnings: ETFs in Focus).

Intel Corp. INTC, Qualcomm QCOM and Sony Group also forecast weak sales on demand concerns for personal computers and phones.

The industry is currently facing a slowdown in demand for computer chips amid the PC market slump and many companies have boosted their inventories in response to supply-chain issues and labor shortages. Now, with demand slowing, companies may be forced to slash prices to get rid of those chips.

One analyst at Citigroup expects that semi stocks will fall by at least another 15% over the course of the year, as Wall Street analysts lowered their forecasts for profits during the earnings season.

Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (PSI)

Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF tracks the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index, holding 32 securities in its basket, with each making up less than 5.4% share.

Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF has AUM of $614.5 million and sees a moderate average daily volume of 27,000 shares. The expense ratio is 0.56%.

First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL)

First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF offers exposure to the most-liquid U.S. semiconductor securities based on volatility, value and growth by tracking the Nasdaq US Smart Semiconductor Index. FTXL holds 30 stocks in its basket, with none making up for more than 9% share.

First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF has accumulated $88.1 million in AUM. The average trading volume is light at around 11,000 shares and the expense ratio is 0.60%.

iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

iShares Semiconductor ETF follows the ICE Semiconductor Index and offers exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture and distribute semiconductors. It holds 30 securities in its basket, with each making up for less than 8% of assets and charging a fee of 40 bps a year from investors (read: Intel Misses Q2 Earnings Estimate, Cuts View: ETFs in Focus).

iShares Semiconductor ETF has amassed $7.6 billion in its asset base and trades in a volume of about 1 million shares a day.

Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXQ)

Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF tracks the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, holding 30 stocks in its basket. Each firm accounts for less than 9% share.

Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF has accumulated $65.5 million in its asset base. It charges 19 bps in annual fees and trades in an average daily volume of 43,000 shares.

SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD)

SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF offers exposure to the semiconductor segment of the broad technology sector and tracks the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index. It holds 39 stocks in its portfolio, with each making up for not more than a 456% share (read: 5 Top-Ranked ETFs That Outperformed in July).

SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF has AUM of $1.2 billion and an average daily volume of about 75,000 shares. It charges 35 bps in fees per year.
What Lies Ahead?
Despite the slide, the outlook for the industry looks promising provided the CHIPS and Science Act is signed into law by President Joe Biden.

The bill would provide $54 billion in grants for semiconductor manufacturing and research, tens of billions to support regional technology hubs and a tax credit covering 25% of investments in semiconductor manufacturing through 2026. As such, it will encourage investment in chip manufacturing and spur the innovation and development of other U.S. technologies. The bill would help the United States in reclaiming semiconductor industry competence lost to Taiwanese and Korean companies and challenged by the increasingly capable Chinese firms.

Spurred by the bill, many companies have announced more than $44 billion in new semiconductor manufacturing investments. Qualcomm has committed to spending $4.2 billion with chipmaker GlobalFoundries to build processors in New York. Micron will invest $40 billion in memory chip manufacturing capacity that would increase the chipmaker’s U.S. market share from 2% to 10%.  All these efforts should boost the domestic chip industry as the bill will ease supply-chain disruptions and lower the cost for the semiconductor industry. This has created a bullish sentiment in the space (read: Semiconductor ETFs to Buy Now).

Semiconductors have been the most important drivers of the overall growth in technology, given the use of chips in day-to-day life from cars, electronic gadgets to planes and weapons. The demand will continue to trend higher given the increased digitization in various corners like healthcare, transport, financial systems, defense, agriculture and retail, among others.

The rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology like cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, 5G and other advanced information technologies should continue to fuel growth. Further, the introduction of expensive and new generation chips has been leading to an enhancement in the product mix for semiconductors.

Further, the above-mentioned ETFs have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), suggesting that these have the potential to outperform in the coming months. About 60% of the industries falling under semiconductors have a solid Zacks Rank in the top 40%.  

Given the solid outlook but somewhat bearish near-term sentiments, investors may want to consider staying on the sidelines for the time being. However, risk-tolerant, long-term investors may want to consider this recent slump a buying opportunity, should they have the patience for extreme volatility.

2022-08-10 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks That Could Help Make You Richer,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-that-could-help-make-you-richer,,,"If you're like most investors, your ultimate goal is growing your current capital into a much bigger nest egg meant to be enjoyed down the road. If you're also like most investors though, you don't have time to keep constant tabs on your portfolio.
Good news! There are plenty of solid stocks out there that offer a nice balance of reliability with long-term upside potential. Your lack of time arguably works in your favor too, since these are the sorts of tickers best left alone to let time do its thing.
Here's a rundown of three such names well-positioned to power your portfolio to a size greater than you may even be envisioning.
Dollar General
At first blush it looks like just another brick-and-mortar retailer -- a business facing an unrelenting uphill battle. However, a closer look at Dollar General (NYSE: DG) reveals it's thriving for all the right reasons.
If you've never actually seen one, don't sweat it. It may be because the majority of the chain's 18,000-plus stores are located in communities with populations of less than 20,000, which tend to be underserved by bigger players like Kroger and Walmart. Yet three-fourths of U.S. residents live within five miles of a Dollar General, keeping them convenient for consumers looking to avoid a longer trip to a larger competitors' store. The average Dollar General locale's footprint is a modest 8,000 square feet as well, making them easy to get into and out of in a hurry.
The company isn't simply relying on a savvy location strategy to meet its growth goals, though. It's also thinking strategically about what one can find inside its stores. Unlike the average discounter, more and more Dollar General stores are carrying fresh foods like produce, eggs, and milk. Only a little over 2,100 stores currently offer this assortment, but Chief Operating Officer Jeff Owen commented in March that the ultimate goal was to eventually bring such staples to more than 10,000 locations. In the meantime, the retailer says it's still looking to open on the order of 1,100 new stores this year, and remodel more than 1,700.
It might have been difficult to believe a few years ago, but smaller, neighborhood-oriented general stores are looking like the future of retailing.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
While the worldwide semiconductor shortage is a problem for most tech companies, it's proving a boon for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM).
As the name suggests, this company makes much-needed microchips. Its customers are paying almost any price for access to any silicon wherever they can find it. That's why Taiwan Semiconductor's top line is expected to grow more than 30% this year following last year's 18% uptick.
The situation is prompting bold responses from the tech industry. Looking to avoid similar supply problems in the future, several key semiconductor companies are planning to produce more of their own microchips in-house rather than rely on third-party manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor. Samsung is investing billions of dollars in its own production facilities, for instance, while Intel is committing $88 billion to build more of its own microchip foundries all across Europe. A few other names in the business are following this lead, albeit less dramatically, calling the need for outsourced chipmaking into question.
What's being lost in the worry is that even once all this new production capacity is brought online years down the road, it will still barely make a dent in the world's annual need for new semiconductors. McKinsey estimates the annual semiconductor market -- a big chunk of which is already handled by third-party manufacturers -- will grow from 2021's $600 billion to more than $1 trillion by 2030.
Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor's most important customers like Apple, Qualcomm, and Advanced Micro Devices are among the tech names showing the least amount of interest in doing more in-house production of their own silicon. All in all, this should be good news for Taiwan Semiconductor.
Amazon
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is up by more than 1,000% over the past 10 years and over 19,000% for the past 20 years, making it one of the market's most rewarding names during that stretch.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results, of course. And this may be particularly true in the case of Amazon. There's only so much online shopping the world can do, and the company's perpetually paper-thin profit margins on its e-commerce operation has turned into a major problem this year. With shipping, payroll, and other costs being so high, the company's actually lost money by selling physical goods. Its year-to-date e-commerce loss in North America has reached $2.2 billion, with Amazon remaining in the red for both reported quarters. Internationally, selling goods online has led to more than a $3 billion loss in 2022.
It may not matter though, even if the company continues to lose money with its online marketplace. Its roots may be selling physical goods online, but that's no longer the company's core profit center. Although it only accounts for 16% of its revenue, Amazon Web Services produced nearly three-fourths of last year's income. Moreover, AWS's bottom line has only continued to grow this year.
And before you float the idea of Amazon ending its online-selling business to focus on its firmly profitable cloud computing venture, understand that e-commerce is still a means to an important end. Amazon leveraged the reach of its online marketplace to produce $31 billion worth of ad revenue supplied by many of the third-party sellers using the platform to promote their goods. Although the company didn't disclose how much of that revenue was turned into a profit, digital ad revenue tends to be high-margin.
It's an exciting, long-term growth prospect simply because Amazon is still figuring out how to make the most of both of these young initiatives.

2022-08-10 00:00:00+00:00,This Tech Stock Is a Screaming Buy Following 70% Growth Last Quarter,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-tech-stock-is-a-screaming-buy-following-70-growth-last-quarter,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) went into its second-quarter earnings report facing multiple headwinds in the form of a big slowdown in sales of personal computers (PCs) and softness in graphics card prices, but its numbers turned out to be better than expected.
AMD reported eye-popping growth when it released its results on Aug. 2, easing past consensus estimates thanks to the terrific demand for its chips that are used in data centers, computers, and gaming consoles, among others. Though the outlook was lighter than what Wall Street was looking for, AMD is on track to deliver outstanding growth in 2022. More importantly, it could sustain its hot growth for a long time to come, thanks to a bunch of impressive catalysts.
Let's see how AMD performed last quarter and why the stock remains an enticing bet right now.
AMD's market share gains are driving impressive growth
AMD's second-quarter revenue jumped 70% year over year to a record $6.6 billion as sales grew across all its business segments. The acquisition of Xilinx, which was completed in February this year, also contributed to this solid growth. More specifically, the Xilinx acquisition added $1.3 billion to AMD's embedded segment revenue, an increase of 2,228% over the prior year.
What's more, AMD's non-GAAP (adjusted) gross margin surged 640 basis points year over year, while the adjusted operating margin also increased by a similar margin to 30%. The fatter margins and the healthy top-line spike helped AMD increase its earnings by 67% to $1.05 per share last quarter. Analysts would have been content with earnings of $1.03 per share and revenue of $6.53 billion.
The stronger-than-expected performance from AMD isn't surprising as it was well placed to beat the weakness in the PC market. The chipmaker has been pursuing the premium end of the PC processor market, and that seems to have worked in its favor last quarter. Its client segment revenue, which includes sales of desktop and notebook processors and chips, increased 25% year over year to $2.2 billion.
AMD witnessed a one-percentage-point increase in its operating margin in this segment thanks to the rise in the average selling price (ASP) of its processors. AMD CEO Lisa Su pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that it gained market share in client processors yet again. The company has increased its share in PC processors for nine straight quarters at the expense of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
AMD reportedly controlled 36% of the PC processor market in the second quarter, with Intel holding the rest. It is worth noting that Intel's revenue from its client computing segment, which includes sales of desktop and notebook processors, was down a whopping 25% year over year in the second quarter to $7.66 billion. This makes it clear that AMD is enjoying a mix of stronger volumes and pricing power in the PC processor space. More importantly, it has room to gain more share with the launch of new chips on the horizon.
The data center business, however, was the star of the show as it reported an 83% year-over-year spike in revenue to $1.5 billion. The segment's operating margin also improved to 32% last quarter from 25% in the year-ago period. Su said on theearnings callthat the demand for AMD's server processors increased substantially over the prior-year period thanks to robust demand from both cloud and enterprise customers.
Su added, ""In [the] cloud, more than 60 new instances powered by third-gen EPYC processors launched in the quarter from AWS, Baidu, [Alphabet's] Google, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle, including the industry's first cloud-based software-as-a-service solution for chip design for Microsoft Azure and Synopsys, powered by our Milan-X processors with 3D stacked triplets.""
AMD controlled 11.6% of the server CPU market in the first quarter of 2022, and the company believes that it is set for more share gains in this segment with the launch of its upcoming processors. A closer look suggests that AMD is sitting on a massive opportunity in server processors that could supercharge the company's growth in the long run.
What about the outlook?
AMD's guidance for the current quarter fell short of consensus estimates. The company expects $6.7 billion in revenue this quarter, while analysts were looking for $6.84 billion. However, investors shouldn't forget that AMD's revenue would increase 55% year over year as per its guidance.
Also, the company's non-GAAP gross margin forecast of 54% for the current quarter points toward a nice improvement over the prior-year period's figure of 48%. Even better, AMD expects 60% revenue growth for the full year to $26.3 billion, which is higher than Wall Street's forecast of $26.2 billion.
Analysts are also upbeat about the company's long-term prospects, estimating 28% annual earnings growth for the next five years. That's not surprising, as AMD has a lot of room to gain more share against Intel in the server and PC markets.
Additionally, the company has an additional catalyst in the form of the video gaming market, where its semi-custom chips are used by major console manufacturers. All this indicates that AMD is a top growth stock to buy right now. The stock is trading at 43 times earnings, which represents a discount from its five-year average of 102.
Share prices of AMD have soared 36% in the past month. So, investors can buy AMD at a relatively attractive valuation right now before it jumps higher and becomes more expensive.

2022-08-09 00:00:00+00:00,"Biden signs bill to boost U.S. chips, compete with China",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biden-signs-bill-to-boost-u.s.-chips-compete-with-china,,,"By David Shepardson and Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Tuesday signed a landmark bill to provide $52.7 billion in subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production and research and to boost efforts to make the United States more competitive with China's science and technology efforts.
""The future is going to be made in America,"" Biden said, calling the measure ""a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself.""
Biden touted investments that chip companies are making even though it remains unclear when the U.S. Commerce Department will write rules for reviewing grant awards and how long it will take to underwrite projects.
Some Republicans joined Biden on the White House lawn to attend the signing of the chips bill that was years in the making in Congress.
The chief executives of Micron MU.O, Intel INTC.O, Lockheed Martin LMT.N, HP HPQ.N and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O attended the signing as did governors of Pennsylvania and Illinois, the mayors of Detroit, Cleveland and Salt Lake City, and lawmakers.
The White House said the bill's passage was spurring new chip investments. It noted that Qualcomm QCOM.Oon Monday agreed to buy an additional $4.2 billion in semiconductor chips from GlobalFoundries' GFS.O New York factory, bringing its total commitment to $7.4 billion in purchases through 2028.
The White House also touted Micron announcing a $40 billion investment in memory chip manufacturing, which would boost U.S. market share from 2% to 10%, an investment it said was planned with ""anticipated grants"" from the chips bill.
Progressives argued the bill is a giveaway to profitable chips companies that previously closed U.S. plants, but Biden argued Tuesday ""this law is not handing out blank checks to companies.""
The legislation aims to alleviate a persistent shortage that has affected everything from cars, weapons, washing machines and video games. Thousands of cars and trucks remain parked in southeast Michigan awaiting chips as the shortage continues to impact automakers.
A rare major foray into U.S. industrial policy, the bill also includes a 25% investment tax credit for chip plants, estimated to be worth $24 billion.
The legislation authorizes $200 billion over 10 years to boost U.S. scientific research to better compete with China. Congress would still need to pass separate appropriations legislation to fund those investments.
China had lobbied against the semiconductor bill. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said China ""firmly opposed"" it, calling it reminiscent of a ""Cold War mentality.""
Biden noted the United States needs chips for key weapons systems like Javelin missiles. ""It's no wonder the Chinese Communist Party actively lobbied U.S. business against this bill,"" Biden said.
Many U.S. lawmakers had said they normally would not support hefty subsidies for private businesses but noted that China and the European Union had been awarding billions in incentives to their chip companies. They also cited national security risks and huge global supply chain problems that have hampered global manufacturing.

2022-08-09 00:00:00+00:00,"China's Lenovo reports flat revenue, weakest in eight quarters",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chinas-lenovo-reports-flat-revenue-weakest-in-eight-quarters,,,"By Josh Ye
HONG KONG, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Lenovo Group 0992.HK, the world's biggest maker of personal computers, reported flat revenue for the April-June quarter when many Chinese cities were hit by COVID-19 lockdowns, marking its most subdued result in eight quarters.
Total revenue came in at $16.96 billion, in line with an average Refinitiv estimate of $16.87 billion drawn from seven analysts. Net income attributable to shareholders rose 11% to $516 million.
Lockdowns in China during the quarter dealt a blow to the PC supply chain, with major laptop manufacturing partners including Quanta 2382.TW, Compal 2324.TW and Wistron 3231.TW suffering significant manufacturing disruptions, according to a report by research firm Counterpoint.
It also coincided with the global PC industry coming off the pandemic-fuelled sales boom and the war in Ukraine, prompting several companies from chipmakers to electronics manufacturers such as Intel INTC.O and Samsung 005930.KS to warn of a sharp slowdown in demand.
Global shipments fell 11.1% in the past quarter from a year earlier, the largest year-over-year decline since the second quarter of 2013, according to Counterpoint.
Lenovo said in a statement that ""the PC market is currently experiencing short-term challenges.""
Counterpoint said Lenovo’s total PC shipments fell 12.7% to 17.4 million units largely due to weak consumer demand. However, Lenovo maintained its leadership in the global PC market with a 24.4% share.
But strong demand from companies to upgrade their digital capability has fuelled growth in Lenovo’s server and other non-PC business. The company reported 37% revenue growth in its non-PC business during the quarter.

2022-08-09 00:00:00+00:00,"Biden to sign bill to boost U.S. chips, compete with China",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biden-to-sign-bill-to-boost-u.s.-chips-compete-with-china,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Tuesday will sign a bill to provide $52.7 billion in subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production and research and to boost efforts to make the United States more competitive with China's science and technology efforts.
The White House is touting investments that chip companies are making even though it remains unclear when the U.S. Commerce Department will write rules for reviewing grant awards and how long it will take to underwrite projects.
The chief executives of Micron, Intel INTC.O, Lockheed Martin LMT.N, HP HPQ.N and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O will attend the signing, set for 10 a.m. EDT, as will cabinet officials and auto industry and union leaders, including United Auto Workers President Ray Curry, the White House said.
Also attending will be governors of Pennsylvania and Illinois, the mayors of Detroit, Cleveland and Salt Lake City, and lawmakers.
The White House said the bill's passage was spurring new chip investments. It noted that Qualcomm QCOM.O Monday had agreed to buy an additional $4.2 billion in semiconductor chips from GlobalFoundries's GFS.O New York factory, bringing its total commitment to $7.4 billion in purchases through 2028.
The White House also said Micron was announcing a $40 billion investment in memory chip manufacturing, which would boost U.S. market share from 2% to 10%.
The legislation aims to alleviate a persistent shortage that has affected everything from cars, weapons, washing machines and video games. Thousands of cars and trucks remain parked in southeast Michigan awaiting chips as the shortage continues to impact automakers.
A rare major foray into U.S. industrial policy, the bill also includes a 25% investment tax credit for chip plants, estimated to be worth $24 billion.
The legislation authorizes $200 billion over 10 years to boost U.S. scientific research to better compete with China. Congress would still need to pass separate appropriations legislation to fund those investments.
China had lobbied against the semiconductor bill. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said China ""firmly opposed"" it, calling it reminiscent of a ""Cold War mentality.""
Many U.S. lawmakers had said they normally would not support hefty subsidies for private businesses but noted that China and the European Union had been awarding billions in incentives to their chip companies. They also cited national security risks and huge global supply chain problems that have hampered global manufacturing.

Aug 9 (Reuters) - Memory chipmaker Micron Technology MU.O said its free cash flow was expected to be negative for the fiscal first quarter and that it could see significant sequential declines in revenue and margins in the period due to a fall in shipments.
The company also said fourth-quarter revenue may come in at or below the low end of its previous forecast in June, further pointing to weakening demand from PC and gaming industries.
Other chip makers including Intel INTC.O, Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and storage company Western Digital WDC.O have warned of a slowing uptake from PC makers as inflation dents demand.

2022-08-09 00:00:00+00:00,7 Deep Value Stocks for Income and High Total Returns,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-deep-value-stocks-for-income-and-high-total-returns,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Investors have fewer deep value stocks to pick from after the latest rally.
Retail investors had enough of the bear market by late June when the S&P 500 bottomed at below 3700. From there, the index rose for several consecutive days. Each pullback ended quickly as more buyers bid stocks higher.
Fearful investors who waited for a stock market crash missed out. In the last two months, the summer rebound erased the technical bear stock market.
Income investors need not time the market as traders do. High total returns are a sum of dividend income yield and capital gains from stocks.
Deep value stocks that fell during the quarterly earnings season are especially attractive. They offer an even higher yield and lower risk. Some stocks are on sale because impatient investors do not want to wait for the business to turn around.

Altria Group (MO)
Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com
Altria Group (NYSE:MO) posted Q2/2022 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.26. Revenue fell by 4.1% year over year to $5.37 billion. The tobacco firm’s declining revenue does not hurt its dividend safety. Each share pays $3.60 in annual dividends.
Altria reaffirmed its 2022 full-year guidance. It expects adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $4.79 to $4.93. This is well above the annual dividend. In addition, the EPS is a growth of 4% to 7% from its $4.61 base in 2021.
Altria stocks are trading lower because the Food and Drug Administration wanted to take Juul products off the market. In the e-vapor category, consumers have few good quality choices.
Altria’s Chief Executive Officer, Billy Gifford, said that the company is monitoring theglobal marketconditions for alternative products. It might consider merger and acquisition options, internal product development, and pipeline product expansion to strengthen Juul.
Tobacco demand is declining. Altria offsets the lower sales by increasing prices. For example, it can raise prices by 5% to 6%. This is below that of June’s consumer price inflation of 9.1%.
Devon Energy (DVN)
Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com
Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) posted Q2 results on Aug.1. Its revenue grew by 132.6% year over year to $5.63 billion. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.59. It raised its full-year 2022 production forecast by 3%. It expects up to 610,000 Boe per day.
Devon’s growth rate exceeds that of high-flying technology firms at their peak. Yet the stock trades below the 52-week high. Markets are pricing the stock for its prospects. It believes energy prices will fall. Capital expenses will pressure margins.
The market is likely wrong in its forecast. Devon will apply its strong cash flow to buy back up to $2 billion worth of shares. Its capital expenditure is not a fixed value. It will alter its investment levels depending on its cash flow-through and margins.
In the last quarter, Devon Energy bought RimRock Oil & Gas leasehold interest and related assets in the Williston Basin. The $865 million limited the company’s stock buyback activity. Expect aggressive buybacks to support DVN stock for the rest of the year.
Intel (INTC)

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) posted disastrous results in the last quarter. INTC stock fell to levels not seen since 2016. On its conference call, CEO Pat Gelsinger said that the company believes it is at the bottom of the falling PC addressable market.
Intel is counting on the Client Computing Group (CCG) and the Datacenter and AI Group (DCAI) unit to recover through the rest of the year. First, the firm must work through excess inventory. This will set up a business recovery in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, Intel has a good set of products coming out in the second half of the year.
The company’s IDM 2.0 strategy (integrated device manufacturing) enables it to absorb much of the inflationary pressures. Competitors do not enjoy the same luxury. Since inflationary increases are permanent, Intel may pass the higher costs to customers.
The PC industry needs to work through a post-pandemic slowdown. Excess demand during the lockdown took away future sales. Intel will position its consumer and enterprise products to maximize margins. As margins recover, so too will Intel stock.
LyondellBasell Industries (LYB)
Source: Flagmania / Shutterstock.com
LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) is a chemicals company. LYB stock failed to bounce back despite posting a non-GAAP EPS of $5.19. Revenue grew by 28.4% year over year to $14.84 billion.
CEO Peter Vanacker said its new propylene oxide capacity gives the firm meaningful contributions to earnings starting in 2023. Still, investors are worried about the volatility in polypropylene price spreads. For example, the spread increased from around 20 cents a pound at the start of the quarter to around 50 cents a pound in May 2022. Then it fell.
The industry’s production downtime for polypropylene has an effect on inventory levels. Fortunately, packaging demand is strong. While the company expects some softening in this space, spreads are above historic averages.
In Europe and China, demand is improving. China is reestablishing its relationship between naphtha and crude oil. Demand in China rose slightly in the second quarter. Investors may expect that by the end of the year and the start of 2023, China’s demand will return to normal levels.
Inflation in Europe led to moderating demand at the end of the second quarter. LyondellBasell also took a $65 million cut in revenue after extending its maintenance for its cracker in France. When inflation rates moderate, the company may increase volumes in Europe.
Medical Properties Trust (MPW)
Source: venusvi / Shutterstock.com
Medical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW) posted revenue of $400.2 million, up by 4.8% year over year. It maintained its per-share net income of $1.88 to $1.92.
REIT investors need to only care about Funds from operations (FFO). The value is an indicator of a stock’s distribution income safety. Medical Properties posted 46 cents per diluted share in normalized FFO.
Investors are worried that the company’s tenants are struggling. For example, Prospect Health sounded like it had a slower recovery. CEO Edwar Aldag said that business in this unit’s West Coast facilities remains strong. Those facilities will continue to generate good coverage.
Medical Properties has a model of success that depends on the attractiveness of its facilities. For example, it acquired Five General Acute hospitals in South Florida in June 2021. The Steward facility from Utah alone will have an EBITDAR run rate of around $125 million.
Medical Properties could elect to sell the unit or seek a joint venture. This increases its diversification.
Suncor Energy (SU)
Source: Brett Holmes / Shutterstock.com
Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU) posted strong upstream production, net synthetic crude production growth and increased refinery crude in the second quarter.
The firm earned $2.71 in EPS (non-GAAP). Upstream production was 720,200 barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) per day in the quarter. Net synthetic crude oil production increased to 483,000 barrels per day (bbls/d), up from 437,200 bbls/d last year. Refinery crude throughput increased to 389,300 bbls/d.
Suncor benefited from a strong performance at Syncrude. Investors should expect continued improvements in the quarter ahead. CEO Greg Pardy said that its Fort Hills open-pit truck and shovel mine is in-line with plans. It completed its planned maintenance last year. As it comes out of that maintenance, Fort Hills will contribute to results.
Capital expenditure guidance is slightly higher. Suncor is restarting the West White Rose Project. It increased spending related to project turnarounds. In addition, it has maintenance activities to complete. This increased staff safety and reliability. It strengthens the return on assets.
Rowe Price (TROW)
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com
T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) is an asset management firm. In the second quarter, revenue plunged by 21.8% year over year to $1.51 billion. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.79.
Investors expected TROW’s poor results. Unitholders withdrew assets as fears mounted. The bear market led to increasing capital losses by June. Unitholders potentially had no choice in withdrawing assets. They may have needed to raise cash to cover higher costs related to inflation.
The stock market’s strong rebound since will persuade retail investors to put money back into markets. This would reverse the net client outflow from Q2. Customers of T. Rowe Price pushed the assets under management from $1.55 trillion at the end of the first quarter to $1.31 trillion.
TROW cut spending levels to offset its top-line decline. CEO Rob Sharps said it would take steps to cut its pace of hiring. Its expense growth deceleration will restore the firm’s profitability levels.
