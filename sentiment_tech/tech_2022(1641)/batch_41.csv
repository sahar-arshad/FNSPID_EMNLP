2022-03-28 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-too-late-to-buy-nvidia-stock-2,,,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has started flying once again, with shares of the graphics card specialist gaining 32% since March 14. The stock is now trading at 72 times trailing earnings, which is higher than the multiple it was trading at in the middle of March. Does this mean that investors who didn't take advantage of the pullback in Nvidia stock have missed an opportunity to buy this fast-growing tech company? Let's find out.
Nvidia is expensive, but the valuation remains attractive
There is no doubt that Nvidia remains an expensive stock to buy. However, investors looking for a growth stock should note that the graphics card specialist was trading at a whopping 90 times earnings last year. Going back to 2020, Nvidia remained expensive with a price-to-earnings ratio of 85. It was only in 2019 that Nvidia's valuation was at a relatively cheap 60 times earnings.

Since early 2020, Nvidia stock has jumped a massive 400%. The stock handsomely rewarded investors who had bought at 60 times earnings back in 2019. So, growth-oriented investors still have an opportunity to buy the stock before it gets even more expensive due to multiple upcoming catalysts that should help the company maintain its outstanding growth pace.
Hot tech trends should ensure rapid long-term growth
At Nvidia's recent developer conference, the company revealed new products that support its aggressive pursuit of fast-growing markets such as artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled data centers, autonomous vehicles, and digital twin applications.
Nvidia unveiled the Grace Central Processing Unit (CPU) Superchip, which will target the high-performance computing (HPC) market and AI data centers. Nvidia says that this chip combines two interconnected server CPUs, and is capable of ""providing the highest performance and twice the memory bandwidth and energy-efficiency compared to today's leading server chips.""
The chipmaker also said that leading players in the HPC, supercomputing, cloud, and hyperscale markets are already working with Nvidia to integrate the Grace Superchip into their applications. The product should be available in the first half of 2023. This move will be huge for Nvidia, marking its entry into a market where the company is currently absent.
By 2023, the server CPU market is expected to generate $19 billion in revenue. The space is currently dominated by Nvidia rivals Intel and AMD. According to Mercury Research, Intel controlled nearly 90% of the server CPU market at the end of 2021, with AMD holding the remaining market share. Nvidia's foray into this space is going to unlock a massive opportunity for the chipmaker that has the potential to substantially boost its revenue.
At the same developer conference, the chipmaker announced that its automotive pipeline had increased to $11 billion, a sizable increase from the $8 billion it was sitting on a year ago. This pipeline could soon translate into real revenue: the company's self-driving platforms are now in production and BYD, the world's second-largest electric vehicle manufacturer, announced it will build its next-generation fleet on Nvidia's DRIVE Hyperion architecture.
BYD is just one of many companies tapping Nvidia's autonomous driving system to power their self-driving vehicles. With these partnerships, it wouldn't be surprising to see the chipmaker's automotive business gain robust traction in the future. By expanding this business segment, Nvidia could generate substantial revenue: last fiscal year, automotive brought in $566 million for the company, accounting for only 2% of total revenue.

Nvidia OVX was another key product revealed at the conference that could supercharge long-term company growth. Nvidia has described OVX as being ""purpose-built to operate complex digital twin simulations"" of buildings, factories, warehouses, autonomous vehicles, or entire environments.
Digital twins will be the building blocks of the metaverse, as the technology creates virtual copies of physical objects and spaces such as offices, schools, colleges, stadiums, and other locations. As the metaverse aims to connect people within virtual 3D spaces, the digital twin market is going to expand at a terrific pace in the future. A third-party estimate projects that the current $10.27 billion digital twin market could grow at an annual pace of 35% through 2027.
Still a good buy
Nvidia's revenue shot up 61% in fiscal year 2022 to $26.9 billion. Adjusted earnings were up 78% to $4.44 per share. So far, the video gaming and data center markets have been the pillars of this terrific growth, and they are likely to help the company maintain its momentum in the long run. And now that the company is ready to tap into more lucrative markets, its revenue and earnings could grow substantially over the long run.
Investment bank Cowen (NASDAQ: COWN) estimates that Nvidia could generate $140 billion in revenue and $28 per share in earnings by 2028. That would be a huge jump over last year's numbers, and indicates that Nvidia could remain a top growth stock for a long time to come.

2022-03-28 00:00:00+00:00,Intel's Audacious Turnaround Plan in 1 Chart,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-audacious-turnaround-plan-in-1-chart,,,"When a company faces no real competition for a long time, complacency inevitably sets in. That's the story of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) for much of the 2010s. Advanced Micro Devices, the other half of the x86 processor duopoly, was a train wreck until around 2017. It didn't matter that Intel was running into all sorts of problems on the manufacturing side. The profits kept flowing.
After years of pushing out uncompetitive products, AMD turned the market for PC and server CPUs on its head with its Zen-powered chips. This was partly enabled by Intel's chronic manufacturing delays, and partly by the rapid technological progress made by third-party foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC). Intel sat idly by as its manufacturing edge slipped away, and AMD took advantage.
AMD has been winning market share, which is particularly problematic in the lucrative server chip market. Meanwhile, companies Apple and others have been able to have their own custom chips manufactured by TSMC using bleeding-edge tech that Intel simply can't match. In all, it's not a good situation for the half-century-old semiconductor giant.
A bold comeback plan
Pat Gelsinger, an Intel veteran who had left to lead VMware, was brought back as CEO in early 2021. It didn't take long for Gelsinger to begin charting Intel's comeback. Instead of abandoning manufacturing, which some had been calling for, Gelsinger doubled down on the business of making chips. Not only would Intel beat back the threat from AMD, but it would also build out its very own foundry business to rival TSMC.
If this plan sounds expensive, that's because it is. To make all of this happen, Intel will dramatically increase how much it spends each year on building and maintaining its factories.
Chart by author. Data source: Intel.
For the past decade, Intel's annual capital expenditures averaged around $12.5 billion. The most Intel ever spent before Gelsinger took over was $16 billion in 2019. Spending ticked up last year as the beginnings of Gelsinger's strategy was put into motion. Starting this year, Intel will be going all out as it works its way back into a position of dominance.
Intel plans to spend around 35% of its revenue, or approximately $27 billion, on capital expenditures this year. This capital intensity will persist through at least 2024, and Intel doesn't expect to be producing any meaningful free cash flow during this time. Only in 2025 and beyond, according to Intel's plan, will it be able to cool off its spending.
Intel has committed $20 billion to build a new fabrication complex in Ohio, and that investment could rise to $100 billion by the time it's all said and done. Whether or not the CHIPS Act, which would provide $52 billion in incentives for the semiconductor industry, is signed into law will dictate how much cash Intel pours into this new facility.
Intel is also investing as much as 80 billion euros into the European Union over the next decade, including an initial 17 billion euros for a fabrication complex in Germany. As in the U.S., Intel is hoping to receive billions in incentives to pay for part of this new facility. The details haven't been ironed out yet, but Germany is reportedly looking to grant Intel around $5.5 billion.
The semiconductor industry is in desperate need of more capacity, and Intel's investments will help bring supply and demand back into sync over time. This level of spending is also necessary for Intel to catch up in terms of technology. The company has no hope of landing clients that need the most advanced manufacturing processes if it doesn't offer them.
For Intel investors, the next few years will require a lot of faith. Profits are going to take a big hit, free cash flow will dry up, and the future of the company depends on the success of an audacious plan to spend nearly $100 billion over the next three years undoing its mistakes and building out an entirely new line of business.
Intel needed a bold strategy, and Gelsinger delivered. Now let's see if it works.

2022-03-26 00:00:00+00:00,"Where to Invest $5,000 for the Next 5 Years",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-to-invest-%245000-for-the-next-5-years-0,,,"The stock market hasn't been in the best of health so far in 2022 with the S&P 500 index down 5%, but the correction has created an opportunity for investors to add some solid stocks to their portfolios at attractive valuations.
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are two stocks investors can consider investing $5,000 in for the next five years as they are on track to take advantage of some secular growth opportunities. Let's look at the reasons why these tech giants could make investors richer in the long run.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Apple
A $5,000 investment in Apple at the beginning of 2017 was worth nearly $30,000 at the end of 2021 thanks to the stock's terrific rise during this five-year period.
AAPL data by YCharts
But the stock market sell-off has led to a 5% decline in shares of Apple so far this year. However, Apple seems capable of delivering outstanding stock market returns over the next five years as well due to a few reasons.
First, the company is leading the fast-growing 5G smartphone market. Strategy Analytics estimates that Apple accounted for 31% of global 5G smartphone shipments in 2021. It is worth noting that Apple's 5G smartphone shipments last year exceeded the combined shipments of the next two vendors.
Apple's dominant position in the 5G smartphone market could be a solid long-term catalyst for the company. That's because global 5G mobile subscriptions are expected to jump from 664 million in 2021 to nearly 4.4 billion by 2027, according to third-party estimates. Apple appears to be pulling the right strings to make the most of this lucrative opportunity by adding an entry-level 5G-enabled iPhone to its portfolio that could substantially boost the company's smartphone shipments.
Second, Apple is reportedly working on new products such as self-driving cars, and metaverse-related hardware such as mixed reality headsets. Bloomberg reported in November 2021 that Apple aims to launch a self-driving electric car by 2025, compared to the company's estimated internal timeline of five to seven years. As it turns out, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty estimates the automotive space could pave the way for Apple to double its revenue and market cap in the future.
Finally, the company's services business is growing at a faster pace than its product business. The services business generated $19.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, up 24% from the prior-year period. This exceeded the 9% growth in Apple's revenue from product sales as well as the 11% year-over-year growth in the company's total revenue to $123.9 billion.
The addition of new hardware products to Apple's portfolio bodes well for the services business as the company will be able to bring more users into its ecosystem. Analysts expect the services business to clock 15% to 20% growth for the next few years due to stronger hardware penetration and new offerings. This potential growth of the services business points toward an improvement in Apple's earnings power. That's because the services business reported a gross margin of 72.4% last quarter as compared to the 38.4% margin of the products business.
Not surprisingly, analysts expect Apple's earnings to grow at nearly 15% a year for the next five years as compared to just 8.4% annual growth over the last five. As such, Apple could continue to be a top growth stock well into the future.
2. Intel
Intel may look like a surprising choice to invest $5,000 in given that the stock has underperformed the broader market over the past five years.
^SPX data by YCharts
However, Intel stock could turn out to be a top performer over the next five years as the semiconductor giant now appears to be in turnaround mode. The launch of Intel's Alder Lake central processing unit (CPU) platform in late 2021 has started turning the tables in the company's favor against rival Advanced Micro Devices.
According to CPU benchmarking software provider PassMark, Intel's share of the CPU market has increased to 65.8% in the first quarter of 2022. This points toward a turnaround in Intel's fortunes as the company's share dipped to 60.2% in the third quarter of 2021 from more than 82% in the fourth quarter of 2016.
It is also worth noting that Intel is witnessing a shift in the server market, with a market share of 97% in the first quarter of 2022, up from 91.6% in the third quarter of 2021. This reversal in Intel's fortunes of late isn't surprising as the company has bridged the technology gap with rival AMD.
More importantly, Intel is now intent on keeping up the pressure on its rivals by ramping up capital spending and consistently rolling out competitive platforms. For instance, Intel has outlined $27 billion in capital expenditure this year, up substantially from last year's outlay of $18.7 billion. More specifically, Intel will spend 35% of its projected 2022 revenue as capital expenditure, and it expects to maintain this level through 2024.
The company intends to ""regain process performance parity by 2024 and leadership by 2025,"" according to CEO Pat Gelsinger, by launching five processor platforms over the next four years. What's more, Gelsinger says that Intel is on or ahead of schedule as far as the development of its upcoming process nodes is concerned, which explains why the company is confident in its ability to return to double-digit revenue growth by 2025.
Chipzilla expects to clock 10% to 12% annual revenue growth from 2025, and maintain that momentum in 2026. It also anticipates a gross margin between 54% and 58% by then, which points toward a nice bump over its projected 2022 gross margin of 52%.
Intel seems to be executing well as far as its turnaround is concerned. The company was able to reduce wafer costs by 30% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2021, and it also increased its substrate capacity by a record margin.
As such, it won't be shocking to see Intel become a solid tech investment in the long run. So, investors should consider buying it right away as it is trading at less than 10 times trailing earnings as compared to the Nasdaq-100's price-to-earnings ratio of 33.

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger confirmed that the company is in discussions with Nvidia. Intel expanded its business to accommodate chips designed by others near the beginning of 2021. The company calls its expanded offering ""Intel Foundry Services.""

Nvidia shares were also seeing strength after chip manufacturing executives urged Congress to pass legislation that includes subsidies for the semiconductor industry. The legislation would include $52 billion in incentives for chipmakers.

Analysts Play Catch-Up

Shame on me for not buying more NVDA at $220 like I've been talking about for six months -- and we watched it go down there 3 months in a row!

But I had a good chunk already and the market was doing some dicey head-fakes down there so I wanted to wait and see how bad it could get.

And tisk-tisk on you if you didn't own any NVDA at all and not take the stab at $220 as I reiterated again in my March 9 video...

Technically Constructive

Okay, let's hear from the analysts in the wake of GTC that probably caught a few sleepin' (or at least they weren't publishing new buy calls at $220!)...

5 Nvidia Analysts On AI Inflection, A $1-Trillion Opportunity, Silicon-Software Split And Sky-High Valuation (notes courtesy of Benzinga.com)

Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated a Buy rating and $400 price target for Nvidia shares.

Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland has a Positive rating and $360 price target.

Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer has an Outperform rating and $400 price target.

Raymond James analyst Chris Caso maintained a Strong Buy rating and $365 price target.

KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh reiterated an Overweight rating and $350 price target.

The most underrated analyst above is Mosesmann from Rosenblatt. He's the only one to speak boldly about the ""Massive AI Inflection Ahead: Tuesday's announcements set the stage for a massive AI inflection that targets a $1-trillion total addressable market spread among gaming, AI enterprise and Omniverse, chips/systems and automotive.""

Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer offered a powerful observation in his note ""Confidence is High: Nvidia increased its long-term TAM to $1 trillion, with a 50-50 breakup between silicon and software.""

Pitzer also made this prediction: ""The Hopper GPU architecture, which will succeed Ampere, likely represents the most significant generational improvement in history.""

Chris Caso from Raymond James wrote that ""...while the stock is among the most highly valued at 40x, that multiple is justified by 50% annual revenue growth for the last two years (35% annually over the last 5), and such significant product cycles and new revenue streams going forward.""

Finally, here was JPM...

Nvidia remains ""1-2 steps ahead of competitors""

JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reiterates an Overweight rating on Nvidia with a $350 price target following Tuesday's investor day. The company provided updates on its accelerated computing products, platforms and solutions across its focus end-markets and announced a next generation Hopper accelerated computing architecture and next-gen H100 chipset that targets datacenter acceleration.

""With leading silicon hardware and software platforms and a strong ecosystem, Nvidia is well positioned to continue to benefit from major secular trends in artificial intelligence, high performance computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles.""

While Sur believes the company remains ""1-2 steps ahead of its competitors,"" I would say that's an understatement.

And that's why you buy the dips in NVDA.

2022-03-25 00:00:00+00:00,3 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dividend-paying-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now-2,,,"Most people hear the phrase ""technology stocks"" these days and immediately think of volatile, rapid-growing investments suitable only for the boldest investors. But this description paints with too broad a brush! There are several established tech stocks that not only grow but are also profitable and pay dividends to their shareholders, rewarding them for owning stock in the business.
Finding them does require some searching and some research and I can help with that. Here are three dividend-paying tech stocks that have industry-leading businesses in their respective specialties. Long-term investors might want to consider them as potential additions to their portfolios.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Apple
There's an investing adage that says, ""Start by investing in what you know."" Technology giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is a stock that most people are very familiar with. An estimated 1.65 billion people worldwide use Apple devices; its phones, computers, watches, and various services regularly touch consumers' daily lives.
This dominance and brand recognition has created one of the largest companies in the world, with annual revenue of more than $365 billion. Apple converts roughly 25% of its revenue into free cash flow, making it a powerful cash-generating machine. The company returns a lot of it to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks ($85.5 billion in 2021 alone). But it also distributes dividends ($0.88 per share in 2021), and management has raised the payout the past nine years at an average increase of 9.4% annually. The dividend itself yields 0.5% at the current share price.
Dividend investors might scoff at the low dividend yield, but part of the reason for that low yield is the significant growth Apple still generates despite its massive size which has led to outsized stock price appreciation. Revenue growth has averaged 15% per year over the past three years, while earnings per share have outrun it, averaging 23.5% growth per year thanks to stock buybacks. Apple is a total package and fits in just about any long-term portfolio.
2. Verizon
Another company you've probably heard of is telecom giant Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ). It's one of only a handful of wireless telecom companies in the U.S., and the massive network infrastructure built over decades with billions of dollars of investment has built quite the competitive moat. It simply doesn't make sense for a new competitor to spend the time and money to try to penetrate the wireless industry.
Cell phones have effectively become a utility and their importance makes Verizon's business reliable in almost any economic scenario, ensuring steady monthly income. That steady cash generation has helped the company pay a steady dividend. Verizon's stock price has been relatively flat over the past five years. Couple that with steady dividend increases and the yield now tops 5% at the current share price, which gives investors a healthy dose of income for holding shares.
Verizon hasn't traditionally been a fast-growing company; management has raised the payout for the past 17 years, but the average yearly raise has amounted to just over 2% over the past five years. The company could see an uptick in growth as 5G rolls out and becomes more central to the economy. New technologies like autonomous driving, streaming, and connected devices (IoT -- internet of things) could increase the demand for network services.
3. Intel
An increasingly digital world means more components are needed to power the computers and devices that make things work. Chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is a titan in the industry, inventing the x86 CPU chip architecture used throughout the world today. The industry has become increasingly competitive, but Intel still produces about 65% of x86 chips in circulation.
This long-standing success has made Intel one of the largest tech companies globally; its stock has a market cap of almost $200 billion, and its revenue totaled $79 billion in 2021. Intel generated $11.3 billion in free cash flow in 2021, some of which went to investors as dividends. The company has increased its payout for the past seven years, raising it an average of 6.2% annually over the past five years. Investors can get a solid 3% dividend yield at the current share price.
There's currently a shortage of semiconductor chips, and Intel is taking advantage of the challenge by investing heavily into becoming a leading chip manufacturer. It's spending $20 billion to build two chip factories (called ""fabs"") in Ohio and another $20 billion to expand capabilities in Arizona. This will make Intel the leading U.S. chip producer by a wide margin, which could invite growth opportunities from working more closely with the government and other U.S. businesses.

This often pushes you toward small, speculative companies that haven't yet proven themselves to the market, but it doesn't have to be that way.
Large-cap stocks, or companies worth $10 billion or more by market cap, are still growing leaps and bounds, enough to produce stunning returns for your portfolio, and they're more established than smaller, riskier names. Here are five of the fastest-growing large-cap companies to consider for your portfolio.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Datadog
Software company Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) operates a platform that monitors customers' cloud activity and analyzes it to provide insights and data. These insights give Datadog's customers (other companies) valuable information on user experience, security, network status, and more. The company operates as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform, thus generating recurring revenue.
Companies are becoming increasingly digital, moving more parts of their business operations into the cloud, removing the need for on-site servers and storage. Datadog has benefited from this trend, growing revenue 70% to $1.0 billion in 2021. That marked an acceleration from 2020 when revenue increased 66%, a rarity given how many tech stocks saw their growth slow last year as pandemic conditions eased.
2. Advanced Micro Devices
Many emerging technologies require computing power, and semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is poised to help provide the hardware to power applications like supercomputing, 5G, artificial intelligence, and more. AMD has traditionally competed with rival Intel, but AMD has gained ground in recent years due to technological advancements in bringing new chip architectures to market.
The company generated $16.4 billion in revenue in 2021, up 68% and an impressive leap considering its already large revenue base. AMD also recently closed its massive $50 billion acquisition of Xilinx, which gives it a strong foothold in adaptive computing products and increases AMD's total addressable market to an estimated $135 billion.
3. Sea Limited
E-commerce, gaming, and digital payments are all ""hot"" growth industries for investors, and internet conglomerate Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) does all three. The company primarily serves Southeast Asia but has expanded to new markets like Latin America and parts of Europe. The company's mobile game Freefire is among the most popular mobile games globally.
Sea is growing at a blistering pace -- revenue increased 128% last year, extending a multiyear streak of triple-digit top-line gains. That kind of growth won't last forever, but Sea has a lot of levers to pull to drive future growth. Management is guiding for its fintech business to expand 155% this year, which should help offset an expected slowdown in the gaming business.
4. Snowflake
Data is becoming an essential resource for businesses to analyze and learn from. However, most companies have outdated storage methods, often keeping data segregated in various formats and locations. Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) operates a cloud-based platform that enables companies to efficiently store and share data.
Simplifying that process seems to be solving a massive problem for Snowflake's customers. The company recently closed its fiscal 2022, growing revenue 106% to $1.2 billion. The company has an impressive 178% net revenue retention rate, which means Snowflake's customers are spending much more with the company with each passing year. With just under 6,000 customers, there's a huge market for Snowflake to pick up new customers in the years ahead.
5. The Trade Desk
Ad money is steadily flowing out of outdated media formats, like broadcast television, and into new digital ones, such as connected TV devices for streaming. The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) operates one of the leading independent ad-technology exchanges, where companies can buy digital ad campaigns, target them toward a specific audience, and see how their campaigns perform.
It's not the fastest-growing company on this list -- 2021 revenue was up 43%. But that marked an increase from the previous two fiscal years. There's a significant tailwind in the advertising industry with an estimated $155 billion spent on programmatic ads in 2021, a figure which should keep growing, and The Trade Desk can lean into that opportunity for years to come.

2022-03-24 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Intel, AMD, and Navitas Stocks Popped Thursday",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-amd-and-navitas-stocks-popped-thursday,,,"What happened
Thursday is turning out to be a great day to invest in semiconductor stocks.
As of 2 p.m. ET, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are up 5.3%, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is gaining 6.1%. Meanwhile, Navitas Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: NVTS), a maker of gallium nitride (GaN) power integrated circuits, is putting both of those larger companies to shame with its stock price gains -- up 12.2%.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
What's driving the semiconductor sector higher today? Several things, actually.
Most broadly beneficial to chips stocks today are probably the comments from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, reported in the Silicon Valley Business Journal, who argues that in a technological age, semiconductors have become ""the new oil,"" and encourages the U.S. government to subsidize efforts ""to produce more"" of them here in the U.S., so as to not be vulnerable to supply ""disruptions"" in China and elsewhere in Asia.
Nor is Gelsinger the only CEO making this argument. As Nikkei Asia reports today, multiple ""top semiconductor executives"" including both Micron Technology's Sanjay Mehrotra and Lam Research's Tim Archer are urging the U.S. government to allocate subsidies of as much as $52 billion ""for the American chipmaking."" As Mehrotra pointed out, China is already spending more than $100 billion to support its semiconductor industry, so the U.S. spending $52 billion would only be half that level of support.
Says Mehrotra, it's ""extremely important"" that the U.S. pass ""the so-called CHIPS Act to support semiconductor research and manufacturing"" and ""catch up"" in semiconductor manufacturing capability -- and as Nikkei Asia observes, this subsidy law does in fact have bipartisan support in the U.S., meaning it is likely to pass, which could benefit each of AMD, Navitas, and Intel.
Now what
Speaking of Intel, though, there's a second big development here that investors should be aware of. As Reuters reported yesterday, Intel rival Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has confirmed that it is ""very interested in exploring"" the possibility of using Intel's foundries to produce Nvidia chips -- and for its part, Intel says it is ""thrilled for their interest.""
The idea of Intel producing chips for other chip companies seemed pretty controversial last year, when Intel was trying to buy contract chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries. Regulators reportedly weren't keen on the idea of Intel's competitors becoming dependent upon Intel for their ability to produce chips. In the current environment of a global semiconductor shortage, however, the situation has become more all-hands-on-deck, with semiconductor companies apparently more willing to cooperate with one another to crank out more supply.
If the net effect of such alliances is to also reduce dependence upon Asia for chip manufacturing, however, and to bring more manufacturing capacity home to America, then all the better.

Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is doing a 20-for-1 stock split on July 15.
Smaller investors will be able to buy more GOOG stock then, but fractional shares are still an option before then.
Investors shouldn’t wait until after the split to buy shares.

It’s been almost two months since Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) announced it will split GOOG stock on a 20-for-1 basis. On July 15, shareholders will get 19 additional shares for every share held in the $1.8 trillion company. But, of course, Alphabet’s valuation won’t change. 
What will change is the number of shares outstanding. That will increase 20-fold to 13.2 billion from 661 million today. In addition, the share price will fall to 15% of the closing price on July 14. 
In early March, I suggested Alphabet would finally get an acquisition right by buying Mandiant (NASDAQ:MNDT) for $5.4 billion. The move adds immediate value to the company’s cloud business. 
Alphabet remains one of the best tech stocks to own for the long haul.  
GOOG Alphabet $2,805.51
GOOG Stock Would Bring Dow Jones to Life
One of the arguments made for why Alphabet and other high-priced stocks should split is to qualify for inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Index. The DJIA, unlike the cap-weighted S&P 500, is price-weighted. So, the larger your share price, the higher your weighting in the index. 
7 Healthcare Stocks to Buy for the Long Term
Barron’s published an article on March 10 that listed $100 as the sweet spot for gaining admission to the Dow. It pointed out the 30 stocks in the index varied in price, from UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) at the high end around $486 and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at the low end around $48. 
Alphabet argued it was doing the split to make its shares more accessible to retail investors. However, in an age of fractional shares, the need to do so has mostly disappeared. There is no question about it: Alphabet is trying to get a place in the Dow.
As Barron’s argued, it’s likely Alphabet and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which announced its 20-for-1 split on March 10, will get into the Dow. They’ll replace tech stocks Intel and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), which are up 34% and 64%, respectively, over the past five years. Over the same period, GOOG and AMZN are up 233% and 282%, respectively. 
Undoubtedly, Alphabet and Amazon would liven up the index that’s been around since 1885.    
You Don’t Have to Wait to Buy Alphabet
Virtually every major online broker provides fractional share purchases these days. So, you don’t need to wait to buy a tiny sliver of the company. But many analysts don’t seem to know this, as seen in a recent report by InvestorPlace’s William White on the Amazon stock split. 
Morgan Stanley’s Brian Nowak likes it. He thinks, much like Alphabet, that “it will open the stock up to a larger range of investors,” White wrote on March 10. Another analyst high on the move is BofA Global Research’s Jared Woodard, who seconds Nowak’s view that an increase in share count will accelerate buying. 
The other two analysts White mentions like the split because it will increase the share repurchases companies make. Amazon is buying back $10 billion as a result. 
Clearly, none of these analysts have ever bought fractional shares. If they had, they’d know it doesn’t matter to retail investors whether they buy one share or 20 for their $2,700 investment. Their ownership stake remains the same.
Yet, as Barron’s stated in February, other companies will rush to do the same thing to reach more of the so-called “retail” investors. It’s a total smokescreen by the Alphabets of the world — an opportunity to engage investors of any kind. 
Buy GOOG Stock on the Dip
Alphabet’s share price is down 3% year-to-date through March 24. Yet Alphabet generated $67 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in 2021, 56.4% higher than a year earlier. Moreover, its FCF margin is 26% while its current FCF yield is 3.7%. That’s high for a company growing its FCF by more than 50% a year.
As I stated in early March, Alphabet doesn’t make a lot of large acquisitions — only seven out of 246 have been for more than $1 billion. So the fact it’s spending more than $5 billion on Mandiant suggests it’s getting very serious about protecting its Google Cloud customers. 
Most of its valuation metrics at the moment are reasonable relative to its history. Trading at 7.3x sales and 24.2x earnings, these ratios are either at or below their five-year averages. 
I like Alphabet as a long-term play. If you’re thinking about buying GOOG stock, I wouldn’t wait until July to own it.

2022-03-24 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel: Short-Term Pains, Long-Term Gains",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel%3A-short-term-pains-long-term-gains,,,"Intel (INTC) has fallen technologically behind the competition over the last few years, which has led many investors to believe Intel is dead in the water. To correct Intel's course, former CTO Pat Gelsinger returned to Intel as CEO in February 2021.
The groundwork is now being done to expand into the lucrative foundry business while continuing the core x86 CPU business. The current macroeconomic and geopolitical climate is beneficial for Intel. I am bullish on Intel because of its long-term growth potential. 
Expanding into the Foundry Business
Historically, Intel has only designed and manufactured its own chips in its foundries. Intel is now opening up its foundries to third parties and expanding its capacity.  
The foundry business has enormous barriers to entry; luckily, Intel meets them. One of the key barriers is access to the technology needed to create modern chips. Intel has an existing investment in ASML Holding (ASML), the only company to provide machines for extreme-ultraviolet lithography (EUV).
ASML is also the only company producing the machines for High-NA EUV, which is expected to be used for Intel's 18A process in 2025. Even though Intel has a 15% stake in ASML, it still has to back order the $150+ million machines, showing how difficult it would be for a new player to start manufacturing modern chips. 
Intel is rapidly expanding its foundry capacity. Some of the notable investments Intel has made to expand capacity include: investing €33 billion into operations across Europe, acquiring Tower Semiconductors for $5.4 billion, investing over $20 billion into two new foundries in Ohio, and $20 billion for two foundries in Arizona. 
The expansion allows for Intel to turn the threat of ARM and RISC-V architectures into an opportunity. Apple (AAPL) dropping Intel for its own Apple M1 chips was a major blow to Intel. Intel could potentially win back Apple for manufacturing its ARM-based M1 chips. 
The M1 chip is currently produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company or TSMC (TSM). Apple switched to TSMC because TSMC is able to manufacture a more effective node. The switch ultimately allowed Apple to have similar performance with more battery life due to the superior node and ARM architecture. 
The crux of Intel investing in foundries is if it is unable to regain technological dominance. If it can't regain dominance, high-end silicon customers like Apple will remain at TSMC. On the other hand, if Intel is able to gain industry dominance, even direct competitors Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) would likely flock to Intel foundries. 
Intel has relied purely on improving other chip processes over raw transistor size reductions for years now. Intel's non-density innovation is illustrated by continuing performance improvements on the 14nm transistor over its extended lifetime. 
One of the key introductions is the use of chiplets instead of the traditional monolithic system on a chip (SOC). Chiplets allow for better yields, reducing wasted silicon wafers and offering better optimization for specific uses. 
In summary, Intel is setting itself up for the long game, investing heavily to expand its business. 
Macro Environment
The current macro environment is beneficial to Intel. Geopolitical tensions and supply chain issues have pushed the U.S. and EU to invest heavily in localizing semiconductor manufacturing. 
TSMC, which is located in Taiwan, is estimated to produce more than 90% of the world's advanced chips. China has had a perpetual threat to invade Taiwan. A Chinese invasion is a threat to the international semiconductor industry. To defend against losing access to vital chips, both the U.S. and EU are looking to localize manufacturing. 
The Innovation Act, which is making its way through Congress, would give the semiconductor industry $52 billion in funding. Intel would be the likely recipient of the lion's share as Biden praised the company during the Union Address. If passed, Intel will pour another $80 billion into its Ohio foundries for a total of $100 billion.
On the other side of the Atlantic, the European Union is pushing for 20% of total chips manufactured to come from the EU by 2030. The EU has a planned investment of $49 billion. As a result, Intel is investing €33 billion into fabrication and research across the Union. 
Intel is deepening relationships with both sides of the Atlantic, which will allow for long-term growth. 
Funding Investments
Due to the rapid investment, CapEx hit an all-time high of $20.3 billion in 2021, a 40.7% increase year-over-year. The question is, can Intel keep up the spending?
Intel should be able to continue to have heavy investment into expanding its foundry segment.
Intel had a free cash flow of over $9.6 billion in 2021. The fact that Intel is able to retain a positive free cash flow after investing heavily is promising.
Intel is spinning off its autonomous driving business Mobileye as an IPO. Mobileye is expected to be valued at more than $50 billion. Intel is going to retain a majority of shares, so it could sell up to $25 billion while retaining a majority. The cash injection will help pay for immediate investments.
As a last line of defense, Intel would be able to drop its dividend and share buybacks, but the market will punish the stock price if this occurs. 
The bearish case against Intel's finances is the stagnation of growth. Revenue only grew 1.5% year-over-year for 2021 and is expected to drop for Q1 2022.
EPS is in a worse state than revenue; EPS fell 7.5% in 2021. The Q1-2022 guidance shows a 40% decline in EPS for the quarter to $0.80.
The lack of growth is exhibited in the low P/E of 10.6. 
Ultimately, Intel is pushing for long-term growth, but the trade-off is that short-term growth will most likely be negative or insignificant. 
Wall Street's Take
Turning to Wall Street, Intel is a Hold base on eight Buys, 13 Holds, and seven Sell ratings over the last three months. 
The average Intel stock price target is $53.90, representing 4.9% upside potential.
Conclusion
Intel's short-term stagnation should be made up for in the long term. I am more bullish than analysis consensus; I believe Intel is a Buy.

If you look at the change over the last five and ten days, too, the stock has risen 18% and 26%, outperforming the broader market on both occasions. This jump was largely a result of NVDA’s most recent FY ’22 earnings (NVDA’s fiscal year ends in January), which saw revenue rise strongly to $26.9 billion, up from $16.7 billion in FY ’21. Additionally, a much slower rise in operating expenses and COGS meant that operating income rose more than 2.2x to $10 billion in FY ’22. Combined with a roughly unchanged effective tax rate, EPS rose from$1.76 in FY ’21 to $3.91 in FY ’22, a more than 2x jump.

Of these 22 instances, the stock has seen a positive movement over the next five trading days on 14 occasions
This points to a 64% probability for the stock rising over the next five trading days

2022-03-24 00:00:00+00:00,Top Semiconductor Stocks To Watch Before April 2022,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-semiconductor-stocks-to-watch-before-april-2022,,,"3 Semiconductor Stocks To Watch Right Now 
The stock market has had its fair share of ups and downs since the start of the year. Semiconductor stocks are not spared from the volatility in the broader market. That is especially so considering that supply chain disruptions have been causing a shortage of semiconductor chips. In fact, it may even come as a surprise for some that almost every industry in the world today is reliant on semiconductors. For instance, the personal computers that we use require microprocessors, memory, graphic processing units, and many more. These are all semiconductor components that play crucial roles in making the machines operational. 
Elsewhere, even the medical field utilizes advanced technology that requires semiconductors. Risky surgeries are now being aided by machines to improve precision. And, none of these would be possible without semiconductor chips. Similarly, as many newer vehicles come equipped with digital displays and semi-autonomous features, the auto industry needs more semiconductor chips than ever.
We only need to look at what Intel’s (NASDAQ: INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger has to say. He believes that “there is an urgent need for the federal government to incentivize more private sector investment in the United States to enable a resilient and innovative semiconductor ecosystem.” On top of that, Micron’s (NASDAQ: MU) CEO Sanjay Mehrotra also calls on Congress to pass the refundable investment tax credit to create a long-term incentive that may invigorate domestic manufacturing in the industry. With that said, could we see a strong rebound from semiconductor stocks soon? If you think so, here are some of the top semiconductor stocks in the stock market today.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)
Axcelis Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: ACLS)
Veeco Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ: VECO)
NVIDIA
NVIDIA is a tech giant that has been on the rise at an unprecedented pace over the past few years. The company provides graphics and computer solutions around the world. NVIDIA invented the programmable shading graphic processing units (GPUs) two decades ago, defining modern real-time computer graphics. Today, it has reinvented computer graphics again. The company’s new approach using the NVIDIA RTX™ fuses rasterization and programmable shading with ray tracing and artificial intelligence to make graphics more realistic and almost cinematic. 
On Tuesday, NVIDIA announced the launch of its new NVIDIA Omniverse™ features during the Game Developers Conference. This includes updates to Omniverse Audio2Face™, Omniverse Nucleus Cloud, Omniverse DeepSearch, and the introduction of Unreal Engine 5 Omniverse Connector. Therefore, it will make it easier for developers to share assets, sort asset libraries, and deploy AI to animate characters’ facial expressions in future games. Needless to say, these new developments would help address the challenges of doing business in today’s world. 
On top of that, the company also recently announced the availability of its Jetson AGX Orin™ developer kit. This is the world’s most powerful, compact, and energy-efficient AI supercomputer for the field of robotics and autonomous machines. Besides that, there is also news reporting that NVIDIA is now open to the idea of using Intel to manufacture its chips. Intel’s CEO Pat Gelsinger also confirmed that there were ongoing discussions with Nvidia. Given these exciting developments, would you buy NVDA stock?

Axcelis
Following that, we will be looking at Axcelis. Essentially, the company designs, manufactures, and services ion implantation and other processing equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductor chips. Additionally, it also provides aftermarket lifecycle products and services such as used tools, spare parts, maintenance services as well as customer training. Impressively, ACLS stock has been riding on strong bullish momentum. The stock has risen more than 115% over the past year. 
Last week, Axcelis announced that it has shipped multiple of its Purion VXE™ high energy systems to multiple leading CMOS image sensor manufacturers in Asia. The Purion XVE is an extended energy range solution for its Purion XE™ high energy implanter. Evidently, the company remains a market leader in the image sensor market. Its growth in this segment appears to be sustainable and benefits from long-term trends such as the growing Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, and automotive markets. 
Financially, the company has also been firing on all cylinders. During its fourth quarter, its revenue came in at $205.7 million, surpassing guidance and representing an increase of 14.7% compared to the third quarter. Net income for the quarter was $35.7 million or $1.05 per diluted share, up 29.8% compared to the prior quarter. Meanwhile, its revenue for the full year 2021 was $662.4 million, up 40% year-over-year, and is a company record. Overall, Axcelis appears to be in a prime position for a strong year ahead. With that in mind, do you consider ACLS stock a top semiconductor stock to watch?

Veeco
Last but not least, we have the developer and manufacturer of semiconductor and thin-film process equipment, Veeco. In detail, its products are primarily sold to make electronic devices. The company covers a range of markets that includes semiconductor, photonics, communication and data storage, sensors, and even power markets. Despite trading sideways for most of the year, VECO stock has still risen more than 35% within the past year.
Recently, Veeco announced that a world-leading semiconductor manufacturer ordered multiple of its WaferStorm Wet Processing Systems. These are used for advanced packaging applications. The advantages that it brings are the low cost of ownership and process performance as compared to other platforms. Besides that, some customers operate its LSA201 Laser Spike Annealing System for their front-end-of-line processes. All in all, the growing demand for the company’s products puts it in a strong position for further long-term growth. 
In February, Veeco announced its fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financials. The company reported a revenue of $153.0 million, compared to $138.9 million in the same period last year. Furthermore, its GAAP net income turned positive to $8.2 million as compared to a net loss of $0.1 million in the prior year’s quarter. Safe to say, it was a successful year for the company as it continues to advance its product innovation and penetrate new customers. All things considered, do you think VECO stock will have more room to grow?

2022-03-24 00:00:00+00:00,Is iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) a Strong ETF Right Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-ishares-msci-usa-value-factor-etf-vlue-a-strong-etf-right-now-1,,,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) debuted on 04/16/2013, and offers broad exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.
A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency, market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns.
If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Blackrock, VLUE has amassed assets over $12.92 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Value. Before fees and expenses, VLUE seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index.
The MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index is based on a traditional market capitalization-weighted parent index, the MSCI USA Index which includes U.S. large and mid capitalization stocks.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for VLUE are 0.15%, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.
The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.32%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Most ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.
Representing 25.60% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector; Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.
Taking into account individual holdings, At&t Inc (T) accounts for about 6.44% of the fund's total assets, followed by Intel Corporation Corp (INTC) and General Motors (GM).
VLUE's top 10 holdings account for about 26.48% of its total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF has lost about -5.67% so far this year and it's up approximately 5.90% in the last one year (as of 03/24/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $100.54 and $114.92.
The ETF has a beta of 1.05 and standard deviation of 26.04% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 153 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
IShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.
IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) tracks Russell 1000 Value Index and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) tracks CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $57.56 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $100.51 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.19% and VTV charges 0.04%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Value.

2022-03-24 00:00:00+00:00,May 6th Options Now Available For Intel (INTC),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/may-6th-options-now-available-for-intel-intc,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options begin trading today, for the May 6th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new May 6th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.47. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $47.53 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $50.37/share today.
Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.94% return on the cash commitment, or 41.93% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $50.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $52.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.75. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $50.37/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $52.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.71% if the stock gets called away at the May 6th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $52.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $52.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.47% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.49% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $50.37) to be 29%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

March 24 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rose on Thursday, as investors bought beaten-down chipmakers and megacap technology shares while grappling with the fallout of Ukraine war as the United States and Britain further tightened sanctions on Russia.
Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced, with technology .SPLRCT, communication services .SPLRCL and gaining more than 1%.
""A lot of that is when bargain hunters come out to start to buy the dip, they start looking for the sectors that have been the most beat up,"" said Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at National Holdings Corp.
Tech titans Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Meta Platforms FB.O added between 0.4% and 2.7%, while chipmakers Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Intel Corp INTC.O climbed 8.6% and 5.4%, respectively, to provide the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
Meanwhile, in a show of Western unity, NATO offered Kyiv new military assistance and assigned more troops to its eastern flank.
While Britain slapped sanctions on more Russian lenders and the United States targeted dozens of Russian defense companies and members of the ruling class, the EU remained divided on more energy sanctions.
At 12:43 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 194.66 points, or 0.57%, at 34,553.16, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 36.45 points, or 0.82%, at 4,492.69, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 136.94 points, or 0.98%, at 14,059.55.

Intel will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 28, 2022. On that day, Intel is projected to report earnings of $0.80 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 42.45%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $18.32 billion, down 6.88% from the year-ago period.
For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $3.49 per share and revenue of $75.39 billion, which would represent changes of -36.2% and -3.38%, respectively, from the prior year.
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Intel. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell).

2022-03-23 00:00:00+00:00,Will AMD Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2030?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-amd-be-a-trillion-dollar-stock-by-2030,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) was once considered a struggling underdog in the semiconductor market. But over the past eight years, AMD became a formidable chipmaker again under Lisa Su, who succeeded Rory Read as the company's CEO in Oct. 2014.
AMD stock has rallied a whopping 3,400% since Su's first day on the job. Its market cap briefly surpassed Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) for the first time this February, and it's currently worth $187 billion -- putting it within striking distance of Intel's market cap of $197 billion.
Image source: AMD.
Su brought AMD back from the brink of bankruptcy by developing more custom chipsets for gaming consoles, rebooting its CPU business to counter Intel, and ensuring its GPU business continued to challenge Nvidia with more cost-efficient chips.
But can AMD maintain that momentum over the next eight years and increase its market value to $1 trillion by 2030? Let's review its roadmap, its long-term challenges, and its valuation to find out.
What's next for AMD?
AMD's roadmap will be determined by its ability to design smaller chips. Unlike Intel, which manufactures its own chips, AMD outsources most of its production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- or TSMC -- the world's top foundry. TSMC currently remains far ahead of Intel in the ""process race"" to create smaller, denser, and more advanced chips.
AMD plans to follow up its current-gen 7nm CPUs and GPUs with 6nm and 5nm chips this year. In 2023, it will launch its first 4nm and 3nm chips. Management believes its Ryzen CPUs will continue to gain ground against Intel in the PC market, while EPYC CPUs will become a compelling alternative to Intel's industry-standard Xeons in the booming data center market.
If AMD sticks to that ambitious schedule, it should remain ahead of Intel -- which has doubled down on its first-party foundries to challenge TSMC -- in the process race with more power-efficient chips. Intel replaced its traditional nanometer-based roadmap with its own proprietary system last year, but it only expects to reach the equivalent of TSMC's 3nm node in 2024.
Staying ahead of Intel and keeping pace with Nvidia
AMD controlled 34% of the CPU market in the first quarter of 2022, according to PassMark Software, while Intel held the remaining 66%. But if AMD consistently launches smaller and more power-efficient chips than Intel over the next several years, we could see its market share continue to rise.
As for GPUs, AMD and Nvidia both rely on TSMC and Samsung's shrinking nodes to manufacture smaller and denser chips. AMD controlled 19% of the discrete GPU market in the fourth quarter of 2021, according to JPR, while Nvidia held the remaining 81%. AMD clearly remains the underdog here, but sticking with its traditional strategy of selling cheaper GPUs with comparable performance should help the company defend its discount niche against Nvidia.
AMD's custom APU business should also benefit from stable sales of Sony's PS5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series consoles, which were initially launched in late 2020. Both consoles are likely to be discontinued before 2030, but Sony and Microsoft could end up sticking with AMD's APUs for their next-generation gaming consoles.
How fast will AMD grow over the next eight years?
Analysts expect AMD's revenue to rise 55% in 2022, 14% in 2023, and 10% in 2024, reaching $32 billion. Its near-term growth could decelerate as the PC market faces slower sales and longer upgrade cycles in a post-pandemic world.
But back in 2020, management set a target to grow revenue at a compound annual rate of 20% ""over the long term."" That outlook might seem a bit optimistic, given Wall Street's near-term estimates, but if AMD's top-line growth does even out at that rate between 2020 and 2030, the company could generate about $60 billion annually by the end of the decade.
In that same period, AMD would need to expand its price-to-sales ratio from 8.6 as of this writing to nearly 17 times sales -- a level the company has never reached -- to be valued at $1 trillion.
Look beyond its market capitalization
AMD probably won't become a trillion-dollar company by 2030, but it could still easily double (or more) from its current levels if it keeps chipping away at Intel's market share in CPUs while aggressively defending its GPU business against Nvidia.
But even without replicating the jaw-dropping gains the stock has delivered since 2014, AMD will remain a rock-solid investment so long as Lisa Su is in charge of this resilient chipmaker's roadmap.
