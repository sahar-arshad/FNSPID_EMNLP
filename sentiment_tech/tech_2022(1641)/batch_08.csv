2022-11-01 00:00:00+00:00,Is Mobileye Stock a Buy Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-mobileye-stock-a-buy-now,,,"Mobileye (NASDAQ: MBLY) went public again on Oct. 26 after spending the past five years as a subsidiary of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). The Israeli developer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and computer vision chips listed its shares at $21, and its stock started trading at $28.25. But is its stock a worthwhile investment in this tough market for chip stocks?
What does Mobileye do?
Mobileye controls about 70% of the ADAS market. These systems use sensors and cameras to detect hazards while driving and parking a vehicle. They can also be used to adjust a vehicle's speed with adaptive cruise control, keep it centered in a single lane, monitor tire pressure, track blind spots, and even analyze the driver's eye movements for sleepiness.
Image source: Getty Images.
Mobileye's ADAS platforms run on its own EyeQ computer vision chips. Its current mainstream chip, the fourth-generation EyeQ4, was launched in late 2018 to bridge the gap between semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles. The EyeQ5, which entered mass production last year, is designed for Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous vehicles. Level 4 vehicles can drive themselves with limited human intervention, while Level 5 vehicles (which don't exist yet) will be fully automated.
Why did Intel spin off Mobileye?
Intel bought Mobileye in 2017 to diversify its business away from x86 CPUs for PCs and data centers while increasing its exposure to the growing market for automotive chips. Mobileye had lost Tesla as a major customer the previous year, and it faced growing competition from other chipmakers like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) -- so it likely preferred to be bought out by a major chipmaker like Intel than to endure those challenges on its own.
But over the past five years, Intel has struggled with chip shortages, product delays, and jarring CEO changes as it fell behind TSMC in the ""process race"" to create smaller and denser chips. That pressure forced it to streamline its business, focus on strengthening its core x86 CPU business, and start divesting its non-core assets. Faced with these challenges, it made sense for Intel to spin off Mobileye in a new IPO to raise some fresh cash.
How fast is the ""new"" Mobileye growing?
Mobileye's growth in revenues and EyeQ system-on-chips (SoCs) cooled off in 2020 as the pandemic disrupted the automotive industry, but its business recovered quickly in 2021 as those headwinds dissipated. Its adjusted net income also continued to grow at an impressive rate.

Data source: Mobileye S-1 filing. YOY = Year over year.
Mobileye's growth decelerated this year against those year-over-year comparisons, and that slowdown was exacerbated by ""continuing supply chain constraints"" at its manufacturing partner STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM). Mobileye says those constraints are preventing it from satisfying the market's demand for new EyeQ SoCs. To avoid facing similar constraints in the future, Mobileye plans to ""build up inventories of EyeQ SoCs"" with ""substantial amounts of capital.""
Those statements suggest that Mobileye's near-term revenue growth will cool off as its expenses increase. That's a bit troubling since Mobileye is still unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. Its net loss narrowed from $196 million in 2020 to $75 million in 2021 but widened again to $67 million in the first half of 2022.
But there's still plenty of pent-up demand for Mobileye's chips. Based on its existing design wins, it expects its ADAS solutions to be deployed in ""more than an additional 266 million vehicles by 2030."" So once Mobileye resolves its current supply chain challenges, it should continue to expand as more connected and autonomous vehicles hit the market.
Is Mobileye cheap enough to buy?
Intel initially planned to spin off Mobileye with a valuation of about $50 billion. But the tough market forced Intel to reduce its target valuation to just $17 billion, compared to the $15 billion it originally paid for the company.
Mobileye is now worth $21.5 billion. If it grows its revenue by 25% to $1.75 billion this year (Intel's latest report indicates Mobileye's revenue rose 27% year over year in the first nine months of 2022), it will trade at 12 times that estimate. Nvidia, which will grow at a much slower rate this year as the PC market cools off, trades at 13 times this year's sales.
Mobileye isn't terribly expensive, but it also isn't a screaming bargain yet. I personally believe investors should wait for Mobileye to post its first few quarterly reports instead of eagerly buying its newly minted shares.

2022-11-01 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Stock Is on the Rise Despite Poor Earnings. Why?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-stock-is-on-the-rise-despite-poor-earnings.-why,,,"Something remarkable happened recently with Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) stock. The company released its third-quarter earnings report, disappointing investors on earnings and revising its revenue projections lower.
But despite that news, Intel stock actually increased in next-day trading. Given those results and the reaction, is it finally time to buy Intel stock?
Another weak earnings report
Admittedly, Intel's latest earnings report shows the depth of its issues. The company reported $15.3 billion in revenue for the third quarter of 2022. From a GAAP perspective, that fell 20% from year-ago levels but slightly beat the consensus estimate of $15.25 billion.
However, net income came in at $1 billion, or $0.25 per share. Analysts expected $0.32 per share. Moreover, the $63 billion to $64 billion forecast for 2022 represents a significant reduction from the $65 billion to $68 billion forecast in Q2.
The company cited a ""pronounced slowdown in demand"" for both its results and outlook on the Q3 2022 earnings call. Still, it also said that the beleaguered PC sector began to show improvement in Q3.
Why investors did not care
The rising stock price could mean that investors may finally gained some perspective on Intel stock. This may seem to make no sense at first glance. Both Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung continue to hold a years-long technical lead. Additionally, longtime rival AMD continues to claim more of Intel's market share in the server market, according to DigiTimes.
Nonetheless, Intel has fallen so far that it sells for less than 1.2 times its book value. At one point, the plunge to its recent intraday low of $24.59 per share means it briefly traded below this critical level.
Reasons to consider Intel
That move below book value would imply a high likelihood of bankruptcy. Although Intel remains troubled, its expected $63 billion to $64 billion makes it the largest revenue producer in the industry, except for Samsung and TSMC. That is hardly an indication the company is going under.
Moreover, it still operates the largest number of foundries in the U.S. This is significant given efforts to onshore some chip manufacturing. For those reasons, the $53 billion in industry subsidies approved by the U.S. government should help Intel.
Admittedly, many investors, myself included, hold doubts about Intel's plans to regain the technical lead by 2025. Nonetheless, its 10nm chip release makes Intel the third most advanced chip producer.
Also, foundries ranging from TSMC to GlobalFoundries have built a business on less-advanced chips. With Intel going into the foundry business with Intel Foundry Services, more clients will likely turn to Intel chips as conditions improve, even if it falls short of gaining technical leadership.
Furthermore, autonomous driving company Mobileye now trades on the market. Through that tracker stock, this segment could unlock more of its value, giving Intel stock an additional boost.
The state of Intel
At current levels, Intel looks like a buy. Indeed, it is far behind the industry leaders, and it remains unclear if or when Intel will catch up.
However, the semiconductor stock trades barely above book value. That valuation leaves the stock with little room for a downside. Additionally, Intel's sheer production volume, data center leadership, and emerging foundry business could boost its stock. This means that even if the technical lead remains elusive, a recovery in the stock should not.

2022-10-31 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Corporation (INTC) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-corporation-intc-is-attracting-investor-attention%3A-here-is-what-you-should-know-1,,,"Intel (INTC) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Over the past month, shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned +12.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Intel falls in, has gained 5.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.66 per share, indicating a change of -39.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -32.7% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $2.07 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -62.2%. This estimate has changed -11.1% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.41 indicates a change of +16.3% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.5%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intel is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Intel, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.21 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -22.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $63.85 billion and $62.36 billion estimates indicate -18.2% and -2.3% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $15.34 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.1%. EPS of $0.59 for the same period compares with $1.71 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.49 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.99%. The EPS surprise was +73.53%.
Over the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

2022-10-31 00:00:00+00:00,China's Geely to spin off and list its Zeekr electric car brand,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chinas-geely-to-spin-off-and-list-its-zeekr-electric-car-brand,,,"SHANGHAI, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Geely Automobile 0175.HK said on Monday it plans to spin off its high-end Zeekr electric vehicle brand and list the unit.
The terms of the proposed spin-off, including listing venue, offering size and price range for Zeekr have not been finalised, the company said in a statement.
Geely Automobile and its parent Zhejiang Geely Holding Group GEELY.UL launched Zeekr in April 2021 as a premium brand targeting young and trendy customers.
In August last year, Zeekr raised $500 million in its first external funding from investors that included Intel Capital INTC.O, battery maker CATL 300750.SZ and online entertainment firm Bilibili 9626.HK.
An Conghui, Geely's president and Zeekr's chief executive, has said Zeekr is confident of hitting its sales target of 70,000 units this year. The brand aims to sell 650,000 vehicles a year by 2025.
Besides Zeekr, Geely owns other EV brands such as Polestar and Geometry.
ECARX Holdings, a Chinese auto tech startup backed by Geely Holding Group's chairman, went public in May through a merger with a blank-check firm in a deal that valued it at $3.8 billion.

Advanced Micro Devices AMD is set to report on November 1, trading 63% off its highs. AMD is one of many chip stocks that have suffered amid unfavorable conditions for semiconductors.
Wall Street expects AMD to show continued improvement in its top and bottom lines after surpassing Intel INTC in terms of market cap and cementing itself as a mainstay in the industry. AMD tends to have nice movements to the upside after beating expectations and when providing upbeat guidance and outlook.

Boom or Bust
It is yet to be seen if AMD can sustain its path to prosperity, and be considered among elite chip stocks such as NVIDIA NVDA and Qualcomm QCOM. The next few years will be pivotal for the company as Intel has vowed to return to its days as an industry leader.
The possibility of a recession will also throw out the willingness of investors and Wall Street to pay a premium for AMD shares. Despite beating last quarter’s earnings expectations by 2% at $1.05 per share, the stock saw a large leg of its decline during Q3. AMD shares began to drop as market sentiment surrounding semiconductor stocks continued to deteriorate. 
AMD has beaten earnings expectations for nine consecutive quarters, dating back to July 2020. The company has also delivered record revenue for eight consecutive quarters. Last quarter’s revenue of $6.6 billion represented a 70% year over year increase and operating cash flow exceeded $1 billion which should certainly help in the uncertain market environment.

However, it is important to remember that despite AMD’s impressive growth over the last few years the company debuted on the NYSE in 1979. Wall Street will be monitoring if the company can keep its growth going in the right direction and not fade back into obscurity among one of the most innovative industries.
Q3 Outlook
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD’s Q3 earnings is $0.67 per share, which would be a decline of -8% from Q3 2021. Sales for Q3 are expected to be up 29% at $5.58 billion. This is a major indication that operation costs are weighing on AMD’s bottom line.
Earnings estimates for the period have largely gone down from $1.10 at the beginning of the quarter. Revisions have also trended down in the last week leading up to the company’s Q3 release.
Year over year, AMD earnings are expected to be up 28%, and another 6% in FY23 at $3.83 per share. Top line growth is also expected, with sales projected to be up 45% this year and another 7% in FY23 to $25.55 billion. It is important to note that annual estimate revisions for this year and FY23 have largely declined over the last 90 days as well.
Performance & Valuation
Year to date, AMD is down -58% to underperform the S&P 500’s -19% and the Nasdaq’s -30%. The current economic environment is harder on semiconductor stocks as they are cyclical in nature and can plummet on slowing consumer demand. However, over the last five years, AMD is still up +453% to crush the benchmark and the Nasdaq.

 Longer-term investors are hoping AMD can get back to this stellar performance when the economy stabilizes. After reaching highs of $164.46 last November, AMD currently trades around $60 per share. At current levels, AMD has a P/E of 19.8X. This is above its peer group’s average of 12.3X. AMD does trade well below its 5-year high of 813.7X and the median of 51.6X as the company became profitable during this period.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Wall Street was okay with paying a premium for AMD shares due to its growth prospects. But in the tougher operating environment, it will be important to see if the company can sustain this.
Bottom Line
AMD currently lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in correlation with downward earnings estimates for the current quarter, this year, and FY23. AMD’s Electronics-Semiconductors industry is also in the bottom 17% of over 250 Zacks Industries.
The long-term growth prospects for AMD still look intact but the declining estimate revisions are cause for concern with the economy still expected to struggle in the near term. AMD has historically been an obscure company in its industry despite its impressive growth over the last five years. While the company is not expected to go back to its previous subpar performance, investors will want to monitor the valuation and premium they pay for the stock.

Since the year began, all three major indexes have plunged into a bear market, and a number of metrics and indicators suggest the broader market could head even lower.
While that's not exactly a rosy forecast, it does represent an incredible opportunity. No matter how poorly the stock market's major indexes have performed throughout history, big declines have eventually always been recouped by bull market rallies. This means the current bear market is an ideal time to put money to work.

However, investors don't have to buy volatile stocks to build wealth on Wall Street. There are a number of relatively safe stocks that have navigated their way through downturns before and offer reasonable long-term growth potential without the violent price swings typically associated with high-growth stocks. What follows are three exceptionally low-risk stocks that have the ability to turn an initial investment of $400,000 into $1 million, including dividends paid, by 2030.
Walgreen Boots Alliance
The first safe stock that offers low volatility and the opportunity to generate a total return, including dividends paid, of 150% by 2030 is pharmacy-chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA).
Are things perfect for Walgreens at the moment? No. A slowdown in COVID-19 vaccinations has modestly slowed foot traffic into its stores. Arguably more pressing, a strengthening U.S. dollar threatens to weigh down its earning potential in overseas markets.
That has some folks on Wall Street leery about putting money to work in this pharmacy giant. However, this is a narrow-sighted view for a company making all the right moves.
For years, Walgreens has been undertaking a transformation designed to make the company more efficient, boost organic growth, and increase customer loyalty. The initial report card for this transformation should result in an ""A"" grade.
In terms of operating efficiency, Walgreens set a goal to reduce its annual operating expenses by $2 billion by the end of fiscal 2022 (the company's fiscal year ends August 31). Walgreens surpassed $2 billion in annual cost savings and managed to reach its goal one year ahead of schedule (fiscal 2021).
Of course, cost-cutting only moves margins and the profit needle so far. What's far more enticing is where the company has been deploying its capital. For instance, it's beefed up its online retail presence in the wake of the pandemic. Even though this is a brick-and-mortar-dominated retail chain, Walgreens is seeing sustained digital sales growth in the double digits.
Additionally, Walgreens has partnered with and made a majority investment in VillageMD to open up to 1,000 full-service health clinics by 2027. They'll be co-located at Walgreens' stores in over 30 U.S. markets.
As of the end of August, 152 of these clinics were already open. Having a physician on staff broadens the treatment landscape for these clinics and provides an impetus for repeat visits.
One final note: Walgreens is doling out a 5.4% yield and has raised its base annual payout for 47 consecutive years. Valued at just seven times its fiscal 2022 earnings, Walgreens Boots Alliance seems to provide a very safe floor and reasonably high ceiling.
York Water
Exceptionally low-risk stocks don't have to be well known to deliver triple-digit total returns. Completely off-the-radar water utility stock York Water (NASDAQ: YORW) is the perfect example of a safe stock that can make its shareholders a lot richer by 2030.
For even the most diehard utility investors, York Water is probably a name few have heard of before. It's a small-cap company ($603 million market cap) that averages about 63,000 shares traded daily. More specifically, it operates water and wastewater utility services in 51 municipalities spanning three counties in South-Central Pennsylvania. But what York might lack in publicity, it more than makes up for with its capital-return program, which I'll get to in a moment.
The beauty of water utility stocks like York Water is that their operating cash flow is very predictable. To begin with, homeowners and renters have few, if any, choices when it comes to choosing their water and wastewater utility provider.
To build on this point, York is a regulated water utility. This means the company can't pass along rate hikes without receiving approval from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.
While this might sound like more hassle than benefit, it's quite the opposite. With rates known in advance, York avoids being exposed to potentially unpredictable wholesale pricing. This predictability plays a key role in York setting aside capital for acquisitions and its dividend without having to worry about these outlays adversely impacting profits.
But the real star for York Water has been its dividend. Earlier this year, I referred to York as the ""Greatest Dividend Stock of All Time,"" because no publicly traded company has paid a consecutive dividend for a longer time frame -- 206 years (and counting).
Though its 1.8% yield may be a bit pedestrian among utility stocks, the compound annual total return of its shares plus dividend since 1999 would put investors on a path to gain 150% on a $400,000 initial investment by 2030 (assuming its average returns for the past 23 years hold true for another eight years).

Intel
The third exceptionally low-risk stock that can turn a $400,000 initial investment into $1 million by 2030 is semiconductor stock Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
Understandably, a quick look at Intel's stock chart on a year-to-date basis might have investors feeling anything but ""safe."" The combination of historically high inflation, persistent global supply chain issues, a strengthening U.S. dollar, growing fears of a recession, and market-share gains by key rival Advanced Micro Devices have pushed shares of Intel to their lowest point in more than eight years. Though cyclical stocks like Intel don't bounce back at the snap of a finger, they can offer competitive advantages and predictability that make them rock-solid buys.
For example, on a macro basis, semiconductor stocks appear poised to benefit from certain products and industries becoming more technology-driven. Everything from our home appliances to cars are becoming more reliant on semiconductor solutions. This provides a steady growth opportunity for what often amounts to multiyear economic expansions.
More specific to Intel, its data center segment should become a cash cow this decade. Although Intel is best known for its personal-computing (PC) processors, it's the steady shift of enterprise data into the cloud that should fuel data center demand for years to come. Even with modest market share losses to AMD, Intel still commands the bulk of PC, server, and mobile central-processing-unit market share.
The CHIPS and Science Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in August, presents another opportunity for Intel to move the needle. Intel is spending $20 billion to bolster its foundry operations and build two manufacturing plants in Ohio. The company could lean on the subsidies provided to the semiconductor industry via the CHIPS Act to construct additional facilities in the United States.
At no point in Intel's storied history has the company been valued so inexpensively relative to its book value. When you add in its 5.4% dividend yield, you get an extremely safe tech stock with what should be a sturdy floor beneath its current share price.

2022-10-29 00:00:00+00:00,How Safe Is Intel's Dividend?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-safe-is-intels-dividend,,,"Shares of chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) soared on Friday after the company laid out plans to aggressively cut costs. Not only is the PC market imploding following a pandemic bonanza in 2020 and 2021, with global unit shipments tumbling 19.5% year over year in the third quarter, but Intel is also seeing demand for server chips from enterprise and cloud customers soften.
The plan is to slash costs by $3 billion in 2023 and grow the annualized cost reductions to between $8 billion and $10 billion by the end of 2025. That's a huge cut. For perspective, Intel expects its total revenue this year to be around $64 billion.
This cost-cutting comes as Intel continues to invest aggressively in manufacturing as it builds its own third-party foundry business and attempts to launch five process nodes in a four-year period. The plan is to keep free cash flow at roughly breakeven throughout this investment cycle. For that to happen now that demand has deteriorated further, cost cuts are necessary.
There has been no talk of cutting the dividend to free up cash so far, but given the state of Intel's core markets and the chance of a global recession next year, dividend investors should certainly be feeling a little nervous. What are the odds that Intel cuts its dividend?
The good news: Intel probably won't need to cut the dividend
The scope of Intel's cost-cutting plans, which include layoffs, portfolio cuts, more aggressive cost controls, and improved sales and marketing efficiencies, will help the company keep its free cash flow from falling too deeply into the red. For this year, free cash flow is expected to be a loss of between $2 billion and $4 billion.
Assuming Intel succeeds in not burning through too much cash, the balance sheet is fully capable of supporting the dividend for the time being. At the end of the third quarter, the company had $24.5 billion of cash and investments along with $39.5 billion of debt. Dividends eat up approximately $6 billion in cash each year, so a few years of dividend payments without any free cash flow is certainly doable.
Free cash flow will rebound once Intel completes its current investment cycle and reduces its capital spending. Intel's manufacturing push is a multi-year effort, so investors can expect elevated capex for at least a few years. A rebound in sales of PC and server chips will also help. While end market demand may remain weak for a while, once Intel's customers finish reducing their own inventories, Intel's sales will better align with actual end market demand.
If one of Intel's priorities is to maintain the dividend, it can certainly do that.
The bad news: There are no guarantees
Although paying its current dividend isn't an issue, that doesn't mean the company won't look to free up some cash by cutting or even suspending the dividend. Intel's future depends on it regaining its manufacturing edge, both to give its own chips an edge and to effectively compete with TSMC in the foundry business.
Doing so will be expensive. While the company has reduced its capex plans for 2022 by a couple billion dollars to react to lower demand, it set plans earlier this year to pour around $60 billion cumulatively into capex during 2023 and 2024.
Intel does have options beyond tapping the dividend for additional cash. In August, the company partnered with Brookfield Infrastructure to help fund the cost of two new chip factories in Arizona. Brookfield will supply 49% of the expected $30 billion price tag, allowing Intel to bring new capacity online without needing to fund the entire project itself.
My guess is that Intel will turn to this model of financing again over the next few years if it needs to fill any funding gaps. For that reason, I think it's likely that Intel maintains its dividend. Don't expect any kind of dividend increase -- anything more than a token increase probably isn't going to happen until 2025 at the earliest. But Intel has enough options on the table to keep those dividend dollars flowing to investors.

This video was recorded on Oct. 18, 2022.
Deidre Woollard: Activist investors are getting busy and more tech companies are getting layoff notices ready. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. Today we're looking at the impact of activist investors amid tech slowdown. I'm Deidre Woollard sitting in for Chris Hill and I am joined by Motley Fool senior analyst Asit Sharma. Hey, Asit.
Asit Sharma: Hey, Deidre, how's it going?
Deidre Woollard: Going great. So we're in the midst of this busy earnings week, so it kicked off last week and so far, so good. Tentatively optimistic here. It's been a decent week in the stock market. But amid all of that, we've got this activist investor who's stealing the spotlight today, Jeff Smith, he's the founder of a company called Starboard Value, and he announced the company has taken stakes in both Salesforce and Splunk. Starboard Value manages billions in assets. Why is it news when an activist like this steps in?
Asit Sharma: When an activist of this capability and track record steps in, it's news because you know that they are serious and they are probably going to drive for either a board seat or really push for change in an organization. The quality of activist investors, I think varies depending on how much firepower they have, how much shares they're actually able to snap up. This is a significant one. People take notice and they really reexamine the business models of the companies that the activist investors announced they've taken hold in.
Deidre Woollard: Well, I think it's particularly interesting with Salesforce because Jeff Smith, he's been very complimentary about Salesforce, talking about what a great company it is, how it's so important to so many businesses. But he also zeroed in on this idea that it has the subpar mix of growth and profitability. It seems like there's a lot of concern about Salesforce's spending. If you're a Salesforce investor, should you be thinking about that ability to cut costs here?
Asit Sharma: I think you should. Deidre, Salesforce has grown to such a size where it's no longer feasible for it to forever grow serially through acquisitions, which has been its mainstay even though it has an amazing core product in its namesake product and it's picked up great businesses like Slack along the way. In recent years what's happened with Salesforce is that it's become a big generator of cash flow in terms of dollar magnitude. But when you look at the percentages across its income statement, when you compare cash flow as a function of revenue or net profit as a function of revenue, it starts to look weaker. People have questions about the company's return on its invested capital. I mean here's a company that's quadrupled its sales, its revenue over the last five years, mainly through acquisitions.
It's also more than doubled its net income, but its operating margin has decreased by 93% over the same period. What that clearly shows is this company is still really good at acquiring more revenue, more cash flows, but organically, its ability to generate profits is going in the other direction. Now, management has said that they are going to focus on that operating margin. They are no longer going to be a company that strives to make its bread solely through acquisitions. But you had this period where you're shifting gears. It may take a few quarters. These are the types of vulnerable periods where you are ripe for an activist investor to come in and say, ""What's wrong with this picture?"" Well, management's already said what's wrong with the picture. They just need some time to start working on those costs. I think they can be more efficient with their cost structure. I think they can start to show some operating leverage, but they may not have any time left at their disposal at this point.
Deidre Woollard: Yeah. I think that's really interesting. It is sort of a slower turnaround. Definitely, yes, they need to stop acquiring so many companies, even though they've been really good at it. I know that they've put some of their lease in Salesforce Tower up for lease. They're trying to make better use of that space. They're looking at some layoffs. It's really interesting to see how fast they can turn it around. Wanted to also talk about Splunk. Starboard Value, they took a 5% stake in Splunk, that company is a little bit lesser known, it's a data and analytics company. It was a takeover target earlier this year. Cisco was interested and nearly bought it. Is that what's going to be happening with this one? I know that Jeff Smith is also interested in the idea of buying up companies that are takeover targets.
Asit Sharma: Yeah, I think a takeover would be the main impetus to take a position in Splunk. Splunk made quite a splash when it came public several years ago. It's a company that has a very interesting business in that it generates information off of machine data. When they first came onto the scene, they showed multiple use cases for the software. The problem with Splunk is that it's never really been able to generate consistent profits over the years, as it's piled up losses upon losses, it's also leveraged its balance sheet. They've got something like $3.8 billion of convertible senior note debt on their books. It's not the kind of company that you could easily go into and say, ""I'm going to turn this around."" I mean, you could try that, but what this more obviously points to is maybe a sale to another big buyer, like Cisco's a company, that has billions and billions of dollars of cash in stock to snap up Splunk. But this would be a really hard case for even an activist investor to just come in and say, ""OK, I'm going to do away with some payroll. I'm going to cut some variable expenses."" Really sharpen this picture up and then try to increase share price as earnings start to come in. They're far in the distance for Splunk still.
Deidre Woollard: You've got this activist investor. He's got two different companies he's interested in. He's really got two different paths because, with Salesforce, he's trying to incentivize them to do things they're already doing a little bit which is cutting costs and being smarter about their operations. But with Splunk, it sounds like turning that around isn't going to bring him the payday he wants. The end choice is then to sell it off.
Asit Sharma: Yeah, I think the best activist investors are sort of like tree shakers, right? They will get one tree and say, ""OK, this is a really thin, I can just grab this with one hand and shake it in this way. The fruit will fall down."" Other trees are bigger, they're harder to deal with and so you have to take a different approach. The good activist investor has many routes to persuading his or her fellow investors that he or she is going to create that kind of value in the marketplace. The ones that don't stick around for long periods of times are the ones who only come in and agitate in one sort of style, after a while it's just counterproductive.
Deidre Woollard: Yeah, really good point. I think this speaks to a larger issue that we're seeing cost-cutting all around tech. Tech has had a great run and now this year has been a little bit of a wake-up call. We've seen so many tech layoffs. Microsoft is the latest to confirm, it might cut as many as a 1,000 jobs. Meta has been doing that, Alphabet has been doing that. Obviously, these are the big companies, but it's happening all the way down the line for smaller companies. What are the longer-range implications of these widespread tech layoffs?
Asit Sharma: Deidre, I think the longer-term implications really get case-specific where you're talking about medium-sized or big tech. For some companies, you can look at it as an optimization exercise. In other words, Microsoft, I think, they're hearing that investors are little more focused on earnings. They understand, that investors understand, their growth is slowing, so they got to show some other impetus to push dollars to the bottom line. You can think of that as just getting a little bit more into fighting trim. Microsoft is a net investor in their technology, in their people, in their solutions, so they're going to at some point, turn the faucet back on and start hiring again. Now there are other companies where the business case looks sort of wobbly. Meta is a great example, I mean, they've got that huge investment in the metaverse, and we saw reports over the last week or so that hardly anyone wants to hang out there. You and I are both really interested in the metaverse.
I have not been on their space yet. I don't know if you've had, but the descriptions I've heard of up until now haven't really seemed persuasive, like why would even want to go try out that space? There you have a company whose advertising model is slowing down, they've got investments that might look misplaced in a year if they can't generate some momentum out of them, and for them, that could signal something longer-term. The fact that Meta says, ""We're going to be a significantly smaller company by next year,"" you wonder, OK, where is the tool? Where is the catalyst to rebound? How will this company start growing again? It placed its big bet already in the metaverse and now it's scaling back. With each of these companies, like sight unseen, I'll say it's an optimization exercise. But there's some specific cases where you wonder if it's not the start of something more serious down the road.
Deidre Woollard: I think that's a really good point because one of the things that I'm always looking for when I hear about these layoffs, is I want to know which departments. Like with Intel, they were looking at cutting some marketing and some sales. OK, that makes sense. Obviously not going to be cutting back in manufacturing, so I think you're absolutely right. It's a case-by-case basis and also within the company, what are they cutting? Why are they cutting it and how does that position them for the future?
Asit Sharma: Yeah, I think that's a great perspective to take whenever you hear about these. If you can dig like one layer deeper, sometimes you get a clue as to what it means for the company longer-term, exactly when you see which departments they're cutting in.
Deidre Woollard: Well, speaking of clues, we've got some interesting clues of another activist investor, Dan Loeb of Third Point. He's a pretty famous hedge fund guy and activist investor. He's built up a big stake in Colgate-Palmolive, and he's done that because he's interested in Hill's Pet Nutrition, the pet foods side of the business. I found this interesting because a couple of months ago, he took a stake in Disney, he's got this aim of pushing it toward a spinoff of ESPN. I'm really thinking about, what is he trying to accomplish and what does he see in the value of spinning off something? Is it to protect the core business or is it because he sees the spin-off as being the more interesting part?
Asit Sharma: For most of these activist investors, there's one part of a spin-off that's really attractive and that's usually you get a tax-free distribution. I'm too small an investor to worry about this stuff, and lots of my investment anyway is in my retirement savings accounts. But the bigger you are, the more you're going to look for opportunities where you can get a quick rise in some type of value and have that come to you tax-free. Why that can be good for shareholders, is that often the progress or potential of a smaller division just gets obscured, because part of a bigger, slower-growth corporate ball of wax. If you look at what General Mills did with Blue Buffalo, four or five years ago now they purchased that small premium pet food company in 2018.
They've grown it into a billion-dollar business. We see how strong this pet premiumization and pet humanization trend is. He's looking over at that and saying, ""Hey, I could take this part of Colgate-Palmolive, carve it up, offer that to the public."" People who own Colgate-Palmolive will get shares in the new company, and that value is perceived by the public, when they can see it as a separate company and see the growth rate, those shares will rise. The total value will be greater than if Colgate-Palmolive just kept plodding along and no one can see how great the potential this small pet division is.
I think that's what he's after. That would be my guess, and this strategy of the tools that we've been talking about the ways to shake the tree, this one has proved, one of the ones that I seem to think, makes a good case for the activist investor. I mean, so many of the times you look at these deals and you're like, ""Gosh, these people are like buccaneers,"" like they don't care. They'll take a position in a company and sometimes just bail after six months after destroying a lot of confidence in management. I've seen that movie so many times, but this can be a pretty fun tool, so we'll see what happens as he keeps probing Colgate-Palmolive and various business units within it.
Deidre Woollard: I love what you said there. That's a perfect way to end this is this idea of when we see an activist investor, we have to look at the motivation and we have to look at what their end goal is. Are they just trying to unseat the leadership? Are they going to work with the leadership? There's so many questions to ask. Definitely going to keep an eye on all of these, it is fascinating to watch. Thank you so much for your time today, Asit.
Asit Sharma: Deidre, thanks so much for having me. It was a lot of fun.
Deidre Woollard: You're listening to Motley Fool Money, there's a good chance your home is your largest asset, so how does your house fit into your financial plan? Robert Brokamp caught up with Matt Frankel to discuss.
Robert Brokamp: For many Americans, their home is their biggest asset, and the price of that asset skyrocketed during the pandemic. The Case-Shiller National Home Price Index has grown 44% since February of 2020. According to data from the Federal Reserve, homeowners collectively had $29 trillion in home equity as of the end of June, which is roughly the value of all the companies in the S&P 500. That said, it's an interesting time for the housing market. Combine those higher prices with a 30-year mortgage rate that has spike to 7% this year.
The monthly payment on a new medium-priced home is 50% higher than it was a year ago. Consequently, affordability has plummeted, probably spelling the end of the housing boom, at least for now. In fact, Bill McBride of the CalculatedRisk blog expects prices to drop a nominal 10% and an inflation-adjusted 25% over the next 5-7 years. Here to help us discuss how to factor home equity into your financial plan during these potentially challenging times is Motley Fool contributor Matt Frankel, who is also a Certified Financial Planner and an experienced real estate investor. Matt, welcome to the show.
Matt Frankel: Thanks, Bro, thanks for having me. Always great to be here talking personal finance with you.
Robert Brokamp: It's great to have you on the show because you have your experience as both a landlord and a real estate investor. You're going to help us look at probably the four most prominent ways that Americans used their home equity to pay for their retirements or other goals. Also though, we'll talk a little bit about how that might be different given the current conditions of the housing market. So let's start with the first one, strategy No. 1 is basically to relocate. You basically moved to a cheaper part of the country, or maybe cheaper part of your city or just to a smaller house, you can use websites like bestplaces.net or numbo.com as a resource, they'll show you the cost of living in your area compared to where you might move to maybe get a cheaper place. You sell the more expensive home, you buy a lower-priced home and you realize a lump sum that you can invest.
But it could also lower your annual expenses, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, homes cost 3.25% of their value to maintain each year. When you look at things like taxes, insurance, utilities, upkeep, not including the mortgage. Theoretically, by moving from a $600,000 home to a $400,000 home, you could lower your annual expenses by $6,500. All that said, given the slowdown in the market, the price you get for your home may not be as high as you hope and it could stay on the market longer than you'd like. If you need to take out a mortgage to buy a replacement home, today's higher rates could result at a monthly payment that is higher than what you're currently paying. So the decision to move for financial reasons requires basically some time for the spreadsheet to analyze your trade-offs. Now, what thoughts do you have about relocating or downsizing nowadays?
Matt Frankel: Another thing with relocating, it could also make your life easier. A lot of people relocate from a three-storey house to a one-storey house because they don't want to deal with stairs as they get older. So it can have a lot of other benefits besides just financially as well to make your life a little easier.
Robert Brokamp: Yeah. If you were in a situation where you still like your house, you would like to move to a lower-price place but you don't want to sell your house, another thing you could do then is rent your house, which brings us to strategy No. 2, either renting your house or a portion of it. Matt, you have experience with this.
Matt Frankel: I do and I guess technically you don't even need home equity to do this to some degree. As Bro said, the market for renting out some or all of your home has never been easier to break into. Thanks to tools like Airbnb if you want to rent out a room in your house, those things didn't exist not that long ago. This could take several forms. You can rent out of room in your house which to be fair a lot of people aren't too thrilled with the idea of random people staying in their house over and over again, especially the older generations, from my experience. I could just imagine how my grandparents would react if I suggested that. Another way that can play out is renting out your entire home while you relocate.
Instead of selling your home to relocate, if you could afford to do so maybe buy a condo where you want to live and keep your larger home as a rental property in retirement to generate cash flow, especially if you have a lot of equity and you don't have a lot of overhead like a mortgage to cover. That can be a great way to generate some cash flow. No. 3, one way that people don't often think of this. You can relocate from your current house into a multiunit property and rent out one or more of the other units while you're living in one side. If you have a 3,000-square-foot house right now you could sell it and buy a 3,000-square-foot triplex, live in 1,000 square feet and rent out two-thirds of the property to generate some capital. You're essentially getting a wash when it comes to home equity but it also generates a lot of income and if you don't need that much space for yourself, it's an interesting way to potentially create some more extra cash flow in retirement.
Robert Brokamp: While we were talking about this previously we found out we had a couple of things in common. First of all, we were both teachers earlier in our careers, we both married teachers and all four of us, at some point, were renting someone else's place. When I met my wife she was renting a basement in a retiree's home, I was renting an attic at a colleague's home. So I can understand how people are uncomfortable maybe doing that initially but once you get over the hump of being comfortable that and setting things up it actually could be a great way to add some extra money to your cash flow.
Matt Frankel: I used to live in a guest house which is very common in Florida. Houses are built with like little small guest units. It could be easy enough to create a separate entrance to a part of your property that's something else to consider. Put an exterior door on a bedroom or something to that effect. So there are a lot of ways that could take shape.
Robert Brokamp: So given your experience as a landlord, what are some of the unexpected hassles of renting out your properties? Because I'm sure that some people come across things that they didn't expect.
Matt Frankel: Well, one I would say, if you want a truly passive investment hire a property manager, that's No. 1. I have no desire to deal with tenants and stuff like that, that's a headache that I would recommend avoiding, I've done it before. No. 2, plan for the unexpected. Don't think your property is just going to cash flow because it's making more rent than your mortgage cost. You set aside money for vacancies, set aside money for maintenance, set aside money for repairs. I set aside 20% of rent for those three things. That's the biggest shock that a lot of people have especially if you're buying an older property is that it will need things. One of my rental properties, the roof, the water heater and the air conditioner all went within the first year. The property was built in the '30s. So I'd say plan for expenses like that. Start with a nice emergency fund, if you will, for your properties and keep it there.
Robert Brokamp: Let's move on to strategy No. 3 as a way to turn your home equity into a bit of cash flow and that is to borrow against your home. What is your take on that, Matt?
Matt Frankel: Well, the last data I saw said that refinancing is down 80% year over year and that certainly makes sense because interest rates have risen. There are fewer homeowners that could benefit from just a traditional refinance of your house. But this can take other forms as well. A second mortgage as you would call it a home equity loan you can get a home equity line of credit, which in those cases could make sense for a lot of people. Let's say you retire and you have a big chunk of credit card debt at 20% interest, by borrowing against your house at say, a 7% or 8% interest rate doesn't make sense to refinance your entire property but can certainly make sense for refinancing your credit card debt.
So that's something to think about, and you could save that difference in interest. That's essentially cash flow by 20% interest debt and making 7% interest debt out of it. There's also the opposite type of borrowing called a reverse mortgage, where you use your home equity to create cash flow. Instead of making monthly mortgage payments to a bank, a reverse mortgage the bank makes monthly payments to you and they're buying a piece of your home equity each time. Over time there are ups and downs to reverse mortgages, definitely do your homework before you get one. But it can be a great way especially if you're not concerned about passing your house onto your heirs. It can be a great way to create a set extra stream of cash flow in retirement.
Robert Brokamp: Borrowing gets your home has its risks. Because you're basically making your house as the collateral. With the first few options whether it's a cash-out refinance, a home equity loan, or HELOC, you have to be prepared to pay that back because if you don't, the bank can foreclose. They don't like to do it. They'll often work with you to come up with a better arrangement that can happen. Reverse mortgage is different. You don't have to pay it back until you move or you sell the house. If the loan grew to be worth more than the house you don't owe more than that. But you still have to pay taxes, pay insurance, maintain the house and that's happened to a lot of older folks they're unable to do that so then the company comes and claims it. What would you say to people who are like, ""I don't know if I want to do this, I don't know if I want my house as collateral for a loan?""
Matt Frankel: Well, I would say that you have to consider the pros and cons of the situation. Your house is going to be collateral for a mortgage. There are alternatives to a mortgage which in the current rising rate environment could be worth considering. It could be worth considering a personal loan because personal loan companies generally have 7%-8% interest rates, right now, that's what you're going to get on your mortgage. It's not like a year ago when you could borrow against your house for 3% while the personal loan companies were offering 7% or 8%. Now the playing field is a little more even so you can look at taking on a type of unsecured debt. So you might want to take a look at something like that if you need to borrow money and aren't comfortable putting your house up for collateral, you probably won't be able to borrow as much but there are other types of loans you might want to look into.
Robert Brokamp: Yeah, that's a great point. Let's get into our fourth strategy and that is basically, think of your home as one big fat emergency fund. Basically, you don't do anything about your home equity now, and basically, leave it alone so that it can grow over the years but then you downsize or borrow in the future, regular mortgage, reverse mortgage, if absolutely necessarily. Often this might be because your portfolio has plummeted so much that you just need some bridge until your portfolio recovers or through some unexpected large expense like long-term care and many people make reverse mortgage as part of their long-term care plan. You leave it alone, build it up, if you need it it's there, if you don't you could leave it to your heirs and that leaves a bigger legacy to them because often what will happen when someone passes away, the kids think they're going to get the house outright but then they found out there was some loan or reverse mortgages so they didn't get what they expected. Matt, what are your thoughts on just leaving your home equity alone?
Matt Frankel: Well, that's my thought right now. I have no desire to tap into my home equity right now. I can't tell you what my financial situation, or interest rates, or anything are going to be when I retire because it's a little ways away. But that's how I view my rental property investments: as my big emergency fund. Because with rental properties you're generally required to put down 20% or more. You start out with a lot of equity, over the past few years it's just got up a little bit more. I have substantial equity in my rental properties and I definitely view it as a big emergency fund.
Robert Brokamp: Let's close out here. Matt, with us just talking a little bit on how we plan to factor our home equity into our personal plans and you touched on yours a little bit already. I'm definitely going that strategy No. 4, the big fat emergency fund. My wife and I love our home, I could certainly see us spending the rest of our lives here and in terms of long-term care that's in the back of my mind that if one of us needs it, it's there to be used. If I use the retirement calculator for example as I often do, I don't include my home equity. I just think that it is this big emergency fund sitting there but I don't factor it into a way that's going to pay my retirement expenses by the time I retire. What are you going to do?
Matt Frankel: So I mentioned that I treat my rental properties as my big emergency fund. With my primary home, I definitely think we're going to go the relocate route eventually. I mentioned, right now I'm talking to you from a third-floor loft. I don't picture myself doing that when I'm 70. Coming up to the third floor to use my computer. We have a relatively large house, like I said, we have three different three floors. We have kids, we have relatives nearby, we always have people staying with us. So we have pretty large house right now and I don't think we're going to need that when it's just my wife and I in the house. So I definitely could see us going to downsize route as part of how we use our home equity in retirement.
Robert Brokamp: Do you actually factor it into like a retirement analysis or you just think, it's too far off in the future, I'm not going to even worry about it but at that point it probably will become some a resource for retirement?
Matt Frankel: It's like you said, with treating your house as an emergency fund where you pretend it doesn't even exist as part as of your net worth and when we need it, hopefully, it'll be there.
Robert Brokamp: Got it. Well, Matt, thanks for joining us and sharing both your knowledge and your experience.

2022-10-28 00:00:00+00:00,"US STOCKS-Wall Street jumps about 2% on upbeat Apple results, hopes of slowing rate hikes",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-street-jumps-about-2-on-upbeat-apple-results-hopes-of-slowing-rate-hikes,,,"By Amruta Khandekar and Shreyashi Sanyal
Oct 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street indexes jumped on Friday, buoyed by upbeat results from Apple, with investors hoping that some signs of economic weakness would lead to the U.S. Federal Reserve slowing down the pace of its interest rate hikes soon.
Data showed U.S. consumer spending rose more than expected in September, but private industry wage growth slowed considerably in the third quarter and underlying inflation still remained high.
The indicators did little to change expectations of a 75 basis point rate hike by the Fed next week, but investors are pinning their hopes on the central bank taking a less aggressive approach by delivering a 50 bps hike in December.
Meanwhile, Apple Inc AAPL.O shares jumped 8% as the iPhone maker's fourth-quarter results showed some resilience though it cautioned revenue growth could see some pressure in the December quarter.
""Investors are convinced that the Fed will say or do something that is encouraging next week,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
With majority of the big S&P 500 companies having already reported, investors are hopeful that the worst is now over, according to Stovall.
Apple's results were the only bright spot among megacap earnings, with other behemoths such as Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Meta Platforms Inc META.O and Google-parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O disappointing investors.
Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O also forecast a slowdown in sales growth for the holiday season, sending its shares down 8.6%.
Still, shares of Microsoft and Alphabet were up about 2% each in afternoon trade, while the S&P 500 .SPX and the Nasdaq .IXIC were set to post a second straight week of gains.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI headed for its fourth consecutive week of gains.
Oil-and-gas giants Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and Chevron Corp CVX.Nblew past quarterly profit expectations, boosted by surging energy costs. Their shares were up 2.2% and 0.6%, respectively.
With more than half of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported, 73% of them have beaten consensus estimates. Analysts now see aggregate S&P earnings growth of 4.1%, up from 2.5% a day ago, according to Refinitiv data.
At 1:05 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 714.44 points, or 2.23%, at 32,747.72, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 75.25 points, or 1.98%, at 3,882.55, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 242.43 points, or 2.25%, at 11,035.10.
Intel Corp INTC.O jumped 10.0% after the chipmaker cut its capital spending forecast, while T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.O rose 6.8% after raising its annual forecast for wireless subscriber additions.
Twitter TWTR.N was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange after Tesla Inc TSLA.O chief Elon Musk completed his $44 billion acquisition of the social media company.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 2.26-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.97-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded 26 new 52-week highs and eight new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 92 new highs and 95 new lows.

2022-10-28 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Intel's Stock Is Gaining Ground Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-intels-stock-is-gaining-ground-today,,,"What happened
Investors were celebrating Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) latest quarterly financial results today after the company reported better-than-expected top and bottom lines. The tech sector has generally disappointed investors lately, so the good news from the company was welcomed.
Not everything was fantastic for Intel in the quarter, though, and management said cost reductions are on the way. But investors viewed the latest quarterly results from a glass-half-full perspective Friday morning, and its share price had climbed 11% as of 11:28 a.m. ET.
So what
Intel reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 in the third quarter, which was down 85% from a year ago but far better than analysts' consensus estimate of $0.32 per share.

Intel's total sales of $15.3 billion also topped Wall Street's consensus average of $15.2 billion but were down 20% from the year-ago quarter.
Tech companies have generally reported disappointing quarterly earnings lately, so investors were enthusiastic about the company outpacing analysts' expectations.
But Intel's latest financial report wasn't all good news. Management cut full-year revenue guidance from a range of $65 billion to $68 billion down to a range of $63 billion to $64 billion.
The company also lowered adjusted earnings guidance for the full year to $1.95 per share, down from its previous guidance of $2.30.
Those guidance revisions put Intel's estimates for the year below analysts' expectation of $65.2 billion in sales and earnings of $2.15 per share.
Now what
In addition to lowering its full-year guidance, Intel's management also gave a somewhat sobering assessment of the economy right now, with CEO Pat Gelsinger saying on theearnings callthat ""... we are planning for the economic uncertainty to persist into 2023.""
Chief financial officer Dave Zinsner went even further, saying, ""It appears that the current challenging market environment will extend well into 2023 with the potential for a global recession.""
To help weather the uncertainty, Intel plans to reduce costs by $3 billion next year and increase its annualized cost reductions to between $8 billion to $10 billion by the end of 2025.
The cost-cutting will also affect employees, with Zinsner telling Barron's that there will be a ""meaningful number"" of layoffs.
So while investors were happy with Intel's better-than-expected results today, they may also want to prepare for the company to experience potentially difficult times in the coming quarters.

Presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So in this series we look at the largest insider buys by the ''top brass'' over the trailing six month period, one of which was a total of $746.3K invested across 2 purchases by Patrick P. Gelsinger, CEO at Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC).

08/24/2022 Patrick P. Gelsinger CEO 14,800 $33.86 $501,153.16
Gelsinger's average cost works out to $36.77/share. In trading on Friday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) and achieve a cost basis lower than Gelsinger, with shares changing hands as low as $27.86 per share. Shares of Intel Corp were changing hands at $28.84 at last check, trading up about 9.9% on Friday. The chart below shows the one year performance of INTC shares, versus its 200 day moving average:
Looking at the chart above, INTC's low point in its 52 week range is $24.59 per share, with $56.28 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $28.84.
The current annualized dividend paid by Intel Corp is $1.46/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend has an upcoming ex-date of 11/04/2022. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for INTC, which can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend with approx. 5.6% annualized yield is likely to continue.

2022-10-28 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) Beats on Q3 Earnings Despite Lower Revenues,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-beats-on-q3-earnings-despite-lower-revenues,,,"Intel Corporation INTC reported mixed third-quarter 2022 results, wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line missed. Both revenues and earnings declined year over year owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment and softening demand trends.
Quarter Details
The company reported a GAAP net income of $1,019 million or 25 cents per share in the third quarter compared with $6,823 million or $1.67 per share in the year-ago quarter. The significant decline was due to a sudden and rapid fall in economic activity and a slowdown in demand that resulted in top-line contraction. Non-GAAP earnings in the reported quarter were $2,432 million or 59 cents per share compared with $5,908 million or $1.45 per share a year ago. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 25 cents.

GAAP revenues were $15,338 million, down 20.1% year over year, owing to softness in the end consumer and educational market demand. In response to supply chain issues, the company is closely collaborating with customers and suppliers to effectively address their most critical needs. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $15,491 million.

Segment Performance
Intel has reorganized its business segments to better reflect the growth in both large traditional markets and high-growth emerging markets for increased transparency, focus and accountability.

Client Computing Group (CCG, 52.5% of total operating segment revenues) revenues were down 17% year over year to $8,124 million. This was largely due to global TAM weakness, particularly in consumer, education and small/medium business markets.

Datacenter and AI Group (DCAI, 27.2%) revenues fell 27.1% year over year to $4,209 million. This was due to OEM inventory reductions and competitive pressures. The company has a singular focus on regaining performance and TCO leadership across all workloads and use cases from enterprise to cloud.

Network and Edge Group (NEX, 14.6%) revenues improved 14.1% to $2,333 million. This was due to the strength and data center networking products, specifically networking Ethernet and 5G.

Revenues from Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group (AXG, 1.2%) were up 8.2% to $185 million. This was due to the ramp-up of Blockscale products. Mobileye (2.9%) revenues were up 38% to $450 million, primarily driven by higher demand for EyeQ products. Intel Foundry Services (IFS, 1.1%) revenues were $171 million, down 1.7%.
Other Operating Details
Non-GAAP gross margin was 45.9%, down 1240 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating margin contracted 2,100 bps to 10.8%.

CCG's operating income was down 53.9% year over year to $1,655 million and DCAI's operating income fell 99.2% to $ 17 million. NEX's operating income fell to $75 million from $511 million, while Mobileye’s operating income improved to $142 million from $127 million a year ago.
Cash Flow & Liquidity
As of Sep 30, 2022, Intel had cash and cash equivalents of $4,529 million, with $37,240 million of long-term debt. The company generated $7,730 million of cash from operations in the first nine months of 2022 compared with $24,053 million in the prior-year period.
Outlook
For the fourth quarter of 2022, Intel expects non-GAAP revenues to be $14-$15 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin is likely to be 45%. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be around 20 cents per share.

For 2022, the company expects non-GAAP revenues to be $63-$64 billion, down from prior expectations of $65-$68 billion owing to challenging macroeconomic conditions with a high degree of uncertainty. Non-GAAP gross margin is likely to be 47.5%. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be $1.95 per share, down from prior expectations of $2.30.

2022-10-28 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Shares of Nvidia, AMD, and Skyworks Are Rallying Today",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-shares-of-nvidia-amd-and-skyworks-are-rallying-today,,,"What happened
Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS) were all up big on Friday, rising 4.1%, 5.5%, and 4%, respectively, as of 1:54 p.m. EDT.
None of these companies have reported earnings yet, although AMD did announce worse-than-expected results in its PC division earlier this month.
The synchronous move highlighted a good day for semiconductor stocks generally. The semiconductor outperformance likely came from a combination of better-than-feared earnings from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) last night, as well as some better-than-feared economic data in the U.S. this morning.
So what
Last night, Apple beat analyst estimates for both revenue and earnings, and Intel delivered in-line revenue with a bottom-line beat.
Expectations were very low heading into each earnings report, since it had been well documented that both the PC and handset markets are in a sharp slowdown. Therefore, to see a result that wasn't as bad as feared is likely helping sentiment today.
Intel also said that the PC market remained difficult, and the company plans for units to be flat to slightly down next year, even with units down by the mid to high teens already in 2022. CEO Pat Gelsinger said the data center market was holding up better, although Intel was losing market share at the moment.
The 2023 outlook might perhaps indicate a bottom in PCs for some investors, because Gelsinger also said use of PCs is still above pre-pandemic levels. And that should mean a higher overall addressable market, despite the near-term correction.
And resilient data center investment bodes well for Nvidia and AMD, with AMD taking share from Intel in data center CPUs and Nvidia being the market leader in artificial intelligence focused GPUs.
Wireless chip company Skyworks is also likely benefiting from Apple's good results, as Skyworks generates just over half its revenue from the iPhone giant.
Semiconductor stocks are also very economically sensitive, and tend to respond to good or bad macroeconomic news. This morning, the Employment Cost Index released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a slowing of private-sector wage growth, which was taken well by the markets.
Although the three-month seasonally adjusted rate of growth was 1.2% and the year-over-year growth was 5.2%, both figures marked a significant slowdown from June's 1.6% and 5.7% growth figures, respectively.
Wage inflation had been one of the main sources of overall core services inflation, which in turn affects the path of Fed rate increases. So these slowing numbers show that this summer's rapid rate hikes could be having their intended effect. That means the Federal Reserve might not have to go materially higher than their forecast in terms of interest rates to slow inflation to its target. That would be good news for the economy overall.
Meanwhile, consumer spending metrics from September also came in higher than expected, despite worries over inflation and a deceleration in wages. Solid consumer spending along with falling inflation would be a Goldilocks scenario (not too hot and not too cold) for the Fed and the economy.
Now what
It's quite possible that these semiconductor stocks will continue to rise, even if revenue and earnings results come in poorly over the next couple of quarters. After all, these stocks began to decline even while earnings were good earlier this year, in anticipation of a downturn brought on by inflation and the Fed's interest rate hikes.
Now that a downturn is here, especially in the PC market, investors might be sensing a bottom and looking ahead to a recovery. The lower wage-inflation figures are likely helping to spur optimism that the Fed might soon be done with its restrictive interest rate increases.
There is still a high degree of uncertainty in the outlook, since a number of factors, including geopolitical issues, could continue to throw the economy surprises. But today's data was certainly encouraging.
With shares of Nvidia and AMD down between 55% and 60% on the year, even after the recent bounce, and with Skyworks down 45%, it's no surprise to see them being bought heavily on the first signs of a potential slowdown in inflation.

NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - A robust, broad-based rally sent Wall Street to a sharply higher close on Friday as encouraging economic data and a rosier earnings outlook boosted investor risk appetite ahead of next week's much-anticipated two-day policy meeting of the Federal Reserve.
All major U.S. indexes ended the session up more than 2%, with the S&P and the Nasdaq notching their second straight weekly gains. The blue-chip Dow posted its fourth consecutive Friday-to-Friday advance and its biggest weekly percentage gain since May.
""This has been one of the best months (so far) in the history of the Dow, suggesting the bear market likely ended,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha. ""Big monthly moves historically happen at the end of bear markets.""
""This is the second Friday in a row we’ve seen aggressive buying suggesting investors are growing more comfortable holding over the weekend,"" Detrick added.

""We’ve seen some high-profile misses from significant large-cap names,"" Detrick said. ""But under the surface many of the smaller and midsize companies have been quite impressive with their earnings results.""
On the economics front, the Commerce and Labor Departments released data that showed robust consumer spending and easing wage growth, respectively.

NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - A robust, broad-based rally sent Wall Street stocks surging on Friday, as encouraging economic data and a rosier earnings outlook buoyed investor risk appetite ahead of next week's much-anticipated two-day policy meeting of the Federal Reserve.
All major U.S. indexes jumped more than 2%, with the S&P and the Nasdaq setting a course for their second straight weekly gains. The blue-chip Dow was set for its fourth consecutive Friday-to-Friday advance and its biggest weekly percentage gain since May.
A 7.8% rebound in Apple Inc AAPL.O helped soften the blow of the 8.1% plunge for Amazon.comAMZN.O shares, in the wake of the two market leaders' results posted after Thursday's closing bell.
Solid earnings beats from ChevronCVX.N and Exxon MobilXOM.N and other companies outside the tech and tech-adjacent megacap group have brightened aggregate earnings estimates for the quarter.
Analysts now see third quarter S&P 500 earnings growth of 4.1%, up from 2.5% on Thursday, according to Refinitiv data.
""In big tech, earnings have been more negative than positive, but outside of tech it's been more positively skewed in the areas that are more indicative of the Main Street economy,"" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GLOBALT in Atlanta. ""It’s easy to miss the forest for the trees.""
On the economics front, the Commerce and Labor Departments released data that showed robust consumer spending and easing wage costs, respectively.
Financial markets have now priced in an 82% likelihood of a fifth consecutive 75 basis point interest rate hike at the conclusion of the Fed's Nov. 1-2 policy meeting, and a 48% chance the central bank will decelerate to 50 basis points in December, according to CME's FedWatch tool.
""Is it déjà vu all over again? We’ve seen the stock market rally in anticipation of a Fed pivot,"" Buchanan added. ""If (Fed Chairman Powell) doesn’t push back, he’s comfortable with the markets anticipating a pivot.""
At 2:15 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 750.93 points, or 2.34%, to 32,784.21, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 79.93 points, or 2.10%, to 3,887.23 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 255.66 points, or 2.37%, to 11,048.33.

Oct 28 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O shares fell about 8% on Friday after forecasting holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates, while its Big Tech peers recovered from a bruising selloff this week.
The online retailer, whose market cap briefly fell below $1 trillion, was last down 8.4% at $101.66, after hitting its lowest since April 2020.
Apple Inc AAPL.O, however, shone bright amid a crowd of dimming lights in the Big Tech space, as the iPhone maker reported revenue and profit that topped analysts' estimates.
Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta gained between 1.2% and 3.1% after their shares were battered this week following gloomy outlook from the companies.
The Big Tech stocks are on track to lose more than $400 billion this week.
Many view the megacap companies as bellwethers for how corporate America is faring during a year in which inflation has soared, pushing the U.S. Federal Reserve to enact a series of jumbo-sized rate hikes that have bruised markets.
Analysts fear macroeconomic factors, including a strong dollar, will continue to hit Amazon in the near term, however, over a longer period of time, the retailer should be able to bounce back.
""Despite accelerating revenues, Amazon has been cut down to size by the market after missing expectations. Efficiency has yet to return to the e-commerce business,"" Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said.
While the cloud services segment has been one of high and sustained growth for tech companies, indications for Amazon, Microsoft and Intel Corp INTC.O this week point to lower investments as costs rise.
Intel's shares rose about 7% after the chipmaker said its cost-reduction plan includes layoffs and is expected to lower costs by $3 billion next year.
However, analysts are cautious of how the company plans to cut costs.
Cost reductions are necessary, but Intel needs to focus on cutting spending in the right places and keep research and development investments high, Glenn O'Donnell, research director at Forrester, said.

Oct 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell on Friday as gloomy forecasts from megacaps Amazon and Apple heightened fears that the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes were finally slowing the economy and could hammer corporate earnings.
Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O joined a chorus of Big Tech firms that have disappointed investors this week by forecasting a slowdown in sales growth for the all-important holiday season and warned of a hit to consumers' purchasing power. Shares tumbled 11.9% in premarket trade.
About $134 billion was set to be wiped out from its market capitalization, if current losses hold.
Apple Inc AAPL.O cautioned revenue growth could see some pressure in the December quarter but shares edged 0.4% higher as the iPhone maker's fourth-quarter results showed some resilience.
Shares of other megacap tech companies such as Microsoft MSFT.O and Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL.O, which reported downbeat earnings earlier this week, were down 0.9% and 0.3% respectively.
""With tech performing so poorly, the message to markets is confusing many investors as the sharp slowdown in the fortunes of the tech sector contrasts with the outperformance of more traditional economic bellwethers,"" said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets.
Tech sector earnings were viewed as a major test of the strength of corporate America in the face of decades-high inflation. Their dismal results and warnings have fed into fears of a looming recession from aggressive monetary policy tightening by the Fed.
While another 75 basis point rate hike from the Fed next week is largely priced in, traders are now waiting for a key U.S. inflation reading due at 8:30 a.m. ET to gauge whether the central bank could dial down its aggressive approach in December.
The Commerce Department's core Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (PCE), the Fed's preferred inflation measure, is expected to have climbed 5.2% on a year-over-year basis in September when stripped of volatile food and energy costs.
At 7:39 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were down 6 points, or 0.02%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 17.25 points, or 0.45%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 94.5 points, or 0.84%.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI is up for the fourth straight week, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC tracked weekly losses.
Intel Corp INTC.O was a bright spot, up 7.1% after the chipmaker cut its capital spending forecast, helping easing pressure on Dow futures.
Twitter TWTR.N was set to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange after Tesla TSLA.O chief Elon Musk completed his $44 billion acquisition of the social media company. Shares of Tesla were down 0.7%.

2022-10-28 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to Cut Workforce as Part of Massive Cost Reduction Efforts,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-nasdaq%3Aintc-to-cut-workforce-as-part-of-massive-cost-reduction-efforts,,,"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) impressed investors with its better-than-anticipated third-quarter earnings and its aggressive cost savings plans amid tough business conditions. The semiconductor giant aims to deliver $3 billion in cost reductions next year and is targeting $8 billion to $10 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiency benefits by the end of 2025.
Intel’s CEO Pat Gelsinger stated, “To position ourselves for this business cycle, we are aggressively addressing costs and driving efficiencies across the business to accelerate our IDM 2.0 flywheel for the digital future.” Intel recorded restructuring charges of $664 million in Q3 as part of its cost reduction initiatives.
The company’s cost reduction actions include headcount optimization. In an interview with Reuters, Gelsinger indicated that the headcount optimization will begin in the fourth quarter, although he didn’t provide any details on how many employees will be impacted.
Intel stock was up 5.6% in Thursday’s extended trading session. Shares have declined 49% year-to-date due to a broader tech sell-off and demand concerns in the semiconductor space.  
Intel’s Outlook Reflects Pressure
Intel’s Q3 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) declined 59% year-over-year to $0.59 due to lower revenue and margin pressure. However, adjusted EPS topped analysts’ consensus estimate of $0.34 due to lower-than-anticipated taxes.
Revenue declined 20% to $15.3 billion due to lower revenue from the Client Computing and Datacenter and AI segments.
Intel lowered its full-year guidance, citing macro headwinds. The company now expects adjusted EPS of $1.95 and revenue in the range of $63 billion to $64 billion. It had earlier projected adjusted EPS of $2.30 and revenue between $65 billion to $68 billion.
Is Intel Buy, Sell, or Hold?
Following the print, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated a Sell rating on Intel stock and lowered the price target to $20 from $30.
Mosesmann  stated, “Weak outlook across the board and a macro malaise expected to continue well into 2023 creates an immensely delicate balance in committed CapEx expansion, FCF neutrality targets, share losses in data center, non-trivial employee reduction efforts, and a foundry services business that will take years to play out.”
Overall, Wall Street is sidelined on Intel stock, with a Hold consensus rating based on four Buys, 14 Holds, and 11 Sells. The average Intel stock price target of $33 implies 25.6% upside potential.
Conclusion
Intel is taking the required steps to fight challenging market conditions and improve profitability. However, Wall Street remains cautious as the company has been losing ground to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).
