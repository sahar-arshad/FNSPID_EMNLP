2022-06-15 00:00:00+00:00,Which Low-Cost Dividend Stocks Does Wall Street Like the Most?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/which-low-cost-dividend-stocks-does-wall-street-like-the-most,,,"The recent market sell-off has caused many investors to steer clear of unprofitable growth companies in favor of their low-growth, dividend-paying counterparts. Undoubtedly, many dividend plays have been faring far better than fast-growers in the market's latest fall into bear market territory.
While seemingly cheap dividend stocks have been dealt less damage than tech plays, they are not immune from considerable downside as the bear market looks to extend lower.
Unlike the late-2018 Fed-driven market sell-off, inflation is a force that will make the Fed less likely to make a dovish pivot in response to market damage. With a ""Fed put"" less likely this time around, investors can only wait and see how low markets sink as rates continue on the ascent.
In this piece, we used the TipRanks' Comparison tool to have a closer look at three cheap — price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples in the single-digits — dividend stocks, to gauge where Wall Street stands after yet another month of extreme selling activity.
Shell (SHEL)
Energy stocks have been in a bull market of their own over the past year, surging higher, even in the face of market-wide panic. The Ukraine-Russia conflict has undoubtedly given big oil firms like Shell a massive boost. Unforeseen peace between Ukraine and Russia could drag oil prices and oil stocks much lower from here. However, the smart money — think Warren Buffett — seems comfortable placing big bets on big oil, even with oil in the $120 per barrel range.
As one of the cheapest major oil and gas firms today, Shell stands out as one of the best ways for late-comers to the energy rally to play the space. Shares of the British energy company slipped into a correction. At writing, the stock trades at 9.85 times trailing earnings multiple, with a 3.5% dividend yield.
Shell took a bit of a hit to the chin when it announced its withdrawal from Russia. As the firm continues to take steps to improve its asset mix while continuing to benefit from higher commodity prices, I think it will be hard to stop the relative underperformer in its tracks.
Chasing momentum in energy isn't for everyone. Still, the severely-depressed multiples in SHEL stock are hard to ignore for value-focused investors.
Turning to Wall Street, analysts are very bullish with a ""Strong Buy"" rating and the average Shell price target of $68.43, implying 24.55% upside from today's levels.
AT&T (T)
With a massive 5.7% dividend yield and a modest 8.2 times trailing earnings multiple, AT&T is an enticing stock for those seeking the perfect mix of value and yield. Though AT&T was forced to reduce its payout following the spin-off of its media assets, the new payout is far more sustainable, even as the lights on the macroeconomy begin to dim.
AT&T is an old-time company that may have a reputation for being a perennial underperformer. The mix of media and telecom proved to be a tricky balance. In the case of AT&T, getting bigger and more diverse did not help result in more sizeable gains.
As a leaner company with a narrower focus and long-term 5G and fiber trends still very much in play, the case for taking a contrarian position in the old-time telecom behemoth has never been greater, especially at rock-bottom multiples.
Now, the U.S. telecom scene is very competitive. With higher interest rates and an economic slowdown likely for 2023, the tides are not in the firm's favor. And though the post-spin-off version of AT&T is more agile, it's still a $139 billion company with a lot of bloat that could weigh it down versus its rivals.
Fortunately, AT&T is on the right track, with numerous divestments made in the first half. It's encouraging that management is taking steps to better itself. Though the stock may not reflect such positive changes until after macro headwinds dissipate. Such dissipation may not happen for yet another full year.
Wall Street is bullish, with the average AT&T price target of $23.00, suggesting 18.25% upside from current levels.
Intel (INTC)
Finally, we have chip giant Intel, which sports a 3.9% dividend yield and an absurdly-low 6.3 times trailing earnings multiple. Like AT&T, Intel is an old-time company that's lost its way and has earned a reputation for being a perennial underperformer.
Intel's rivals have become much stronger recently, and its commanding lead has since diminished. Though the firm has a long-term plan to retake the lead, it's hard for investors to be nearly as upbeat as its CEO Patrick Gelsinger. Arguably, Intel has a daunting task as it looks to ramp up on R&D to regain its innovative shine.
Looking ahead, many big-tech firms may choose to follow Apple (AAPL)'s lead by creating their own CPUs. Undoubtedly, there are long-lived benefits of cutting Intel out of the equation, especially as the firm plays catch-up.
If Intel can't leap-frog rivals in the crowded chip space, it may have to resort to discounting. Substantial margin erosion does not bode well for investors eyeing a bottom in a troubled stock under pressure well before the rest of the market sold off.
Wall Street is muted on the name, with the average Intel price target of $51.50, implying 35.78% upside from current levels.
Conclusion
Dividend stocks with low P/E multiples seem like a great place to be in a bear market. However, with a fading macro outlook and idiosyncratic issues to consider, low P/Es aren't necessarily indicative of undervaluation. At this juncture, Wall Street is most bullish on Shell.

2022-06-14 00:00:00+00:00,"Forget Inflation and Intel, With Data Center Strength Nvidia Is a Long-Term Buy",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/forget-inflation-and-intel-with-data-center-strength-nvidia-is-a-long-term-buy,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
On Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics published May inflation numbers. They weren’t pretty. The 8.6% inflation rate was the fastest increase since December 1981. That sent the market into a panic, and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) stock certainly felt it. NVDA stock closed on Friday down 5.95% for the day.
The concern is that when economic conditions are tough, consumers will have less disposable income to spend on things like new graphics cards for their PCs. The product that is (or, was — more on that shortly) Nvidia’s bread and butter. That’s on top of concern that the GPU market could be upended by the arrival of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). With that company’s new Intel Xe GPUs, Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) no longer have the market to themselves.
However, the game is changing for Nvidia as well. Last quarter, the company’s Data Center revenue surpassed Gaming revenue. The strong growth of that Data Center segment is why neither inflation nor Intel worries me. NVDA stock will continue to be in a strong long-term growth position. Last Friday’s drop is just the latest opportunity to buy Nvidia stock at a great price.
NVDA Nvidia $155.38
Data Center Revenue Overtook Gaming Last Quarter
When we talk about Nvidia, the conversation is around GPUs. Specifically, it tends to be around graphics cards like the uber-popular GeForce RTX 30 series. These continue to be in hot demand among gamers and sell faster than Nvidia can make them. Historically, these cards make up the company’s Gaming division, which brings in the bulk of the company’s revenue.
7 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever
It’s fair to say that those graphics cards have been the primary driver of  NVDA stock.
That changed last quarter. On May 25, Nvidia reported its first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings. Gaming revenue of $3.62 billion was a record-setter and up 31% year-over-year.
However, Data Center revenue was up a whopping 83% YOY. And at a record $3.75 billion, it eclipsed Gaming revenue. This is a big deal and it bodes very well for the future performance of NVDA stock. 
The company’s GPU-powered servers including the new Grace Hopper and Grace CPU superchips are making inroads into data centers — traditionally Intel territory. Demand is skyrocketing for advanced capabilities like AI to power next-gen platforms like the metaverse.
Nvidia is excelling here. This doesn’t mean gaming isn’t still very important to Nvidia. It is. But the company is no longer reliant on it. And it happens to be making big inroads in a data center market that is projected to grow astronomically to meet coming demand.
What About Intel?
Should Nvidia investors be losing sleep about Intel? After all, this is the company that has dominated data centers since the first one was built. And it is now taking aim at Nvidia’s core market of PC gamers with its own graphics cards.
First, Intel’s CPUs are no match for Nvidia GPUs when it comes to the needs of many modern data centers. Intel is losing share, while Nvidia is rapidly growing. Last April, INTC stock suffered a big drop after it was revealed its data center chip sales had dropped by over 20% YOY. There’s no question, Nvidia is in the ascendency here.
In terms of graphics cards for laptops and desktop PCs, it’s possible that Intel will take some marketshare from AMD and Nvidia. However, being competitive and besting the performance of the market leaders are two very different things. An Intel GPU is highly unlikely to outperform an equivalent Nvidia GPU any time soon. 
In addition, Intel has a chicken and egg problem. Until game makers release drivers to support Intel GPUs, demand is unlikely to take off — no matter how good those graphics cards might be. But with the vast majority of players using Nvidia or AMD graphics cards, game makers will be reluctant to spend the time and money on Intel drivers. 
In short, nothing that Intel is doing makes me lose sleep about the impact on NVDA stock. 
Bottom Line
Do you need more reasons to buy NVDA stock? For starters, it earns a solid “B” rating in Portfolio Grader. Demand for ultra-powerful servers to power data centers is a big part of the company’s future, but if you want to see even more catalysts for growth, check out this post.
The company is about to release the largest wave of new products in its history and besides the areas I’ve already touched on (plus gaming), the list of target markets also includes AI, robotics, and self-driving cars.
Yes, inflation could cut into consumer spending — in the short-term. Yes, NVDA stock dropped 5.95% on Friday, once again bringing it near 2022 low territory. Smart investors with a focus on long-term growth recognize that drop for what it is: an opportunity.

2022-06-13 00:00:00+00:00,Why Apple Could Still Go Lower,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-apple-could-still-go-lower,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
With Russia gobbling Ukraine, China threatening to take Taiwan, and the damage from climate change becoming obvious, it can seem hard to make a case for any stock. Even Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Apple crossed into bear market territory last week and was due to open at $133.35, down almost 23% for 2022. But it’s still not cheap, relative to the market. Those who step in June 13 will still pay more than 22 times last year’s earnings. The company’s market cap is still over $2.2 trillion, double its pre-pandemic high.
Rather than quote some analyst or stockholder, heed the words of Apple CEO Tim Cook. Don’t buy Apple if you’re a short term trader.
Ticker Company Price
AAPL Apple $131.93
AAPL Stock: Strengths
Apple held its worldwide developer conference (WWDC) on June 6, an event that would have once dominated the news cycle. This year few noticed who weren’t being paid to.
There were things. Its laptops will use the Apple-designed M2 chip and it will be off Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) later this year. There were software updates, and new health features on the Apple Watch. Analysts seemed cheered, especially Dan Ives of Wedbush, who continues to support the stock. 
By working closely with Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), which is building a huge new manufacturing plant in Arizona, Apple has assured itself of supplies. The danger is that, as a chip supplier, Apple is now subject to the hazards of other chip suppliers, like flaws that can’t be patched.
As it controls its supply chain, Apple also controls its customer. Its latest Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) initiative bypasses banks and credit processors, who you might see as the “chip companies” of consumer credit. Payments will be tied directly to users’ debit cards, and Apple will make its own lending decisions. There’s risk, but a run rate of nearly $400 billion/year in sales means they’re manageable.
Apple’s Weaknesses
Apple’s weaknesses are those of the global economy.
It’s not just the U.S. that’s headed into recession. It’s the world, and that greatly impacts Apple. The $200/share price target put on the stock by Citicorp (NYSE:C) looks ludicrous when China, its second-largest market, is threatening to go to war. Investors who see losses elsewhere in their portfolios are selling their winners, including Apple, and that’s going to continue.
Technicians note that Apple stock recently plunged through a “death cross.” The stock’s losses over the last quarter now exceed those over the last year. For a less worthy company this would be a sign to abandon a sinking ship. To those with a longer-term view, it may be a sign to buy.
Trouble is, buy with what? Investors who were told to “buy the dip” six months ago now have fat losses, and less cash to buy anything else. We’re not all Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A), who still has 40% of his portfolio in Apple stock because his insurance empire keeps generating cash that needs to be invested.
The Bottom Line on AAPL Stock
Speaking of cash, Apple still had $51.5 billion of cash and equivalents on its books at the end of March. Sounds like a lot, but a year earlier it had almost $70 billion.
Apple has an $11 billion capital budget and pays $14.5 billion in dividends each year. It also spent nearly $86 billion last year buying back its own stock. Even Apple’s strength is not unlimited.
But bear markets end. It’s hard to believe when you’re in one. It was hard to buy this line in 2002, and hard to buy it in late 2008. But this, too, shall pass away, as those crises passed away. A few years from now, if civilization survives, you’ll be glad you own Apple stock. If it doesn’t nothing, not even cash, matters.

It was more of the same with U.S. stock markets in May, meaning that investors won’t be getting much reprieve from volatility in the near future. Virtually every U.S. stock index has more or less succumbed to bear markets. Hence, investors gravitate towards safe stocks that provide a hedge against troubling market conditions.
You invariably think about dividends with safe stocks, which have been an investing staple for the past several years. Dividends offer investors a consistent income stream, similar to fixed-income securities that have become incredibly popular. Rising interest rates have made growth stocks significantly less attractive than income-oriented stocks.
7 Great Dividend Stocks Under $25
Moreover, most stocks, including the safer ones, have taken a beating with the market downturn. Therefore, many of the safe stocks discussed in the article are trading at multi-year lows.

Safe Stocks: American Water Works (AWK)
Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.com
American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is the leading water utility, offering regulated water and wastewater services to over 10 million people across 24 different U.S. states.
AWK has been a remarkably attractive utility due to its tremendous growth profile. Its diluted adjusted earnings per share have grown over 14% on average over the past five years. With its top and bottom-line performance strength, the company’s dividends have grown at an exceptional 10% annually over the past five years.
The thesis behind investing in AWK is straightforward. The services it offers are a necessity, and its business will continue to flourish with rate hikes and a steady increase in population growth rates. The U.S. experienced an impressive 7.4% increase in population growth from 2010 to 2020, equating to 22.7 million people. Hence, there’s a tremendous growth runway ahead with AWK.

Chip-maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been posting mediocre results for multiple years now, denting investor confidence.
However, it now has a clear strategy to turn its fortunes around. Its clear strategic direction could potentially lift its glowing dividend profile, which currently offers a 3.3% yield to investors.
Chipzilla plans to invest heavily in future growth through accelerated capital spending. It plans to spend $27 billion on advancing its research and development efforts. From 2026 and beyond, the management is targeting 10% to 12% annual revenue growth.
7 of the Hottest ETFs to Buy Right Now
Intel’s management is hopeful that these investments will lead to strong revenue expansion for several years, stemming from its traditional and emerging businesses. For instance, it plans to invest about €33 billion in R&D in expanding its foundry services during the first quarter alone, representing a 175% bump from the same quarter last year.
American Express (AXP)

Credit card company American Express (NYSE:AXP) has outperformed its competition so far this year, with its stock price up over 7.5% over the past six months. It recently released its encouraging first-quarter results, where it comfortably beat analyst estimates on the back of a 29% increase in sales on a year-over-year basis.
Travel spending is a key growth driver for American Express, so it struggled immensely during the pandemic. It is a leading provider of credit cards that offer various incentives and travel rewards to its consumers.
In March, it reached an incredible milestone where travel and entertainment spending returned to pre-pandemic levels due to a resurgence in travel spending. The trend continued into April and is likely to continue in line with the pandemic fade. This development bodes well for income investors, as dividend yields could potentially increase over the 3.3% it currently offers.
Coca-Cola (KO)

Beverage giant Coca-Cola’s (NYSE:KO) stock has had it rough amidst the challenging macro-economic conditions, including inflation, coronavirus-led shutdowns, and geopolitical conflicts.
However, its inflation-resistant business remains as solid as ever, posting an 18% increase in organic sales during the first quarter. Its leading distribution network, pricing strategies, and humongous marketing budget is starting to pay off.
7 Top-Rated Large-Cap Stocks to Buy and Hold
Investors should expect higher returns from dividends and stock buybacks. KO stock currently yields over 2.50%, with a remarkable payout ratio of over 70%. Moreover, the dividend king has paid and increased payouts for the past 59 years.
Comcast (CMCSA)

Communications and media conglomerate Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has been a steady performer over the past several years, driven by growth across multiple segments. Its recently released report showed a 14% spike in sales driven by strong theme park attendance, movie ticket sales, and increased viewership at NBCUniversal due to the Winter Olympics.
Furthermore, the business saw remarkable growth in its communications segment, which notched solid increases during the quarter. 194,000 new customers were added during the quarter for various services offered by the company. Additionally, broadband subscribers rose to nearly 32.2 million during the first quarter compared to just 31 million from the same period last year.
Though it’s not exactly a growth stock, Comcast has been an excellent dividend stock that pays an attractive 2.70% yield. Additionally, it trades just 1.60 times forward sales, compared to its 5-year average of 1.92.
CVS Health (CVS)

CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) Corporation is one of the oldest healthcare providers in the U.S., with roughly 85% of Americans living within a 10-mile radius of a CVS location. It’s been a top performer in the healthcare space with a penchant for consistently rewarding its shareholders. CVS offers an incredible yield of over 2.36%, with a 34% payout ratio.
In 2021, the company’s sales increased 8.7% to $292.1 billion. Product sales form the bulk of its business at $203.7 million, generating $76.1 billion from insurance premiums. The rest of its sales accrue to services and investment income. Moreover, it reported a net income of $7.9 billion and consistently posted profits.
7 High-Yielding Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy in June
Digital healthcare is a key growth catalyst for CVS, a niche that will explode in the coming years. It had 35 million digital customers, 80% of which remain actively engaged. The enterprise plans to deploy $40 to $50 billion in capital over the next couple of years to explore new growth avenues, including the expansion of digital services and share repurchases.
Safe Stocks: Clorox (CLX)

Cleaning products giant Clorox (NYSE:CLX) is currently tackling higher costs of doing business. Moreover, it is also facing supply chain troubles coupled with rising input costs. It will be looking to pass on the higher costs to customers, but the impact is imperative.
However, despite its iffy performance over the past several years, the enterprise has proven to be a solid investment, primarily due to its robust dividend policy. It has bumped its dividend payouts every year for over 50 years.
Annual payouts have risen over 400% in the last 20 years, and its effective yield is currently at around 3%. It’s a dividend aristocrat and a dividend king at the same time, making it one of the more attractive plays.

2022-06-13 00:00:00+00:00,"2 Stocks That Could Turn $10,000 Into $100,000 by 2030",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-stocks-that-could-turn-%2410000-into-%24100000-by-2030,,,"Technology stocks have plunged big time in 2022, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index down nearly 35% so far this year thanks to a hawkish Federal Reserve that's hiking interest rates in a bid to keep surging inflation in check.
The sharp decline in tech stocks has brought some high-flying names crashing into the ground this year. The likes of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) have borne the brunt of the stock market sell-off in 2022.
^NDXT data by YCharts
However, a closer look at the markets that these companies serve indicates that they could regain their mojo and deliver terrific upside in the long run. It wouldn't be surprising to see the likes of AMD and Micron turn a $10,000 investment into $100,000 by the end of the decade. Let's see why.
1. Advanced Micro Devices
AMD has been benefiting big time from multiple catalysts such as gaming consoles, data centers, and personal computers (PCs), as evident from the impressive growth that the company has been clocking in recent years.
AMD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
The company exited 2021 with a 68% spike in revenue to $16.4 billion. This year, AMD expects to clock 60% revenue growth to $26.3 billion, driven by its acquisition of Xilinx, which was completed in February 2022. A closer look at the markets that AMD serves indicates that it is in a solid position to sustain its momentum.
In the PC market, for instance, AMD can keep growing by cornering more share from bigger rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). According to a third-party estimate, Intel is reportedly sitting on 65% of the PC CPU (central processing unit) market in the second quarter of 2022, with AMD holding the rest. It is worth noting that AMD has been consistently taking share away from Intel in the PC CPU market, and it could keep doing so thanks to its product development moves and Intel's delays.
The company has announced the launch of Ryzen 7000 processors based on the 5-nanometer (nm) Zen 4 architecture, which it believes could deliver 35% performance gains over its current offerings. These chips are expected to arrive in the second half of the year. However, Intel's competing Meteor Lake processors, which will be based on a 7nm process, are expected to hit the market only by the end of 2023.
AMD sees a total addressable opportunity worth $50 billion in the global PC market. So a stronger market share should pave the way for robust long-term growth at AMD, especially considering that the chipmaker has other huge catalysts that could supercharge its growth in the long run.
Not surprisingly, analysts are expecting AMD's earnings to increase at an annual pace of nearly 33% for the next five years. If it can sustain that momentum till 2030, the company's earnings could increase to $36 per share from $2.79 per share in 2021. The stock is currently trading at nearly 37 times trailing earnings. A similar multiple in 2030 would translate into a share price of $1,330. That would translate into an increase of over 12x from the current stock price, which indicates that this tech stock could turn a $10,000 investment into more than $100,000 by 2030.
2. Micron Technology
Memory specialist Micron Technology is another chipmaker that could give investors' portfolios a big boost in the long run. That's because the chipmaker is making the most of the lucrative opportunity in the market for dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and NAND flash memory chips.
Micron has delivered healthy growth in revenue and earnings this fiscal year. For the first six months of fiscal 2022, Micron's revenue has shot up nearly 29% over the prior-year number to $15.5 billion, while net income more than tripled to $4.57 billion. The company is benefiting from favorable developments in the memory market, which are likely to continue as demand for DRAM and NAND flash memory grows.
The DRAM market, for instance, is expected to hit nearly $222 billion in revenue by 2030, clocking a compound annual growth rate of 9.2% through the end of the decade. The NAND flash memory market, on the other hand, is expected to hit $95 billion in revenue by 2027, compared to $66 billion last year. Micron is pulling the right strings to corner a bigger share of these markets.
For example, Micron will reportedly start producing its memory chips using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography in Taiwan later this year. This move will allow the chipmaker to shrink the size of its memory chips. The company reportedly manufactures its current DRAM chips based on an 11nm-13nm manufacturing node. The move to EUV lithography will allow it to make chips using a sub-10nm process node.
Chips made using a smaller process node are supposed to be more powerful, power-efficient, and cheaper to manufacture. This could pave the way for Micron to make better memory chips than its rivals and help the chipmaker take share away from the likes of Samsung and SK Hynix, its two main competitors in this space.
The massive end-market opportunity and Micron's product development moves indicate why analysts are upbeat about the company's prospects. They expect its earnings to clock a compound annual growth rate of nearly 30% over the next five years. If Micron maintains a similar growth rate through the end of the decade, its earnings could jump to $64 per share, compared to $6.06 per share in fiscal 2021.
Micron stock has a five-year average earnings multiple of 13.7; a similar multiple in 2030 would translate into a stock price of just over $875. That would be an increase of more than 10x from Micron's current stock price of $66, which indicates that this growth stock is another potential candidate that could turn $10,000 into $100,000 in the long run.

2022-06-13 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Too Late to Buy Intel Stock?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-too-late-to-buy-intel-stock,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) was once considered a reliable blue chip stalwart for long-term investors. As the world's largest producer of PC and data center CPUs, Intel had a strong brand, a captive market, and a wide moat.
It remained resilient throughout previous economic downturns, and it generated plenty of cash to cover its share buybacks and dividends. But today, Intel's stock hovers near its 52-week low and trades at just 12 times forward earnings. That decline has boosted its forward dividend yield to 3.5%.
Has Intel become an undervalued income play at these levels, or is it too late to buy its beaten-down shares? Let's review the company's latest challenges and its ongoing turnaround efforts to decide.
Image source: Getty Images.
Why did Intel lose its momentum?
Intel's stock tumbled more than 30% over the past 12 months for three main reasons. First, its first-party foundries had fallen far behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC, in the ""process race"" to manufacture smaller and denser chips. As a result, rival AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), which outsources its manufacturing to TSMC, consistently delivered more power-efficient chips over the past few years.
As Intel struggled to catch up to TSMC, it stumbled with ongoing chip shortages and production delays at its own foundries. As a result, a growing number of frustrated PC and data center customers started to use AMD's Ryzen PC and Epyc server CPUs instead. Here's how rapidly Intel's shares of the desktop, laptop, and server CPU markets deteriorated over the past five years:

Second, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took the helm last February, resisted calls to transform the company into a ""fabless"" chipmaker -- or one that would outsource all of its production to third-party foundries, like AMD. Instead, Gelsinger doubled down on upgrading and expanding Intel's plants in an ambitious bid to reclaim the process lead from TSMC by 2025.
That capital-intensive strategy, which will require Intel to raise its annual capex from $18.7 billion in 2021 to $27 billion (36% of its projected revenue) in 2022, would still fall short of TSMC's capex target of $40 billion to $44 billion this year. Gelsinger is counting on government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to fill that wide gap, but TSMC will also probably receive some of those subsidies.
And third, the PC market has been cooling off in a post-lockdown market as fewer people buy new systems for remote work and video games. The ongoing chip shortages, which broadly affect other PC components, and supply chain headwinds have been exacerbating that pain.
In short, Intel faces slower growth and elevated spending for the foreseeable future, which makes it an unappealing stock in this challenging market. In 2022, it expects its adjusted revenue to rise less than 2% and for its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to tumble 34%.
How can Intel regain its momentum?
The next three years will inevitably be difficult for Intel, but the chipmaker still has plenty of ways to stabilize its long-term growth.
To streamline its business, it's in the process of selling its NAND memory chip business, which is more exposed to cyclical headwinds, to South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix. It plans to spin off its automotive chipmaking unit, Mobileye, which it acquired in 2017, in an initial public offering later this year.
Intel also hasn't repurchased any shares since the first quarter of 2021. That's a major reversal of Intel's strategy under Gelsinger's predecessor, Bob Swan, who was frequently criticized for plowing too much cash into big buybacks instead of R&D and manufacturing initiatives. That tighter financial discipline should free up more cash for Intel's accelerated expansion plans.
The chipmaker's recent expansion into the discrete GPU market, which is currently dominated by Nvidia and AMD, shouldn't be dismissed. It can afford to bundle its GPUs with its new CPUs, or sell them as loss-leading chips, to gradually gain a foothold in that saturated market. That project also won't apply additional pressure on its own foundries, since it's ironically outsourcing the production of its discrete GPUs to TSMC.
And Intel's decision to open up its plants to other chipmakers, which would partly turn it into a third-party foundry, could eventually generate fresh revenue by pulling orders for lower-end chips away from TSMC, Samsung, UMC, and other leading contract chipmakers. Therefore, the bulls will probably claim Intel's business is merely transforming instead of dying.
Is Intel's stock still worth buying?
Intel's low valuation and high yield might limit its downside potential, but there are plenty of better blue chip dividend stocks to buy right now. Gelsinger seems optimistic about Intel, but it's still too early to tell if it can actually catch up to TSMC in the process race and prevent AMD from gaining more ground across the PC and server CPU markets. So for now, Intel deserves to stay near its 52-week low.

2022-06-13 00:00:00+00:00,December 16th Options Now Available For Intel (INTC),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/december-16th-options-now-available-for-intel-intc,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options begin trading today, for the December 16th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 186 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new December 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $35.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.85. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $35.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $32.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $38.09/share today.
Because the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 69%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.14% return on the cash commitment, or 15.98% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $35.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $38.09/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $40.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.15% if the stock gets called away at the December 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $40.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.14% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.97% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 43%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 35%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $38.09) to be 32%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

We remain in a directionless market. And that’s why dividend stocks are your best choice right now.
And by dividend stocks, I don’t mean stocks with huge dividends. I mean stocks that have the ability to grow in any market and deliver a solid, reliable dividend that you can reinvest in more stock (in many cases), accumulate for new share purchases or use as income.
These are really what investing insiders call total return stocks. They provide solid income and capital gains growth. And the combination can be very beneficial, especially in rudderless markets like the one we’re in.
What’s more, even when the economy starts to head in a clearer direction, these stocks will shine since economic growth powers their growth as it has for decades.

Dividend Stocks for Your Grandkids: AbbVie (ABBV)

When you own the patent to the soon-to-be best-selling prescription drug of all time, that’s a good base to build from.
Humira is presently the number two best-selling prescription drug of all time, but by 2024, it will take the title. The number one drug now is the statin Lipitor. And its reign is also significant because it has had significant challenges to its market share due to generic competition, but still remains a blockbuster.
That could well be the case for Humira when it comes off patent, although AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) will likely kick that can down the road as far as possible. Plus, it has so many different uses at this point, the patent cliff is being reduced to a set of cascades.
Also, ABBV isn’t just a one-hit wonder. It has a huge drug portfolio and one of the best pipelines in the business. Plus, it’s one of the most generous dividend stocks on the list, delivering a 3.8% dividend. And ABBV stock has gained 6% year-to-date (YTD), so it’s far outperforming the major averages.

Amgen (AMGN)

Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is 42 years old. That means when it started out as a biotech, it was in a very small crowd. Remember, biotech was a shadow of what it is today compared to then.
That didn’t stop AMGN from building an impressive array of drugs and a similarly impressive product pipeline.
For much of AMGN’s life it, hasn’t been about hitting homers – i.e., producing blockbusters – as it has been about getting on base. And its drug portfolio shows that adding to those hits year after year really pays off.
Speaking of payoff, AMGN has a nearly 3.2% dividend and the stock has gained just under 7% YTD. This legacy biotech is well positioned to thrive for another four decades.
7 Top-Rated Large-Cap Stocks to Buy and Hold

Dividend Stocks for Your Grandkids: Bank of America (BAC)
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is the second largest bank in the U.S. with more than 66 million customers. It’s also the ninth largest bank in the world.
Ironically, BAC started in San Francisco in 1904 as the Bank of Italy. After a number of mergers on the East Coast and West, it was officially named Bank of America in 1930.
Most of its size has come by acquisition over the past nine decades, but it remains the West Coast bookend to East Coast powerhouse JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), although admittedly BAC is currently headquartered in North Carolina. But the core of its organic growth has historically been in the west until more recent decades.
And it has always been an innovator. It was one of the first banks to accept the credit card concept, BankAmericard, in 1958, which went on to become Visa (NYSE:V). It has been through a lot in nearly a century of operation and the fact that it has become such a powerful domestic and global player is testament to its management, innovation and durability.
The stock has lost 25% YTD, but that shouldn’t be a long-term issue. Consider this a discount. BAC also has a 2.3% dividend that is about as reliable as they come. This is a good entry point for long-term total return investors.

Comcast (CMCSA)

Usually when you hear stories about Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) it’s usually some biting comment about its customer service or subscription pricing. But the fact is Comcast has become a major telecom, entertainment and content player in the U.S., Asia and Europe.
That means for a great deal of people it’s the only game in town. And for investors, that’s a very exciting prospect because it means one important thing: pricing power. CMCSA owns Xfinity cable and streaming services, NBC and Telemundo broadcast companies. It also owns Universal theme parks around the globe, as well as Europe’s Sky network that has huge sports and news penetration.
That’s quite an empire. And it has been around since 1963, so it has built its position over decades, in good and bad times. For shareholders, this is reassuring, especially if you’re building a portfolio of dependable dividend stocks for the long term.
CMCSA stock has lost almost 17% year to date, and it has a 2.6% dividend.

If you’re one of the leading tech stocks in the world right now, you can expect the market to be looking at everything you say with a jaundiced eye. That’s just the way it is when the market goes from risk-on to risk-off investing and there’s so much happening in the global economy.
That has certainly been true of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the world’s largest computer chipmaker.
Although the company warned that the first two quarters of this year were going to be dicey, it seems no one really believed them until the reality hit in early June. That has sent the stock down and now INTC has lost almost 24% YTD.
But when you’re as big as INTC, quarterly numbers get a bit blurry since you’re much more focused on efforts that take years to unfold rather than weeks. For example, its $20 billion commitment to Ohio for two state-of-the-art chip foundries that should be up and running by 2025. That is how you avoid supply chain issues and other problems when you’re a global presence.
INTC has a 3.5% dividend and the stock is cheap. As the supply chain issues moderate, the coming quarters should see INTC rebound quickly.

United Parcel Service (UPS)

Stuff. We all have it and post-pandemic we may have a lot more. Part of this accumulation is part of our need to manage the explosion in e-commerce.
Marketers have long understood that our First-World desires for immediate gratification have become more immediate as logistics companies have transitioned from next-day shipping to same-day shipping, to getting our items within hours of purchase.
Granted, the supply chain issues we’ve been stuck in for months now is boosting immediate gratification withdrawal, but it won’t last long. We’re too accustomed to the buy-it-get-it mentality.
That’s great news for United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), the oldest and one of the biggest logistics and delivery companies in the US, and now beyond. It has been building its network and reputation since 1907, and has adapted to every new technological advance – and competition – across the decades.
Its reliability and leadership earns it a listing among these dividend stocks, as well as its nearly 3.4% dividend. UPS stock is down almost 16% year to date, but that’s understandable given the global supply chain mess. But this is a proven long-term winner, so its current troubles are your opportunity.

The one thing that makes just-in-time-inventory and fast turnaround product fulfillment crucial is a well-integrated network of warehouses and distribution centers.
Prologis (NYSE:PLD) is one of the world’s biggest and best REITs focused specifically on this sector. From major ports around the world to last-mile facilities, PLD builds, owns and manages these properties for companies all around the world. Anywhere that manufactures goods and needs to move them along the supply chain is likely to use a PLD facility along its journey.
There may be a rethinking of some companies’ supply chain strategies, but the world is too connected for this to be the beginning of the end of global commerce. Quite the contrary, this is just the beginning. And PLD will be at the forefront of this massive trend for years to come.
PLD stock has lost about 30% year to date, but it was also running very hot for quite a while, so this isn’t worrying. It has pricing power in this market, which should see it recover quickly. Its 2.5% dividend will buy some patience.

June 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Thursday, led by Tesla and other growth shares following a broad selloff on Wall Street on worries over surging inflation and the path for interest rate hikes.
The electric-vehicle maker's shares TSLA.O jumped 3.5% in premarket trading as it sold 32,165 China-made vehicles last month, up sharply from 1,152 in April.

A spike in Brent crude prices LCOc1 above an eye-watering $123 a barrel has made investors anxious ahead of the U.S. consumer price index report on Friday.
Market participants fear a hot reading on inflation could keep the U.S. Federal Reserve on its path to raise interest rates aggressively against the backdrop of a volatile stock market, strong consumer spending and tight labor market.
On Wednesday, International Monetary Fund First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath said U.S. inflation could remain above the Fed's 2% target for a long time based on current projections, and overall, the risks are towards the possibility that this will require much more steeper increases in rates.
The U.S. central bank has raised its short-term interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point this year and intends to keep at it with 50 basis points increases at its meeting next week and again in July.

2022-06-09 00:00:00+00:00,3 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy on the Dip,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-blue-chip-dividend-stocks-to-buy-on-the-dip,,,"One thing billionaire investor Warren Buffett hates to do is to lose money. And investing in blue-chip stocks with strong financials that pay dividends can help minimize the odds that you lose money in the long haul. Although all the stocks listed here are in negative territory this year, they're more than likely to recover.
CVS Health (NYSE: CVS), Home Depot (NYSE: HD), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) all pay dividend yields that are far higher than the S&P 500 average of around 1.4%. Together, these stocks can diversify your portfolio and serve as pillars to build upon for years.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. CVS Health
CVS is one of the largest healthcare companies in the world. In addition to owning a top retail pharmacy, it also has a health insurance business since it acquired Aetna in 2018. That diversification can make it one of the safer healthcare investments to hold. Year to date, the stock has fallen 7%, which is better than the S&P 500's decline of 13%. And with nothing wrong with the business's fundamentals, the dip in price makes now a good opportunity to load up on this ultra-safe dividend stock.
Today, CVS generates close to $300 billion in annual revenue. Last year, sales of $292 billion rose 8.7% year over year. And while the company normally nets a modest profit margin of less than 3%, that still resulted in just under $8 billion in net income for 2021. Over the trailing 12 months, CVS has reported diluted earnings per share of $6.01
Those profits are sufficient to cover the company's dividend per share, which on an annual basis is $2.20 and yields 2.3%. Due to its size and consistently strong bottom line, CVS is one of the safer dividend stocks you can own in the healthcare industry.
2. Home Depot
Home Depot is a name that has become synonymous with home repair. The retailer is a go-to place for tools and anything you might need to help maintain or improve the look of your home. Home Depot generates better margins than CVS; in the past four fiscal years, the retailer's bottom line has been at least 9.7% of revenue.
During the past couple of years the real estate market has been red hot. That, combined with people spending more time at home during the pandemic, has led to a surge in home repair projects. Home Depot's net revenue for its fiscal 2021 (ended Jan. 30, 2022) was more than $151 billion -- 37% higher than the $110 billion it reported two years earlier before the pandemic hit. As a result of all that growth, the company's EPS has soared from $10.25 to $15.53. Even if there's a slowdown in the business, Home Depot is in excellent shape to cover its dividend, which totals $7.60 per share annually. Its yield of around 2.5% is slightly better than the payout from CVS.
However, the stock is down more than 26% in 2022 as investors are likely anticipating a sharp slowdown in revenue. But the good news is Home Depot is still growing -- in May, the company released guidance that estimated sales growth of 3% for the current fiscal year. Its strong financials and continued growth make Home Depot an underrated stock to be holding right now.
3. Intel
Shares of Intel have fallen more than 15% this year as demand in the PC market has been lackluster. Net revenue for the three-month period ended April 2 totaled $18.4 billion and was down 6.7% year over year. And the company's guidance for next quarter called for revenue that wasn't any better -- just $18 billion.
However, these are short-term issues facing a business that has a strong future over the long term. The company is investing billions in expanding its chip manufacturing capabilities to help address the chip shortage; in January, it announced plans to invest $20 billion for two factories in Ohio.
The company's strong balance sheet, which includes close to $40 billion in cash and short-term investments, enables Intel to take on big investments that can help grow the business over the long haul. Plus, the company is a money-making business that has generated free cash flow of $9.8 billion over the trailing 12 months. That's enough to support the $5.7 billion it paid out in dividends during that time while also taking on growth initiatives. That makes its dividend yield of 3.4% look incredibly safe for investors who want both growth opportunities and recurring income.
Intel's business generated more than $79 billion in revenue last year and on that, it earned profits of nearly $20 billion, which equates to a net margin of more than 25%. Regardless of what short-term challenges Intel faces, this is still a rock-sold business to invest in. It makes a ton of profit, brings in loads of cash, and pays a great dividend.

2022-06-09 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Stock: Buy the Dip or Bail? Morgan Stanley Weighs In,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-stock%3A-buy-the-dip-or-bail-morgan-stanley-weighs-in,,,"Intel (INTC) investors are having a bad week -- and it may get worse before it gets better.
Heading into this week, things were already looking grim for Intel. After reporting a 1% slide in sales for Q1 in April, Intel proceeded to guide investors towards lower-than-predicted revenues and earnings in Q2 as well. Then on Monday, Citigroup analyst Christopher Danely chopped his firm's price target on Intel by 10%, to $45 a share, citing likely weakened demand for semiconductors in this year's second half. 
And then there was yesterday's news. In a late-breaking report from Reuters Wednesday, a leaked Intel internal memorandum described plans to pause hiring in Intel's PC semiconductors group. Although the memorandum in question also assured Intel staff that ""we are at the beginning of a long-term growth cycle across the semiconductor industry and we have the right strategy in place,"" if Intel is suspending hiring in its biggest division by revenues, that's certainly not optimistic. Furthermore, Reuters says Intel is canceling employee travel requests within the group, and limiting participation in industry conferences as well -- severe belt tightening that doesn't jibe with Intel coasting atop a ""growth cycle."" 
Commenting on all of this ""news flow"" surrounding the company, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore described his firm's view that Intel is experiencing ""challenging current business conditions."" Citing comments overheard from Intel's CFO at a conference Wednesday, Moore reports that Intel's sales are being impacted by weak demand where customers need a ""match set"" of multiple chips in order to complete manufacture of a given final product. When unable to obtain all the needed parts, such a customer might decide to delay production entirely until it can get its supply chain in order.
Additionally, Intel's finance chief has worries about inventory levels among the company's customers. Customers may be paring inventory levels in general -- perhaps in anticipation of supply chains improving, so there will be less need to hoard chips to ensure needed supply. On the one hand, that's a positive sign pointing to wounded global supply chains starting to heal. On the other hand, though, in the near term it may mean fewer sales for Intel s customers work down their inventories.
""And then there was ... China,"" deadpanned the CFO. As you've probably heard, China has for the past couple of months imposed severe limits on movement in an effort to control the spread of Covid. While these restrictions have been lifting in recent weeks, ""it takes time to get back to normal,"" noted the CFO. And until normal returns, Intel's sales may take a hit.
Overall, ""in all three cases, the circumstances at this point are much worse than what we had anticipated coming into the [second] quarter,"" concluded the CFO.
And given that Intel is describing a situation no better than, and quite possible worse than what it described just ""a few weeks ago,"" Moore is maintaining Morgan Stanley's Underweight (i.e. Sell) rating on Intel stock.(To watch Moore's track record, click here)
According to TipRanks, the consensus on Wall Street is that Intel stock is a “hold” for investors. But TipRanks might as well have said “buy” — because analysts, on average, think the stock, currently at $40.91, could zoom ahead to $51.12 within a year, delivering 25% profits to new investors.

June 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were set to open lower on Thursday as rising bond yields pressured technology and growth stocks, while concerns around surging inflation and the path for interest rate hikes sapped risk appetite.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR climbed to 3.06%, its highest level since May 11. A spike in Brent crude prices LCOc1 above $123 a barrel made investors anxious ahead of the U.S. consumer price index report on Friday.
Market participants fear a hot reading on inflation could keep the U.S. Federal Reserve on its path to raise interest rates aggressively against the backdrop of a volatile stock market, strong consumer spending and tight labor market.
In the previous session, the S&P 500 snapped a two-day winning streak, dragged lower by chipmakers after a bearish brokerage report by Citi Research on Intel Corp INTC.O.
""We're not going to see the market enjoy a robust recovery until there is a sense the inflationary pressures are easing as that will suggest the Fed has been moving in the right direction and the weakening of the economy has not been drastic,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial.
""The market has been in a tight trading range. The volume in either scenario, buying or selling, has been weak and that is indicative of a market without commitment.""
The U.S. central bank has raised its short-term interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point this year and intends to keep at it with 50 basis points increases at its meeting next week and again in July.
At 8:42 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were down 29 points, or 0.09%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 5.25 points, or 0.13%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 28.25 points, or 0.22%.
Rate-sensitive growth stocks like Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Meta Platforms META.O and Netflix Inc NFLX.O fell between 0.2% and 0.8% in premarket trading.
Tesla Inc TSLA.O rose 2.5% as the electric automaker sold 32,165 China-made vehicles last month, up sharply from 1,152 in April. Brokerage UBS upgraded the stock to ""buy"" and raised its profit estimates for the next three years.
Alibaba Group BABA.N slipped 4.1% even as Reuters reported China's central leadership has given a tentative green light to Jack Ma's Ant Group to revive its initial public offering in Shanghai and Hong Kong.
Bloomberg News reported that Chinese financial regulators have started early-stage discussions on a potential revival of Ant Group's IPO.

NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended lower on Wednesday as Treasury yields rose above the psychologically important level of 3% and oil prices jumped, fanning worries about inflation and the outlook for interest rates.
The technology sector .SPLRCT fell, with shares of Intel Corp INTC.O dropping after Citi Research said the chipmaker could pre-announce weaker-than-expected earnings for the second quarter. Other chip shares also declined.
Brent crude oil prices LCOc1rose above $123 a barrel and hit a 13-week high, while the Dow Jones transportation average .DJT significantly underperformed the other main indexes on the day.
""The 10-year Treasury yield is up over 3%. That's probably part of why we're seeing the drawdown in the market today,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.
""That level is what people are focused on because it represents an increase in interest rates and a reflection of inflation and market volatility.""
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields US10YT=RR rose after the U.S. Treasury Department saw tepid demand for a sale of 10-year notes.
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 45.18 points, or 1.09%, to end at 4,115.50 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC lost 90.15 points, or 0.74%, to 12,085.09. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 273.57 points, or 0.82%, to 32,906.57.

The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates by 50 basis points at each of its June and July meetings, with a similar move also likely in September, in an effort to combat inflation.

NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. and European stocks slid on Wednesday as the outlook for rate hikes sullied sentiment, while bond yields rose after euro-zone gross domestic product beat expectations, adding to bets of a more hawkish European Central Bank.
Trading was choppy as investors awaited an ECB meeting on Thursday and U.S. consumer price data on Friday that will highlight the dilemma they face. As central banks tighten policy to tame inflation, it could spark an economic slowdown.
The White House said it expected the headline inflation number on Friday to be ""elevated."" Economists expect annual inflation to be 8.3%, according to a Reuters poll.
Adding to inflation concerns was a surge in crude oil to 13-week highs, while Exxon Mobil XOM.N shares closed at a new record for the first time since 2014.
Investors are worried about the economic outlook and its effect on results. Citi Research analysts cautioned that Intel Corp INTC.O could pre-announce weaker-than-expected earnings for the second quarter. Intel's shares fell 5.3%.
Target TGT.N roiled markets on Tuesday when the retailer cut its profit margin forecast after reporting a much steeper drop in quarterly profit in May than expected. Other companies will follow and challenge second-quarter results, said Philip Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes.
""The market is rolling over here and will at a minimum retest that 3,800 level that we saw in early May over the course of the next couple of months, and it may go a little bit below that,"" he said. He called the recent rally a dead-cat bounce.
The S&P 500 almost confirmed a bear market when it slid more than 20% from its record closing peak on Jan. 3 to an intraday low of 3,810.32 on May 20, but the benchmark closed higher.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX fell 0.57% as concerns about growth weighed on banking shares, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS fell 0.56%.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 0.81%, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 1.08% and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 0.73%.
Data showed the euro zone economy grew much faster in this year's first quarter than the previous three months, despite the war in Ukraine, the European Union statistics office said, as it revised earlier estimates sharply higher.
Investors raised their bets on ECB rate hikes, and money markets priced in 75 basis points of rate hikes by September.
German and U.S. Treasury yields rose after the euro area GDP data beat expectations, adding to bets of a more hawkish ECB.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR rose 6.6 basis points to 3.036%. Yields also rose on tepid demand for the sale of $33 billion in 10-year notes.
Germany's 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro area, rose to its first new high since 2014 at 1.368%.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development slashed its growth outlook to 3% this year from 4.5% forecast in December. The OECD also raised its inflation estimates, though it said there was a limited risk of ""stagflation.""
The euro hit a seven-year peak against the yen, getting a lift from the upward revision to first quarter growth. Against the dollar, the euro EUR= was up 0.12% to $1.0712.
The dollar index =USD rose, while the U.S. currency hit a fresh 20-year high against the yen. The yen JPY=EBS weakened to hit 134.47 per dollar, its softest since Feb. 27, 2002.
Asian stocks strengthened overnight, with Chinese stocks seeing some relief from easing of COVID-19 restrictions, but sentiment was volatile and European indexes fell soon after opening.
Japan's economy shrank slightly less than initially reported in the first quarter, as private consumption remained resilient and companies rebuilt inventories.
Oil prices rose about 1% as U.S. crude hit a 13-week high despite a rise in domestic crude inventories, as supplies looked likely to tighten with China easing lockdowns and Norwegian oil workers planning to strike.
U.S. crude futures CLc1 rose $2.70 to settle at $122.11 a barrel and Brent LCOc1 settled up $3.01 to $123.58 a barrel.
Gold inched up in choppy trade as concerns over economic growth boosted the metal's safe-haven appeal.
U.S. gold futures GCv1 settled up 0.2% at $1,856.50.
Bitcoin BTC=BTSP fell 3.11% to $30,147.80.

2022-06-08 00:00:00+00:00,Economic Concerns and Intel Pushed The Dow Jones Down Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/economic-concerns-and-intel-pushed-the-dow-jones-down-today,,,"Further concerns about an economic slowdown and an analyst downgrade for the large semiconductor chip maker Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) helped drive the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a decline of nearly 270 points today.
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bill remained above 3% as investors continued to analyze whether or not the economy is headed south amid high levels of inflation.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow Tracker tracks economic data in real-time in order to forecast where the economy might be headed. It recently indicated that the U.S. economy could soon be in a recession, which in technical terms would be two straight quarters of negative GDP growth.
U.S. GDP fell at an annualized rate of 1.5% in the first three months of the year, and GDPNow data recently showed that the U.S. economy in the second quarter is likely to post just a modest annualized rise of 0.9%. Economists before this had been estimating GDP growth of 1.3% in Q2.
The news hit the financials sector in particular. Several banks, such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and American Express, found themselves among the worst performers in the Dow.
Intel may miss second-quarter estimates
Intel led the Dow downward, with its shares falling more than 5% today, after Citigroup analyst Christopher Danely warned investors today that he expects the company to miss its second-quarter guidance. Danely's belief stems from comments made by Intel CFO David Zinsner at a recent conference.
Zinsner at the conference said Intel has recently been experiencing three major headwinds. One was that customers couldn't get the components they need to build their own products. Customers have also been reducing their inventory. Then, there were issues in China, due to lockdowns imposed by the country after a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. All of this impacted demand worse than Intel had expected in the quarter.
Zinsner added that Intel expects choppiness in performance similar to other industry peers. However, the company expects to stick with its strategic plan and execute strongly to reach good results.
Danely said in a research note that he believes his bear case is ""taking shape even earlier"" than he anticipated. Danely maintained his ""neutral"" rating on the stock and a $45 price target but lowered his estimates for Intel's revenue and earnings per share for 2022.
Should you be concerned about Intel and the economy?
Interestingly, new data yesterday showed that the cost of semiconductors may be finally peaking and that shipping prices have been steadily declining as well. I would have expected this news to more broadly benefit Intel.
Intel hasn't exactly crushed it over the past year, or even in the last five years. However, it's operating in a market that is only going to grow and become more important. Large companies like Intel are also typically able to ride out economic slowdowns better than more volatile, small-cap stocks so I don't disagree with Citigroup's hold rating on the chip maker.
As for the economy, a recession is possible but I am more in the camp that if we do see a recession it will be more modest in nature. Consumers are still relatively healthy and spending at strong levels. I also think the Fed will eventually be able to bring down consumer prices and the labor market still looks quite strong right now.

NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday as Treasury yields rose above the psychologically important 3% level and oil prices jumped, fanning worries about inflation and the outlook for interest rates.
The S&P 500 ended down more than 1% in the broad sell-off, snapping a two-day winning streak.
Among its biggest drags, shares of Intel Corp INTC.O slid 5.3% after Citi cut its estimates on the chipmaker for the second time in a week. Citi pointed to uncertainty about demand for personal computers and predicted the company could pre-announce weaker-than-expected earnings for the second quarter. Other chip shares also fell.
Brent crude oil prices LCOc1 rose above $123 a barrel and hit a 13-week high, while the Dow Jones transportation average .DJT fell 3.8%, significantly underperforming the other main indexes on the day. The S&P 500 energy sector .SPNY was the only sector to end higher.
""The 10-year Treasury yield is up over 3%. That's probably part of why we're seeing the drawdown in the market today,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.
""That level is what people are focused on because it represents an increase in interest rates and a reflection of inflation and market volatility.""
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields US10YT=RR rose after the U.S. Treasury Department saw tepid demand for a sale of 10-year notes. Rising interest rates tend to be a negative for stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 269.24 points, or 0.81%, to 32,910.9; the S&P 500 .SPX lost 44.91 points, or 1.08%, to 4,115.77; and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 88.96 points, or 0.73%, to 12,086.27.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.78-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.33-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and 29 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 36 new highs and 70 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.62 billion shares, compared with the 12.26 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
