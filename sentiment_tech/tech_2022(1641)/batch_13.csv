2022-10-09 00:00:00+00:00,3 Companies That Could Be Worth $1 Trillion by 2030,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-companies-that-could-be-worth-%241-trillion-by-2030,,,"Only a handful of companies have reached the trillion dollars in value mark, but that number will likely grow in coming years. As I set out to find companies that could reach a trillion-dollar valuation, I had a few requirements. The companies must have an extremely large addressable market, must have an identifiable moat to build on, and be growing and profitable today.
The three stocks that stood out to me are Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), Disney (NYSE: DIS), and Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE).
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
There's one chip manufacturer that's more important than any other in the world today, and that's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. The company is a third-party manufacturer for chip leaders like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and dozens of other companies designing their own chips.
Designing a great chip is great, but someone has to make the chip, and that's where Taiwan Semiconductor comes in.
You can see in the chart below that the company is now trading at just 13.2 times earnings, and has grown revenue and net income 91.5% and 140.4% respectively in the last three years.
TSM Market Cap data by YCharts
What's fascinating about the company's place in chip manufacturing is that there's no clear competitor at the bleeding edge of manufacturing. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is years behind, GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: GFS) is much smaller, and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) has a more integrated business model. For chip companies that don't own fabrication facilities, Taiwan Semiconductor is still the go-to manufacturer if you're designing at the cutting edge.
Given the company's strong strategic position, technology, growth, and profitability, I think this could be the first of these companies to reach $1 trillion in value.
Disney
The last five years haven't been quite as smooth sailing at Disney. The company has seen cable connections decline, streaming has been an enormous investment, and the pandemic had a huge effect on both theaters and theme parks. But Disney is positioned for a decade of growth.
DIS Market Cap data by YCharts
Disney now technically has more subscribers than Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) when you add together Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu. So, it's a leader in next-generation media distribution.
Investors haven't liked the money being spent on streaming, but the payoff may be getting better very soon. Disney announced an advertising tier, but instead of offering a lower-cost version of Disney+ with ads, it is keeping the same $8 per month price but adding advertising, increasing the price to $11 per month if you want no ads.
Disney's ability to create compelling content and then monetize it through what I call a waterfall of businesses -- from the theater to streaming to merchandise to theme parks -- is unmatched in media. The company needs to do well to reach a $1 trillion valuation by 2030, but I think it can get there.
Adobe
Adobe has long made valuable software for designers, but it's now poised to become the operating system of the design and programming community if it can complete the acquisition of Figma.
You can see below that Adobe's business of licensing software to creators has been a growth machine over the last decade. But it's creating tools that people use to create assets, not a platform they're using to collaborate on. That's why the acquisition of Figma is a big deal.
ADBE Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
You can see above that Adobe currently trades for 28.5 times trailing earnings, and Figma should help with future growth. But for Adobe to become a $1 trillion company, it needs to lean into Figma's multi-user platform to become a real juggernaut. I think it can do that, pulling not only graphic designers but programmers, project managers, and many more into the Figma ecosystem. Don't be surprised if products like Photoshop and Illustrator become add-ons to Figma, not the other way around.
Now that Adobe has a potential platform solution, the sky is the limit for the company's value. That's why I think this could be a $1 trillion company by the end of the decade.
Thinking big
There's no guarantee any of these companies will reach the heights of a $1 trillion company, but they all have the foundation needed to get there. If management thinks big, these stocks could be trading near the most valuable companies in the world.

2022-10-09 00:00:00+00:00,Why I'm Doubling Down On Intel's Dividend,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-im-doubling-down-on-intels-dividend,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has been under tremendous pressure this year. Shares of the semiconductor company have tumbled about 50%. That decline has pushed its dividend yield to 5.6%.
While Intel is facing its share of headwinds, I believe better days lie ahead for the tech giant and its big-time dividend. That's why I'm doubling down on my position. I have growing confidence Intel can sustain and grow its dividend in the coming years.
Building out a chip behemoth
Intel is struggling these days. Revenue tumbled 22% in the second quarter to $15.3 billion. Meanwhile, the company reported a net loss of $500 million, well below the $5.1 billion profit it posted in the prior-year period.
CEO Pat Gelsinger didn't mince words when discussing the company's second-quarter results. He stated: ""This quarter's results were below the standards we have set for the company and our shareholders. We must and will do better."" While the sudden and rapid decline in economic conditions was a big driver, Gelsinger noted that ""the shortfall also reflects our own execution issues.""
The company is working to address its issues. It's investing heavily to build new semiconductor manufacturing capacity to capitalize on the large and growing market opportunity. It's spending up to $30 billion to build two fabrication plants in Arizona. Meanwhile, it could spend upwards of $100 billion apiece to build new complexes in Ohio and Germany. The company sees these investments as crucial in helping it capture the growth ahead for semiconductor sales, which could double by the end of the decade to more than $1 trillion.
Building a funding bridge
Intel is investing an enormous amount of money to capitalize on what could be a massive opportunity. However, investors are concerned that it might be taking on more than it can handle. The company expects to invest $23 billion this year on expansion projects. That spending level puts its adjusted free cash flow at negative $1 billion to $2 billion.
That's causing some concern that Intel might need to cut its dividend to help finance its aggressive expansion plans. That would save it almost $6 billion per year.
However, Intel believes it can maintain its payout amid this investment cycle. The bedrock of that belief is its strong balance sheet. Intel has a hefty cash balance, ending the second quarter with $27 billion of cash and short-term investments. Meanwhile, it has A-rated credit, giving it the flexibility to borrow money at attractive rates. It's also planning to complete an initial public offering of its Mobileye subsidiary to raise additional cash to help fund its new factories.
Intel has also accelerated the deployment of its smart capital strategy. It signed a first-of-its-kind semiconductor co-investment program with leading global infrastructure investor Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP). The deal will see Brookfield Infrastructure and its institutional partners fund 49% of the up to $30 billion projected price tag for its Arizona fabrication facilities.
The partnership will provide a cumulative $15 billion benefit to Intel's adjusted free cash flow over the next few years. That will help protect its cash and debt capacity for future investments while allowing Intel to fund a healthy and growing dividend. The framework serves as a blueprint for potentially similar transactions to help finance other capacity expansions.
Meanwhile, Intel could be the single biggest beneficiary of the CHIPS Act that the U.S. Congress recently passed to boost domestic high-tech manufacturing. The company could collect several billion dollars in payouts over the next few years to help fund its expansion projects.
None of this guarantees that Intel will be able to maintain its dividend, let alone continue growing the payout as it executes its expansion strategy. However, the company's strong balance sheet and deal with Brookfield are helping build a bridge to better days when its new plants come online and start growing its cash flow.
The dividend appears poised to continue growing
Intel has a pretty solid track record of paying dividends. The tech giant has steadily increased that payout over the years and intends to continue doing so in the future. That seems much more likely following its deal with Brookfield and the passing of the CHIPS Act.
Because of that, I believe Intel can deliver on its promise to continue growing its dividend. That's why I recently doubled down on my position to capitalize on the steep slide in its stock price and lock in an even more attractive dividend yield.

2022-10-09 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Dow Jones Dividend Stocks to Buy in October and Hold for Decades,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-dow-jones-dividend-stocks-to-buy-in-october-and-hold-for-decades,,,"The 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) tend to be industry-leading companies that are meant to provide a representation of the broader economy. And although the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are generally preferred benchmarks over the DJIA since they are market-cap weighted and include more companies, the DJIA remains a reliable source of inspiration for building a stock market starter kit. It can also be a good place to turn to for buys during a bear market.
Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) stand out as three reliable Dow stocks to buy in October and hold for decades. Investing in equal parts of each company produces a dividend yield of 3.6%. Here's what makes each dividend stock a great buy now.
Image source: Getty Images.
The industrial conglomerate that invests like a growth company
Lee Samaha (Honeywell International): Dow Jones stocks are known for being mature blue chip companies. Honeywell certainly fits that bill, but it's also a company categorized by ongoing investment in growth industries. As such, the case for buying the stock and holding it for decades is based on the idea that there is plenty of growth in its pipeline.
Indeed, management certainly thinks so because it upgraded its expectation for long-term organic growth to 4%-7% a year from a previous estimate of 3%-5% during its investor conference in March. In addition, Honeywell's management also upgraded its estimate for segment margin expansion from 30 basis points-50 basis points a year (where 100 basis equal 1%) to 40 basis points-60 basis points a year.
The improved growth expectations reflect management's ongoing development of its software business, Honeywell Connected Enterprise. Not only does increasing software content raise Honeywell's margin profile, but it also adds value to Honeywell's equipment. For example, its Honeywell Forge (enterprise performance management software) can gather mass data on building performance to improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption -- something that adds value to Honeywell's building technology solutions.
Alongside its software development, Honeywell also has a collection of so-called ""breakthrough initiatives"" that include investments in quantum computing, avionics and propulsion systems for air taxis, unmanned cargo drones, and last-mile delivery drones. Meanwhile, its Sustainable Technology Solutions business is developing renewable fuels, carbon capture solutions, plastics recycling technology, and green hydrogen technology.
It all adds up to a company teaming with growth potential, and investors can buy and hold the stock while they wait for the company to realize its growth ambitions.
Intel is a tempting turnaround play
Daniel Foelber (Intel): Intel stock is hovering around its 52-week low and is trading at roughly the lowest price in eight years. Interestingly enough, Intel has also raised its dividend for eight consecutive years, which has coincided with its underperforming stock.
INTC data by YCharts
The result is that Intel's dividend yield is hovering around an all-time high -- currently at 5.2%. A good proxy for valuation is looking at the dividend yield over time. Historically speaking, Intel's dividend yield has rarely been above 3%.
INTC Dividend Yield data by YCharts
Intel stock is cheap no matter how you look at it -- through its dividend yield, its price-to-earnings ratio of just 5.9, you name it. The issue is that Intel, in many ways, deserves to be a cheap stock. The company has been mismanaged for years and has lost market share to its competitors. Although Intel is scrambling to catch up, it still holds a sizable position in the market. Its influence, paired with its high dividend yield and low valuation, makes it an ideal candidate for a turnaround play.
Investors interested in Intel are betting it will be able to turn its business around. And those apprehensive about Intel stock may be waiting for concrete signs of a turnaround before hitting the buy button. Nothing in the stock market is free. And when a company is down as bad as Intel, it's usually for a good reason.
However, Intel's valuation implies stagnating to low growth. With hopes low and doubts high, investors are getting a good price for Intel. The 5.2% dividend yield provides a powerful passive income stream while investors give the turnaround a chance to take form.
Given the vulnerability of the chip industry to the broader economy, paired with Intel having to play catch-up to its peers, it's worth understanding that it could take several years for Intel's turnaround to truly take form -- underscoring the importance of maintaining a long-term horizon when it comes to investing in Intel stock.
Chevron can power your portfolio with passive income for years and years
Scott Levine (Chevron): Carving out time to shop for stocks instead of Halloween candy and decorations? That's a smart move. With the recent volatility rattling the markets, some keen buying opportunities have presented themselves -- chances to pick up high-quality stocks such as Chevron that can boost your passive income for decades.
Before we look at the decades ahead, it's worth taking a quick view in the rearview mirror. Raising its dividend for the past 36 consecutive years, Chevron has earned a place among the noble class of stocks known as Dividend Aristocrats. Even more noteworthy is the fact that Chevron is one of only two energy stocks (the other being ExxonMobil) that have achieved this noble rank. This prior performance doesn't guarantee that the company will retain its place among these dividend all-stars. Still, it's certainly an encouraging sign that Chevron is able to maintain its dedication to shareholders during periods of volatility in energy markets.
Offering investors a 3.6% forward yield, Chevron's stock is one of the most compelling choices found in the energy sector. The company has a strong presence throughout the value chain, operating an extensive portfolio of upstream, midstream, and downstream assets. And it's not as if these assets aren't producing strong returns. According to a recent investor presentation, Chevron forecasts growing cash flow from operations at a compound annual growth rate of more than 10% (excluding working capital) through 2026 provided that the price of Brent crude oil is $60 per barrel.

2022-10-09 00:00:00+00:00,1 Under-the-Radar Tech Growth Stock to Buy in October,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-under-the-radar-tech-growth-stock-to-buy-in-october,,,"Anyone invested in the semiconductor sector knows that the industry is headed into a down cycle. Huge demand during the pandemic led to chip shortages, but now that central banks are tightening up their fiscal policies to tamp down on inflation -- and economic growth -- demand has slumped, suppliers are loaded with inventory, and prices are falling for memory chips worldwide. Despite a rally this week, the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) is still down 39% on the year.
And yet, the semiconductor industry is going to grow over the long term, and likely at a much faster rate than the overall economy. Today, many chip stocks trade at bargain levels, setting up those who invest in them now for potentially outsized gains once the market recovers.
One under-the-radar company in this space that looks like a terrific buy today is equipment supplier Onto Innovation (NYSE: ONTO).
Exposure to the most attractive parts of the market
Onto Innovation is relatively small by semiconductor equipment standards, with a market cap of just $3.3 billion. However, it has put forth some powerful technology in some of the more attractive parts of the market: leading-edge metrology and advanced packaging.
Even though a semiconductor slump may be in the cards, chipmakers will still invest to compete on the most advanced nodes. Samsung and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) look set to invest heavily through this cycle, as they aim to build alternatives to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), which pulled ahead of both of them a few years ago and now dominates leading-edge chip production. In fact, Samsung just announced a bold plan to produce 2 nm chips by 2025 and 1.4 nm chips by 2027, with a goal of tripling its advanced node capacity by that time. Intel has announced it aims to transition through four nodes in just five years -- an ambitious timeline.
Onto Innovation makes metrology solutions for leading-edge logic and memory chips. Metrology, to put it simply, is the science of measurement. And in the specific context of manufacturing chips, it refers to the quality-assurance tools and techniques used to calibrate the machines and scan the chips they produce for imperfections at nearly every step of the process. As chip geometries get smaller and smaller and manufacturing execution becomes more difficult, the need for quality metrology solutions intensifies.
The company's other segment focuses on wafer inspection and advanced packaging lithography -- two areas that should also grow in the years ahead. As foundries struggle to shrink transistor distances further, chipmakers are now turning to advanced packaging solutions and chiplet architectures to keep Moore's Law valid. Advanced packaging is also growing with the ascension of electric vehicles and edge-computing devices.
Equipment sales account for 83% of Onto Innovation's revenue, split roughly evenly between the leading-edge and advanced packaging segments; software and services make up the remaining 17%.
An exciting growth catalyst
Onto Innovation also has a particularly important catalyst coming up. The semiconductor industry is transitioning from FinFET transistors (in which gates surround each transistor on three sides) to Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors. As the name suggests, that new architecture has gating material on all sides of the transistor, which also enables vertical transistor stacking. Samsung is already beginning production of GAA chips at the 3 nm node, which is just ramping up as we speak. TSMC is staying with FinFET for 3 nm, but will transition to GAA at 2 nm, likely in 2024.
Onto Innovation is in a great spot here, as its new Atlas 3D metrology system looks to have the lead in performance capabilities, especially when it comes to the 3D-modeling capabilities needed for GAA-based chips. According to reports and industry blogs, it appears as though Atlas machines outperform even KLA's (NASDAQ: KLAC) metrology solutions in GAA nodes. Given that KLA dominates the metrology industry with a market share of more than 50%, a competitive win by Onto Innovation could make a meaningful dent in the balance of power.
In July, the Atlas machine won the Best of West Award at the SEMICON West trade show. Management also said on its August conference call that it has already received orders for Atlas on both 3 nm and 2 nm node buildouts. That gives management great visibility, and it expects advanced node revenue to rise by 40% this year.
In addition, it forecast that advanced packaging revenue will rise by 20%, so both of its segments are growing faster than the 9% to 10% growth that the broader semiconductor equipment industry is experiencing in 2022. Even though Onto Innovation is small, it appears fiercely competitive in its high-growth specialty niches.
The market downturn has made this growth stock a bargain
The semiconductor sector's swoon has brought down Onto Innovation's valuation to a quite reasonable 17.7 times earnings. However, the company also has an excess $545 million ($10.98 per share) in cash on its balance sheet and no debt, which brings its price-to-earnings ratio ex-cash down to just 15.
Meanwhile, revenue grew by 33% last quarter. Although margins took a hit due to supply chain issues and inflationary pressures, management expects those headwinds to diminish as the supply chain becomes unkinked.
Onto Innovation doesn't pay a dividend and hasn't bought back stock -- qualities that may turn off some investors. However, it's hoarding cash for potential acquisitions, and its big cash balance could be a huge asset if the market becomes stressed next year. In that scenario, it could make some opportunistic purchases at bargain prices.
With its rock-solid balance sheet, a multiyear catalyst ahead in the Gate-All-Around transition, and a cheap valuation for its growth rate, Onto Innovation should be on every tech investor's radar.

AMD, Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, Intel Corp INTC.O, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Micron Technology Inc MU.O were down between 1.2% and 6.0%, weighing on smaller peers such as Marvell Technology Inc MRVL.O and Applied Materials Inc AMAT.O.
Samsung, the world's top maker of memory chips, smartphones and televisions, is a bellwether for global consumer demand and its disappointing preliminary results add to a flurry of earnings downgrades and gloomy forecasts.
The chip sector has been grappling with weak demand, spurred by decades-high inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions and pandemic-related lockdowns in China, hitting the PC and smartphone market as businesses and consumers rein in expenses.
Nearly a dozen analysts cut their price targets on AMD's shares by as much as $50 after the U.S.-based chipmaker slashed its third-quarter revenue outlook by about a billion dollars.
""We believe AMD's warning will have the most negative read-across for PC peer Intel, but also somewhat for Nvidia and related memory and data center peers,"" BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya said.
Memory chip buyers such as smartphone and PC makers are holding off on new purchases and using up existing inventory, leading to lower shipments and ushering in an industry downcycle.
""We still think the industry is heading for its deepest downcycle in a decade, thanks to high supply chain inventories and falling end demand,"" Jefferies analysts said.
Global chip sales grew just 0.1% in August, making it the 15th month of a downcycle since June 2021, when sales rose more than 30%, according to Jefferies.
Shares of major U.S. chipmakers have already lost between a third and half of their value so far this year, following huge gains last year when Nvidia was inching closer to a trillion-dollar valuation.

OAKLAND, Calif., Oct 7 (Reuters) - They did it to Huawei. They used it on Russia. Now, the United States is going after China's advanced computing and supercomputer industry.
The weapon? A little-known rule that enables U.S. regulators to extend their technology export control powers far beyond America's borders to transactions between foreign countries and China.
The provision called the foreign direct product rule, or FDPR, was first introduced in 1959 to control trading of U.S. technologies. It essentially says that if a product was made using American technology, the U.S. government has the power to stop it from being sold - including products made in a foreign country.
On Friday, U.S. officials applied the rule to China's advanced computing and supercomputer industry to stop it from obtaining advanced computing chips.
The rule took center stage in August 2020, when it was used against China telecom company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd HWT.UL. American officials had tried to cut off Huawei's supply of semiconductors but found that companies were still shipping to Huawei chips made in factories outside the United States.
Eventually, U.S. regulators found a choke point: Almost all chip factories contain critical tools from U.S. suppliers. So they expanded the FDPR to control trade of chips made using U.S. technology or tools. That move was a blow to Huawei's smart phone business, and U.S. regulators used it on Russia and Belarus after the invasion of Ukraine to cut off chips.
Dan Fisher-Owens, a specialist in export controls on chips at law firm Berliner Corcoran & Rowe, said the expansion in FDPR closed a gap in U.S. export control jurisdiction.
However, he said the United States has been cautious about using the rule as it can drag foreign companies into the process and ""create friction"" with allies who may disagree with the application of U.S. law.
Senior U.S. officials said on Friday the new application will stop advanced chip use in Chinese supercomputers, which can be used to develop nuclear weapons and other military applications.
The United States had already placed a number of Chinese supercomputing companies on a restricted entity list, cutting them off from buying U.S. chips. But those companies started to design their own chips and seek to have them manufactured - a strategy that the U.S. action on Friday were designed to thwart.
The latest move would ban any semiconductor manufacturing firm that uses American tools - which most do - from selling advanced chips to China, said Karl Freund, a chip consultant at Cambrian AI who watches the supercomputing space.
""They will have to develop their own manufacturing technologies, and they'll have to develop their own processor technologies to replace the missing U.S. or Western technologies that they're using today,"" said Freund, a chip consultant at Cambrian AI who watches the supercomputing space.
In that case, it could take China five to 10 years to catch up to today's technology, he added.

Oct 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street fell sharply on Friday after a solid jobs report for September increased the likelihood the Federal Reserve will barrel ahead with an interest rate hiking campaign many investors fear will push the U.S. economy into a recession.
The Labor Department reported the unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, lower than expectations of 3.7%, in an economy that continues to show resilience despite the Fed's efforts to bring down high inflation by weakening growth.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 263,000 jobs, more than the 250,000 figure economists polled by Reuters had forecast. Money markets raised to 94.1% the probability of a 75 basis-point rate hike when Fed policymakers meet on Nov. 1-2, up from 83.4% before the data.
The job gains, lower unemployment rate and continued healthy wage growth point to a labor market Fed officials will likely continue to see as keeping inflation too high.
In the latest of a steady stream of hawkish messages by policymakers, New York Fed President John Williams said more rate hikes were needed to tackle sticky inflation in a process that will also likely increase unemployment.
""Rates have gotten too extreme,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. ""They are risking doing some harm they don't really need to do, in my opinion. But they're under pressure, and they see it differently.""
The Fed should not take comfort in the historically tight labor market because when the unemployment rate begins to rise, a leading indicator of a recession, it does so quickly, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""We haven't felt the full effects of the tightening,"" he said. ""They're going to keep going until eventually this thing turns over, and when it turns over you won't be able to slow the momentum.""
Despite a hefty two-day rally earlier in the week, Friday's nosedive put the S&P 500 on track for its fourth straight weekly decline, while the Dow and the Nasdaq were poised for their seventh consecutive weekly declines.
By 2:12 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 602.47 points, or 2.01%, to 29,324.47, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 99.25 points, or 2.65%, to 3,645.27 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 398.87 points, or 3.6%, to 10,674.44.
Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors declined more than 1%, with the technology sector .SPLRCT leading the fall, down 4.0%. Energy .SPNY was the sole gainer, rising 0.1%.
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX shed 5.9% after a revenue warning from Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O signaled a chip slump could be worse than expected. The index was poised for its biggest single-day percentage decline in nearly a month.
AMD shares fell 12.3%, the largest decliner on the Nasdaq 100, as its third-quarter revenue estimates were about $1 billion lower than previously forecast.
Peers Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Intel Corp INTC.O, ON Semiconductors ON.O, Lam Research LRCX.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O shed between 2.44% and 6.63%.
FedEx Corp FDX.N lost 1.5% after an internal memo seen by Reuters showed the division that handles most e-commerce deliveries expects to lower volume forecasts as its customers plan to ship fewer holiday packages.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 5.67-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.19-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 2 new 52-week highs and 64 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 20 new highs and 273 new lows

2022-10-07 00:00:00+00:00,Why Chip Stocks Were Falling Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-chip-stocks-were-falling-today,,,"What happened
Shares of leading chip stocks were tumbling today after Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) confirmed what investors had been fearing: a severe downturn in PC demand. AMD won't release fiscal third-quarter results until November, but it announced preliminary revenue of approximately $5.6 billion for the quarter, missing management's forecast for $6.7 billion.
As a result, investors hit the sell button on chip stocks, sending shares of Advanced Micro Devices down by 10.9%, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) by 6.8%, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) by 4% as of 12:40 p.m. ET.
This caps off a rough year for AMD, with its stock price already lower by 50% year to date, despite still being on pace to report strong full-year revenue growth.
So what
AMD was the last domino to fall. Intel and Nvidia had already reported weakening revenue growth in the last quarter -- a sign of how bad things are getting across the semiconductor industry. Nvidia had started to see its gaming segment decelerate as early as Q1 of this year. AMD's revenue increased by at least 70% year over year in the first two quarters of the year, but that momentum is apparently over for now.
On a positive note, AMD said that revenue across data center, gaming, and embedded segments each grew ""significantly year over year,"" consistent with expectations. This means AMD is still running circles around Intel in the consumer and enterprise central processing unit (CPU) market. Even with the revised figure for the upcoming earnings report, AMD's revenue will still be up 29% year over year, which is much better than Intel.
Intel saw revenue fall 22% year over year in the last quarter, citing the weakening demand in the PC market and economy overall. But execution issues appear to be Chipzilla's biggest problem. The company is spending billions of dollars to speed up innovation and expand domestic manufacturing capacity to regain control of the supply chain and market leadership. Intel's capital expenditures were up 56% in the first half of the year, which is pressuring profitability just as PC shipments are starting to plunge.
Both AMD and Nvidia have reported strong growth in their respective data center segments this year, but investors are starting to get nervous. Some analysts fear that the accelerating decline in PC shipments will eventually spill over to the enterprise market. Nvidia's data center revenue growth decelerated from 83% in Q1 to 61% in Q2, which is not the trend investors want to see.
Now what
Investors might want to wait for the dust to settle before rushing to buy any of these beaten-down growth stocks. However, if you have a long-term perspective, it's easy to make the case that AMD is being significantly undervalued at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.6. Its record of superior growth makes AMD a better buy next to Intel, which has struggled to keep up and is not that much cheaper, trading at a P/E of 11.5.
Data by YCharts
Still, investors should watch the chip battle in the near term. Intel appears to be ready to fight back aggressively against its smaller rival. AMD's new Ryzen 7000 series CPUs for desktop could face stiff competition against Intel's upcoming Raptor Lake release, which offers comparable performance at a lower price point. Intel is also aggressively pricing its new Arc A750 and A770 graphics cards, which could take a small bite out of Nvidia's lower-end market.
Nvidia is more expensive trading at 36 times expected earnings. Team Green is experiencing a similar decline in revenue as AMD. Nvidia just released its new RTX 40 series graphics chips for gaming, which some investors are hopeful can turn things around next year. Nvidia expects revenue of about $5.9 billion for the fiscal third quarter, down from $7.1 billion in the same period a year ago.
While Intel tries to recover, AMD and Nvidia are executing against massive long-term growth opportunities in advanced AI-based computing applications and software. These companies are not done growing, so investors could have a rare opportunity to buy these stocks at incredibly cheap valuations.

Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks nosedived on Friday as solid job growth and a drop in the unemployment rate last month boosted the chances of more jumbo-sized interest rate hikes, while a revenue warning from Advanced Micro Devices hit chipmakers.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 263,000 jobs last month after rising 315,000 in August.
The report also showed the jobless rate fell to 3.5% in September, lower than expectations of 3.7%. Traders now see a 92% chance of 75 basis-point hike by the Federal Reserve, up from 83.4% before data.
Aggressive rise in borrowing costs have stoked fears of slowing economic growth and a hit to corporate profits, but with the labor market remaining tight, the U.S. central bank was likely to continue with its monetary tightening plan.
""While the labor supply and demand remain in this state, combined with high inflation, the Fed will continue to be forced to tighten until the economy snaps off its current momentum,"" said Rusty Vanneman, chief investment strategist at Orion Advisor Solutions.
Sticking to the hawkish tone by most Fed officials, New York President John Williams said more rate hikes were needed to tackle sticky inflation.
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX shed 5.14%, and was set for its biggest one-day percentage decline in nearly a month as a revenue warning from Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O signaled the chip slump could be worse than expected.
AMD lost 10.82% as its third-quarter revenue estimates were about a billion dollars less than previously forecast.
Peers Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Intel Corp INTC.O, ON Semiconductors ON.O, Lam Research LRCX.O, and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O shed between 2.44% and 6.63%.
""People who had been hoping for some kind of turnaround in the chips are starting to give up that hope,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.
The S&P 500 technology sector .SPLRCT index fell more than 3%, leading declines among the 11 major sector indexes.
At 11:56 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 495.62 points, or 1.66%, at 29,431.32, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 82.39 points, or 2.20%, at 3,662.13, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 344.02 points, or 3.11%, at 10,729.30.
All three main Wall Street indexes are still set to snap a three-week losing streak, heading for their biggest weekly gain in almost a month.
With the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR rising to 3.910%, most rate-sensitive technology and growth stocks such as Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O fell between 2.14% and 4.46%.US/
FedEx Corp FDX.N lost 2.42% after an internal memo accessed by Reuters showed the company's division that handles most of the e-commerce deliveries plans to lower volume forecasts as its customers plan to ship fewer holiday packages.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 4.96-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 3.79-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded two new 52-week highs and 54 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 16 new highs and 214 new lows.

Oct 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street slid on Friday as solid job growth and a drop in the unemployment rate last month gave more room for the Federal Reserve to stick to jumbo-sized interest rate hikes, while a revenue warning from Advanced Micro Devices hit chipmakers.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 263,000 jobs last month after rising 315,000 in August.
The report also showed the jobless rate fell to 3.5% in September, lower than expectations of 3.7%. Traders now see a 92% chance of 75 basis-point hike by the Fed, up from 83.4% before data.
Aggressive rise in borrowing costs have stoked fears of slowing economic growth and a hit to corporate profits, but with the labor market remaining tight, the Fed was likely to continue with its monetary tightening plan.
""The markets are worried that the Fed is going to rely on information like this that's really a month old and they're going to overshoot and kill the economy,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.
""Investors don't have confidence in a soft landing because the Fed continues to have to ramp higher and higher to begin to slow the economy down.""
The Philadelphia Semiconductor SE index .SOX shed 4.2%, and was set for its biggest one-day percentage decline in nearly a month as a revenue warning from Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O signaled the chip slump could be worse than expected.
AMD fell 7.97% as its third-quarter revenue estimates were about a billion dollars less than previously forecast.
Peers Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Intel Corp INTC.O, ON Semiconductors ON.O, Lam Research LRCX.O, and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O shed between 2.65% and 4.88%.
""People who had been hoping for some kind of turnaround in the chips are starting to give up that hope,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.
The S&P 500 technology sector .SPLRCT index fell 3.1%, leading declines among the 11 major sector indexes.
At 10:02 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 488.84 points, or 1.63%, at 29,438.10, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 80.05 points, or 2.14%, at 3,664.47, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 309.86 points, or 2.80%, at 10,763.45.
All three main Wall Street indexes are still set to snap a three-week losing streak, heading for their biggest weekly gain in almost a month.
With the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR rising to 3.8875%, most rate-sensitive technology and growth stocks such as Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O fell between 2.25% and 3.92%.US/
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 7.75-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 4.70-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded two new 52-week highs and 49 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 12 new highs and 148 new lows.

2022-10-07 00:00:00+00:00,Should Investors Stay Away from Top Chipmaker Stocks?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-investors-stay-away-from-top-chipmaker-stocks,,,"Shares of top chipmakers, including Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), have eroded investors’ wealth in 2022. The slump in consumer demand and lower average selling prices are taking a toll on their financials and stock price. Amid challenges, Robert W. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra suggests investors stay away from PC-centric companies. 
Gerra wrote, “We would continue to stay away from PC-centric names, which within our coverage list include AMD, INTC, and NVDA, due to a likely prolonged PC downturn into next year and continued weakness in consumer gaming.” 
While Gerra remained sidelined on the shares of these chipmakers, AMD’s lackluster Q3 performance further strengthened his view. Notably, AMD announced preliminary numbers for Q3, wherein its revenue of $5.6 billion came about $1.1 billion lower than its prior expectations. AMD blamed a weaker-than-expected PC market and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain for the underperformance.
Gerra reduced his price target to $65 from $100 on Advanced Micro Devices stock following the preliminary Q3 numbers. He maintains a Hold recommendation on AMD stock.
Earlier, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland also warned investors about the prolonged weakness in the PC market. Rolland lowered his price target on AMD, NVDA, and INTC stocks. 
Given the challenges, let’s see what Wall Street recommends for these chipmakers.  
Is Advanced Micro Devices a Buy, Sell, or Hold? 
Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about AMD stock. It has received 19 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell rating for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Further, analysts’ average AMD price target of $112.84 implies 66.3% upside potential. 
Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices stock has a Neutral Smart Score of five out of 10 on TipRanks. 
What is the Prediction for Nvidia Stock?
Similar to AMD, analysts are cautiously optimistic about Nvidia stock. NVDA commands a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TipRanks based on 24 Buys and nine Holds. Moreover, these analysts’ average price target of $206.81 implies 57.5% upside potential.
Meanwhile, Nvidia stock has an Outperform Smart Score of eight out of 10 on TipRanks due to its AI (Artificial Intelligence) capabilities and momentum in the Data Center business.
What is the Prediction for Intel Stock?
The overall weakness in the PC market is keeping analysts sidelined on Intel stock. INTC stock sports a Hold consensus rating on TipRanks based on four Buy, 16 Hold, and eight Sell ratings. Meanwhile, analysts’ average price target of $37.76 implies 38.9% upside potential.
INTC has a Neutral Smart Score of 5 out of 10.  
Conclusion 
The industry is in the middle of a correction following the solid demand it witnessed during the pandemic times. Prolonged weakness in demand (both from consumers and enterprises), lower selling prices, and an uncertain macro environment will likely play spoilsport in the short term.

Oct 7 (Reuters) - Nasdaq index futures fell on Friday after a revenue warning from Advanced Micro Devices Inc sparked losses in chipmakers, with investors awaiting data that is likely to show U.S. job growth slowed in September.
AMD AMD.O lost 5.4% in premarket trading as its third-quarter revenue estimates were about a billion dollars less than previously forecast, signaling the chip slump could be much worse than expected.
Other chipmakers, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Intel Corp INTC.O, ON Semiconductors ON.O, Lam Research LRCX.O, and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O shed between 1.3% and 3%.
Stock futures were trading in a narrow range in anticipation of the Labor Department's closely watched employment report, which will show nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 250,000 jobs last month after rising 315,000 in August.
Aggressive interest rate hikes have made businesses more cautious about the economy, but the labor market remains tight, giving the Federal Reserve enough room to continue its monetary tightening plan.
The report will also likely show the jobless rate remained unchanged at 3.7%.
""Any increase in the headline unemployment rate, would be key to any narrative around a Fed pivot,"" said Michael Weisz, president of Yieldstreet.
""Our view is that the latest economic projections (by the Fed) indicate that not only is a recession inevitable but is being purposely engineered.""

Most rate-sensitive technology and growth stocks such as Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O were down between 0.2% and 0.5%.
Before closing lower on Thursday, markets briefly took comfort from data showing weekly jobless claims rising by the most in four months last week, raising hopes of some easing in the Fed's rapid interest rate hikes.
With most Fed officials supporting the need for continued rapid rate hikes, investors will monitor comments from New York President John Williams, Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari, and Atlanta President Raphael Bostic for any slight deviation in narrative.
Meanwhile, top U.S. senators from both parties on Thursday gave momentum to a so-called No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels bill pressuring OPEC+, after the group announced a deep cut in oil production worsening inflation woes.

2022-10-07 00:00:00+00:00,Intel is Oversold,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-is-oversold-0,,,"The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.
But making Intel Corp an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Friday, shares of INTC entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $25.88 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Intel Corp, the RSI reading has hit 29.9 — by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel currently has an average RSI of 41.3. A falling stock price — all else being equal — creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, INTC's recent annualized dividend of 1.46/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 5.37% based upon the recent $27.18 share price.
A bullish investor could look at INTC's 29.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on INTC is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

2022-10-06 00:00:00+00:00,Biden to tout IBM's $20 bln investment in New York over next decade,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biden-to-tout-ibms-%2420-bln-investment-in-new-york-over-next-decade,,,"By David Shepardson and Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - President Biden on Thursday will tout IBM Corp's IBM.N plans to invest $20 billion in New York over the next decade in development and manufacturing of semiconductors, mainframe technology, artifical intelligence and quantum computing.
The announcement is the latest in a string of investments unveiled since Biden signed the Chips and Science bill in August that funded $52 billion to subsidize semiconductor chips manufacturing and research.
The administration says hefty subsidies for private businesses are necessary because China and the European Union had been awarding billions in incentives to chip companies.
Biden has sought to capitalize on the investment announcements ahead of next month's midterm congressional elections. Last month, he traveled to Ohio to speak at the site of Intel Corp's INTC.O planned $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing facility.
On Tuesday, Micron Technology MU.Osaid it would invest up to $100 billion over the next 20-plus years to build a semiconductor fabrication facility in New York that is expected to create nearly 50,000 jobs, with the first phase investment of $20 billion planned this decade.
White House National Economic Director Brian Deese on Twitter called the Micron investment ""a significant win for US economic & national security"" and ""part of a deliberate, long term industrial strategy that will bolster U.S. competitiveness, & increase our long-term productive capacity.""
Biden will visit IBM's Poughkeepsie, New York site home to of the largest concentrations of quantum computers and will be joined by Chief Executive Arvind Krishna.
IBM said it plans to make its Poughkeepsie site ""a global hub of the company's quantum computing development, just as it is today for mainframes."" IBM did not provide a detailed breakdown of its $20 billion investment plans.
IBM said chips funding ""will ensure a reliable and secure supply of next-generation chips for today's computers and artificial intelligence platforms.""

By Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - The Biden administration plans to spare SK Hynix and Samsung from the brunt of new restrictions on memory chipmakers in China aimed at thwarting Beijing's technological ambitions and blocking its military advances, sources said.
The Commerce Department, which plans to release new curbs on exports of technology to China this week, will likely deny requests by U.S. suppliers to send equipment to Chinese firms like Yangtze Memory Technologies Co Ltd (YMTC) and ChangXin Memory Technologies, Inc (CXMT) if they are making advanced DRAM or flash memory chips, the sources said.
However, license requests to sell equipment to foreign companies making advanced memory chips in China will be reviewed on a case by case basis, sources said, potentially allowing for them to receive the equipment.
""The goal is not to hurt non-indigenous companies,"" one of the people briefed on the matter said.
The White House and Commerce Department declined to comment. SK Hynix Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, YMTC, and CXMT did not respond to requests for comment.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Thursday described the expected rules as ""sci-tech hegemony."" It accused the United States of using its ""technological prowess ... to hobble and suppress the development of emerging markets and developing countries.""
The move could assuage the worst fears of South Korean memory chipmakers that the United States might hobble their China-based manufacturing business in its effort to thwart China's rise, cripple YMTC and protect vulnerable U.S. memory chipmakers.
They still worry, however, that the case-by-case review standard is far from an explicit greenlight for U.S. equipment to be shipped to their Chinese facilities and could result in bickering with regulators over what shipments to approve.
Details of some of the new regulations facing China-based memory chipmakers have not been previously reported.
The new curbs target China-based producers of DRAM chips, which hold information from applications while the system is in use, and NAND chips, which are used for data and file storage.
U.S. suppliers seeking to ship equipment to China-based semiconductor firms would not have to seek a license from the Commerce Department if selling to firms producing DRAM chips above the 18 nanometer node, NAND Flash chips below 128 layers, or logic chips above 14 nanometers, the sources said.
However, U.S. companies selling sophisticated technology to indigenous Chinese chipmakers producing DRAM chips at 18 nanometers or below, NAND flash chips at or above 128 layers or logic chips at or under 14 nanometers would have to apply for a license that would be reviewed with the tough ""presumption of denial"" standard.
U.S. suppliers seeking to sell the equipment to non-Chinese origin companies operating in China and producing those same types of chips would also face a license requirement but the applications would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, the sources added.
If published as expected, the rules would mark the first U.S. bid through export controls to target Chinese production of memory chips without specialized military applications, representing a more expansive view of American national security, according to export control experts.
They would also hit YMTC, a rising power in manufacturing NAND chips founded in 2016. Its expansion and low-price offerings represent ""a direct threat"" to U.S.-based Micron Technology Inc and Western Digital Corp, the White House said in a June 2021 report.
YMTC is already under investigation by the Commerce Department over whether it violated U.S. export controls by selling chips to Chinese telecoms company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. Its chips are being evaluated by Apple Inc for inclusion in some of its iPhones in China, a major concern for U.S. lawmakers and the Biden administration.
The rules could also hurt CXMT, a state-backed Chinese company that is working to enter the DRAM market.
LAM Research Corp, Applied Materials Inc and KLA Corp, major U.S. vendors of equipment to make chips, are likely to be hit by the restrictions. LAM and Applied Materials did not respond to requests for comment. KLA declined to comment.
South Korea's Samsung has a facility producing NAND Flash memory chips in China's Shaanxi Province. South Korean rival SK Hynix has purchased Intel Corp's NAND flash memory chip manufacturing business in Dalian and produces DRAM chips at another China-based facility.
According to consulting firm Yole Intelligence's Walt Coon, 25% of SK Hynix's and 38% of Samsung's NAND wafer production is based in China, and about 50% of SK Hynix's DRAM production is in China.
Reuters first reported that the United States was considering limiting shipments of American chipmaking equipment to memory chip makers in China including YMTC, part of a bid to halt China's semiconductor sector advances and protect U.S. companies.
Reuters also reported last month that the Biden administration planned in October to broaden curbs on U.S shipments to China of semiconductors used for artificial intelligence and chipmaking tools.

2022-10-06 00:00:00+00:00,November 25th Options Now Available For Intel (INTC),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/november-25th-options-now-available-for-intel-intc,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the November 25th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new November 25th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $26.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.29. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $26.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $24.71 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $27.27/share today.
Because the $26.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.96% return on the cash commitment, or 36.19% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $26.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $29.00 strike price has a current bid of 92 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $27.27/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $29.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.72% if the stock gets called away at the November 25th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $29.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $29.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.37% boost of extra return to the investor, or 24.61% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $27.27) to be 36%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.2%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.14%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.12%.
Coming into today, shares of the world's largest chipmaker had lost 8.76% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 4.64%, while the S&P 500 lost 3.29%.
Intel will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Intel to post earnings of $0.34 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 80.12%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $15.53 billion, down 19.07% from the year-ago period.
INTC's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.24 per share and revenue of $66.15 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -59.05% and -15.22%, respectively.
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Intel should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.

2022-10-05 00:00:00+00:00,Why AMD Stock Fell Before Recovering Earlier Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amd-stock-fell-before-recovering-earlier-today,,,"What happened
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) were down over 4% this morning before rallying. Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers cut his growth estimates for the next three years, citing weakening demand in the PC market that might spill over to the data center market, a key driver of growth for the chipmaker.
As of 12:56 p.m. ET on Wednesday, the stock was down just 1.3%, while the S&P 500 index was down less than 1 percent.
The fears of inflation and rising interest rates have sent this growth tech stock down 53% year to date. Should investors be worried about more losses after Wells Fargo's call?
So what
In AMD's lastearnings callin early August, CEO Lisa Su mentioned that the company's next-generation 5-nanometer Genoa server central processing unit (CPU) was experiencing very strong customer pull. But this was two months ago, and the demand trends might have deteriorated since then.
The market intelligence firm International Data Corporation forecast PC shipments to be down 12.8% in 2022, with most of this decline coming from consumer and public sector markets. Not surprisingly, the enterprise market, which can afford to keep investing in products during recessions, is only expected to experience a 1.6% decline in PC shipments.
Su said that AMD is on track to launch the new server CPU later this year, positioning the data center business for ""continued growth and share gains.""
Now what
AMD reported robust 83% year-over-year growth in data center revenue last quarter. Even with a decline in PC shipments through the second quarter, the client and gaming segments posted revenue growth of 25% and 32%, respectively.
AMD's business might hold up better than investors realize, since part of the investment thesis revolves around taking market share from Intel.
Most importantly, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 15.5 times this year's earnings estimate, which is a discount to the average stock.
Still, investors might want to wait another quarter to see management's updated outlook before deciding to call the stock a bargain.

2022-10-05 00:00:00+00:00,Is Intel Stock a Buy Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-intel-stock-a-buy-now,,,"This has been a terrible year for semiconductor stocks, as the 41% decline in the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index tells us. That isn't surprising, as weakening demand, surging inflation, and a hawkish Federal Reserve have combined to send shares of once high-flying stocks into the abyss.
Chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has borne the brunt of the sell-off, losing half of its value in 2022. That's not surprising given the multiple headwinds that the chipmaker is facing, which have delivered its top and bottom lines a crushing blow. From economic headwinds to market share losses to execution issues, Intel is struggling on multiple fronts.
Chipzilla, as Intel is often called, is trying hard to regain its mojo with aggressive moves on the product development front. But will those moves be enough to inject some life into the company? Let's find out.
Intel is trying to get its house in order
Intel is currently gunning for a turnaround by arresting its market share losses in big markets such as personal computer (PC) processors and data center server processors. The company has been consistently losing ground to rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), explaining Intel's woeful performance in the second quarter of 2022.
Intel's Q2 revenue was down 22% year-over-year, bringing in $15.3 billion on a non-GAAP basis. The chipmaker's non-GAAP operating margin also fell to 9.2%, down a whopping 25.7 percentage points year-over-year thanks in part to a decline in revenue within the data center and artificial intelligence (DCAI) business segment, but also due to the aggressive investments the company is making to improve its products. As a result, Intel's adjusted earnings shrunk to $0.29 per share in Q2, down 79% from the year-ago period.
It is also worth noting that the PC market has hit a rough patch this year as sales have declined rapidly on account of weak demand. As PC sales are expected to decline 12.8% in 2022, Intel's struggles are here to stay in the short run. That's because the client computing group (CCG) is Intel's largest business, accounting for half of its top line. The segment brought in $7.7 billion in second quarter revenue, down 25% year-over-year.
The slowdown in PC sales and the market share losses will likely continue to weigh on Intel's largest business. However, Intel is going all out to ensure that it doesn't lose any more ground to AMD with its latest Raptor Lake processors. Intel's new chips are not just promising serious performance gains over the previous generation of Alder Lake processors, but they are also priced competitively.
Intel's latest flagship processor, the Core i9-13900K, is priced at $589. The processor packs 24 cores and 32 threads, and has a maximum clock speed of up to 5.8 GHz. Meanwhile, AMD's Ryzen 7000 flagship is priced at $699 and packs 16 cores and 32 threads, but it only supports DDR5 memory. Intel's Raptor Lake processors, on the other hand, support both DDR4 and DDR5 memory types.
So a combination of affordable pricing and better memory compatibility could boost Intel's processor sales and give its CCG business a lift. But then, investors shouldn't forget the struggles of Intel's other business entities.
Intel's DCAI revenue was down 16% year-over-year in Q2 to $4.6 billion, accounting for 30% of its top line. The company's data center business has been hamstrung by delays in the launch of its new server processors, Sapphire Rapids. What's even more alarming is that Intel doesn't expect to start regaining server market share until 2025.
Should you buy this beaten-down chipmaker?
Intel is trading at a dirt-cheap valuation, which isn't surprising given the steep declines in its revenue and earnings. The stock's trailing price-to-earnings ratio stands at just six. But Intel doesn't look like a value play at this cheap multiple since a turnaround in the company's fortunes still seems a few years away.
According to Intel's estimate, its revenue will increase in the mid-to-high-single digits in 2023. From 2026, the company expects to hit annual revenue growth of 10% to 12%. The chipmaker also sees its gross margin ranging between 54% and 58% from 2025 onward, compared to a range of 51% to 53% from 2022 to 2024. Analysts, however, estimate that Intel's earnings won't be increasing for the next five years, which looks like a possibility considering the tall order it faces to turn its business around.
All this indicates that Intel stock is a falling knife that investors may want to avoid until and unless there are concrete signs of a turnaround in this semiconductor company's fortunes.

2022-10-05 00:00:00+00:00,Lawmakers press U.S. Commerce for tougher checks on semiconductor chip subsidies,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lawmakers-press-u.s.-commerce-for-tougher-checks-on-semiconductor-chip-subsidies,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - A group of Democratic lawmakers wants the U.S. Commerce Department to take additional steps to ensure semiconductor companies do not use government subsidies to conduct stock buybacks.
In August, President Joe Biden signed legislation providing $52 billion in government funding to boost semiconductor manufacturing and research and a 25% investment tax credit for chip plants estimated to be worth $24 billion.
""Without strict controls, we are concerned that CHIPS funding may result in a subsidy for additional buybacks, enriching executives and stockholders at taxpayers’ expense while undermining the goals of the legislation,"" said the letter signed by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Baldwin and Representatives Sean Casten, Jamaal Bowman, Pramila Jayapal
and Bill Foster.
Commerce has said it will ""give preference in awards to companies who commit to make future investments that grow the domestic semiconductor industry ... and not engage in stock buybacks.""
The letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo notes the largest U.S. semiconductor companies have spent hundreds of billions on stock buybacks in recent years, with Intel INTC.O spending over $100 billion on buybacks since 2005.
Commerce hopes to begin seeking applications by February for $39 billion in semiconductor chips subsidies to build new facilities and expand existing U.S. production.
Commerce, which confirmed it received the letter, has said chips companies awards will be ""no larger than is necessary to ensure the project happens here in the United States” and will discourage “race-to-the-bottom subsidy competitions between states and localities.”
Chipmaker Micron Technology MU.O said Tuesday it planned to invest up to $100 billion over the next 20-plus years to build a computer chip factory complex in upstate New York.
The lawmakers expect Commerce ""to announce additional protections and to refine its existing guidance over the coming weeks and months"" and ask if Commerce will require companies to attest on applications for chips funding ""that they will not engage in buybacks for a set period of time.""

2022-10-05 00:00:00+00:00,42 Billion Reasons Why You'll Regret Not Buying This Growth Stock Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/42-billion-reasons-why-youll-regret-not-buying-this-growth-stock-right-now,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) investors have endured a difficult year thus far as shares of the chipmaker declined 54% Source: YCharts amid the broader stock market sell-off. But this could be an ideal time for savvy investors to buy the stock given its mouthwatering valuation.
AMD is now trading https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/amd/valuation at 27 times trailing earnings, which is a massive discount compared to the stock's five-year average price-to-earnings ratio of 100. The stock's forward earnings multiple of just 12.9 shows that its earnings are set to grow at a terrific pace over the next year. What's more, AMD's forward earnings multiple makes it cheaper than the Nasdaq-100's forward multiple of 20.8.
Buying AMD at these multiples looks like the right thing to do given its outstanding growth, especially considering that the chipmaker could sustain its momentum thanks to a massive opportunity in the data center business. Let's take a closer look at this opportunity and see why it could give AMD a solid boost in the long run.
AMD is scratching the surface of a multibillion-dollar opportunity in server processors
AMD's data center revenue stood at $1.5 billion https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1084/amd-reports-second-quarter-2022-financial-results in the second quarter. The segment's revenue shot up 83% over the prior-year period thanks to strong sales of its EPYC server processors. It is worth noting that AMD's data center revenue has nearly doubled in the first six months of 2022 to $2.8 billion. The company could finish the year with just over $5.6 billion in data center revenue if it maintains its current pace of growth.
AMD's data center business should be able to sustain such outstanding growth for years to come. That's because AMD sees a $42 billion https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_7d046f7918c7d75587535ecc5058781c/amd/db/812/6834/presentation/FAD+2022_Dan+McNamara_Final+Post.pdf slide 6 revenue opportunity in the server processor market alone over the long run, driven by the growing adoption of cloud computing, the proliferation of high-performance computing data centers, and the growth of enterprise workloads.
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is AMD's biggest competitor in the server processor market, but the chip giant has been helpless to stop the latter from going after this $42 billion opportunity. This is evident from Intel's market share losses and AMD's gains in server processors so far this year.
AMD controlled https://www.tomshardware.com/news/lowest-cpu-shipments-in-30-years-amd-intel-q2-2022-cpu-market-share 10.7% of the server processor market at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, according to Mercury Research. Its share increased to 11.6% at the end of the first quarter, followed by a jump to 13.9% in the second quarter. Intel controls the rest of the server processor space, but is losing its grip.
AMD was a negligible player in the server processor market at the end of 2017, and it could exit 2022 with a respectable share as it is likely to make further inroads into Intel's territory. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger's comments at a recent analyst conference suggest that Chipzilla is likely to lose more ground in the data center market.
Gelsinger said https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-expects-continued-market-share-loss-throughout-2023-will-likely exit-more-businesses that the competition's momentum and Intel's execution issues are likely to lead to more market share losses in data centers. More specifically, Intel is unlikely to keep up with the broader data center market's growth into 2025, and it expects to start regaining ""material share"" only from 2026. So AMD could establish itself as a bigger player in the server processor market by 2025.
Gauging the potential revenue opportunity
It is estimated that AMD could corner https://wccftech.com/amd-epyc-server-cpu-market-share-18-percent-by-2024-intel-xeon-downfall-arm-10-percent-growth/ 18% of the server processor market by 2024, but don't be surprised to see it grab a bigger slice thanks to its aggressive product roadmap. The chipmaker will release its fourth-generation server processors (based on a 5-nanometer process) in the current quarter, promising https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_7d046f7918c7d75587535ecc5058781c/amd/db/812/6834/presentation/FAD+2022_Dan+McNamara_Final+Post.pdf more than 75% gains over the third-gen processors.
AMD also plans to release its fifth-generation EPYC server processors, codenamed https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_7d046f7918c7d75587535ecc5058781c/amd/db/812/6834/presentation/FAD+2022_Dan+McNamara_Final+Post.pdf Turin, in 2024, which could be based on 3-nanometer and 4-nanometer manufacturing nodes. Intel's next-generation Sapphire Rapids processors, on the other hand, were delayed https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/intel-sapphire-rapids-server-cpu-delayed-yet-again/ yet again. They are expected to be released in 2023, which means that Intel will be on a 7nm process while AMD will move ahead on the technology curve with a more advanced node.
As such, don't be surprised to see AMD increase its share of the server processor market over the next few years. If AMD corners a 25% share of this space by 2025, then server processors alone could generate $10 billion in annual revenue for the company given the $42 billion opportunity discussed earlier. Throw in the other catalysts in the data center business, such as data processing units, embedded processors, and graphics cards, and it's easy to see that this business could become a big money spinner for AMD in the long run.
In all, AMD is built for long-term growth, and management forecasts https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_7d046f7918c7d75587535ecc5058781c/amd/db/812/6839/presentation/FAD+2022_Devinder+Kumar_Final+Post.pdf slide 14 the company's revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 20% for the next three to four years. Its operating margins are expected to land in the mid-30s during the forecast period, which would be a nice improvement over last year's operating margin of 25%.
All this makes AMD a top tech stock to buy right now given its attractive valuation.
