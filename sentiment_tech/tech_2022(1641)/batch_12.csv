2022-10-13 00:00:00+00:00,December 2nd Options Now Available For Intel Corp (INTC),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/december-2nd-options-now-available-for-intel-corp-intc,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options begin trading today, for the December 2nd expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new December 2nd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $23.00 strike price has a current bid of 89 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $23.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $22.11 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $25.84/share today.
Because the $23.00 strike represents an approximate 11% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.87% return on the cash commitment, or 28.22% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $23.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $26.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.65. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $25.84/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $26.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.00% if the stock gets called away at the December 2nd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $26.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $26.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.39% boost of extra return to the investor, or 46.57% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $25.84) to be 37%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Oct 12 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq bounced on Wednesday after a five-day selloff, but inflation and rate hike worries capped the gains after a higher-than-expected rise in September producer prices.
The Labor Department's producer prices index rose 8.5% in the 12 months through September, slightly higher than an estimated 8.4% rise. The reading was still lower than and 8.7% increase in August.
Persistent inflation has increased concerns about the Fed's aggressive monetary action tipping the world's largest economy into a recession.
""It's stubborn and some people are hoping that we had peak inflation and it's going to come down quickly,"" said Joe Saluzzi, partner at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.
""It is not going to be that way. That's what the Fed has been looking at and that's why they're raising rates the way they are. So this will take time and this is not going to be a quick thing.""
Money markets are pricing in a 92% chance of another 75-basis-point hike in November. Investors will also scrutinize the Fed's September meeting minutes, due later in the day, for more clarity on the central bank's rate hike trajectory. FEDWATCH
""The thing we're looking for from the FOMC is some evidence that it is open-minded, that they will consider being a lot more flexible,"" said Hugh Johnson, chief economist of Hugh Johnson Economics at Albany, New York.
""The comments are going to be just as hawkish as they have been.""

Oct 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Wednesday, as a dip in Treasury yields helped ease pressure on tech and growth shares, with investors also eyeing key inflation data and minutes from the Federal Reserve's September meeting to gauge the rate-hike path.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC and the S&P 500 .SPX have ended in the red for five straight sessions as a recent set of economic data pointed to more policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve, fanning worries of a recession and triggering a spike in yields.
The producer price index, an important inflation gauge, is expected to have risen 8.4% in the 12 months through September, after advancing 8.7% in August, according a Reuters poll. The data is due at 8:30 am ET.
Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which was held last month, will be released later in the day.
Megacap companies Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Apple Inc AAPL.O added 0.8% each in premarket trading.

The U.S. is scrambling to tackle unintended consequences of its new export curbs on China's chip industry that could inadvertently harm the semiconductor supply chain, according to a Reuters report.

Oct 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures pared gains on Wednesday after data showed producer prices increased more than expected in September, in another hot inflation reading that boosted bets of more jumbo-sized interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
The Labor Department's producer prices index rose 8.5% in the 12 months through September, slightly higher than an estimated 8.4% rise. The reading was still lower than and 8.7% increase in August.
""It's stubborn and some people are hoping that we had peak inflation and it's going to come down quickly,"" said Joe Saluzzi, partner at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.
""It is not going to be that way. That's what the Fed has been looking at and that's why they're raising rates the way they are. So this will take time and this is not going to be a quick thing.""
Persistent inflation has sparked worries about the Fed's aggressive monetary action tipping the world's largest economy into a recession. Money markets are pricing in a 92% chance of another 75-basis-point hike in November. FEDWATCH
Still, Wall Street's main indexes eyed a bounce following five straight days of declines in the Nasdaq .IXIC and the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX as recent economic data nearly sealed a case for a fourth consecutive 75-basis-point hike by the Fed.
Battered megacap companies Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Tesla Inc TSLA.O, Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O and Meta Platforms Inc META.O rose between 0.2% and 0.6% in premarket trading.
Beaten-down chip shares including Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O Micron Technology Inc MU.O, Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O and Intel Corp INTC.O also rose between 0.2% and 1%.
The United States is scrambling to tackle unintended consequences of its new export curbs on China's chip industry that could inadvertently harm the semiconductor supply chain.
A Reuters report showed the Biden administration has allowed at least two non-Chinese chipmakers operating in China to receive restricted goods and services without their suppliers seeking licenses, the report said.
At 8:51 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 46 points, or 0.16%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 10.25 points, or 0.28%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 41.25 points, or 0.38%.
PepsiCo Inc PEP.O gained 2.6% up after the soft-drinks maker raised its annual revenue and profit forecasts on firm demand for its sodas and snacks despite multiple price increases amid rising costs.
Investors will also monitor comments from Fed's Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari, Washington's Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, and New York's Governor Michelle Bowman.

2022-10-11 00:00:00+00:00,U.S. gives reprieve from export curbs to at least two non-Chinese chipmakers in China - sources,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-gives-reprieve-from-export-curbs-to-at-least-two-non-chinese-chipmakers-in-china,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee, Karen Freifeld and Alexandra Alper
OAKLAND, Calif and WASHINGTON Oct 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Tuesday allowed at least two non-Chinese chipmakers operating in China to receive restricted goods and services without their suppliers seeking licenses, easing the burden of a new crackdown on the Chinese chip sector, according to industry sources.
The Biden administration had planned to spare foreign companies operating in China such as South Korean memory chip makers SK Hynix Inc 000660.KS and Samsung Electronics Co 005930.KS from the brunt of new restrictions, but the rules published on Friday failed to exempt such firms, the sources said.
As published, the rules require licenses before U.S. exports can be shipped to facilities with advanced chip production in China, as part of a U.S. bid to slow Beijing's technological and military advances.
The U.S. had planned to grant licenses to supply non-Chinese chip factories on a case-by-case basis, while licenses to Chinese chipmakers will face a presumption of denial.
As of midnight Tuesday, vendors also cannot support, service and send non-U.S. supplies to such China-based factories without licenses if U.S. companies authorize, direct or request them.
But whether a license is approved or not, the time it takes to get through the license process could create delays in shipments and halt production.
A U.S. Commerce Department spokesperson did not directly respond to a request for comment on the authorizations, but said the department hopes to get input from stakeholders about the rule and may consider changes.
A White House spokesperson also did not respond to a request for comment.

Investors will be hoping for strength from Intel as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 27, 2022. On that day, Intel is projected to report earnings of $0.34 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 80.12%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $15.53 billion, down 19.07% from the year-ago period.
Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.24 per share and revenue of $65.92 billion. These totals would mark changes of -59.05% and -15.51%, respectively, from last year.
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Intel. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.

2022-10-11 00:00:00+00:00,Dow ETFs in Focus Ahead of Q3 Earnings,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dow-etfs-in-focus-ahead-of-q3-earnings,,,"After the worst first nine months of 2022, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed some stability at the start of the fourth quarter. Worries about stubbornly hot inflation and the Fed’s rapid tightening policy to tame inflation have led to risk-off trade.

The blue-chip index gained 1.7% so far this quarter, and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust DIA, which tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, is also up 1%. The trend is likely to continue heading into the earnings season.

Third-quarter 2022 earnings are set to kick off this week, with the banking sector slated to report numbers. Total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up 0.7% from the same period last year on 9.1% higher revenues. The earnings growth is down from 7.2% at the start of the third quarter. In addition to inflation, logistical challenges and macroeconomic uncertainty, which have been recurring themes in the last couple of quarterly reporting cycles, a strong U.S. dollar is also acting as a headwind this earnings season (read: 5 Favorite Sectors of Q3 Earnings and Their ETFs).

Of the 16 Zacks sectors, eight are expected to have recorded positive earnings growth in the third quarter, with the strongest gains in energy (up 113.2%). This will be followed by transportation (48.1%), autos (31.6%), consumer discretionary (22.2%) and construction (24.5%) sectors.
DIA in Focus
SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with an AUM of $26.2 billion and an average daily volume of 3 million shares. Holding 30 blue-chip stocks, the fund is widely spread across components, with each holding less than 11.4% share. Healthcare (22.1%), information technology (20.1%), financials (15.8%), consumer discretionary (13.6%) and industrials (13.2%) are the top five sectors.

SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF charges 16 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Medium risk.   

Nearly one-fourth of the blue-chip firms are expected to announce results this week and next. JPMorgan Chase JPM and UnitedHealth UNH are expected to report on Oct 14, while Johnson & Johnson JNJ will announce earnings on Oct 18. International Business Machines IBM is scheduled to report on Oct 19, while Goldman GS will report on Oct 21. Dow Inc. DOW and Intel INTC will release earnings on Oct 20 and Oct 27, respectively.

Let’s delve deeper into the third-quarter earnings picture that will likely aid the fund in the coming days.

2022-10-11 00:00:00+00:00,Intel and Google Cloud launch new chip to improve data center performance,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-and-google-cloud-launch-new-chip-to-improve-data-center-performance,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
Oct 11 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Cloud on Tuesday said they have launched a co-designed chip that can make data centers more secure and efficient.
The E2000 chip, code named Mount Evans, takes over the work of packaging data for networking from the expensive central processing units (CPU) that do the main computing. It also offers better security between different customers that may be sharing CPUs in the cloud, explained Google's vice president of engineering, Amin Vahdat.
Chips are made up of basic processors called cores. There can be hundreds of cores on a chip and sometimes information can bleed between them. The E2000 creates secure routes to each core to prevent such a scenario.
Companies are running increasingly complex algorithms, using progressively bigger data sets, at a time when the performance improvement of chips like CPUs is slowing down. Cloud companies are therefore looking for ways to make the data center itself more productive.
While the new chip was co-developed with Google, Nick McKeown, who leads Intel's Network and Edge group, said Intel can sell the E2000 to other customers.
""We do consider ourselves to be the open cloud, and to the extent that others take advantage of the capabilities here, we're thrilled,"" said Vahdat.
Google Cloud is starting to offer the E2000 in a new product called C3 VM which will be powered by Intel's fourth-generation Xeon processors, said Vahdat. Xeon chips are Intel's most powerful CPUs and Google Cloud is the first cloud service to deploy the latest generation of those chips, Intel said.

2022-10-11 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-KLA to stop sales and service to China to comply with U.S. export curbs - source,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-kla-to-stop-sales-and-service-to-china-to-comply-with-u.s.-export-curbs-source,,,"By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI, Oct 11 (Reuters) - U.S. chip toolmaker KLA Corp KLAC.O will cease offering some supplies and services from Wednesday to China-based customers including South Korea's SK Hynix 000660.KS in compliance with recent U.S. regulations, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.
The move underscores huge business headwinds facing chipmakers and chip equipment makers around the world, as the Biden administration published a sweeping set of export controls on Friday aimed at slowing China's progress in advanced chip manufacturing.
China is KLA's largest geographic market, bringing in $2.66 billion in sales, or nearly 30% of its total revenue in the last fiscal year that ended in June, according to the company's financial filings.
Under new U.S. regulations released on Friday, companies looking to supply Chinese chipmakers with advanced manufacturing equipment must first obtain a licence from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The source, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter, said staff in China received an email from KLA's legal department stating that effective 11:59 p.m. local time (1559 GMT) on Tuesday, the company shall stop sales and service to ""advanced fabs"" in China for technology of NAND chips with 128 layers or more, and DRAM chips 18nm and below, and advanced logic chips.
""Our top management team has told us to relax for a couple of months,"" the source who was briefed on the matter told Reuters.
KLA did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of working hours.
The source added that the company would also cease supplying China chip plants owned by Intel INTC.O and SK Hynix, the world's second-largest memory chipmaker.
Reuters previously reported that foreign companies with fabs in China looking to receive advanced chip manufacturing equipment would have their licence applications reviewed on a case-by-case basis, while applications to supply Chinese fabs would be reviewed with through a ""presumption of denial"" standard.
SK Hynix reiterated its stance that it would seek a license under new U.S. export control rules for equipment to keep operating its factories in China. Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
China's two leading memory chipmakers - Yangtze Memory Technologies Co Ltd (YMTC), Changxin Memory Technologies Inc (CXMT) - and contract chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) 0981.HK are among the major customers affected by the U.S. export control.
None of the three fabs immediately responded to Reuters' requests for comment.
Another source at an overseas chip equipment company told Reuters that all of the major suppliers to fabs were working round-the-clock to assess the long-term impact of the regulations.
""We are all overreacting at first, while the legal teams work out the details for every piece of software and equipment that could be affected.""
Shares in KLA tumbled nearly 5% on Monday, hit by the latest U.S. export control measures.
Along with Lam Research Corp LRCX.O and Applied Materials Inc AMAT.O, KLA is among top U.S. toolmakers now required to halt shipments to wholly Chinese-owned factories producing advanced chips.

Reuters


HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Washington's sweeping technology curbs on China today will have ripple effects across global supply chains tomorrow. The export controls unveiled by the U.S. Department of Commerce on Friday will effectively block the People's Republic from developing its own advanced semiconductors needed for supercomputers and the like. But the ban may prompt Chinese chipmakers to hasten their progress in the commoditised parts of the market, embedding firms like Semiconductor Manufacturing International in global supply chains.
    The measures mark a huge escalation in President Joe Biden's efforts to hobble Beijing's chip advances. Essentially, any company that uses American equipment will be restricted from selling relatively high-tech semiconductors or tools to Chinese firms. And because nearly every factory relies on crucial hardware and software from U.S. suppliers like Lam Research and Applied Materials, the latest move potentially sets back Chinese chipmakers by years, if not decades.
    Yet this need not be the end of the $23 billion SMIC and its compatriots. In fact, most are quietly thriving by churning out low-tech chips that are seen as less politically sensitive. Notably, while the new U.S. rules target specific types of leading-edge memory and logic components to be restricted, so-called trailing-edge products, such as analog or discrete semiconductors commonly used in computers, gadgets and cars, fall under a grey area.
    They may not be as lucrative as processors or memory units, but those chips are still a huge market to play for. Analog sales alone jumped by more than a third last year, to $74 billion, outpacing growth for logic and memory, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. And even for lower-tech processors, demand is still strong in China. First-half revenue at SMIC jumped 53% year-on-year to $3.7 billion, despite the company being put on Washington's so-called Entity List in 2020. Its Hong Kong stock is down roughly 14% this year, outperforming the $360 billion TSMC's 30%-plus slump.
   Longer term, Chinese outfits could start grabbing a larger global share of this less flashy end of the market. One reason is that most governments are nudging the dominant chipmakers, TSMC, Samsung Electronics and Intel, to prioritise leading-edge semiconductors. That leaves the rest of the market up for grabs. For all the talk about decoupling, Chinese firms could end up even more intertwined in supply chains.

CONTEXT NEWS
The U.S. Department of Commerce on Oct. 7 published a raft of new technology restrictions, including export curbs that aim to cut China off from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with U.S. equipment.
    Under the new regulations, U.S. companies must cease supplying Chinese chipmakers with equipment that can produce relatively advanced chips — logic chips under 16 nanometers (nm), DRAM chips below 18 nm, and NAND chips with 28 layers or more — unless they first obtain a license.
    The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security within the Department of Commerce also added 31 Chinese companies to its so-called Unverified List for 60 days, which could trigger tough penalties. The government takes such action when U.S. authorities cannot complete on-site visits to determine if they can be trusted to receive sensitive U.S. technology, forcing U.S. suppliers to take greater care when shipping to them.

2022-10-10 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 5.68% Yield (INTC),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-named-top-dividend-stock-with-insider-buying-and-5.68-yield-intc,,,"In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC), which saw buying by CEO Patrick P. Gelsinger.
Back on August 24, Gelsinger invested $501,153.16 into 14,800 shares of INTC, for a cost per share of $33.86. In trading on Monday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) and achieve a cost basis 25.1% cheaper than Gelsinger, with shares changing hands as low as $25.36 per share. Intel Corp shares are currently trading -1.28% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of INTC shares, versus its 200 day moving average:
Looking at the chart above, INTC's low point in its 52 week range is $25.25 per share, with $56.28 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $25.25. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which insider buying was recorded over the last six months:
PURCHASED INSIDER TITLE SHARES PRICE/SHARE VALUE
05/03/2022 David Zinsner EVP, CFO 5,500 $44.73 $246,014.45
05/02/2022 Patrick P. Gelsinger CEO 5,500 $44.58 $245,183.95
08/24/2022 Patrick P. Gelsinger CEO 14,800 $33.86 $501,153.16
The DividendRank report noted that among the coverage universe, INTC shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics. For example, the recent INTC share price of $25.72 represents a price-to-book ratio of 1.0 and an annual dividend yield of 5.68% — by comparison, the average company in Dividend Channel's coverage universe yields 4.6% and trades at a price-to-book ratio of 2.2. The report also cited the strong quarterly dividend history at Intel Corp, and favorable long-term multi-year growth rates in key fundamental data points.
The report stated, ''Dividend investors approaching investing from a value standpoint are generally most interested in researching the strongest most profitable companies, that also happen to be trading at an attractive valuation. That's what we aim to find using our proprietary DividendRank formula, which ranks the coverage universe based upon our various criteria for both profitability and valuation, to generate a list of the top most 'interesting' stocks, meant for investors as a source of ideas that merit further research.''
The annualized dividend paid by Intel Corp is $1.46/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 11/04/2022. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for INTC, which the report stressed as being of key importance. Indeed, studying a company's past dividend history can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

2022-10-10 00:00:00+00:00,Is AMD Stock a Buy Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-amd-stock-a-buy-now-2,,,"Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) stock fell nearly 5% during after-hours trading on Oct. 6 in response to a preview of its upcoming third-quarter earnings on Nov. 1. The chipmaker now expects its revenue to rise 29% year over year to $5.6 billion with an adjusted gross margin of 50%, compared to its prior forecast for about 55% growth with an adjusted gross margin of 54%.
CEO Lisa Su blamed that big miss on macroeconomic conditions, which ""drove lower-than-expected PC demand and a significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain."" The company expects its client (or PC) revenue to plunge 40% year over year to $1 billion, which will largely offset the growth of its data center, gaming, and embedded divisions.
Image source: Getty Images.
That was a disappointing update, but investors should have already curbed their expectations for the PC market following HP's disappointing third-quarter report in early September. Other chipmakers like Micron have also issued similar warnings.
AMD clearly overestimated its own ability to resist that cyclical downturn, but is its stock getting too cheap to ignore after declining more than 50% this year?
How bad was AMD's slowdown?
In 2021, AMD's revenue grew 68% to $16.4 billion, its adjusted gross margin expanded 370 basis points to 48.3%, and its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) more than doubled. That growth was driven by robust sales of its Ryzen CPUs, Radeon GPUs, and Epyc CPUs for data centers. It benefited from elevated sales of consumer PCs as more people worked remotely, as well as market share gains against Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) across the PC market.
In the first half of 2022, AMD's revenue (which was boosted by its acquisition of Xilinx in February) surged 70% year over year to $12.4 billion, its adjusted gross margin expanded to 53.4%, and its adjusted EPS grew 90%. Therefore, its abrupt slowdown to just 29% revenue growth in the third quarter likely caught many investors by surprise.
What are AMD's main weaknesses?
Starting in the second quarter of 2022, AMD split its computing & graphics division and EESC (enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom) division into four new segments -- data center, client, gaming, and embedded -- to more clearly reflect its growth.
The biggest change was made to its EESC segment, which had housed its data center and custom APUs for gaming consoles. It shifted its data center chips into in a stand-alone segment, while its custom gaming console APUs joined AMD's Radeon GPUs in the gaming unit. The new embedded segment now mainly houses Xilinx's programmable chip business. Shifting its PC CPUs into the new client division also set up easier comparisons with Intel's client computing group.
AMD's year-over-year growth still looks strong, but it actually expects revenue to decline 15% sequentially in the third quarter as its tumbling client revenue and the flattish growth of its gaming segment overwhelm the single-digit growth of its data center and embedded businesses:
DIVISION
Q3 2022 REVENUE
QOQ GROWTH (DECLINE)
YOY GROWTH
Data Center
$1.6 billion
8%
45%
Client
$1 billion
(53%)
(40%)
Gaming
$1.6 billion
0%
14%
Embedded
$1.3 billion
4%
1,549%
Total Revenue
$5.6 billion*
(15%)
29%
Data source: AMD. QOQ = quarter over quarter. YOY = year over year. * Column does not add up to total because of rounding.
Those sequential declines indicate AMD will likely face a tough cyclical slowdown over the next few quarters as it grapples with inflationary headwinds for discretionary spending, supply chain challenges, and tough comparisons to the temporary stay-at-home growth spurt for PCs throughout the pandemic.
According to market research firm IDC, global shipments of personal computing devices (PCs and tablets) could decline 10.8% this year and slip another 2.3% in 2023 before finally recovering in 2024. But IDC still expects those shipments to stay below pre-pandemic peaks through 2025. In other words, any company that is heavily dependent on the PC market should probably brace for at least two more years of sluggish growth.
Is AMD undervalued right now?
Analysts had originally expected AMD's revenue to rise 57% this year, 12% in 2023, and 13% in 2024. On the bottom line, they had expected its net income to increase 22% this year, 44% in 2023, and 26% in 2024.
Based on those estimates, AMD's stock looks cheap at 14 times forward earnings. Intel and Nvidia, which are both growing slower than AMD, trade at 10 and 29 times forward earnings, respectively. AMD's valuation might seem reasonable, but it's still pegged to earnings estimates that will likely need to be reduced to account for its latest update.
Therefore, I believe it's too early to consider AMD to be a screaming bargain. So investors should stick with more-balanced semiconductor plays like ASML Holding or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing until they get a clearer picture of how long AMD's cyclical downturn will actually last.

2022-10-10 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Preliminary Q3'22 Results Impact Share Price Negatively,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-preliminary-q322-results-impact-share-price-negatively,,,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD has slumped 59.4% compared with the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 40.5% and 35.8%, respectively, in the year-to-date period.
The recent fall in AMD’s share price reflects negative sentiments amongst investors as the company reported a $1.1 billion shortfall in revenues from than prior outlook for the third quarter of 2022.
AMD forecasted third-quarter 2022 revenues to be approximately $5.6 billion, an increase of 29% year over year, lower than the previously expected rise of roughly 55%. Preliminary results of the company reflect lower-than-expected client segment revenues resulting from reduced processor shipments due to weaker demand in the PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain.
AMD is expecting a non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 50%, down 400 basis points due to lowered client segment revenues.
AMD expected PC sales to decline in the third quarter, which was reflected by the falling PC demand in the prior quarters. Per International Data Corporation, PC sales were down 15.3% year over year to 71.3 million units during the June quarter, which was higher than the first quarter's decline rate of 5.1% and was the worst fall in many years.
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Quote
Rising geo-political tensions between the United States and China, the global supply-chain challenges that adversely impacted the semiconductor industry, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, rising inflation and interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve caused the recent fall in PC demand as the market slips into recession.
The volatile macroeconomic situation has the broader tech sector in the doldrums as AMD’s peers in the sector NVIDIA NVDA and Intel INTC also bore the brunt of the situation.
NVDA and Intel shares have fallen 58.9% and 50%, respectively, in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s decline of 50.1%.
However, the company is expecting a significant rise in its high-growth business segments like data center and gaming, in line with its previous guidance. AMD expects Data Center and gaming business to grow 45% and 14%, respectively, year over year.
AMD Addressing High-Growth Markets to Boost Top Line
AMD’s third-quarter results are expected to have benefited as the company has been diversifying its product portfolio to cater to trending high-growth markets like cloud, gaming, data center and EV.
The company has constantly been improving the performance of its Ryzen processors to help address the increasing proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning in industries like cloud, gaming and data center.
However, as it ventures into new markets, the company faces rising competition from the likes of NVIDIA and Intel.
NVIDIA is a dominant name in the data center, professional visualization and gaming markets, where its peers are close on its heels. NVDA has been benefiting from the rapid proliferation of AI. The company has been expanding its base in untapped markets like climate science, energy research, space exploration and digital biology.
Intel is still the leading name in the consumer PC market and is the major competitor of AMD in this segment. INTC is gradually reducing its dependence on the PC-centric business by transitioning to data-centric businesses such as AI and autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, AMD is expected to benefit from its plans to address new markets, accelerate data center growth and enter the AI and Augmented Reality spaces with its launch of various products by building strategic partnerships with companies like Dell Technologies DELL and OEM partners Hewlett Packard, Acer and Lenovo.
The company currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
AMD recently collaborated with Dell to launch the most powerful 17” AMD Advantage laptop — Alienware m17 r5 Gaming Laptop.
The recent collaboration with Dell will help AMD benefit from the rising gaming industry that will attain $545.98 billion by 2028, witnessing a CAGR of 13.20% between 2021 and 2028, according to Fortune Business Insights.

2022-10-10 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Corporation (INTC) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-corporation-intc-is-a-trending-stock%3A-facts-to-know-before-betting-on-it-1,,,"Intel (INTC) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -18.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -8.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Intel falls in, has lost 10.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.34 per share, indicating a change of -80.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.24 points to a change of -59.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.9%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.61 indicates a change of +16.2% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intel is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Intel, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.53 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -19.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $66.15 billion and $68.19 billion estimates indicate -15.2% and +3.1% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $15.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22%. EPS of $0.29 for the same period compares with $1.28 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -14.51%. The EPS surprise was -57.97%.
Over the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

2022-10-09 00:00:00+00:00,2 High-Yield Tech Stocks to Buy in October,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-high-yield-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-october,,,"2022 has been a tough year for investors. The S&P 500 market index is down more than 30% year to date and the more growth-oriented Nasdaq Composite lost more than 30% over the same span. Within these broad market trackers, many stocks have taken even harder hits.
On the upside, the negative market trend has created some fantastic buying opportunities. That's particularly true in the tech sector, which tends to exaggerate whatever trends are going on in the general stock market. But wait -- there's more good news! Given the price-based mathematics of dividends, lower stock prices also tend to drive dividend yields higher.
Taken together, these two effects make me want to pound the table about investing in Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) right now. These top-quality companies have seen sharp price drops in 2022, pushing their cash-powered dividends to new heights of generosity.
Intel's turnaround story: 5.7% dividend yield
Semiconductor giant Intel's latest earnings report was admittedly disappointing. The company fell short of Wall Street's estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Management conceded that the results were below Intel's own expectations, partly due to execution issues. The stock is down 35% since that fateful report, far below the S&P 500's 11% decline over the same period.
Today, Intel's stock trades at the lowest price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios seen since the early 1990s. The dividend yield stands at an ultra-generous 5.6% -- the highest in Intel's 30-year dividend history.
You might see these unusual metrics as red flags signaling Intel's fall from grace. However, I see a tremendous opportunity to buy in and lock down those incredible dividend yields amid a unique turnaround story.
The processor design cycle tends to take between three and five years. Intel appointed a new CEO in 2021, who then revamped the entire management structure to his liking. CEO Pat Gelsinger is still saddled with the decisions and product developments of his predecessor, and the real improvements to Intel's long-term business plan won't materialize until 2024. We are in the deep end of that troublesome trough, deepened even further by exceptional challenges for the American and global economies.
Intel's business prospects are actually brighter than ever in the long run. Gelsinger is an engineer at heart, replacing a financial professional who had to take Intel's help in a scandalous hurry. It makes sense that former CEO Bob Swan made some operational mistakes, and I have full confidence that Gelsinger can right the ship -- given enough time.
On top of all that, Intel has started to manufacture chips for other companies and is investing billions of dollars in expanded chip-building facilities. The cash machine looks as healthy as ever, and Intel remains committed to returning a significant slice of that cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. Investors should jump at a chance to nail down Intel's massive dividend yield while the stock is cheap.
IBM's artificial intelligence focus: 5.6% dividend yield
Big Blue's lofty dividend yield is not a company record, but you'll only find a handful of richer quarterly checks among the S&P 500 tickers. And if you narrow your search down to the S&P 500's technology names, only Intel stands above IBM's yield today. We are looking at the elite of the elite of the tech sector's dividend payers here.
The company started its transition away from hardware into software and services a decade ago. Today, IBM is a giant in hybrid cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) tools. The current platform was rebuilt around the $34 billion Red Hat acquisition of 2019.
IBM's top-line sales grew 16% year over year in July's second-quarter report. Hybrid cloud sales are rising even faster, and more than 70% of IBM's total sales now come from software and consulting. This centennial titan has transformed itself into a high-growth phenomenon with its finger directly on the pulse of the computing market's biggest growth opportunities.
Yet, the stock price has fallen 13% in 2022 as investors shied away from growth stocks in favor of ultra-safe value havens. In my eyes, IBM supplies its high-octane growth opportunities from a rock-steady financial platform. It's the best of both worlds, appealing to growth and value investors in equal measure.

IBM and Intel shares have taken significant haircuts in 2022, mostly due to challenges facing the economy as a whole. The price drops have given their stocks attractive dividend yields, and if you buy in today, you can lock in those high yields for the long term. That's a great way to build lasting wealth in the stock market.
