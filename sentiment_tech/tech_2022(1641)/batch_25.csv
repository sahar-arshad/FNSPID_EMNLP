The chart below illustrates the year-to-date performance of the ETF.

One company part of the iShares Semiconductor ETF is the widely-known Intel INTC. In addition, the company is slated to release its quarterly results on July 28th (Thursday) after the trading session ends.  
Intel is the world’s largest semiconductor company and is a primary supplier of microprocessors and chipsets. Recently, the company has been slowly reducing its dependence on the PC-centric business by moving into data-centric businesses — such as AI and autonomous driving.
Let’s take a look at how the semiconductor titan shapes up heading into its quarterly release.
Share Performance & Valuation
Sellers have controlled Intel shares for the majority of 2022, declining more than 20% in value and underperforming the general market by a wide margin.

However, it seems that the bears have started to lose grip over the last month, with Intel shares tacking on a marginal 1.4% and primarily trading in line with the general market.

The recent price action is definitely inspiring, as it signals that the selling has slowed down immensely.
In addition, Intel boasts stellar valuation metrics, further displayed by its Style Score of an A for Value.
The company’s 11.3X forward earnings multiple is nicely below its five-year median of 12.1X and represents an enticing 37% premium relative to the S&P 500.

Quarterly Estimates
Analysts have been bearish for the quarter to be reported, with four negative estimate revisions hitting the tape over the last 60 days.

The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate resides at $0.74, notching a 42% decrease in quarterly earnings year-over-year.
Top-line projections display some softening as well – Intel is forecasted to generate $17.9 billion in revenue for the quarter, displaying a 9% decrease from year-ago sales of $19.6 billion. The chart below illustrates the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.

Quarterly Performance & Market Reaction
Intel has been on a blazing hot earnings streak - the company hasn't reported bottom-line results below the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate since 2014. Just in its latest quarter, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by a solid 9%.
Quarterly sales numbers have been just as stellar; Intel has surpassed top-line estimates in 13 consecutive quarters.
Even if the company does register an EPS beat, watch out – shares have moved downwards following each of Intel’s previous nine bottom-line beats dating all the way back to 2020.  
Bottom Line
Quarterly estimates indicate a decreasing top and bottom-line. In addition, shares have struggled for the greater part of 2022 but have found some buyers over the last month.
Intel has consistently reported top and bottom-line results above expectations, but the market has historically reacted poorly to EPS beats. Furthermore, the company sports rock-solid valuation levels.
Heading into the quarterly report, Intel INTC is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with an Earnings ESP Score of -9%.

Presumably the only reason for a company insider to choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. Within the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, only nine companies have experienced such buying over the trailing six month period, one of which was Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC), where an investment totaling $493.1K invested across 2 purchases was made by CEO Patrick P. Gelsinger. Click Here to Learn Which Other Eight Dow Components Also Had Recent Insider Buying »

05/02/2022 Patrick P. Gelsinger CEO 5,500 $44.58 $245,183.95
Gelsinger's average cost works out to $44.42/share. In trading on Tuesday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) and achieve a cost basis lower than Gelsinger, with shares changing hands as low as $38.91 per share. Shares of Intel Corp were changing hands at $39.24 at last check, trading up about 0.2% on Tuesday. The chart below shows the one year performance of INTC shares, versus its 200 day moving average:
Looking at the chart above, INTC's low point in its 52 week range is $35.54 per share, with $56.28 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $39.24.
The current annualized dividend paid by Intel Corp is $1.46/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend has an upcoming ex-date of 08/04/2022. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for INTC, which can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend with approx. 3.7% annualized yield is likely to continue.

Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. Quote
Factors to Note
Ultra Clean’s second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from strong demand for semiconductor products and services, led by the acceleration of digital transformation that has increased the consumption of semiconductor content.
The company might have gained from its ramped-up capital spending plans to develop its robust portfolio and diverse offerings that address megatrends such as 5G, AI, electrical vehicles and high-performance computing.
Ultra Clean has been continuously shifting its operations from the Shanghai facility in China to its Malaysia, Texas and Philippines sites. This is expected to have helped UCTT in meeting the customer delivery schedule and countering the supply chain constraints in the to-be-reported quarter.
The company has been continuously attracting big tech companies like Intel INTC due to its capability to meet delivery schedules even among severe supply chain constraints.
Intel partnered with UCTT for its Ohio megafab projects to meet the backlogs created globally in the semiconductor industry. A growing customer base is expected to have contributed to the second-quarter performance of UCTT.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 8.8%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 26.2%, on average.

The Santa Clara, CA-based semiconductor company is expected to have recorded year-over-year lower revenues due to a fall in sales in the Client Computing Group and Data Center Group.
Factors at Play
In the second quarter, Intel announced a significant advancement in its integrated photonic research  − the next frontier in increasing communication bandwidth between computer silicon in data centers and across networks. This advancement will enable the production of the optical source with the required performance for future high-volume applications such as co-packaged optics and optical compute interconnect for emerging network-intensive workloads, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. This is likely to be reflected in the upcoming results.

Mobileye, a segment of Intel, in the second quarter, launched its first software development kit (SDK) for the EyeQ system-on-chip that powers driver assistance and future autonomous technologies for automakers worldwide. With this, EyeQ aims to reduce development costs, accelerate time to market and enable hardware vendor flexibility for the full development cycle starting from conception to deployment and performance tuning. The consensus estimate for revenues from Mobileye stands at $393 million, which implies an increase from $327 million reported a year ago.

Intel is witnessing intensifying competition in the server, storage, and networking markets. The Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) is posing a challenge in the fast-growing micro-server segment, and its designs have been adopted by several competitors. Delay in 7nm process-based chips is also a major concern. The company detected a defect mode in 7nm, which caused yield degradation. The company expects initial production shipments of Intel-based 7nm client CPU in late 2022 or early 2023.  The consensus estimate for Client Computing Group stands at $8,760 million, which indicates a decline from $10,109 million reported a year ago, while that for Data Center Group is $6,191 million, down from $6,455 million.

For the June quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $17,934 million, which indicates a decline of 8.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share stands at 74 cents, suggesting a fall of 42.2% year over year.

2022-07-25 00:00:00+00:00,Intel to produce Taiwanese company MediaTek's chips,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-to-produce-taiwanese-company-mediateks-chips,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee and Stephen Nellis
OAKLAND, Calif. July 25 (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O said on Monday it will produce chips for Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc 2454.TW, one of the world's largest chip design firms.
The manufacturing arrangement is one of the most significant deals Intel has announced since it launched its so-called foundry business early last year.
A foundry business builds chips that other companies design and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) 2330.TW is the top player in that space. Intel has mainly built chips it designed itself.
“That's a pretty big deal for us to engage a customer from Taiwan and them betting on us to grow and try this. And so this is a major anchor customer win,” Randhir Thakur, president of Intel Foundry Services, told Reuters.
TechInsights’ chip economist Dan Hutcheson said there were doubts in the industry on whether Intel could pull off the foundry business, but the deal with MediaTek shows it’s on the right path and its investments, including in recruiting the right executives, are paying off.
“When you go into a foundry, you're putting at risk about two years of work,” said Hutcheson about the risk for chip design firms like MediaTek. “If something happens and the foundry can't pull it off, you've lost that design window in that market window.”
While Intel didn’t give any financial details of the deal or say how many chips it would be producing for MediaTek, it said the first products would be manufactured in the next 18- to 24- month period and will be in a more mature technology process called Intel 16, with the chips used for smart devices.
“MediaTek has always adopted a multi-sourcing strategy,” MediaTek said in a statement. “In addition to maintaining close partnership with TSMC in advanced process nodes, this collaboration will enhance MediaTek’s supply for mature process nodes.”
Intel previously announced that its foundry business has signed deals with Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O.

2022-07-24 00:00:00+00:00,3 Things About Intel That Smart Investors Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-things-about-intel-that-smart-investors-know,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is one of the largest chipmakers in the world and a bellwether of the semiconductor industry. Most investors probably know it's the largest producer of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers, but that it has also struggled with research-and-development blunders and production delays in recent years.
Those missteps caused it to fall behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC, in the process race to manufacture smaller, denser, and more power-efficient chips. They also allowed Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), its rival that outsources its production to TSMC, to pull ahead with more-advanced chips.
Intel is trying to catch up to TSMC again by expanding its plants and upgrading its technology, but the critics believe its 11th-hour effort will fail and result in an existential crisis for the company. The bulls believe government subsidies, especially the pending CHIPS Act, could save Intel.
Image source: Intel.
I've reviewed those arguments in the past, but today I'll focus on three lesser-known facts that changed Intel's past and could impact its future.
1. Intel once developed ARM-based chips
Intel's biggest blunder was arguably its failure to extend its lead in PC and data center CPUs to the mobile-chip market. It lost that market because x86 CPUs consumed too much power for smaller mobile devices -- which prioritized low power consumption over raw processing power.
That shifting market demand led to the rise of ARM, the UK-based chip designer that was eventually purchased by SoftBank (OTC: SFTB.Y) in 2016. ARM licensed its power-efficient designs to a wide range of chipmakers, including Qualcomm and Apple, which led to its conquest of the smartphone market. Today, more than 95% of premium smartphones are powered by ARM-based processors.
Intel briefly tried to challenge ARM with its lower-powered x86 Atom CPUs for mobile devices, but those chips failed to gain any meaningful traction -- even after Intel paid original equipment manufacturers billions of dollars to try out its chips.
All of that pain could have been avoided if Intel hadn't made two crucial mistakes. First, it turned down a chance to develop a CPU for Apple's first iPhone, believing that Apple could never sell enough handsets to justify the costs of developing a new mobile chip.
Second, Intel failed to expand xScale, the ARM-based chipmaker that grew from its acquisition of the StrongARM team from DEC in 1998. With the proper investments, Intel could have turned xScale into a formidable ARM chipmaker like Qualcomm. Instead, it sold xScale to Marvell in 2006 and focused on the Atom instead. Intel is still suffering from the repercussions of those two mistakes today.
2. Intel's abandoning the memory chip market
Intel is widely known as a CPU maker, but it's also produced memory chips for decades. Back in 1985, Intel abandoned the DRAM market amid intense competition from Japanese chipmakers.
However, Intel went on to develop flash memory chips in 1988. In more recent years, it partnered with Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), one of the world's top memory chipmakers, to co-develop a new generation of 3D XPoint memory chips for high-end solid-state drives.
But in 2020, Intel announced it would sell its NAND business to the South Korean memory chipmaker SK Hynix for $9 billion. Intel will retain the Optane segment, which houses its smaller 3D XPoint business.
The sale will occur in several phases and close in the first quarter of 2025. Until then, Intel will exclude its NAND business from its non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) revenue and earnings.
Intel likely retreated from the NAND market because it was a distant underdog compared to market leaders like Samsung and SK Hynix, and divesting the business would free up more cash for the expansion of its core CPU business.
3. Intel outsources its chips to TSMC
Intel has made a lot of noise about catching up to TSMC by 2025 and bringing back more chip manufacturing to the United States, but it actually outsources production of some of its own chips to TSMC's foundries.
Intel already outsourced the production of its discrete GPUs to TSMC last year. It also intends to outsource some of its upcoming 3 nm and 5 nm CPUs, which will likely arrive in 2023, to TSMC. Intel will still manufacture most of its own chips, but this odd partnership reveals that it can't possibly turn around its business without relying on its biggest rival.
What do these facts tell us about Intel's future?
Intel's mobile blunders and its exit from the memory chip market reveal just how difficult it's been for the company to consistently expand beyond its core market of x86 CPUs. That's also why it's spinning off Mobileye, the automotive chipmaker it acquired in 2017, in an upcoming initial public offering.
CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took the helm last February, realizes that the aging chipmaker needs to double down on manufacturing to stay relevant. But its outsourcing deals with TSMC -- which it made even as Gelsinger publicly claimed Taiwan was ""not a stable place"" for manufacturing chips -- reveal just how far behind it has already fallen, and how crucial the next few years will be.

2022-07-23 00:00:00+00:00,Taiwan Semiconductor Is Saying Chip Demand Remains Strong (For Now),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/taiwan-semiconductor-is-saying-chip-demand-remains-strong-for-now,,,"The second-quarter earnings season is well underway. One of the first companies to report this period is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the largest semiconductor/computer chip manufacturer worldwide. TSMC hit the top end of its revenue guidance and generated phenomenal operating margins for the three months ending in June, causing shares to pop in the days following the release.
Investors have been worried about a downturn in semiconductor demand after the pandemic-induced boost to the industry. So far, these worries have not materialized. Taiwan Semiconductor's second-quarter results show strong demand for computer chips worldwide. But how long is that set to last? Let's see exactly what TSMC said in its second-quarter earnings report and conference call.
Solid Q2 results
On July 14, TSMC released its Q2 earnings results. Revenue was up 36.6% year over year to $18.16 billion, hitting the higher end of its previous guidance for $17.6 billion to $18.2 billion. Operating margin came in at 49.1%, significantly beating TSMC's guidance for 45%-47% margins. This occurred because of continued operating leverage from its factories and gains in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Taiwanese currency. With a lot of customers like Apple and Nvidia headquartered in the United States, a rising dollar means TSMC gets paid more for the same product output, all else equal.
TSMC continues to grow at such a significant pace for a few main reasons. First, its customers in the high-performance computing (HPC) industry are growing like crazy. These include artificial intelligence researchers, data centers for cloud providers like Amazon's Amazon Web Services, and edge computing networks. HPC revenue grew 14% quarter over quarter in Q2 and now makes up 43% of TSMC's overall revenue.
Second, TSMC continues to take its lead with the most advanced semiconductors. It is one of the few manufacturers in the world with the capacity to make 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer silicon wafers at scale (smaller equals better in the computer chip market), giving it a near monopoly with customers looking for the most advanced computer chips. Advanced nodes of the 5nm and 7nm variety now make up 51% of TSMC's overall revenue.
Over the next few years, TSMC plans to roll out its 3nm and 2nm manufacturing capabilities. This should further increase its competitive positioning versus companies like Samsung and Intel and strengthen its relationship with customers like Apple and Nvidia, who are looking to build some of the most advanced computer chips in the world. The only place they can do that is TSMC.
Potential short-term glut but long-term tailwind
The big worry many investors have with companies like TSMC is the history of cyclicality in the semiconductor market. Historically, as global demand increased for computer chips, companies would end up ordering too much inventory from manufacturers, causing a sharp reduction in demand, which led to a reduction in earnings for manufacturers.
With huge demand increases caused by the COVID-19 pandemic over the last few years, it is possible that TSMC's customers are ordering too much inventory right now, which will cause a slowdown in demand in 2023 or 2024. Management even warned about rising inventories on the Q2 conference call.
However, even if a one- or two-year glut materializes, that changes nothing for long-term shareholders in this business. On the Q2 call, management reiterated their confidence in growing TSMC's revenue by 15%-20% a year through 2026, combined with 53%+ gross margins. As long as you plan to hold shares for five-plus years, it shouldn't concern you if revenue growth slows down in 2023, especially when revenue is growing north of 35% annually right now.
Valuation is getting attractive
TSM Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months.
Even though shares popped last week, TSMC's stock is still down around 30% this year and now trades at a market cap of $430 billion. With $25.9 billion in trailing-12-month operating income, the stock trades at a price-to-operating income (P/OI) of 16.6. For a company with such a dominant market position, this is not expensive at all.
But what if we use TSMC's revenue forecast through 2026? If revenue grows at a 15% rate over the next four years, it will be at $107 billion in 2026. Conservatively, if we estimate that TSMC's operating margin will be 45% by that time, that would equate to $48.1 billion in annual operating income. That is a P/OI of 8.9 based on the stock's current market cap. In my book, this makes the stock an easy buy at these prices.

2022-07-22 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Fell More Than 4% on Friday,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-fell-more-than-4-on-friday,,,"What happened
Shares of computer technology company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) lost 4.1% of their value on Friday, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, giving back a sizable piece of their gains logged earlier in the week. The move follows the progress of legislation that would favor the nation's entire microchip industry, but as it turns out, not necessarily Nvidia.
So what
Don't look for a specific reason Nvidia's stock took a tumble on Friday. You won't find it. Rather, look at the evolution of headlines over the course of the week.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate decided to move forward with a bill that will potentially provide the country's chipmakers with $52 billion worth of funding to help them lay the groundwork for establishing more domestic production facilities. The bill in question has not yet become law, but given the degree of bipartisan support for the bill's intention, its ultimate passage seems likely. California-based Nvidia initially appeared to be one its beneficiaries, driving its stock to a weekly gain of as much as 15% as of Thursday.
Now, however, things aren't quite as clearly bullish. The stock's 28% rally off of its early July lows and the recent realization that the most recent revision of the bill actually favors Nvidia's rivals like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) without providing as much benefit to Nvidia itself is giving recent Nvidia buyers pause. The idea of subsidizing the nation's chipmakers is now drawing out congressional critics as well, calling into question just how much support the intended legislation actually has regardless of which companies it benefits most.
Now what
Such news-based volatility is nothing new. Investors frequently come to a conclusion based on a limited amount of information, but as awareness and understanding improve, reality changes minds. Friday's marketwide weakness didn't help Nvidia shares either.
When all is said and done, this week's prospective legislative development doesn't actually change much either way for the company or the country's semiconductor industry in general. Nvidia doesn't need congressional help to expand its domestic production capacity, and even getting such assistance doesn't guarantee it will lead to additional revenue. Moreover, it could be years before the legislation in question makes its intended impact.
In other words, this week's headlines are no reason to buy or sell Nvidia shares. The stock's still a buy at its beaten-down price simply because the broken supply chain will eventually be mended, and Nvidia is very well positioned to lead the artificial intelligence hardware market's growth.

2022-07-22 00:00:00+00:00,7 Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-best-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-now,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Uncertainty on Wall Street means even the best semiconductor stocks continue to struggle. Shortages remain across the sector while industries from consumer electronics to automotive manufacturing vie for the limited supply.
Chipmakers have ramped up production, but the bottleneck comes from a lack of enough fabrication plants, or fabs. Fortunately, semiconductor manufacturers are working to address the issue. Research from SEMI, a global association, highlights, “There are 25 new construction projects of volume fabs in 2022… Fab equipment spending for 2022 is expected to break the $100 billion mark.”
For now, however, investors remain wary of semiconductor shares. Exchange-traded funds (or ETFs) tracking the chip sector, such as the Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (NYSE:PSI), and the iShares Semiconductors ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), have fallen around 36% year-to-date (YTD). In comparison, the S&P 500 Index has dropped 17% over the same period.
The ongoing supply-chain crisis is undeniably significant but will likely be alleviated as production begins in the new facilities. As a result, semiconductor stocks should experience a stronger rebound compared to the overall market in the coming months.

2022-07-22 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Intel Stock Could Be in a Soup This Earnings Season,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-intel-stock-could-be-in-a-soup-this-earnings-season,,,"Chip giant Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) terrible year may be about to get worse when the company releases its second-quarter 2022 results after the market closes on Thursday, July 28.
Intel stock is already down 25% this year thanks to the market sell-off. Additionally, the near-term forecast issued by Intel at its investor meeting held in February this year wasn't received well by Wall Street. Intel's 2022 guidance pointed toward a steep decline in the company's margins and earnings. The chipmaker expects an adjusted gross margin of 52% this year as compared to 57.7% last year. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to drop to $3.50 per share from $5.47 per share in 2021.
Of course, Intel aims to regain its mojo in the long run, but it looks like things will get worse before they start getting better. That's because Intel's biggest business -- the client computing group (CCG) -- is in for a tough time in the second quarter and for the rest of the year. Here's why.
Meet Intel's biggest headwind
Sales of personal computers (PC) have been dwindling in 2022. According to market research firm IDC, PC sales were down 5.1% year over year in the first quarter of the year. However, the decline accelerated in Q2 with PC sales crashing 15.3% over the prior-year period as demand cooled off and supply remained disrupted on account of COVID-19-related lockdowns in China.
This doesn't bode for Intel which gets half of its revenue from the CCG business, which includes sales of central processing units (CPUs) that are used in desktops and notebooks. The CCG business generated $9.3 billion in revenue for Intel in Q1. The segment's revenue was down 13% from the prior-year period thanks to lower sales of both desktop and notebook processors, which was triggered by Apple's move of building its chips in-house instead of using Intel's offerings.
Interestingly, Intel had enjoyed a 25% year-over-year increase in average selling prices (ASP) of its CPUs in Q1 thanks to a rich product mix. However, the steeper drop in PC sales in the second quarter indicates that Intel's shipments may have taken a bigger hit as compared to Q1. Additionally, Apple is expected to have completed the transition to its own chips from Intel's processors in June 2022, which is another factor that will weigh on the latter's top line.
Meanwhile, Intel lost 2.3 percentage points of market share to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) in the second quarter as compared to the first one, as per third-party estimates. Chipzilla was reportedly way behind AMD in markets such as Germany, where the latter held a 63% share of shipments. It is also worth noting that AMD claims to have stronger exposure to the higher end of the PC market.
If Intel was left with the low-hanging fruit last quarter, its CPU ASP could take a hit. Throw in the potential drop in Intel's volumes and it is easy to see why the company's largest business could be in for difficult times in the second quarter. Even worse, PC shipments are expected to contract 8.2% as per IDC. However, the Q2 decline indicates that there may be a bigger drop in the cards.
So, Intel's CCG business seems to be on shaky ground as the developments in the PC market suggest.
Should investors press the panic button?
It won't be surprising to see Intel stock head lower in the near term given the conditions in the PC market. Lower revenue, weaker margins, and shrinking earnings for 2022 have already dented investor confidence in Intel, and a bad set of results could hurt the stock further.
Analysts have already dialed down their expectations as they are expecting $17.96 billion in revenue from Intel in the second quarter. That's lower than the company's guidance of $18 billion. The chipmaker expects adjusted earnings of $0.70 per share in Q2 as compared to $1.28 per share in the prior-year period. But if AMD has indeed cornered the higher end of the CPU market, Intel's earnings may not match expectations.
It is worth noting that Intel is pulling strings to ensure a turnaround in its fortunes in the long run by way of higher capital expenses to upgrade its technology, an aggressive product roadmap to take share away from rivals, and an expansion into new niches. But those steps would take time to bear fruit. The near-term headwinds could send this semiconductor stock lower, which means that there could be better opportunities to buy Intel before its turnaround takes shape.

2022-07-21 00:00:00+00:00,The CHIPS Act Could Boost These 3 Semiconductor Stocks,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-chips-act-could-boost-these-3-semiconductor-stocks,,,"In June 2020, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America (CHIPS) Act was introduced in the House of Representatives by U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas). The act called for the U.S. to boost its subsidies for domestic chipmakers to address the global chip shortage, reduce the country's dependence on Asian chip foundries, and stay ahead of China in the semiconductor race.
The CHIPS Act would provide $52 billion in subsidies and tax breaks for domestic chipmakers. But more than two years later, it still hasn't passed Congress. The Senate recently cleared the way toward a final vote on the bill next week, but some Republicans are still reportedly reluctant to approve those high subsidies. Some chipmakers have also pointed out that the act favors integrated device manufacturers, which produce their own chips, over ""fabless"" chipmakers, which outsource manufacturing to third-party foundries.
Image source: Getty Images.
All that noise can make it difficult to figure out exactly which chipmakers would benefit from the passage of the CHIPS Act. So today, I'll highlight three chip stocks that could rally the most if it's approved.
1. Intel
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is an integrated device manufacturer that still produces most of its chips, but over the past decade, it fell behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (also known as TSMC) in the ""process race"" to create smaller and denser chips. Intel lost its crown as it struggled with R&D blunders, manufacturing mishaps, chip shortages, and delays. TSMC also started installing ASML Holding's top-tier extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems -- which etch circuit patterns into the world's most advanced chips -- long before Intel did.
As a result, Intel is now approximately one to two chip generations behind TSMC. TSMC plans to boost its capital expenditures from 2021's $30 billion to a historic high of $40 billion in 2022 to maintain that lead. Intel can only afford to increase its capital expenditures to $27 billion this year -- yet it claims it can catch up to TSMC in the process race by 2025.
That's why Intel has been aggressively lobbying for the approval of the CHIPS Act. As the country's largest chipmaker, it believes it can secure a large portion of those subsidies, allowing it to close its spending gap with TSMC. It also plans to open up its domestic foundries to fabless chipmakers, which could help it challenge TSMC in the third-party contract chipmaking market.
2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
At first glance, the CHIPS Act seems aimed at reducing the dependence of fabless chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia, and Qualcomm on TSMC and other Asian foundries.
However, the U.S. has also been courting TSMC with subsidies to convince it to open more stateside foundries. Back in 2020, Washington subsidized the construction of TSMC's $12 billion plant in Arizona for the production of its 5nm chips -- which are less advanced than the chips it makes in Taiwan, but far more advanced than the older-generation chips it manufactures in China.
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger loudly protested that decision, but the CHIPS Act would likely free up more subsidies for TSMC's Arizona plant and other foundries it might open in the future. If TSMC builds additional plants in the U.S., it could conceivably snuff out Intel's plans of becoming a major third-party contract chipmaker.
3. Texas Instruments
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) provides a wide range of analog and embedded chips to the automotive, industrial, consumer electronics, and communications industries. It manufactures its analog chips at its own foundries and outsources some of its embedded chips to overseas foundries.
Over the past few years, Texas Instruments has been upgrading its own plants from 200mm to 300mm wafers to reduce the costs of its unpackaged parts by roughly 40%. That strategy enabled it to consistently expand its gross margins.
But earlier this year, it announced that it would increase its capital expenditures to about $3.5 billion annually -- a mid-teens percentage of its projected revenues -- over the next four years to upgrade its plants. It also plans to keep that spending elevated at about 10% of its revenues from 2025 to 2030.
Texas Instruments can easily handle that spending boost, but it could change the public perception of the chipmaker as a shareholder-friendly company that regularly returns all of its free cash flow to investors through buybacks and dividends. The CHIPS Act might help it mitigate that spending pressure.
Not all chipmakers will benefit from the CHIPS Act
Shares of Intel, TSMC, and Texas Instruments will likely rally if the CHIPS Act is finally approved, as will shares of other American integrated device manufacturers like Micron Technology or Skyworks Solutions.
However, fabless chipmakers like Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm probably won't see much of a boost, since they're still dependent on big Asian foundries like TSMC and Samsung. The CHIPS Act won't be a magic bullet for the U.S. semiconductor industry, but it could convince more chipmakers to build first-party fabrication plants domestically again.

2022-07-21 00:00:00+00:00,"Competition & Weak PC Demand Threaten Intel, Says Analyst",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/competition-weak-pc-demand-threaten-intel-says-analyst,,,"Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have bucked the downtrend amid the overall market sell-off and are up 6.6% in the past month, driven by the possibility that Intel could stand to benefit from the passage of the CHIPS act. The CHIPS act is focused on getting semiconductor players to fabricate more of their chips in the United States.
While the passage of this act could benefit Intel, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland remains concerned about the stock and is sidelined with a Hold rating.
Signs of Intel’s PC Market Weakening
Rolland’s research suggests a weakening demand for PCs. The PC market is a part of Intel’s Client Computing Group (CCG). The CCG group made up around 50% of Intel’s total revenues of $18.4 billion in Q1.
Intel estimates generating total revenues of $18 billion in Q2 while earnings are expected to come in at $0.5 per share.
Intel’s management had stated on its Q1earnings callthat while it continued to see strong commercial demand, consumer demand continued to soften and the “impact of no longer shipping to customers in Russia and Belarus” was also being felt.
Intel CFO, Dave Zinsner, added, “Further, component supply constraints continue to be a challenge, with the most recent COVID lockdowns in Shanghai further increasing supply chain risk and contributing to inflationary pressures that are having a negative impact on PC TAM [total addressable market] for the year.”
Even Rolland’s “ODM [original design manufacturing] notebook tracker points to significantly weaker Taiwanese PC ODM builds in 2Q.”
When it comes to its PC business, Intel Taiwan plays a key role.
The analyst also cited data from Gartner and IDC, pointing to “softer 2Q22 PC shipment data.” Rolland also noted that “Intel’s addition of a 14th week in 1Q may present 2Q as seasonally worse.” As a result, the analyst estimates that PC shipments could decline 11% year-over-year to approximately 310 million in 2022.
Are Intel’s Gross Margin & Capex Guidance Likely to Be Lowered?
Intel has projected an adjusted gross margin of 51% for Q2 and 52% for FY22. However, Rolland expects that given the weakness in the CCG group, competitive pricing for Intel’s Alder Lake range of processors, increasing costs for multi-chip modules, and rising competition, Intel could revise its FY22 gross margin guidance “negatively.”
The analyst added, “Given the uncertainty around the CHIPS Act and falling utilizations, we wonder if Intel will not pare back their 2022 capex guidance by ~$2 billion from $27 billion to $25 billion.”
Rolland also pointed out the rising competition from AMD’s processors and Apple's (AAPL) continuing to marginalize Intel from its range of PCs as Apple PCs are now fitted with their own processors.
Wall Street’s Take on INTC
Considering these headwinds, analyst Rolland lowered the price target on the stock from $42 to $40. The stock is currently priced at current levels.
Other Wall Street analysts also side with Rolland and remain sidelined on the stock with a Hold consensus rating based on five Buys, 10 Holds, and six Sells. The average Intel price target of $47.41 implies an upside potential of 17.8% at current levels.
Bottom Line
Even as Intel contemplates a hike in the price of its chips, the company’s expansion plans remain in limbo with the delay in the passage of the CHIPS act. It remains to be seen how Q2 ends up looking for Intel in this challenging macro environment.
However, investors on TipRanks are very positive about the stock, as indicated by the Crowd Wisdom tool on TipRanks. This tool indicates that 15.7% of the top-performing portfolios on TipRanks have increased their holdings of the stock in the past 30 days.

WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. House plans to vote as early as next week on a slimmed-down version of legislation to provide tens of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax credits for the semiconductor industry, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.
On Tuesday, the Senate backed by 64 to 34 a procedural measure to set the stage for potential votes to pass the legislation in the Senate as soon as this week.
The bill ""is a major victory for American families and the American economy,"" Pelosi said in a letter to lawmakers, calling it ""a bold, bipartisan package that will lower costs for families here at home while reigniting American competitiveness on the world stage.""
The bill aims to ease a shortage that has disrupted production in industries from automobiles to electronics and high-tech weapons. It is part of a broad effort across the government to push back against an ascendant China and ease supply-chain problems by decreasing U.S. companies' reliance on foreign-made semiconductors.
""As the Senate undergoes its legislative process, we are optimistic that the House will be able to take this bill up as early as next week,"" Pelosi wrote.
The final text was not released but Senate aides said the measure includes about $54 billion in subsidies for U.S. semiconductor companies, as well as a new, four-year 25% tax credit to encourage companies to build U.S. semiconductor plants. The tax credit is estimated to be worth about $24 billion. There are other provisions including a $1 billion grant program for ""persistently distressed communities.""
President Joe Biden's administration urged Congress to pass a semiconductor bill before lawmakers leave Washington for their August recess, saying it would create and preserve U.S. jobs and bolster national security.
The current bill is a pared-down version of stalled rival measures, even though efforts to counter China are policies generally backed by both Republicans and Biden's Democrats, who narrowly control Congress.
The Senate approved a bipartisan $250 billion bill boosting spending on technology research and development in June 2021, while the House passed its own version in February.
Republican Senator Rick Scott criticized the bill, saying taxpayers should get a return on their investment - rather than giving grants that do not have to be repaid. ""The taxpayer doesn't get anything here,"" Scott told Reuters.

The bill shall also provide a four-year 25% tax credit to motivate companies to build plants in the United States and make investments in the U.S. semiconductor industry. The tax credit is projected to value at about $24 billion.
The proposed legislation is an attempt to solve the ongoing supply-chain disturbances and supply shortages being faced by the U.S. semiconductor industry. This is hurting the manufacturing of several consumer products like smartphones, gaming consoles, and automobiles.
Amid the COVID-19 uncertainty and geopolitical crisis, the bill also aims to reduce the dependence on Asian manufacturers like China and Taiwan.
According to a report published by Barrons, Robert Kaminski of Capital Alpha said, “Semis investors have been looking for CHIPS passage to be a catalyst for the stocks, but we have been cautioning that it will take months for the money to actually get out the door.”
AMD’s Game Stays Strong
AMD is gaining from the robust performance of its Ryzen and EPYC server processors. In fact, revenues from the EPYC server processor more than doubled for the third consecutive quarter in the first quarter of 2022. Each of the company’s businesses saw double-digit year-over-year growth in the last reported quarter. Further, the acquisition of Pensando is expected to broaden AMD’s data center product offerings on the back of its distributed services platform.
Street Is Optimistic about AMD Stock
Overall, the Street is optimistic about the stock and has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 18 Buys and seven Holds. Advanced Micro Devices’ average price target of $129.36 signals that the stock may surge nearly 50.6% from current levels. Shares of AMD have lost 42.8% so far this year.
AMD scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform the market. Also, financial bloggers are 89% Bullish on AMD, compared with the sector average of 65%.
TipRanks data shows that hedge funds are Very Positive about the company, as they bought 9.3 million shares of AMD stock in the last quarter.
Is AMD Stock Worth a Shot?
It is worth noting that The Chips Act could prove to be more beneficial for companies like Intel (INTC), which manufacture their own chips, unlike AMD, a semi-designer, which outsources the production of its chips.
Nevertheless, AMD is well-positioned to gain from upbeat prospects in the U.S. semiconductor industry. Its solid full-year guidance indicates higher organic growth across AMD. Investors interested in the stock could pocket solid returns in the long term.

2022-07-20 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: AMD vs. Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-amd-vs.-intel-0,,,"Semiconductor stocks have been clobbered hard on the market this year, as the 31% decline in the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index indicates. And not surprisingly, its components, such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), have also plunged big time.
Share prices of AMD and Intel are down 43% and 25%, respectively, so far in 2022. Both companies could be in for more pain in the near term, as the demand for personal computers (PCs) is falling at an alarming pace. However, Intel's solid dividend and its turnaround efforts could attract investors to the stock following its slide this year. Similarly, AMD's guidance points toward terrific growth in 2022, and analysts are confident that it could sustain its impressive momentum in the long run as well.
So, which of these two beaten-down chipmakers should investors consider buying right now? Let's find out.
AMD is beating Intel hands down on this front
AMD stock may have taken a bigger beating this year as compared to Intel, but the company's financial performance has been way better.
AMD's revenue was up 71% year over year in the first quarter of 2022 to $5.9 billion. This impressive growth was driven by healthy sales of its Ryzen CPUs (central processing units) and Radeon GPUs (graphics processing units), and a record performance from the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (EESC) business, which includes sales of server processors and semi-custom chips used in gaming consoles.
AMD also benefited from the acquisition of Xilinx that it completed in February 2022, though its organic revenue growth remained solid at 55% over the year-ago quarter. More importantly, AMD's non-GAAP gross margin increased 660 basis points year over year in the first quarter (including the Xilinx acquisition), which allowed the company to more than double its earnings per share.
Intel, on the other hand, cut a sorry figure. Chipzilla's revenue fell 1% over the prior-year period to $18.4 billion. Adjusted earnings crashed 35% year over year to $0.87 per share, thanks to a big drop in the company's margins.
The stark difference in the financial performance of both companies indicates that AMD is enjoying an upper hand as it competes with Intel in the CPU and GPU (graphics processing units) markets. That's not surprising, as AMD has been taking share away from Intel in the client and server CPU markets thanks to its technology advantage. Meanwhile, AMD enjoys a stronger market share of 17% in the discrete graphics card space, compared to Intel's 4%.
Not surprisingly, AMD expects to finish 2022 with eye-popping revenue growth of 60%. The company's bottom line should also increase substantially as it anticipates an adjusted gross margin of 54% this year, compared to 48% last year. Intel, meanwhile, forecasts $3.50 per share in earnings in 2022 on revenue of $76 billion. The company generated $74.7 billion in revenue last year along with adjusted earnings of $5.47 per share, so its bottom line is set to contract by a big margin.
What's more, Intel's long-term prospects fade in front of AMD. For instance, AMD is expected to clock annual earnings growth of 28% for the next five years, while Intel's bottom line is expected to grow at just 3% a year over the same period. That's not surprising, as Intel is currently trying to turn its fortunes around and arrest its market share losses, which is why it has decided to ramp up investments in capacity and research and development.
AMD's technology lead and its lucrative prospects in the data center market, as well as other areas such as gaming consoles where Intel doesn't have a presence, give it an upper hand on the growth front.
So, is AMD the better buy?
AMD is growing much faster than Intel, which is why it carries a richer valuation. AMD stock trades at 29 times earnings, compared to Intel's price-to-earnings ratio of 6. Of course, Intel has a nice dividend yield of nearly 4% that AMD doesn't offer, but the latter has solid upside potential thanks to its faster growth.
Analysts, on the other hand, aren't expecting substantial gains from Intel until 2026. It is also worth noting that AMD seems to be in a better position to weather the downturn in the PC market. That's because AMD is the smaller player in client CPUs, with a 22.5% share of the notebook processor market and an 18.3% share of the desktop CPU space. Given that AMD has been consistently scoring gains against Intel in the client and the server CPU markets, it could mitigate the volume declines in the PC market by gaining more share.
Additionally, AMD's focus on the ""premium, gaming and commercial portions"" of the PC market, as well as its expectation of continuing its share gains in lucrative areas such as data center chips, could help it sustain its healthy growth. So even though Intel might be cheap, AMD looks like the better semiconductor stock to buy right now.

Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Intel as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be July 28, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Intel to post earnings of $0.74 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 42.19%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $17.97 billion, down 8.47% from the year-ago period.
Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.48 per share and revenue of $75.23 billion. These totals would mark changes of -36.38% and -3.58%, respectively, from last year.

2022-07-20 00:00:00+00:00,Should iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) Be on Your Investing Radar?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-ishares-msci-usa-value-factor-etf-vlue-be-on-your-investing-radar-2,,,"The iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) was launched on 04/16/2013, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.
The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $9.18 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.
Why Large Cap Value
Large cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.
Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. While value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long-term performance, growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets.
Costs
Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.15%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.08%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
ETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 27.90% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Telecom round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, At&t Inc (T) accounts for about 7.21% of total assets, followed by Intel Corporation Corp (INTC) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.48% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
VLUE seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index before fees and expenses. The MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index is based on a traditional market capitalization-weighted parent index, the MSCI USA Index which includes U.S. large and mid capitalization stocks.
The ETF has lost about -14.14% so far this year and is down about -3.67% in the last one year (as of 07/20/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $88.40 and $114.92.
The ETF has a beta of 1.03 and standard deviation of 26.97% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 155 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
IShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, VLUE is a great option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.
The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $51.79 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $95.19 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.19% and VTV charges 0.04%.
Bottom-Line
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.

2022-07-20 00:00:00+00:00,3 Chip Stocks to Buy Ahead of Earnings,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-chip-stocks-to-buy-ahead-of-earnings,,,"The world's top chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (NYSE: TSM), better known as TSMC, second-quarter 2022 earnings report indicates chip spending is still very healthy, especially as businesses update their operations for cloud computing and AI. TSMC said its Q2 sales increased 37% year over year (in U.S. dollars), and provided an outlook for another 36% increase for Q3.
That's fantastic news for TSMC's chip design customers (which use TSMC to make the actual chips to fulfill orders). With demand still on the rise for enterprise hardware, semiconductor companies with a focus on cloud and AI are poised to report healthy growth in Q2 and beyond. Three top TSMC customers that look like buys ahead of earnings are Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Here's why.
1. Marvell Technology: A first on Taiwan Semi's advanced manufacturing process
TSMC built itself into the largest chip fabrication company by developing world-class manufacturing technology. It is constantly pouring research dollars into more advanced fab processes. Its 3nm tech process -- representing the best combination of chip computing power, energy efficiency, and chip size -- is gearing up for mass production later this year.
Data management and networking leader Marvell Technology Group was the first chip company to introduce an entire platform of chip designs utilizing Taiwan Semi's 3nm process. It secured priority access to this new fab technology, which means Marvell could have some of the first chips on the market using the latest and greatest manufacturing tech. Marvell is already a leader in supplying data processing and networking equipment for cloud data centers and 5G mobile network infrastructure, so these new chips could help it extend its lead.
Paired with a couple of acquisitions last year that extended its portfolio of hardware into photonics and data center switching equipment, Marvell could be poised for a strong run of growth over the next few years. Marvell also has minimal exposure to consumer electronics, an area of the chip universe that has been exhibiting weakness as of late as households slow spending on PCs and smartphones. Instead, Marvell is primarily focused on secular growth trends like AI, advanced networking, and automotive technology.
Given this dynamic, I believe Marvell is a compelling buy ahead of earnings. Shares trade for 50 times trailing 12-month free cash flow (due to acquisition expenses), but only 22 times current year expected earnings. And with its outsized exposure to top trends in semiconductor technology, I think this will be an industry outperformer for years to come.
2. AMD: Only just beginning to unlock value from Xilinx
Speaking of acquisitions, early in 2022 AMD completed a massive merger with design peer Xilinx in the largest deal ever in the industry. AMD has been on a tear for a decade, going from a small thorn in the side of market leader Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) to a leading researcher and developer of silicon devices. Adding Xilinx to the mix will help AMD keep this epic run going.
But the beauty of getting Xilinx is it fulfills several needs for AMD. One is that it will help AMD lift its profit margins, simply because Xilinx itself had better profit margins than AMD did pre-merger. More importantly, though, AMD's growth has been propelled by cloud data center chips. However, over half of AMD's revenue is tied to far more cyclical consumer electronics sales. Xilinx and its focus on industrial and enterprise networking applications will diversify AMD away from more volatile consumer sales in a big way.
When AMD reports earnings on Aug. 2, I expect AMD's EPYC processors for data centers will continue to keep AMD in fast growth mode. As a TSMC customer, the chip fab giant's recent report indicates as much for AMD. But Xilinx was also a growing company before the merger, and its chip portfolio is also enjoying steady tailwinds from industrial applications. But as AMD stock has been punished as of late (share prices are down 42% so far this year), the market seems mostly focused on the risks with the consumer half of the business.
AMD stock now trades for 32 times trailing 12-month free cash flow and just 19 times current-year expected earnings. The bar is set lower than it has been for years for this chip design leader, and I think AMD is a top buy ahead of its Q2 earnings report in a couple weeks.
3. Nvidia: Everyone's fave chip stock goes on sale, sort of
If there was a chip company that TSMC's Q2 report lent a helping hand to, it's Nvidia. Nvidia's GPUs for high-end video game graphics, cloud computing, and AI make use of Taiwan Semi's fab expertise. But worry has been mounting that Nvidia's momentum over the last few years is about to hit a wall. As the cryptocurrency industry fallout continues, crypto mining companies aren't hoarding GPUs (many of them intended for video gamers) anymore. That could send the video game segment in reverse.
But Nvidia's largest segment is now data centers, and TSMC is a top manufacturer of high-end computing chips. If TSMC is still in growth mode, Nvidia's new bread-and-butter end market is likely to remain in growth mode too. That at least confirms the positive (but somewhat ambiguous) data center outlook Nvidia CẸO Jensen Huang provided during the Q1 earnings call.
As a reminder, Nvidia's data center segment sales were up a sizzling 83% year over year in Q1. I don't expect that same expansion rate to continue in Q2, but it doesn't necessarily need to in order to keep Nvidia's overall revenue headed up and to the right. Besides data center chips, Nvidia has other irons in the fire too (automotive, software, etc.).
The question now is whether more modest growth is worth buying into. Nvidia shares trade for 53 times trailing 12-month free cash flow and 30 times current year expected earnings. It isn't a value. On the contrary, this is still a premium-priced stock that assumes Nvidia will keep growing for many years to come. But if you want a decade-long bet on a top AI computing platform, the stock could be a buy ahead of earnings anyways. Nvidia shares haven't been this ""cheap"" since early in the pandemic in 2020, and its position as a tech giant is stronger than ever. This remains a core holding in my portfolio.
