2022-01-05 00:00:00+00:00,Why AMD Stock Soared 57% Higher in 2021,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amd-stock-soared-57-higher-in-2021,,,"What happened
Shares of scrappy chip-industry underdog AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) rocketed 57% higher in 2021, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. It builds on an incredible run the company has been on in recent years. Since the start of 2018, AMD stock is up a whopping 1,300%.

So what
AMD's success is thanks to its technological advancements in chip design for PCs and data centers. The company laid the foundation for this transformation back in 2009 when it spun off its chip-fabrication division Globalfoundries (NASDAQ: GFS) and then sold off its remaining equity stake in 2012. Since then, AMD has had flexibility in choosing manufacturing partners, and this flexibility has allowed the company to double down on its chip-design engineering.
The result has been an ascendant AMD that is gobbling up market share from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which still boasts the largest slice of the semiconductor industry's annual sales. With Intel's trailing 12-month revenue haul at $78 billion compared to AMD's comparatively small $15 billion, there's still plenty of room for AMD to keep expanding from here. For the record, AMD sales grew 52% through the first nine months of 2021 compared to less than 1% increase for Intel's revenue.
Now what
AMD is in the process of acquiring fellow circuitry engineer Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX). The deal is expected to close during the first quarter of 2022, pending sign off from Chinese regulators. Xilinx, which specializes in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), is also growing faster than Intel's FPGA segment and will be a brand new department for AMD once the merger is complete. Xilinx's growth and higher profit margins also help explain AMD stock's big jump in the last year.
After several years of surging growth, AMD could see a slowdown in its trajectory in 2022. Nevertheless, a new era of cloud-based computing is here, and this once small and oft overlooked company is a top-notch play for investing in the cloud-hardware upgrade cycle that is now underway. The stock does trade for a premium 57 times trailing 12-month free cash flow to kick off the new year, but this isn't an unreasonable price tag considering rapidly improving profit margins at the company. Nevertheless, if shares hit a patch of turbulence this year, remember to stay focused on AMD's long-term potential for the duration of the 2020s.

Everyone loves tech stocks. For the past several decades, they have been the big performers. They’ve led the charge to trillion dollar valuations and beyond. A Goldman Sachs note published last fall reported that between 2016 and 2020, FAAMG stocks delivered a 244% return. The remaining 495 stocks on the S&P 500 returned 41% during the same time. In September 2020, those five FAAMG tech stocks represented 23% of the total value of the S&P 500. Past performance is no guarantee for the future, but tech stocks still seem like a solid bet for growth.
7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy and Hold Until 2030 for Proven Gains
What is better than a tech stock? How about tech stocks that also pay dividends? This delivers a killer combination: growth, plus cash flow. That’s the story with each of the tech stocks on this list. 
Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX)
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)
HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)
Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC)
Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS)
There are even a few companies on this list of tech stocks with dividends that are also big players in the defense industry. Given that the U.S. defense budget approved for 2022 is $770 billion, these stocks make a compelling case even more attractive.
Tech Stocks: Amdocs (DOX)

This Israeli (although based in Missouri) company has been around for 40 years. These days, Amdocs is focused on working with media and communications companies, helping them integrate next-gen digital customer solutions through its 5G and cloud-native offerings. The company’s involvement can range from customer support solutions to helping clients monetize their growing IoT (internet of Things) platforms.
Amdocs is a big business, with 28,000 employees globally, $4.3 billion in revenue in 2021 and a market capitalization of over $9.4 billion. Until an October dip caused by a Q4 earnings miss, DOX stock had delivered growth of over 16% to that point in the year. And DOX is on this particular list of tech stocks because it pays a dividend. At this point its dividend yield is 1.93%.
Among the investment analysts tracked by the Wall Street Journal, DOX stock is currently rated as “overweight.” Their average 12-month price target of $88.57 offers 17% upside.
At the time of publication, the Dividend Grader rating for DOX stock was “A.”
Broadcom (AVGO)

Broadcom continues to be one of my favorite tech stocks. The company always seems to be in the thick of all the big technology trends. At the moment, Broadcom is benefiting tremendously from 5G. The company is a supplier of commercial 5G solutions like base stations and switches used by cellular providers. But Broadcom is also supplying a range of networking chips used in smartphones. As consumers upgrade to a new phone to get 5G, Broadcom is selling Wi-Fi, GPOS and Bluetooth chips to the manufacturers.
Spending on 5G has helped Broadcom deliver a series of record-setting quarters. That, in turn, has seen AVGO stock deliver a return of 59% in 2021. Broadcom has also been rewarding investors.
In its fourth quarter earnings report, the company’s CEO made this announcement (bringing AVGO’s dividend yield to 2.2%): “Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we are increasing our target quarterly common stock dividend by 14 percent to $4.10 per share per quarter for fiscal year 2022, and announcing a new $10 billion share repurchase program.”

Tech Stocks: HP (HPQ)

Some people still think of HP as a tech dinosaur. A computer and printer maker in the age of smartphones. In a way, that’s more true than ever — the original HP split into two companies in 2015, with HP Inc becoming the company focused on PC and printer sales. 
That’s felt a lot less like a “dinosaur” thing over the past 2 years. With the pandemic kicking off an era of working from home, PC sales have been up. In 2021, that’s expected to equate to a year of 14.2% growth for the industry. That will slow, but is expected to continue in the single-digits into 2025, which is a remarkable turnaround after years of decline. Printers are selling as well.
In addition, HP is looking to the future through leadership in technology such as 3D printing. For its full year fiscal 2021, HP reported revenue up 12.1% year-over-year, and the company shattered its own earnings outlook. HPQ stock was up 58% in 2021, making it a growth performer among tech stocks. The company’s 2.1% dividend yield is the icing on the cake.
The current Dividend Grader rating for HPQ stock is “A.”
Intel (INTC)

It’s easy to look at Intel and see another PC dinosaur. In the case of Intel — cursed with processor delays, competition in its core x86 CPU market that is seeing the company bleed market share, and CEO troubles — the analogy has been a dinosaur trapped in tar pit. While other tech stocks have benefitted significantly from the pandemic-spurred growth in laptop sales, INTC stock has struggled. At this point, it managed 4% growth for 2021, but it’s down 24% from January 2020, pre-pandemic levels.
I say this is a strong case of opportunity knocking. Through its darkest days, Intel has continued to pay a dividend. Its current dividend yield is 2.8%. Intel is also moving aggressively after years of stumbling. The company has been snapping up capacity at third party silicon fabricators to get back on track with its delayed 3nm chips. This year, Intel unveiled new 3D stacked-chip CPU designs that would leapfrog rivals to reclaim the PC performance crown. The company is also on the verge of releasing its own consumer graphics cards in 2022.
Intel stock at its current price is positioned to deliver big growth if the company can come even close to hitting its ambitious production roadmap.

Tech Stocks: Lockheed Martin (LMT)

Lockheed Martin is one of those tech stocks I referenced in the intro that also happens to be a big player in the defense industry. In fact it’s the largest U.S. defense contractor by far, with $74.2 billion in contracts for 2021. 
However, Lockheed Martin deserves inclusion in this list because so much of what the company does is technology-driven. Much of that tech is military-based, but the company also operates in the civilian space as well. For example, the James Webb Space telescope was recently in headlines. Its primary camera is a Lockheed Martin NIRCam (near infrared camera).
Lockheed Martin’s GridStar Flow is a high-capacity battery storage system aimed at clean energy facilities like solar and wind farms. The company even sells advanced, digital train management systems for improved safety and on-time performance.
Count LMT among the tech stocks that also pays a dividend. In September, Lockheed Martin announced that quarterly dividend payment would be hiked 20 cents to $2.80 per share. That gives LMT stock a juicy 3.1% dividend yield.
LMT stock currently earns an “A” rating in Dividend Grader.
Northrup Grumman(NOC)

Count Northrup Grumman as being in the same club as Lockheed Martin. It’s one of those tech stocks that is heavily involved in the defense industry (the fifth largest U.S. defense contractor), but it is a very technology focused company. In fact NOC’s second-highest performing division in terms of revenue is Space Systems.    
NOC stock has been in growth mode for the past decade, offering a return of nearly 600% during that time. It closed at an all-time high of $406.62 in October. Despite slipping since then, shares are still up 31% this year. Northrup Grumman also pays a quarterly dividend. The latest dividend payment was announced on Nov. 17. At $1.57 per share, this gives NOC stock a 1.6% dividend yield.

Tech Stocks: Skyworks (SWKS)

California-based Skyworks Solutions is a semiconductor company. It provides chips covering a wide range of high-tech growth markets including 5G, Wi-Fi 6, automotive and IoT. Skyworks uses a hybrid model where it operates its own foundry to manufacture chips, but also has strategic partnerships with suppliers for some components.
The hybrid approach has shielded Skyworks from the worst of the chip shortages that have hit many fabless semiconductor companies. At the same time, demand for Skyworks chips has gone through the roof thanks to ramped-up adoption of advanced communication technology.    
You can see the full effect in Skyworks’ full-year 2021 results, which the company reported in November. Record-setting revenue of $5.1 billion was up 52% compared to 2020. The company’s CEO set out a roadmap that includes expansion and continued investment in the pursuit of new technology: “Looking ahead, Skyworks’ cash generation ability is funding capacity expansion and next-generation technology development, positioning us for continued leadership and sustainable growth as the transition to 5G and other advanced connectivity solutions continues.”
The company also announced a 56 cent per share quarterly dividend payment, bringing SKY stock’s dividend yield to 1.4%.
At the time of publication, SWKS stock earned an “A” rating in Dividend Grader.

2022-01-05 00:00:00+00:00,3 Reasons to Sell AMD in 2022,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-to-sell-amd-in-2022,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock has crushed the broader market in the past three years due to rapid growth in the company's revenue and earnings. AMD's performance has been fueled by market share gains against bigger rivals such as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and its presence in popular products like Sony's (NYSE: SONY) PlayStation and Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Xbox consoles.
It won't be surprising to see AMD sustain its impressive momentum in 2022 and remain a top growth stock thanks to the catalysts it is sitting on.
AMD data by YCharts.
However, investors shouldn't miss a few red flags that could send shares of AMD tumbling. Let's look at three factors that could prove to be AMD's Achilles' heel in 2022.
1. Intel's resurgence could give AMD sleepless nights
The loss of Intel's competitive edge has been one of the biggest factors driving AMD's growth in the past few years. AMD's market share gains in the central processing unit (CPU) space have supercharged the company's revenue and earnings, thanks mainly to an advanced manufacturing process that allowed it to overshadow Chipzilla and gain customer acceptance.
But it looks like Intel is on the road to redemption, as its latest Alder Lake processors are showing signs of taking back share from AMD. Intel's share of sales at German retailer Mindfactory had jumped to 30% in November 2021, which was a record high for the year. Intel had a 23% share of sales at Mindfactory in October 2021, indicating that the launch of its new competitive chips that are comparable to AMD's offerings in terms of the manufacturing process could help it turn the tide.

Intel's new manufacturing process is allowing it to make processors that are not just fast but are also competitively priced when compared to AMD's offerings. Given that Intel is further expected to refine its manufacturing process in 2022 with the Raptor Lake chips and then move to a 7-nanometer process node next year, AMD will have to be on its toes.
AMD has reportedly slashed prices already to ensure the competitiveness of its chips following the launch of the Alder Lake processors. So Intel's resurgence would be bad news for AMD, as the latter has had a terrific run in the CPU space, enjoying a mix of strong volumes and pricing power that could be under threat if Chipzilla continues to execute well.
2. Component shortages could be another challenge
The enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (EESC) business has been one of the pillars of AMD's outstanding growth since the launch of the latest-generation consoles by Sony and Microsoft. The company's third-quarter revenue from the EESC segment was up a whopping 69% year over year to $1.9 billion, and strong gaming console demand was one of the reasons for this massive jump.
However, it looks like console manufacturers are finding it difficult to source components and make enough devices to meet the robust demand. Nintendo, for instance, slashed the sales forecast of its Switch console for the current fiscal year by 1.5 million units. Similarly, Sony is expected to assemble 15 million units of the PlayStation 5 in the ongoing financial year that's set to end in March 2022, down from the earlier estimate of 16 million units.
Additionally, Sony's manufacturing partners reportedly believe that the company may find it difficult to meet its goal of producing 22.6 million units of the PS5 in the next fiscal year. A similar story seems to be unfolding with Microsoft's latest Xbox consoles, which are expected to be in short supply this year due to chip shortages.
So AMD's sales to Microsoft and Sony may take a hit if the console manufacturers are forced to lower their production this year due to component shortages. This is another potential red flag that AMD investors need to look out for, as its EESC business might lose momentum due to lower console sales.
3. Nvidia is dominating graphics cards
AMD has been unable to make much headway against Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market over the past year. Nvidia controlled 83% of the discrete graphics cards market in the third quarter of 2021, according to Jon Peddie Research. For comparison, Nvidia had 82% of the discrete GPU market under its control in the fourth quarter of 2020, which means that it hasn't given AMD an inch in this lucrative market.
It is worth noting that AMD was once giving Nvidia a run for its money in the GPU market and controlled a substantially large chunk of this space. However, the launch of Nvidia's Ampere graphics cards in 2020 changed the equation. Those cards brought about huge performance gains at attractive prices. Nvidia is expected to step up its game in 2022 with the launch of its next-generation Ada Lovelace graphics cards that rumors suggest could be twice as fast as the company's current offerings.
So AMD may find it difficult to make any progress against Nvidia in the GPU market, especially considering that the latter seems to have secured a substantial supply of components that could help it corner a bigger chunk of sales in 2022. As it turns out, Nvidia was the only GPU maker to have increased sales in the third quarter of 2021.
Jon Peddie Research estimates $54 billion worth of GPUs will be sold annually by 2025 as compared to $23.6 billion in 2020, and AMD is not in a great position to take advantage thanks to the presence of Nvidia. As a result, AMD may miss out on the sharp increase in GPU sales in 2022 and beyond, and this missed opportunity could eventually weigh on the stock price.

2022-01-04 00:00:00+00:00,"Mobileye, Zeekr aim for self-driving car in China in 2024",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mobileye-zeekr-aim-for-self-driving-car-in-china-in-2024,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Jan 4 (Reuters) - Intel Corp's INTC.O autonomous driving unit, Mobileye, said on Tuesday it plans to work with Geely Holding-backed GEELY.UL Zeekr to launch in China what the companies claim will be the world's first mostly self-driving car in 2024.
The two companies said at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that the car will have what automotive engineers call level 4 autonomy, meaning that it will still have a steering wheel and require a licensed driver but will be able to drive itself in many situations. It will use six of Mobileye's ""EyeQ 5"" chips and also employ Mobileye's road-mapping data.
Intel, which is hungry for cash to build chip factories and racing to catch up with rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW that have taken away Intel's lead in making the fastest chips, said last month it plans to spin out a portion of Mobileye in an initial public offering. Geely, the fast-growing Chinese automaker, has recently explored manufacturing cars in Korea that could be exported to the United States duty-free, Reuters reported last month.
Mobileye on Tuesday also said that it is deepening its relationship with Ford Motor Co F.N. The two firms said that Ford will use Mobileye's road-mapping data system, which is drawn from all vehicles on the road with Mobileye hardware, in future versions of Ford's ""BlueCruise"" that allows hands-free driving in some situations.
Mobileye said that Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE will also start using some of its mapping data products for Volkswagen's driver-assistance features, such as automated lane keeping.
Mobileye on Tuesday also unveiled the next generation of its flagship computer chip, which will be called the ""EyeQ Ultra"" and is designed to use minimal electricity, which is becoming more important as self-driving systems compete with drive trains for limited battery capacity in electric vehicles. The company said that prototypes of the chip will be ready next year, with automotive production of the chips expected in 2025.

Jan 4 (Reuters) - TuSimple Holdings Inc TSP.O on Tuesday said it has partnered with Nvidia Corp NVDA.O to use the company's vehicle chips to design and build an advanced autonomous driving computer for its self-driving trucks.
The computer, known as a domain controller in the automotive industry, will be specifically engineered for TuSimple's commercial self-driving trucks, and will power sensor perception and vehicle operation.
Nvidia will provide artificial intelligence expertise and its Drive Orin hardware, a chip specifically designed for autonomous driving capabilities.
The controller powered by Nvidia's chip will be installed in the autonomous trucks TuSimple is currently developing in partnership with manufacturer Navistar, targeted for production in 2024.
""We believe this move provides us a significant competitive advantage in speeding time to market,"" TuSimple Chief Executive Officer Cheng Lu said in a statement.
TuSimple said it will own usage rights to the controller's design, adding that it planned to work with an unnamed third party manufacturer to produce it.
Considered crucial in the development of self-driving, controllers allow automakers to centralize compute-intensive instruments such as cameras, radars and lidar sensors.
Instead of each sensor being equipped with an individual electronic control unit, the domain controller handles computing tasks centrally, saving cost and space and allowing software updates to take place remotely.
Other chipmakers, including Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Intel Corp's INTC.O Mobileye and NXP NXPI.O are also offering domain controller chips for the automotive industry.
Self-driving freight trucks, while still operating largely in pilot projects, have become a focus of the autonomous industry in recent years, facing fewer regulatory and technological hurdles and potentially offering a faster way to generate returns than passenger robotaxis.

2022-01-04 00:00:00+00:00,Why AMD Stock Dropped More Than 5% Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amd-stock-dropped-more-than-5-today,,,"What happened
After starting off the new year with a healthy 4.4% share price gain Monday, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) took a turn for the worse Tuesday. As of 1:33 p.m. ET, shares of the semiconductor giant were down 5.7% -- more than deleting all of Monday's gains.
It's not immediately clear what turned investors against the stock, but odds are the issue has its roots in the ""2022 Product Premiere livestream"" presentation that the company began Tuesday morning.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
In this presentation, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su announced several ""new products that deliver leadership productivity, content creation, and gaming experiences,"" including:
""New Radeon RX 6500 XT and Radeon RX 6400 desktop graphics cards for incredible 1080p gaming.""
""Three new AMD Radeon RX 6000S Series GPUs optimized for thin and light gaming laptops.""
""Five new AMD Radeon RX 6000M Series GPUs for premium gaming laptops.""
And ""20 new AMD Ryzen 6000 Series processors.""
Taking stock of the new products, a Reuters article noted that AMD appeared to be ""taking aim at business computers"" -- and looking to win market share away from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Data analytics company Lynx, however, noted Tuesday in a note covered by TheFly.com that for most of the first half of 2022, at least, AMD's focus appears to be not on commercial notebook computers at all, but on gaming computers -- a market where AMD will go head to head with Nvidia rather than the weaker Intel.
Additionally, Lynx is concerned that Dr. Su did not mention the ""Genoa"" 5-nanometer server chips that the company is developing for business customers, noting that it is now possible that they may launch ""no earlier than late 2022.""
Now what
How bad would that be for AMD's business, though, even if it is true?
Consider that over the last five years, AMD has grown its annual revenue by more than three times, grown its annual free cash flow from $4 million to nearly $3 billion, and pivoted from an annual net loss of nearly $500 million to a nearly $4 billion annual net profit.
With the stock trading at a price-earnings ratio of 43 and analysts forecasting that the company's earnings will grow at a nearly 40% annualized rate over the next five years, AMD actually looks quite fairly priced to me right now. This attractive valuation outweighs any potential concerns about the timetables for new product launches, which is why I view AMD's Tuesday sell-off as a buying opportunity.

BENGALURU, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Indian billioniare Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd RELIB.UL, the country's top telecom operator, is planning its largest ever rupee bond sale for up to 50 billion rupees ($670.65 million) of notes, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.
The company is seeking commitments for as much as 50 billion rupees of notes maturing in five years at a coupon rate of 6.20%, according to the report, citing people familiar with the matter.
Jio did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
The operator plans to use the proceeds from the proposed bond sale to meet its financial liabilities, Bloomberg said.
With 426.6 million wireless subscribers as of October 2021, Jio is India's largest mobile phone carrier.
Its launch in 2016 and offerings of free calls and cut-price data plans shook up the country's telecoms sector, forcing rivals to respond with their own cuts and leading to consolidation.

2022-01-04 00:00:00+00:00,Dogs of the Dow 2022: 10 Dividend Stocks to Watch,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dogs-of-the-dow-2022%3A-10-dividend-stocks-to-watch,,,"The start of the new year means a fresh chance for yield-seeking investors to get in on one of the easiest market strategies in the book:
The Dogs of the Dow.
Investment manager Michael B. O'Higgins popularized the idea in his 1991 book Beating the Dow. And it doesn't get much simpler: At the beginning of the year, buy the 10 highest-yielding Dow Jones Industrial Average components in equal amounts. Hold them until the end of the year. Rinse. Repeat.
SEE MORE The Pros’ Picks: 22 Top Stocks to Invest In for 2022
While the Dogs of the Dow sounds like a dividend strategy, it has its roots in value. O'Higgins' proposed that firms with high dividends relative to their stock price in the index would be near the bottom of their business cycle and represent bargains compared to components with lower dividend yields.
And why the DJIA? The Dow Jones has long been considered one of the leading stock-market gauges of America's economy. While the S&P 500 has more components and is more diversified, the Dow still covers most sectors. Not to mention, its components are extremely liquid and there are reams of research available on all 30.
But buyer beware. While the Dogs of the Dow have posted a respectable 8.7% annual total return since 2000, the Dogs have trailed the DJIA in each of the past four years. Analysts have proposed that the shift to growth investing has hurt the strategy's performance; but with value stocks predicted to regain their mojo, the Dogs could again have their day.
Without further ado, here are the 2022 Dogs of the Dow.

Intel
Sector: Technology
Market value: $209.5 billion
Dividend yield: 2.7%
Oh, how the tables have turned.
A decade ago, Intel (INTC, $51.50) was the leading name in chips, while Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) were promising yet still relatively minor players – combined, the two were worth less than a tenth of Intel by market capitalization.
But Nvidia is now several times Nvidia's size, and AMD isn't too far behind Intel's $210 billion market value. That's because in recent years, Intel has missed the boat on a variety of fronts. From mobile computing and productions capabilities for faster/smaller chipsets, Intel has stumbled … and its rivals have eaten its lunch.
But while Intel might be down, it's hardly not out.
Intel's Alder Lake 12th-generation core processor chips have started to eat away from AMD's high-end processors, and Intel recently announced the latest line of Alder Lake chips that include what the company says is ""the fastest mobile processor. Ever."" The next two years should see its 13th-gen (Raptor Lake) and 14th-gen (Meteor Lake) chips come live.
Intel also could squeeze some value out of Mobileye, the autonomous vehicle-chip stock that it acquired back in 2017. INTC in December announced its intent to spin the company off in an initial public offering (IPO) while maintaining controlling interest – allowing Intel to enjoy both an immediate windfall while still realizing gains as Mobileye grows.
In keeping with the Dogs of the Dow's value bent, Intel trades at just 14 times the coming year's earnings estimates, significantly less than both the S&P 500 (21) and technology sector (28). INTC's 2.7% yield is also much better than what you typically get out of tech shares.

Coca-Cola
Sector: Consumer staples
Market value: $255.8 billion
Dividend yield: 2.8%
In today's low-carb and keto-friendly world, sugary soft drinks and sodas are practically verboten. And in recent years, that has largely muted the returns of giant Coca-Cola (KO, $59.21), which has produced roughly half the total returns (price plus dividends) of the S&P 500 over the past half-decade.
But KO is doing a better job of ensuring it has the goods to shift with consumer tastes.
Coca-Cola has spent a few years moving its portfolio into healthier options. That includes teas, milk and sparkling water, among others. It also unveiled new zero-sugar versions of soda brands such as Sprite and Coca-Cola, which fueled about 25% of the Coca-Cola brand's growth in the third quarter.
KO is also looking toward athletics and fitness fanatics for growth. Back in November, Coca-Cola purchased sports beverage group BodyArmor – which it already had a 15% stake in – for $5.6 billion. This instantly gives it a meaningful presence in the industry. ""BodyArmor is currently the #2 sports drink in the category in measured retail channels, growing at about 50% to drive more than $1.4 billion in retail sales,"" the company says.
And you don't get more dependable than Coca-Cola's dividend, which has been growing uninterrupted for 59 consecutive years. That easily puts it among the longest-tenured Dividend Aristocrats.

3M
Sector: Industrials
Market value: 102.4 billion
Dividend yield: 3.3%
Unlike most of Wall Street, 3M (MMM, $177.63) was already getting crushed by the time the COVID bear market came around. The U.S.-China trade war and other difficulties were already weighing on the industrial name when COVID cramped demand for many of the company's products (except its N95 masks and filtering division, of course).
But 2022 could be another year of recovery for 3M.
3M makes more than 60,000 products, from consumer products such as sponges and packing tape to industrial diamond-coated grinding disks and orthodontic supplies. In normal times, this wide product portfolio provides insulation from specific shocks to its various businesses. And it allows 3M to enjoy in numerous facets of a broad economic recovery.
The company grew third-quarter revenues 7.1% year-over-year and generated more than $1.5 billion in free cash flow. 3M is benefiting from continued cost cutting and development programs, as well as from selling chronically underperforming business lines.
3M's forward P/E of 16 makes it one of the more expensive 2022 Dogs of the Dow, and yet it still trades for much cheaper than the S&P 500 and industrial sector (20) alike.

Amgen
Sector: Healthcare
Market value: $126.7 billion
Dividend yield: 3.5%
Patent expirations are a hurdle most pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have to face, and that's no different for established biotech Amgen (AMGN, $224.97). Top drugs such as Enbrel, Neulasta and Otezla will fall off the patent cliff in coming years.
The good news? The earliest drug in that cohort to fall off patent won't do so until 2025. And often, U.S. drug manufacturers can kick the can down the road by making minor changes to drugs or adding more indications for the therapy. Not to mention, expirations go both ways – AbbVie's (ABBV) blockbuster drug Humira is set to lose patent protection in the U.S. in 2023, and Amgen has already gained approval to sell Amjevita, a biosimilar form of the drug.
Another big reason AMGN shareholders shouldn't panic is its potential-packed pipeline. The biotechnology firm has more than 20 drugs in Phase 2 or 3 trials. And recently, the FDA approved Amgen severe-asthma medication Tezspire, a potential blockbuster drug.
Nearer-term, another reason to like Amgen is its dividend. Namely, it'll be 10% bigger in 2022, at $1.94 per share quarterly, the company announced in December.

Merck
Sector: Healthcare
Market value: $193.6 billion
Dividend yield: 3.6%
Merck (MRK, $76.64) has been doing a lot of evolving in recent years. It has gone on an impressive pipeline-buying spree, which continued in late November with its $11.5 billion buy of Acceleron. And Merck also recently spun off its legacy generic drug and off-patent medicines into a separate company, Organon (OGN).
The resulting Merck is one of the top growth-oriented drug producers in the world.
Sales of oncology blockbuster drug Keytruda jumped 22% year-over-year during Q3, to $4.5 billion. Some analysts believe Keytruda will soon be the world's best-selling drug, overtaking AbbVie's Humira. That's in part because Merck intends to seek approval for other indications of the drug. But Merck has other major drugs in the tank, including Gardasil, whose sales grew 68% to $2 billion in Q3. And its pipeline includes dozens of products in Phase 2 and 3 trials.
A low forward P/E of around 10, and a yield well above 3%, make MRK a model example of the income and value found in the Dogs of the Dow.

Walgreens Boots Alliance
Sector: Consumer staples
Market value: $45.2 billion
Dividend yield: 3.7%
Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA, $52.16) wasn't the COVID winner you might have thought. COVID prompted a shift in the company's sales mix to lower-margin items, and it dragged heavily on foot traffic in the company's Boots U.K. stores.
So, like many other retailers, an escape from the pandemic should help Walgreens, which used COVID as an opportunity to cut nearly $2 billion in costs from its operations.
Partnerships will be essential too. For instance, Walgreens has been opening branded primary-care clinics with VillageMD, who staffs these locations with physicians, allowing them to cater to more than ear infections and sniffles. Walgreens plans to open 1,000 of these clinics at its stores by 2027.
Also in play is the potential divestiture of its Boots business; several reports in December said Walgreens was mulling the move.
With foot traffic on the rebound and new avenues for growth opening up, WBA could be a productive Dow Dog. A forward P/E of around 10 doesn't hurt, either.

Chevron
Sector: Energy
Market value: $226.2 billion
Dividend yield: 4.6%
COVID was downright miserable for the energy sector – even integrated oil-and-gas giants such as Chevron (CVX, $117.35).
However, while numerous companies closed, and many more were forced to cut jobs, slash capital expenditures and pull back on their dividends, Chevron managed to keep its dividend running and even used an all-stock deal to acquire Noble Energy.
Chevron's acquisition of Noble at fire-sale prices boosted its overall presence in low-cost fields in the Permian Basin, allowing the company to better leverage a rebound in energy prices, which came in spades in 2021.
Energy stocks of all sorts went bananas in 2021, making it the S&P 500's top sector. Chevron returned 46% amid a complete rebound in its operations. For instance, its third quarter saw Chevron earn $6.1 billion versus the $207 million it lost in the year-ago quarter.
However, despite its massive 2021 move, CVX stock yet again finds itself among the Dogs of the Dow.
Chevron's 4.6% current yield isn't as generous as the 6% or so it offered at this same time last year, but it's still one of the top yields in the Dow. Meanwhile, it's value-priced at just 12 times earnings estimates.

International Business Machines
Sector: Technology
Market value: $119.9 billion
Dividend yield: 4.9%
International Business Machines (IBM, $133.66) has been nothing short of a disappointment in recent years.
Big Blue has struggled to remain relevant in the age of cloud computing while rivals chipped away market share. At one point, the firm recorded 22 consecutive quarters of declining revenue, then restarted that streak shortly after breaking it. Even including dividends, IBM shares returned just 1% between 2017 and 2021.
But IBM might finally be getting itself together.
Its 2019 purchases of open-source software firm Red Hat boosted the company's operations. Fast-forward to 2021, and the company cut loose some dead weight, spinning off its legacy IT infrastructure services as Kyndryl (KD).
A now leaner, meaner IBM is focused once again on growth.
We saw signs of this in the company's third quarter, where overall cloud revenues grew 14% year-over-year. It'll still be a while before IBM can report its post-separation numbers, but analysts are generally expecting IBM to start heading in the right direction once again.
Better still: IBM didn't give away any of the dividend game with Kyndryl. International Business Machines remains a Dividend Aristocrat whose 4.9% yield is among the best of 2022's Dogs of the Dow.

Verizon Communications
Sector: Communication services
Market value: $215.1 billion
Dividend yield: 4.9%
Verizon (VZ, $51.96) spent the last few years trying to build out a communications and media empire. Wireless communication has become a commodity; there isn’t much difference between carriers, plans or offerings at this point. The U.S. market is saturated. The major carriers can’t rely on their legacy businesses for growth.
But Verizon’s ventures, which included buying Yahoo! And other media properties, simply didn’t pan out. Several write-offs later, and VZ is just getting back to basics: improving its giant network and providing services that utilize said network.
The 5G transformation is a major tailwind for Verizon. It’s not just consumer devices; smart vehicles, the Internet of Things and other applications will be a big driver for its network. Also, Verizon has started to transition toward more enterprise customers, which includes fleet management software and applications to data security. These should also provide a runway for growth.
A forward P/E under 10 and a nearly 5% dividend, meanwhile, provide some of the best features of the Dogs of the Dow.

Dow
Sector: Materials
Market value: $42.0 billion
Dividend yield: 4.9%
Dow has had a wild and transformative few years that saw it spin off assets before merging with rival DuPont (DD), then the chemical giant split into three separate firms. The remaining Dow contains the materials sciences chemicals, including adhesives, polyurethanes, silicones, resins and waxes, among others.
Like most other materials stocks, Dow struggled right alongside the broader economy during the COVID recession. For instance, during Q3 2020, the company lost 4 cents per share on $9.7 billion in sales. By Q3 2021, Dow had recovered considerably, posting $2.23 per share in earnings on $14.8 billion in revenues.
The omicron and future variants could throw more hurdles at the Dow recovery, but in general, a growing global economy should mean continued growth in demand for Dow's products.
You can buy into that recovery on the cheap through Dow. Shares trade at a svelte nine times future earnings and yield nearly 5% at today's prices. That's roughly four times the income you'll pull from the broader market, and at a much better valuation. A fair dividend payout ratio of 45% of earnings leaves Dow ample room to raise that payout further.

2022-01-04 00:00:00+00:00,Value Tech Stocks Had A Solid 2021. Will The Rally Continue?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/value-tech-stocks-had-a-solid-2021.-will-the-rally-continue,,,"Our theme of Value Tech Stocks – which is comprised of tech stocks with a market cap of over $5 billion and a price to earnings multiple of under 20x – has rallied by a solid 57% year-to-date, considerably outperforming the S&P 500 index which is up by about 28% over the same period. The outperformance isn’t really surprising. We’ve been bullish on the theme since last year (see updates below) given that it plays on the increasing digitization of the economy following Covid-19 and higher corporate IT spending, without being weighed down by interest rate and inflation concerns, unlike other high-growth, high multiple-technology stocks. So will the outperformance continue? Although we expect these stocks to do better than the broader markets as the Fed has planned as many as three interest rate hikes for 2022, some of the Covid-19 related tailwinds that technology stocks, in general, saw in recent quarters could ease.
Within our theme, Arista Networks (ANET), a company that sells networking solutions for large datacenter, cloud computing, high-performance computing applications, has been the strongest performer with its stock price up by almost 100% over the last twelve months. On the other side, Lumentum Holdings (LITE), a company that manufactures optical and photonic products, has been a relative laggard in the theme, with its stock rising by just about 13% year-to-date.
Below you’ll find our previous coverage of the value tech stocks theme where you can track our view over time.
[7/21/2021] Amkor, eBay: Value Tech Stocks Offer The Best Of Both Worlds
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks – which is comprised of tech stocks with a market cap of over $5 billion and a price to earnings multiple of under 20x – has rallied by about 19% year-to-date, outperforming the S&P 500 index which is up by about 15% over the same period. We see this outperformance continuing in the coming quarters as well, as the stocks in the theme stand to benefit from increasing digitization of the economy following Covid-19 and higher corporate IT spending, without being weighed down by potentially higher interest rates and inflation concerns, unlike other high-growth, high multiple-tech stocks.
Within our theme, Amkor Technology (AMKR), a company that provides semiconductor product packaging and test services, has been the strongest performer, rising by about 48% year-to-date. The rally is being driven by strong demand for semiconductor products and recent speculation of a takeover bid by a private equity player. eBay (EBAY) stock has also fared quite well, rising by around 38%, driven by a higher interest in e-commerce through the pandemic. On the other side, video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) has been the weakest performer, with its stock down by about 2% year-to-date.
[6/3/21]  Value Tech Stocks Are Back In Favor
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks is up by about 16% year-to-date, significantly outperforming the Nasdaq-100 index which is just about 8% higher over the same period. The theme is comprised of large-cap technology stocks that trade at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x. We think the outperformance is likely to continue for a couple of reasons. Firstly, inflation has been trending higher globally and this could cause Central banks to re-think their stance on ultra-low interest rates. This should cause investors to continue rotating out of growth stocks into value stocks.  Moreover, most of the companies in our theme are mature tech names and should remain a play on increasing digitization of the economy following Covid-19.
Cybersecurity player NortonLifeLock (NLOK) has been the strongest performer within our theme, with its stock up by about 37% year-to-date, driven by better than expected Q4 2021 results, which were driven by higher demand for the company’s software, following high-profile cyber attacks in recent quarters. The company also recently announced plans to carry out a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. eBay (EBAY) stock has also fared quite well, rising by around 26%, driven by higher interest in e-commerce through the pandemic. On the other hand, video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) has been the weakest performer, with its stock down by about 1.5% year-to-date.
[5/5/21] Which Value Tech Stock Should You Pick?
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks is up by about 10% year-to-date, compared to the Nasdaq-100 which is up by just about 5% over the same period. The theme includes stocks from the tech sector that have a market cap of over $10 billion, trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x. With Covid-19 cases well off their highs in the U.S. and about a third of the U.S. population now fully vaccinated,  investors are moving away from high growth stocks and Covid-19 winners toward cyclical and value stocks. Moreover, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says that interest rates may have to rise somewhat to keep the economy from overheating and this is another factor that could help value names. We think that value technology stocks, in particular, look attractive at this juncture, considering that they also play on the broader theme of digitization and higher corporate IT budgets post the pandemic. Below is a bit more about how the stocks in our theme have been faring.
Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) has been one of the strongest performers within our theme, rising by about 17% year-to-date, driven by strong semiconductor demand, large new investment plans in the foundry space, and some changes at the top management level. Cisco stock (NASDAQ:CSCO) is up by about 14% year-to-date, as enterprises are likely to increase spending on network infrastructure post the pandemic, with overall corporate IT budgets also likely to trend higher. eBay stock (NASDAQ: EBAY) is also up 14% year-to-date, as the company sees some tailwinds from the shift to e-commerce through Covid-19. However, the stock has come under pressure lately due to lighter than expected guidance for the current quarter. Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) has been the worst performer within our theme, with its stock declining by -3.5% year-to-date.
[3/8/21] Will Rising Bond Yields Help Value Tech Stocks?
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks includes technology names with a market cap of over $10 billion that are trading at a trailing P/E of under 20x.  Although the theme has underperformed since 2017, rising by just about 31%, compared to the Nasdaq-100, which has more than doubled over the period, it has fared better this year, rising 1.5% year-to-date compared to the Nasdaq-100 which is down by over 4%. There’s a good chance these stocks could continue to outperform in 2021, as rising bond yields take some sheen off higher growth names with investors potentially rotating into value stocks. For perspective, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen from around 1.1% to 1.6% in just about a month. Now, value tech stocks might hit the sweet spot in this market as they trade at reasonable valuations while playing on the broader Covid-19 theme of greater digitization and higher corporate IT spends. Moreover, most of the names in our theme are mature tech companies that are incumbents in their respective segments. Within our theme, Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) has been the strongest performer, rising by about 20% year-to-date driven by strong semiconductor demand and some top management changes. On the other side, Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) a company that develops and produces semiconductors and related technology has underperformed on account of mixed quarterly earnings, with its stock declining by about 13% year-to-date.
[2/22/2021] Will Tech’s Old Guard Beat The Market In 2021?
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks has underperformed the market in recent years, rising by just about 29% since the end of 2017, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 46% over the same period. The theme includes tech companies that offer essential technology products and services, have a market capitalization of over $10 billion, and trade at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x. In comparison, the broader NASDAQ index trades at a much higher 40x trailing P/E. However, we believe that the stocks in our theme have lower price risk in the current market environment, and at the same time could offer reasonable upside from increasing digitization and higher corporate IT spends following Covid-19. Below is a bit more about the stocks in the theme and some trends that could help to drive them higher in the near-term.
Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has been the best performer within our theme this year so far, rising by about 26% since early January, driven by stronger than expected Q4 results and guidance for the current quarter, and also due to the appointment of new CEO Pat Gelsinger. Moreover, demand for semiconductors has been strong across the board, with many end-markets facing chip shortages. Intel, with its sizable production capacity, should stand to gain.
Cisco stock (NASDAQ:CSCO)  is up by about 2% year-to-date. The company has been witnessing weaker demand for its networking gear as the Covid-19 pandemic caused customers to postpone deployments and also due to stronger competition. However, IT spending is expected to rebound sharply as the pandemic wanes and Cisco should be well poised to benefit. Additionally, Cisco’s pivot to a more software-centric model should also help the stock.
Oracle stock (NYSE:ORCL) stock is down by about -5.5% year-to-date. Although revenues have faced pressure in recent years as the hardware and services segments have taken a hit, the company’s cloud operations, particularly its public cloud business, could unlock a lot of value. During its most recent quarter, the company said that revenue from its Gen 2 cloud was up over 100% year-over-year. As the public cloud business continues to gain scale and the company provides more transparency, investors could potentially re-rate the stock higher.
[Updated 1/20/2021] Value Tech Stocks 
Our indicative theme of Value Tech Stocks includes relatively mature businesses that offer essential technology products and services and trade at reasonable valuations. Specifically, we have picked tech companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. Although these stocks haven’t really rallied since our last update in November, with the Covid-19 vaccines roll out gathering steam globally, it’s likely only a matter of time before broader economic growth returns, helping value stocks, including reasonably priced technology names. Here’s a quick rundown of some value stocks in our Value tech stocks theme.
Intel (INTC) has been out of favor with investors due to increasing preference for lower-cost ARM-based chipsets and a delay in its rollout of its next-generation 7nm CPUs. However, the stock is up by about 16% year-to-date, as investors have a favorable view of Intel’s recently announced top management shakeup, which will see VMware CEO and former Intel CTO Pat Gelsinger succeed current Intel CEO, Bob Swan.
Cisco (CSCO) stock has also been listless as corporations paired back on spending on networking gear through the Covid-19 recession. However, IT spending is likely to rebound sharply over 2021 and Cisco being the go-to company for enterprise networking solutions should benefit. The company’s gradual pivoting to a more software-driven model should also help the stock. The stock is up by about 1.5% this year.
Oracle (ORCL) is a provider of database, cloud, and enterprise software products. The stock has seen steady growth over the last several years, driven by expanding earnings and its share repurchase program. The company has been expanding sales of its cloud-based applications, such as Fusion and enterprise resourcing planning services, helping to offset the slow growth of its legacy offerings. The stock is down by about -4.5% this year.
NetApp (NTAP) is a company that sells hardware and software focused on data management. While the company has seen a mixed performance in recent quarters, due to weak demand from large customers and its significant reliance on hardware sales, its increasing focus on the cloud computing market should help the stock. The stock is down 2.5% year to date.
[ Updated 11/24/2020] Is it A Good Time To Double Down On Value Tech Stocks?
Value Tech Stocks such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have had a mixed year. There was good reason for this, as the deep Covid-19 recession, abundant liquidity following interest rate cuts, and the growing at-home economy drove investors to hyper-growth software as service stocks, high-risk, high reward sectors such as electric vehicles, and fast-growing platform players such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
However, with the availability of multiple highly effective Covid-19 vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca have published strong efficacy data on their vaccines) looking likely in 2021, things are likely to gradually start returning to normal. Moreover, the Fed could also eventually revisit its stance on ultra-low interest rates as the economy shows signs of picking up.  As this plays out investors could re-visit lower growth stocks that represent compelling value. While positive news about the vaccine earlier this month has already buoyed cyclical sectors such as energy, industrials, and financials we think it’s likely that funds will flow to value tech stocks in the near-to-medium term.
Our indicative theme of Value Tech Stocks includes relatively mature businesses that offer essential technology products and services and trade at reasonable valuations. Specifically, we have picked companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 18x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. Key names in the theme include Oracle (ORCL) , VMware Inc (VMW), Seagate Technology (STX), Cisco (CSCO), and Intel (INTC).
[Updated 11/10/2020] Can Intel Stock Recover?
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has had a rough year, driven by delays in the company’s transition to the next generation 7-nano meter technology for its chips, some recent headwinds at its cloud and data center business, and strong competition from rival AMD in the PC and server CPU space. The stock is down by about 25% this year, significantly underperforming the NASDAQ which is up by over 28%. That said, there have been some positive developments that could help the company get back on track. In October, Intel announced a deal to sell its NAND business to SK Hynix for about $9 billion in a move that could allow the company to focus on its core CPU business, while bolstering its liquidity. Intel also appears to be more flexible with its manufacturing, recently noting that it could produce its next-gen chips in-house, or outsource them, or even use a hybrid model that leverages both internal and external fabs. Intel stock looks like good value at the moment, trading at just about 9.5x projected 2020 earnings. While growth could remain tepid in the near-term, Intel’s scale, its vast marketing and distribution footprint, and its large base of corporate customers, who rely on Intel processors and are likely averse to switching, should help the company in the medium to long-term.
See our indicative theme on Value Tech Stocks for a complete list of technology companies – including Intel, NetApp, and Oracle – that look like good value at the moment. The theme has underperformed this year, remaining roughly flat year-to-date, versus the S&P 500 which is up by about 10%.
[Updated 9/3/2020] Value Tech Stocks
While high-growth information technology stocks have rallied sharply this year, with valuations looking increasingly stretched, we’ve picked a few stocks including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) that have relatively stable and mature businesses and still offer good value. Specifically, we have picked companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 18x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. See our analysis Value Tech Stocks for more details on the returns and performance of these stocks. Parts of the analysis are summarized below.
Intel ($215 billion market cap, -15% YTD), the largest CPU vendor has been somewhat out of favor with investors on account of increasing competition from lower-cost ARM-based chipsets and the company’s delay in its rollout of its next-generation 7nm CPUs. However, Intel looks like good value considering its large base of existing customers, who rely on Intel processors and are likely averse to switch and also due to its vast marketing and distribution footprint. The stock trades at about 11x 2019 earnings.
Cisco ($178 billion market cap, -10% YTD), one of the largest network equipment providers, has also underperformed the market as it has struggled with top-line and bottom-line growth. However, the increasing digitization caused by the Covid-19 pandemic could drive demand for connectivity, in turn improving sales of Cisco’s networking software, and products such as switches and routers. The stock trades at about 16x FY’19 earnings.
NetApp ($10 billion market cap, -25% YTD) is a company that sells hardware and software focused on data management. While the company has seen a mixed performance this year due to weak demand from large customers and its significant reliance on hardware sales, it is looking to double down on the cloud computing market. Last month, NetApp closed a deal to acquire Spot, a leader in computing management, and cost optimization for public clouds. The stock currently trades at about 13x last fiscal year earnings.

2022-01-04 00:00:00+00:00,Tesla criticised for opening showroom in China's Xinjiang region,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tesla-criticised-for-opening-showroom-in-chinas-xinjiang-region,,,"SHANGHAI, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Tesla's TSLA.O announcement that it has opened a showroom in Xinjiang has attracted criticism from U.S. rights and trade groups, making it the latest foreign firm caught up in tensions related to the far-western Chinese region.
Xinjiang has become a significant point of conflict between Western governments and China in recent years, as U.N. experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in camps there.
China has rejected accusations of forced labour or any other abuses there, saying that the camps provide vocational training and that companies should respect its policies there.
The U.S. electric car maker announced the showroom's opening in Xinjiang's regional capital, Urumqi, on its official Weibo account last Friday. ""On the last day of 2021 we meet in Xinjiang,"" it said in the post.
On Tuesday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the largest U.S. Muslim advocacy organization, criticised the move, saying that Tesla was ""supporting genocide"".
The United States has labelled China’s treatment of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang as genocide. The United States and a few other countries plan a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February over the issue.
""Elon Musk must close Tesla’s Xinjiang showroom,"" Council on American-Islamic Relations said on its official Twitter account, referring to Tesla's founder.
Similar criticism came from a U.S. trade group, the Alliance for American Manufacturing, and U.S. senator Marco Rubio.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The carmaker operates a factory in Shanghai and is ramping up production there amid surging sales in China.
A slew of foreign firms in recent months have been tripped up by tensions between the West and China over Xinjiang, as they try to balance Western pressure with China's importance as a market and supply base.
In July, Swedish fashion retailer H&M HMb.ST reported a 23% drop in local currency sales in China for its March-May quarter after it was hit by a consumer boycott in March for stating publicly that it did not source products from Xinjiang.
Last month, U.S. chipmaker Intel INTC.Ofaced similar calls after telling its suppliers not to source products or labour from Xinjiang, prompting it to apologise for ""the trouble caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners and the public"".
Although some have been trying to reduce their supply chain exposure to the region, especially as Washington bans imports such as Xinjiang cotton or blacklists Chinese companies that it says have aided Beijing's policy there, many foreign brands operate stores there.

2022-01-04 00:00:00+00:00,Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Turnaround Story is Depending on Successful Expansions,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-nasdaq%3Aintc-turnaround-story-is-depending-on-successful-expansions,,,"By Stjepan Kalinic
This article first appeared on Simply Wall St News.
After an underwhelming year, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has more optimistic plans for 2022. There will be plenty of catalysts between significant capital investments and a corporate spinoff.
However, the CEO expects the chip shortages to last until 2023 and the corporate turnaround to take 5 years.
Check out our latest analysis for Intel
Latest Developments
Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has been in the role for less than a year, but he has taken significant steps in the corporate turnaround, planning over US$100b of investments in new chip plants.
Among the ambitious plan is a US$9b worth investment in an advanced semiconductor packaging plant in Italy. The investment planned for 10 years should help the company get a stronger foothold in Europe. Other expansions include France (research and design) and Germany (likely the main fabrication plant). Furthermore, there will be a US$7b investment in Malaysia, where the company hopes to add 4,000 jobs in a new packaging and testing facility.
The ultimate goal is to avoid further semiconductor shortages, which Mr.Gelsinger assumes would last at least another year.
Yet, expansions are not cheap, and this is where Intel plans to bank on taking the Mobileye public. A US$15b investment in Mobileye has reached triple value, and it seems only to be growing as the company partnered up with the startup Udelv, whose transporter vehicle is designed to carry up to 2,000 lbs of goods with an autonomy between 160 and 300 miles.
Estimating the Intrinsic Value of Intel Corporation
Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is reasonably priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some questions about this type of valuation, look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.
Step by step through the calculation
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally, the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is lower. In the first stage, we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible, we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available, we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.
We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than in later years.
Generally, we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate
2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031
Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.11b US$4.32b US$15.6b US$17.7b US$19.2b US$20.4b US$21.5b US$22.4b US$23.2b US$23.9b
Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x10 Analyst x7 Analyst x1 Analyst x2 Est @ 8.5% Est @ 6.54% Est @ 5.16% Est @ 4.2% Est @ 3.53% Est @ 3.06%
Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$5.7k US$3.8k US$12.6k US$13.3k US$13.5k US$13.4k US$13.1k US$12.7k US$12.3k US$11.8k
(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$112b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value; this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at the cost of equity of 7.3%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2031 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$24b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.0%) = US$453b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$453b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$223b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$335b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding.
Compared to the current share price of US$53.2, the company appears quite good value at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, do keep this in mind.
NasdaqGS: INTC Discounted Cash Flow January 4th, 2022
The assumptions
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and, of course, the actual cash flows.
Furthermore, DCF does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a complete picture of its potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intel as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate rather than the cost of capital (or the weighted average cost of capital, WACC), which accounts for debt. We've used 7.3% in this calculation, which is based on a levered beta of 1.230. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility compared to the market as a whole.
Next Steps:
Intel seems to be undervalued at the moment, still keeping on the border of the single-digit price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. However, much of the turnaround story depends on trust in its leadership. Although less than a year on the job, the new CEO is making big moves - using the firm's assets, thematic opportunities, and favorable government policies.
Yet, valuation is only one side of the coin in building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the only piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

2022-01-04 00:00:00+00:00,Tesla criticised for opening showroom in China's Xinjiang region,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tesla-criticised-for-opening-showroom-in-chinas-xinjiang-region-0,,,"Updates to show pictures available for media subscribers
SHANGHAI, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Tesla's TSLA.O announcement that it has opened a showroom in Xinjiang has attracted criticism from U.S. rights and trade groups, making it the latest foreign firm caught up in tensions related to the far-western Chinese region.
Xinjiang has become a significant point of conflict between Western governments and China in recent years, as U.N. experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in camps there.
China has rejected accusations of forced labour or any other abuses there, saying that the camps provide vocational training and that companies should respect its policies there.
The U.S. electric car maker announced the showroom's opening in Xinjiang's regional capital, Urumqi, on its official Weibo account last Friday. ""On the last day of 2021 we meet in Xinjiang,"" it said in the post.
On Tuesday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the largest U.S. Muslim advocacy organization, criticised the move, saying that Tesla was ""supporting genocide"".
The United States has labelled China’s treatment of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang as genocide. The United States and a few other countries plan a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February over the issue.
""Elon Musk must close Tesla’s Xinjiang showroom,"" Council on American-Islamic Relations said on its official Twitter account, referring to Tesla's founder.
Similar criticism came from a U.S. trade group, the Alliance for American Manufacturing, and U.S. senator Marco Rubio.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The carmaker operates a factory in Shanghai and is ramping up production there amid surging sales in China.
A slew of foreign firms in recent months have been tripped up by tensions between the West and China over Xinjiang, as they try to balance Western pressure with China's importance as a market and supply base.
In July, Swedish fashion retailer H&M HMb.ST reported a 23% drop in local currency sales in China for its March-May quarter after it was hit by a consumer boycott in March for stating publicly that it did not source products from Xinjiang.
Last month, U.S. chipmaker Intel INTC.Ofaced similar calls after telling its suppliers not to source products or labour from Xinjiang, prompting it to apologise for ""the trouble caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners and the public"".
Although some have been trying to reduce their supply chain exposure to the region, especially as Washington bans imports such as Xinjiang cotton or blacklists Chinese companies that it says have aided Beijing's policy there, many foreign brands operate stores there.

2022-01-04 00:00:00+00:00,Meet the 2022 Dogs of the Dow,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/meet-the-2022-dogs-of-the-dow,,,"Many investors are struggling to get income from their investment portfolios right now. Yields on bonds and bank CDs are still at rock-bottom levels, and that's forcing plenty of people into the stock market. Yet even many dividend-paying stocks don't offer the yields that investors want to see, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) offering an average of just 2.2%.
There's one strategy, though, that looks to capture the opportunities available in blue-chip dividend stocks . The Dogs of the Dow framework is a simple way to get higher dividend yields from your portfolio. It doesn't always outperform the average -- indeed, it underperformed in 2021 -- but it has a solid long-term track record that appeals to many income investors. Below, you'll see the 10 stocks that make up the Dogs of the Dow for 2022.

How the Dogs work
Few strategies are easier than the Dogs of the Dow in terms of implementation. On the last trading day of the year, you take the dividend yields of all 30 Dow stocks. From there, put the stocks in order and take the 10 highest-yielding ones. Then, buy equal dollar amounts of all 10 stocks and keep them in your portfolio throughout the following year. That's all you have to do until the end of the following year, when you repeat the process.
Over the course of 2021, there wasn't much change in the stocks that pay the best dividends in the Dow. As a result, although the order of the stocks was different, there was only one replacement, as Intel took the place of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO).
Image source: Getty Images.
A second chance for the Dogs in 2022?
The Dogs of the Dow strategy works best when the market focuses on value investing principles. Because most Dow stocks have stable dividends, they tend to move toward the top of the Dogs list when some short-term event causes their share prices to fall. If that's merely a short-term issue, then the stock often rises over the course of the year, outperforming the broader average and then making way for a new hard-hit stock to take its place.
You could see this dynamic play out with Cisco, Chevron, and Walgreens. Despite supply chain issues, Cisco benefited from strong demand for network equipment, and it sees growth picking back up in the near future. Rising oil prices during 2021 helped Chevron rise, while Walgreens bounced back from adversity to benefit from people needing health services.
However, other stocks failed to deliver. Verizon was the poorest performer in the Dow, as investors foresaw slowing growth despite the ongoing rollout of 5G technology. Losses for Merck and Amgen showed the have vs. have-not dynamic going on in healthcare, and tepid performances from most of the other 2021 Dogs of the Dow led the strategy to underperformance of roughly eight percentage points.
Will the fourth time be the charm in 2022?
2021's underperformance marked the third straight year of the Dogs losing to the broader Dow. Again, that largely reflects investors' distaste for value investing in favor of stocks with higher potential for fast growth.
These cycles aren't unprecedented, though, and in the past, they've often led to future outperformance from the Dogs. Given the heightened uncertainty in the markets lately, the more defensive names that often make the Dogs list could well finally start to stand out in 2022.
The average yield for the 2022 Dogs of the Dow is 3.9%, and while that's hardly a huge amount of income, it's better than you'll find from the majority of stocks in the market today. Income investors should consider whether the Dogs of the Dow could be the answer they've looked for in order to generate more cash from their investments.

The major indexes all closed out Monday with gains (including fresh closing highs for the Dow and S&P 500) and Wall Street crowned its first $3 trillion-dollar company (albeit briefly).
About the latter: Apple (AAPL) – which became the first company to reach $1 trillion in market capitalization in 2018, then two years later staked the first flag into the $2 trillion mark – momentarily peeked its head above $3 trillion in Monday's session on the back of another bullish note from Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.

""The Street is starting to better appreciate the robust fundamental story for Cook & Co. over the next year,"" says Ives, who believes high demand will bolster the company's March and June quarters. ""Hitting $3 trillion will be another watershed moment for Apple as the company continues to prove the doubters wrong with the renaissance of growth story playing out in Cupertino.""
Ives adds that iPhone 13 checks continue to be ""much stronger than expected,"" and that the company believes AAPL sold more than 40 million iPhones during the holiday season, which would mark a record for Apple despite facing chip shortages.
AAPL closed just below the $3 trillion mark, but its 2.5% gain nonetheless helped to lift the major indexes into the green.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average improved by 0.7% to set a new record close of 36,585, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.6% to hit a record-high 4,796. The Nasdaq Composite was the biggest advancer, however, up 1.2% to 15,832. The small-cap Russell 2000 mimicked its larger brethren, climbing 1.2% to 2,272 to kick off the new year.

U.S. crude oil futures enjoyed a nice 1.2% improvement to settle at $76.08 per barrel. That helped energy finish among the market's top sectors, with gains coming from the likes of Schlumberger (SLB, +5.9%) and Exxon Mobil (XOM, +3.8%).
Gold futures did not participate in the market's larger gains, sliding 1.6% to a two-week low of $1,800.10 per ounce.
Bitcoin marginally improved since New Year's Eve, to $45,910.34. (Bitcoin trades 24 hours a day; prices reported here are as of 4 p.m.)
Tesla (TSLA) was one of the major drivers of the Nasdaq, up 13.5% to start the new year. The company announced over the weekend that it delivered 308,600 vehicles during the fourth quarter of 2021, beating expectations for 267,000. More over, its full-year tally of 936,172 deliveries (up 87% year-over-year) topped estimates for 897,000.
What Does 2022 Have in Store for Tech?
Apple wasn't the only sector winner in what was a productive day for technology shares. Chipmakers Intel (INTC, +3.3%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, +4.4%), as well as fintech firm Fiserv (FISV, +3.7%), were among other stocks moving the needle Monday.

Viatris (NASDAQ: VTRS) $16 billion 3.23%
Data sources: Yahoo! Finance and company investor presentations. *Includes fixed+variable dividend.
Healthcare
You might have noticed there are more stocks from healthcare than any other sector. That's primarily because many healthcare stocks offer steady dividends and often provide solid growth prospects as well.
Three healthcare stocks boast especially impressive dividend track records. Abbott Labs and Johnson & Johnson are Dividend Kings -- S&P 500 members with at least 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. AbbVie is likely to join the club in 2022.
Eli Lilly and Pfizer could be attractive to growth investors. Lilly has multiple catalysts on the way in the new year. Pfizer handily outperformed the broader market in 2021 and could do so again in 2022 with strong sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and pill.
Value investors might like the other healthcare picks. CVS Health's shares trade at only 12 times expected earnings. Bristol Myers Squibb is even cheaper with a forward earnings multiple of a little over seven. And Viatris is dirt cheap, with its shares trading at less than 3.4 times expected earnings.
Energy
Companies in the energy sector are also often known for their dividends. Devon Energy certainly stands out with its fixed-plus-variable dividend of more than 9%. That's more than seven times higher than the S&P 500 average dividend yield.
Midstream energy leader Enterprise Products Partners isn't too far behind Devon, though, with a dividend yield of 8.33%. While the shift away from fossil fuels could impact these companies' businesses over the long term, their prospects over the next several years look bright.
That shift will work to the benefit of Brookfield Renewable. The company has two stocks on our list. It was originally formed as a limited partnership (LP), Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP). In 2020, the company created Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC) for investors who wanted to avoid the tax hassles associated with LPs.
Duke Energy isn't likely to deliver sizzling growth. However, income investors should be able to depend on the utility company's steady dividend. Duke has paid a dividend uninterrupted for 95 consecutive years.
REITs
Three of the top dividend stocks for 2022 are real estate investment trusts (REITs). They're required to return at least 90% of taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends.
Medical Properties Trust is a REIT that focuses, as its name indicates, on medical properties -- primarily acute care hospitals. Its dividend yield of 4.86% is especially attractive. The company has increased its dividend payout for eight consecutive years.
Easterly Government Properties arguably ranks as one of the safest dividend stocks on the market. It specializes in leasing properties to the U.S. government.
Meanwhile, Innovative Industrial Properties is one of the fastest-growing REIT stocks. The company leases properties to regulated cannabis operators in the U.S. Its shares have skyrocketed nearly 1,300% over the past five years. IIP's dividend payout increased by 10 times during this period.
Technology and telecommunications
Intel underperformed the overall market in 2021. However, investors should focus more on where the chipmaker will be in 10 years or more than how its stock fared in one 12-month period. Intel's future should be better than its immediate past. More importantly for income investors, the company's dividend should be safe.
Likewise, Verizon was one of the worst-performing Dow Jones stocks in 2021. However, investors should love the telecom giant's juicy dividend. With the increased adoption of 5G networks, Verizon should have solid prospects over the coming years.
Other
Rounding out the list of top dividend stocks for 2022 are Air Products & Chemicals, Brookfield Infrastructure, and PepsiCo. As was the case with Brookfield Renewable, Brookfield Infrastructure has two stocks -- one an LP (BIP) and the other a corporation (BIPC). There's only one underlying business, though. And that business is rock-solid thanks to steady cash flow from a wide variety of infrastructure assets.
Like some of the other stocks in the top 22, Air Products & Chemicals probably won't deliver jaw-dropping gains. However, it's a Dividend Aristocrat with 39 consecutive years of dividend hikes. You should be able to count on those dividends continuing to flow and grow in 2022.
PepsiCo is also a Dividend Aristocrat and will likely become a Dividend King in the new year. With its strong product lineup and dividend, PepsiCo is arguably one of the best consumer staples stocks to buy right now.

2022-12-29 00:00:00+00:00,February 2023 Options Now Available For Marvell Technology (MRVL),MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/february-2023-options-now-available-for-marvell-technology-mrvl,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options begin trading today, for the February 2023 expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new February 2023 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $36.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.32. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $36.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $33.68 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $36.80/share today.
Because the $36.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.44% return on the cash commitment, or 54.70% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $36.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $37.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.47. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $36.80/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $37.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.26% if the stock gets called away at the February 2023 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $37.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $37.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.71% boost of extra return to the investor, or 56.97% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $36.80) to be 63%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-12-29 00:00:00+00:00,"Marvell Technology, Inc. (MRVL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/marvell-technology-inc.-mrvl-is-a-trending-stock%3A-facts-to-know-before-betting-on-it,,,"Marvell Technology (MRVL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -24%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Technology Services industry, which Marvell falls in, has lost 4.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Marvell is expected to post earnings of $0.46 per share, indicating a change of -8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -32% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $2.12 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +35%. This estimate has changed -9.1% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.01 indicates a change of -5.2% from what Marvell is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -23.6%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Marvell is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Marvell, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.4 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $5.9 billion and $6.02 billion estimates indicate +32.2% and +2% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Marvell reported revenues of $1.54 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +26.9%. EPS of $0.57 for the same period compares with $0.43 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.33%. The EPS surprise was -3.39%.
Over the last four quarters, Marvell surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Marvell is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marvell. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.
