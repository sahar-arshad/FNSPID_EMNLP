2022-02-28 00:00:00+00:00,Wall Street Analysts Predict a 39% Upside in Marvell (MRVL): Here's What You Should Know,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-street-analysts-predict-a-39-upside-in-marvell-mrvl%3A-heres-what-you-should-know,,,"Shares of Marvell Technology (MRVL) have gained 3.7% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $68.75, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $95.81 indicates a potential upside of 39.4%.
The mean estimate comprises 21 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $16.44. While the lowest estimate of $52 indicates a 24.4% decline from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 74.6% to reach $120. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.
While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.
However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in MRVL. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.
Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets
According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.
While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?
They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.
However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.
That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.
Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in MRVL
There has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.6%, as one estimate has moved higher compared to no negative revision.
Moreover, MRVL currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term.

Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much MRVL could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.

2022-02-28 00:00:00+00:00,Here's How Investors Can Find Strong Business Services Stocks with the Zacks ESP Screener,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-how-investors-can-find-strong-business-services-stocks-with-the-zacks-esp-screener-2,,,"Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.
The earnings figure itself is key, of course, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb and vice versa.
The ability to identify stocks that are likely to top quarterly earnings expectations can be profitable, but it's no simple task. Here at Zacks, our Earnings ESP filter helps make things easier.
The Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained
The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information.
Now that we understand the basic idea, let's look at how the Expected Surprise Prediction works. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.
Bringing together a positive earnings ESP alongside a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better has helped stocks report a positive earnings surprise 70% of the time. Furthermore, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
Stocks with a #3 (Hold) ranking, which is most stocks covered at 60%, are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. But stocks that fall into the #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy) ranking, or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market. Strong Buy stocks should outperform more than any other rank.
Should You Consider Marvell Technology?
Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Marvell Technology (MRVL) earns a #2 (Buy) right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.49 a share, just three days from its upcoming earnings release on March 3, 2022.
By taking the percentage difference between the $0.49 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.48 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Marvell Technology has an Earnings ESP of 1.76%. Investors should also know that MRVL is just one of a large group of stocks with positive ESPs. All of these qualifying stocks can be filtered by ESP, Zacks Rank, % Surprise (Last Qtr.), and Reporting date.
Using the Zacks Earnings ESP to your advantage is just the start. Make sure to check out the Earnings ESP Home Page for even more earnings-related tips and tricks to design a winning investment portfolio.

2022-02-25 00:00:00+00:00,Should iShares Morningstar MidCap Growth ETF (IMCG) Be on Your Investing Radar?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-ishares-morningstar-midcap-growth-etf-imcg-be-on-your-investing-radar-0,,,"The iShares Morningstar MidCap Growth ETF (IMCG) was launched on 06/28/2004, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Mid Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.
The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $1.16 billion, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.
Why Mid Cap Growth
Compared to large and small cap companies, mid cap businesses tend to have higher growth prospects and are less volatile, respectively, with market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.
Qualities of growth stocks include faster growth rates compared to the broader market, as well as higher valuations and higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. Something to keep in mind is the higher level of volatility that is affiliated with growth stocks. Even though growth stocks are more likely to outperform their value counterparts in strong bull markets, value stocks have a record of delivering better returns in almost all markets than growth stocks.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.06%, making it the least expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.49%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
ETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 30.90% of the portfolio. Industrials and Healthcare round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Dexcom Inc (DXCM) accounts for about 1.25% of total assets, followed by Airbnb Inc Class A (ABNB) and Marvell Technology Inc (MRVL).
The top 10 holdings account for about 7.61% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
IMCG seeks to match the performance of the MORNINGSTAR US MID CAP BROAD GROWTH INDX before fees and expenses. The Morningstar US Mid Cap Broad Growth Index comprises of mid-capitalization U.S. equities that exhibit growth characteristics.
The ETF has lost about -14.11% so far this year and is down about -5.63% in the last one year (as of 02/25/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $59.71 and $76.33.
The ETF has a beta of 1.08 and standard deviation of 24.92% for the trailing three-year period. With about 375 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
IShares Morningstar MidCap Growth ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, IMCG is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Growth segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.
The Vanguard MidCap Growth ETF (VOT) and the iShares Russell MidCap Growth ETF (IWP) track a similar index. While Vanguard MidCap Growth ETF has $10.70 billion in assets, iShares Russell MidCap Growth ETF has $13.33 billion. VOT has an expense ratio of 0.07% and IWP charges 0.23%.
Bottom-Line
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.

2022-02-16 00:00:00+00:00,7 Stocks Wall Street Says Are Strong Buys Right Now,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-wall-street-says-are-strong-buys-right-now,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
One of the primary rules for investors is to “buy low and sell high.” And in order to commit to this rule, one needs to build a profitable portfolio. That said, finding the right stock for one’s portfolio can be difficult, especially for new investors. In these circumstances, an investor can always look to Wall Street analysts as a source of wisdom for strong buys.
Now, some suggest that Wall Street analysts generally follow the momentum in the stock markets. In other words, these analyst ratings can be lagging indicators that should be ignored. I think that’s an overly-simplistic view; Though, there is some truth to that.
Stock analysts on Wall Street use their expertise to provide stock ratings, reviews and predictions. With this, they recommend and rate certain stocks as “strong buys.” Generally speaking, stock upgrades or downgrades can drive a particular company’s valuation in one direction or another because of the power these reports wield. Of late, many analyst revisions have been to the downside. Cynics might say that’s because the overall sentiment in the market is bearish right now, and to me, that’s fair enough.
7 Housing Stocks To Sell if You Think the Boom Is Going To Bust
However, there remains a strong stable of companies that Wall Street analysts agree are “strong buys.” Therefore, let’s take a look at seven of the top companies I think are worthy of consideration right now.
Nio (NYSE:NIO)
Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI)
XPeng (NYSE:XPEV)
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)
Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ:MRVL)
OneMain Holdings (NYSE:OMF)
CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD)
With all of that in mind, let’s dive in and analyze each one.
Strong Buys Right Now: Nio (NIO)
Source: Andy Feng/Shutterstock.com
The first of a handful of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) stocks on this list is Nio. A leading pure-play EV stock, Nio is a company that ebbed and flowed in epic fashion last year. Hitting a high of nearly $67 per share during last January’s bull rally in spec tech, NIO stock has since fallen to the $25.40 level.
This epic decline of approximately 60% from its peak certainly doesn’t point in the right direction. However, Wall Street remains bullish on this company. In fact, the average investor target price is 129% higher than its current price. Now, that’s a bullish take from Wall Street.
Much of this bullish enthusiasm among investors is related to the company’s fundamentals. Nio doubled its sales in its recent earnings report, growing its market share relative to its peers. As the EV market continues to grow in China, and the middle class transitions to EVs, this company has an incredible future ahead of it. While not yet profitable, analysts see profitability on the horizon — making this company a potential cash flow machine in just a few years.
Li Auto (LI)

Yet another Chinese EV manufacturer, Li Auto is a company Wall Street shares a similar view of. This company is making headway, like its peers, in the Chinese EV market. During the company’s most recent quarterly earnings report, Li reported more than 25,000 deliveries of its Li ONE model, representing 190% year-over-year (YOY) growth.
Those are certainly some impressive growth numbers.
Now, also like its peers, Li is not yet profitable. That said, the company’s current loss is negligible, leading many analysts to think that profitability could be on the menu for 2022. If that’s the case, Li could shoot higher in value, leading to some very strong target price predictions for this stock.
7 Defensive Growth Stocks to Buy for February
Continuing its robust demand trajectory, Li Auto delivered 12,268 Li ONEs last month, witnessing a 128.1% increase YOY. Upon announcing this impressive number, LI stock’s price jumped 10% and is currently trading at just below $30 per share. However, the company’s valuation multiple remains below many of its peers, leading to expectations this stock could be in for growth, should bullish sentiment return to the market.
Strong Buys Right Now: XPeng (XPEV)

The third Chinese EV stock on my list here is XPeng. Like Nio and Li, XPEV stock has also been hit hard in 2021, particularly in the first half of the year. However, this decline has little to do with the company’s financial performance. Accordingly, Wall Street remains very bullish on this stock, as I am.
The company’s average target price is now about 45% higher than its current price. As a high-growth EV stock based in China, expectations are that this company’s results in future quarters could be even better than what the company has reported thus far. And those numbers are staggering.
Moreover, XPeng offers three models: the P7 sports sedan, P5 family sedan, and G3 SUV. In 2021, it delivered 98,155 vehicles, which was 263% above its 2020 numbers. Last month, it fulfilled demands for 12,922 EVs, beating both Li Auto and Nio.
The reason to remain bullish about its upward momentum is XPeng’s expansion into the international market. In 2022, it will start selling these three models and a new G9 SUV in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark. Given its brilliant quarterly performance, the company’s revenue could reach $6.06 billion by the end of this year.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Despite a massive chip shortage in the market, Nvidia was one of the best-performing stocks in 2021. It grew almost 125% and is currently trading at a reasonable value of $263 per share. However, NVDA stock has been on quite a downtrend since its November peak. Currently, investors can pick up shares of this world-class chip manufacturer at a 20% discount from its peak.
That said, Wall Street considers this stock a strong buy because this recent dip is the growth opportunity that Nvidia needs. This company is a pioneer in manufacturing graphics processing units (GPUs) for fast-growing industries like gaming, data centers, artificial intelligence and EVs.
Following this correction, it’s expected NVDA stock could go as high as $400 per share in 2022. Interestingly, part of its upside potential is aligned with Nio, as Nvidia is going to supply the chips for Nio’s ET7 Sedan model. Furthermore, this company is vital for the growth of the metaverse industry as it provides the basic infrastructure.

Nvidia launched its Omniverse software on Jan. 4, which has already become its fastest-growing component. It can charge as much as $1,000 from its users to access this metaverse platform. Thus, based on the success of metaverse, investors can expect huge returns from Nvidia in 2022.
Strong Buys Right Now: Marvell Technology Group (MRVL)

Another chipmaker on this list is Marvell Technology, which is also presenting a great “buy the dip” opportunity. In the past month, MRVL has fallen 13.3% and remains one of the strong buys on this list because of its correction timing.
This Delaware-based semiconductor company has an impressive portfolio of products. It manufactures chips for data centers, wireless and automotive industries. In 2021, Marvell benefited from the increasing demand for its storage and networking chips in these industries.
As per its recent Q3 report, this company saw 61% YOY growth in net revenue, reaching $1.2 billion. Revenue from its data center segment rose 109% YOY, and earnings per share (EPS) grew 72% YOY to 43 cents. Moreover, Marvell Technology anticipates net revenue of $1.32 billion in the fourth quarter of FY2022.
Indeed, Marvell isn’t as popular among investors as Nvidia or AMD. However, it has the potential to be very competitive in the coming years. Furthermore, this company’s revenue growth is likely to be driven by new products resulting in market share gain. Right now, this is a stock I tend to agree with Wall Street on.
OneMain Holdings (OMF)

In times of high market volatility, dividend stocks offer the best investment opportunity. With a consistent dividend payout, dividend stocks attract numerous risk-averse investors. Among such stocks is OneMain Holdings, a dividend aristocrat.
This Indiana-based company is America’s largest personal installment loan company. It caters to 2.2 million customers who have poor credit scores, and thus, face difficulty in attaining a loan. Being part of such a unique market is what makes OneMain a highly profitable company.
So far this year, this financial services company has outperformed the broader market. In the financial year of 2021, OneMain reported a net income of $1.3 billion, which is way above 2020’s figure of $730 million.
This company also witnessed an increase in diluted EPS from $5.41 per share to $9.87 per share. Additionally, attracting more investors was a 36% rise in its quarterly dividend payout. Thus, it is now offering a whopping dividend yield of 7.3%.
7 Best Stocks to Buy to Protect Your Portfolio From the Possibility of 5+ Rate Hikes
Overall, OneMain’s stellar track record is the reason why Wall Street analysts believe that it is one of the top strong buys for investors.
Strong Buys Right Now: CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD)
Source: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com
Shares of cybersecurity technology company CrowdStrike are down almost 40% from its 52-week high, trading at $181. Fortunately, this is because of a broader market selloff and does not indicate poor performance by CrowdStrike.
Among all software-as-a-service (or SaaS) stocks, CRWD stock is at the top. With an increase in cybercrime, especially after the pandemic, CrowdStrike offers numerous versions of cloud-based cybersecurity services. Its products eliminate the need for on-site applications and offer protection for your identity and data.
As it provides an essential service with high quality, CrowdStrike has become the industry leader. In its recent quarter, this company witnessed a 63% increase in revenue, reaching $380.1 million. Additionally, it added 1,600 new customers to its portfolio. Thus, the company’s total customer count rose 75% YOY.
The cybersecurity industry is a high-margin industry, expected to grow at an annualized rate of 14.5% by 2026. CrowdStrike’s unique Falcon architecture is cheap and highly effective. With such a platform, this company can easily capture the cybersecurity market and double its revenue by 2023. Thus, it is not shocking that Wall Street analysts estimate a 51% upside in CRWD stock’s value.

2022-02-14 00:00:00+00:00,Analysts Predict 25% Upside For IVDG,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-predict-25-upside-for-ivdg,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Invesco Focused Discovery Growth ETF (Symbol: IVDG), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $14.48 per unit.
With IVDG trading at a recent price near $11.60 per unit, that means that analysts see 24.83% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of IVDG's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL), KKR & Co Inc (Symbol: KKR), and Globant SA (Symbol: GLOB). Although MRVL has traded at a recent price of $67.99/share, the average analyst target is 44.35% higher at $98.14/share. Similarly, KKR has 41.65% upside from the recent share price of $62.76 if the average analyst target price of $88.90/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting GLOB to reach a target price of $349.57/share, which is 40.16% above the recent price of $249.40. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MRVL, KKR, and GLOB:
Combined, MRVL, KKR, and GLOB represent 8.17% of the Invesco Focused Discovery Growth ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
Invesco Focused Discovery Growth ETF IVDG $11.60 $14.48 24.83%
Marvell Technology Inc MRVL $67.99 $98.14 44.35%
KKR & Co Inc KKR $62.76 $88.90 41.65%
Globant SA GLOB $249.40 $349.57 40.16%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2022-02-07 00:00:00+00:00,Failed deals illuminate chip M&A red lines,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/failed-deals-illuminate-chip-ma-red-lines,,,"Reuters
Reuters


HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Regulators have drawn red lines for chip deals. The failed cross-border takeovers of UK-based Arm and Germany's Siltronic, acquisitions worth $45 billion when they were first announced, says more about scarce technology than the prospects for industry consolidation.
    SoftBank's sale of Arm to Nvidia has been met with fierce opposition from the start. The British company, dubbed the Switzerland of semiconductors, licenses out critical designs to everyone from Qualcomm to China's Huawei, so fears that its new owner may restrict access to Arm's intellectual property look valid. In December, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block the deal, arguing that a takeover would hurt competition in chips used in self-driving cars and networking. Regulators in the EU and UK were also fretting about price increases and less choice and innovation.
     News of deal's collapse on Monday comes just days after Taiwan's GlobalWafers was forced to walk away from its planned $5 billion purchase of German group Siltronic after failing to secure Berlin's approval in time. The combination would have created the world's second largest maker of 300-millimetre silicon wafers - a vital building block for semiconductors. But a foreign buyout of Europe's only major wafer supplier would have made the continent even more dependent on Asian supply chains at a time of crippling chip and component shortages.
    Despite the two high-profile setbacks, industry consolidation still looks appealing. Even with chip prices soaring on the back of a global shortfall, making microprocessors is getting increasingly expensive and technologically harder: semiconductor capital spending was forecast to surge by more than a third to a whopping $152 billion in 2021, according to IC Insights. Larger and more diversified companies will be more competitive and scaling up through acquisitions may be less risky than adding to a potential future supply glut.
    Looking past the latest headlines, governments are mostly on board so long as the targets don't own critical technology. Officials greenlighted mega deals last year including Renesas Electronics' $6 billion swoop for Dialog Semiconductor and Marvell Technology's $10 billion purchase of Inphi. Last month, Chinese watchdogs approved AMD's blockbuster $35 billion acquisition of Xilinx. Humdrum mergers are still ticking along.

CONTEXT NEWS
- SoftBank Group's sale of Arm to U.S. chipmaker Nvidia has ""collapsed"", Reuters reported on Feb. 7, citing a source familiar with the matter.  
- The deal has faced several regulatory hurdles from the United States, the UK and the European Union. In December, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block the transaction.

News of deal's collapse on Monday comes just days after Taiwan's GlobalWafers was forced to walk away from its planned $5 billion purchase of German group Siltronic after failing to secure Berlin's approval in time. Even with chip prices soaring on the back of a global shortfall, making microprocessors is getting increasingly expensive and technologically harder: semiconductor capital spending was forecast to surge by more than a third to a whopping $152 billion in 2021, according to IC Insights.","The failed cross-border takeovers of UK-based Arm and Germany's Siltronic, acquisitions worth $45 billion when they were first announced, says more about scarce technology than the prospects for industry consolidation.

2022-02-07 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting MRVL Put And Call Options For July 15th,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-mrvl-put-and-call-options-for-july-15th,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available today, for the July 15th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 158 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new July 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $61.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $71.87/share today.
Because the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 11.86% return on the cash commitment, or 27.40% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $70.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $72.50 strike price has a current bid of $8.95. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $71.87/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $72.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.33% if the stock gets called away at the July 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $72.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $72.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 45%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 12.45% boost of extra return to the investor, or 28.78% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 53%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $71.87) to be 46%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-02-04 00:00:00+00:00,3 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks From a Top Analyst on Wall Street,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-strong-buy-stocks-from-a-top-analyst-on-wall-street,,,"Finding the right stock signals is a key to success in the market investment game – but knowing what signals to trust takes some learning. Finding the right signaler can shorten that learning curve – but how do you know who to trust?
Follow the data. Every professional stock analyst on Wall Street holds a published record of stock reviews, predictions, and actual results and returns – and the more accurate those are, the better the analyst’s reputation.
Right now, Quinn Bolton, of Needham, holds the number 3 spot out of 7,700+ analysts. His score rests on the 76% accuracy rate of his stock reviews, and the ~50% return brought in by the stocks he’s recommended this past year.
The best way to understand Bolton’s take on the market is to look at some of his recent stock reviews. We’ve done just that, using the TipRanks database to pull up details on three stocks that have gotten recent ‘Buy’ ratings from the top analyst – and that boast Strong Buy consensus ratings from the rest of the Street. Let’s take a closer look.
Marvell Technology Group (MRVL)
The first stock under Bolton's radar is Marvell, a $65 billion semiconductor chip company. Marvell produces a range of chip products, with a focus on data infrastructure solutions for computing, networking, security, and storage. In addition to data centers, Marvell’s chips have found use in the automotive and wireless industries, and the company saw $3 billion in annual revenue for fiscal year 2021.
For fiscal 2022, the company has already beaten that revenue total. In the fiscal 3Q22 report, released this past December, Marvell reported $1.21 billion at the top line, up 61% year-over-year. The company also saw non-GAAP income of 43 cents per share, and cash flow from operations of $265 million. The data center market segment led the way for Marvell’s growth, expanding 109% yoy and making up 41% of total revenue.
Quinn Bolton describes Marvell has one of his Top Picks for 2022. He sees the chip industry generally on the verge of a slowdown, but explains why Marvell should continue to thrive.
“Following three years of semiconductor industry expansion, we believe a deceleration in industry growth may broadly weigh on valuation multiples across the sector. With Marvell's growth driven by new products and market gains and with the vast majority of the company's revenue sole-sourced from the infrastructure markets, we believe Marvell's revenue should be better insulated than its peers from any period of semiconductor or cloud inventory digestion over the next couple of years. Coupled with its expected high growth across diverse segments, we believe investors will naturally gravitate to MRVL as it will stand out,” Bolton wrote.
Overall, Bolton believes this is a stock worth holding on to. The analyst rates MRVL shares a Buy, and his $115 price target suggests a solid upside potential of ~66%. (To watch Bolton’s track record, click here)
This large-cap chip maker has attracted plenty of attention from the Street – it has 24 recent reviews, including 22 Buys against just 2 Holds, and a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $69.79, and the $102.67 average price target indicates room for ~48% one-year upside. (See MRVL stock forecast on TipRanks)
MACOM Technology Solutions (MTSI)
The second Bolton pick we’re looking at is MACOM Technology, another player in the semiconductor chip industry. The company is the largest private employer in its hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts, and is a major contractor with the Federal Government. MACOM produces a wide range of microwave and millimeter wave band semiconductor components and devices for radio communications systems.
In its recent first quarter report for fiscal year 2022, MACOM showed a record year for revenue – the top line grew 7.4% year-over-year to reach $159.6 million. This was also the eighth quarter in a row to show a sequential revenue gain. Adjusted net income grew from 46 cents per share in the year-ago quarter to 64 cents in current report, a gain of 39%. Gross margins expanded from 54% in 1Q21 to 59% in 1Q22.
However, the company predicted Q2 revenue of $161 million to $165 million; that would be a modest yoy increase of 2.1%, lower than recent yoy growth numbers.
Bolton is unconcerned with the guidance. He notes that it is in-line with expectations, but also notes that the company has a recent history of exceeding those expectations. He writes of MACOM, “We believe the story remains intact and note management reiterated its expectation that revenue should grow at least 10% in FY22, led by the I&D and Telecom segments and a F2H recovery in DC. We remain encouraged by the company's new product ramps and see continued margin expansion ahead…”
In line with his comments, Bolton rates MTSI a Buy. His $90 price target suggests the stock has a 12-month upside of 56%.
Overall, MACOM’s Strong Buy consensus rating is supported by 9 reviews, which break down 7 to 2 in favor of Buy over Hold. The average price target here is $82.56, which implies an upside of 43% from the current $57.5 trading price. (See MTSI stock forecast on TipRanks)
Onto Innovation (ONTO)
Last on the list of Bolton picks is Onto Innovation, a manufacturer of process and process control equipment for the semiconductor industry. Simply put, Onto makes the text devices that chip makers require for product optimization and quality control. Onto, another Massachusetts-based firm, was formed in the fall of 2019 through the merger of Nanometrics and Rudolph Technology. Since then, the company’s top and bottom lines have both seen solid growth.
At the top line, Onto reported just over $200 million in total revenue for 3Q21 (the most recent released), a company record and the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Year-over-year, revenues grew 58%. Non-GAAP EPS more than doubled yoy, from 40 cents to 98 cents. Both revenue and earnings beat the forecasts, the top line by 2.5% and the bottom line by 6.5%.
In his coverage of Onto, Bolton sees new product lines as the key point, writing: “In 2020-2021, ONTO introduced 8+ new products that have opened doors to new segments such as compound semis & CIS, planar films, and panel level packaging. Management noted panel level packaging as a larger grower than originally forecast and is contributing significantly ($150M) to the $650M SAM expansion in 2022 brought on by these new products. ONTO currently expects to generate ~$100M in revenue from this new SAM in 2022, reflecting the company's strong position in the heterogeneous packaging market as well as strength in WFE as a whole.
""We view these new opportunities as significant growth drivers for ONTO for several years and believe the company will meaningfully outgrow WFE again in 2022 given its traction in expanding markets,” the top analyst summed up.
Bolton quantifies his bullish stance with a Buy rating and a $115 price target, suggesting ~33% upside by the end of 2022.
Overall, the Street is in agreement with Bolton on Onto’s prospects, as is clear from the unanimous Strong Buy consensus view. The stock is selling for $86.65 and its $116.25 average price target indicates potential for 34% upside this year. (See ONTO stock forecast on TipRanks)

Chris Hill: Today on Motley Fool Money, a reminder that not all cloud stocks are the same and that betting against tech behemoths is not for the faint of heart. That and more coming up right now. I'm Chris Hill, joined by Motley Fool Senior Analyst, Tim Beyers. Thanks for being here.
Tim Beyers: Thanks for having me, Chris.
Chris Hill: We've also got a closer look at the healthcare industry and a renewed partnership for two well-known consumer brands. But let's start with Microsoft, and we have a video channel for members of Motley Fool services. If you're a member any of our services, you have access to all video content everyday. One of the shows on the video channel is called beat and raise. That's what this was from Microsoft. Another beat and raise quarter, second quarter profits were higher than expected, the revenue to the raised guidance. The revenue was just under $52 billion, Tim.
Tim Beyers: I know. There's really only one word to describe this. That would be bananas. Let's hit just some of the highlights here. So overall revenue, just hitting it from the very top line, $51.7 billion. Billion with a B. increased 20 percent. Please recognize that this is a $2.2 trillion companies. How hard is it to grow to 50 plus billion dollars and actually grow that 20 percent? Just like do the math on that. You added, what, $10 billion, a little more than $10 billion year-over-year. Just looking at it now. Total revenue, let's call it $51.728 billion year-over-year. That's up from 43.076. I guess, not quite 10 billion, but $8 billion. That's a lot of money. There are companies that wait a lifetime to grow that big. Some of the numbers here, Chris, were truly outstanding. I'll highlight just a couple of them. But the overall cloud business unit, which is their commercial cloud, but also the Azure public cloud computing business, which had been growing at right around 50 percent, grew 46 percent again this year. That is astounding, 46 percent. Yes, that's slowing slightly, but boy, is it not slowing much. Let me pause it there, but there's a lot more to dig into here because there was growth across all of Microsoft's business units here. Chris.
Chris Hill: I want to get to the gaming in just a minute because a lot of people, you and I included, were eager to hear from Satya Nadella about last week's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. But aside from the gaming, what stood out to you?
Tim Beyers: Well, what stood out to me is that this is very consistent growth. When growth is consistent, it tells you something. Let me tell you what I mean. Total revenue up 20 percent, operating income of $22.2 billion, that increased 24 percent, total net income. Take out all the taxes, take out all the interest, everything else. That was 18.8 billion, that increased 21 percent. The diluted earnings per share was up to $2.48. That increased 22 percent. When you see that symmetry, Chris, not to overuse a Ron Gross phrase, but that literally is firing on all cylinders because it means the businesses in symmetry. It's not like, well, we bought back a whole bunch of shares, so our earnings per share is through the roof, but our revenue growth wasn't that big. No. This is a business that is selling consistently, doing very well, managing its expenses very well and so it's growing across the board. That is extremely healthy. This is an arguable statement, but I'll make it. Microsoft is the healthiest business on the US stock markets today. I think you could argue that, Chris.
Chris Hill: Healthy from the standpoint of their cash reserves because while you were talking about, look, they're not buying back a ton of stock. It reminded me of the fact of just how good Nadella and his team are with capital allocation, which is something we talk about from time to time. Whatever stock you own, whatever industry you're investing in, you can look at Microsoft and Nadella and his leadership and think to yourself. Are the CEOs of the companies I own, are they as good at capital allocation? Because in some ways that's the scary thing about this quarter, that they are doing it without what some people would call financial engineering. They're not buying back a ton of stock. They're not cranking up a huge dividend to reward shareholders. They are as effective with their acquisition strategy and executing it in the eight years he's been CEO as pretty much any company I can see.
Tim Beyers: What I mean by healthy here is we're not just talking about cash and not just talking about that execution. It's that they have a wide variety of businesses, all of the places. When we get to gaming, we'll talk about this a little bit more, but just to highlight some things that are historically businesses really have stopped thinking about, maybe should think about in terms of Microsoft. Let's just, for example, say the Windows OEM business. The Windows OEM business and Windows commercial licenses, that was up 13 percent. That's not nothing. When you're talking about a very large business unit and a very old business unit that's still growing in double digits. Dynamics 365, which is the business intelligence tools. It's more of a commercial enterprise type of software sale, but it's a very popular tool and that's up over 40 percent, Chris. So server products, things like SQL server, that's up 29 percent. What I'm talking about when I say healthy, is that there's a wide range of very balanced growth throughout the company and that's unusual for a company of Microsoft size. Usually something dominates, there's a unit that dominates everything else. Then other things are being shepherded up through that. Microsoft does have one. We could call that gaming, but boy, is there some upside there.
Chris Hill: Let's get to the gaming because Nadella made it very clear for anyone who was wondering. I'm not sure how much you could wonder after last week. He said, ""Look, we're doubling down [laughs] on gaming."" You think about the cash that they have to deploy into that segment. Obviously, it will take some time for Activision Blizzard for that acquisition to close. But again, it's a little bit scary when you think that Nadella looks at Microsoft's gaming division, and thinks, we can be doing a lot better here and we are going to.
Tim Beyers: When you look at the financials, what's interesting here is the second slowest growth segment that Microsoft reported was Xbox gaming and content. That was up 10 percent. Surface was only up eight percent. By the way, is it remarkable that we could say, it was only up eight percent? [laughs]
Tim Beyers: I guess, all right. But terrible.
Chris Hill: People working in Activision are walking around Microsoft headquarters, hanging their heads in shame.
Tim Beyers: Yeah, that it's only eight percent, but 10 percent, so that's what Xbox was up. But just some comments. This is from what Satya Nadella said. The big bets we've made across content community in Cloud over the past few years are paying off, and we saw record engagement as well as revenue in Game Pass, so this is the Cloud portion. Game Pass is, you go in, and you get your Xbox Game Pass. You have access to a lot of games, and you also have access to Xbox Cloud gaming. There are 25 million subscribers. That's across PC and console, and the beauty of Microsoft's gaming division, Chris, is that there's a lot of PC gaming, and there's a lot of console gaming and what can serve both? The Azure Cloud. The Azure cloud can serve both very skillfully. They already have 25-million going into this. They are going to make big bets on bringing Activision Blizzard into that. They say we're investing to make it easier for people to play great games wherever, whenever, and however, they want. That to me signals, Chris, that get ready, there's going to be a lot more coming from the Xbox Cloud gaming segment, especially with all of that Activision content.
Chris Hill: Mattel's partnership with Disney started in 1955 when Mattel sponsored Disney's television show, the Mickey Mouse club. The partnership continued until 2016 when Hasbro outbid Mattel for the rights to Disney's Princess lineup of toys. Today, Mattel won those rights back. They have the rights to Disney's Frozen franchise and other princess brands. The financial terms were not disclosed, but the deal starts in 2023, and when you look at shares of Mattel on the rise, even without knowing the financial terms, we see the power of brand. We see the power of the Disney brand and what that partnership means in this industry.
Tim Beyers: There's two things to take from this. Boy, talk about people hanging their heads. There might be some people at Hasbro hanging their heads today. Not great, not great. But Hasbro does have other good franchises. Remember, they're just losing the princess lines here, but that's still very meaningful, and the fact that it's done something for Mattel should tell you something. That Mattel has not done nearly as well in terms of its own brands here. It'll be very interesting to see and very interesting to see what kind of toy lineups and how creative they get around merchandising here. I don't know if it's more important, Chris, but it's equally as important.
Whenever you look at the licensing data, the number one licensor in the world for years. I haven't checked this recently. I should've checked it this morning, but for years when the 2021 data is out, we should check this. Usually, License magazine has this. Disney is far and away the biggest licenser of merchandise in the world, and they command a premium. As good as this deal is for Mattel, Chris, I'm betting it is a sweet, sweet deal for Disney, and it says something that they can apportion off. When Hasbro won the original Disney license, they won the Disney license. They didn't win the Princess license. They won the Disney license. If somebody needs to correct me on that, please do. But if I recall correctly, that was the Disney license. The fact that this gets apportioned off is fascinating to me, Chris.
Chris Hill: Well, and it is worth remembering that at the time that Disney paid $4 billion for Marvel. You look at what they paid for Pixar, for Lucasfilm, and all of the Star Wars stuff. There were people, particularly in the Marvel deal, who were saying, boy, they're really overpaying here.
Tim Beyers: Not me.
Chris Hill: I know you weren't one of them, but there were people saying they're overpaying, and as you just reminded us, they're so good at this move. They're so good at not just content creation, creating the movies and television shows, and experiences in the parks. They're so good at that, but they are so good at the licensing business, so the ability to leverage out future dollars off of what they're paying in the moment to acquire this intellectual property. Maybe, someday people will stop doubting their ability to do this.
Tim Beyers: I doubt it. Let me give you one other thought on it. Bear in mind I'm a Disney shareholder, so I'm pretty biased on this one. I've been a Disney shareholder for a very long period of time. The reason you should never doubt Disney, among other things, is that they have a history of doing a really good job of taking small things and making something of them. Let me give you another example. Look at the way Disney Plus has done very small things, taken really small parts of the universe, and done something with it. The Mandalorian. Who knew? We can take one character, Boba Fett, and we can turn that into a major franchise. There was a short series and literally, Chris, it was a short run of comics that the writer Matt Fraction did reinventing the character Hawkeye, and it was a great run. It was really interesting. It'll be fascinating if they ever, in that show, get to the pizza dog storyline, which was crazy and really fascinating, but it would be interesting if they ever got to that, but that's another thing. Take this small little thing and turn it into something, and now, what do they got? Another minor character, this little thing called Moon Knight, and you got Oscar Isaac starring in that. So Disney takes really small things and turn them into things that are bigger and more interesting so that's why they can take something like the Princess line and just sell those rights to Mattel and probably get a pretty big bag of cash for it.
Chris Hill: Real quick. Before I let you go, I got to ask you about F5 because you were saying this morning this is not the typical Cloud business.
Tim Beyers: No, it's not.
Chris Hill: Their first-quarter results were overshadowed when they cut their full-year guidance. They also cut guidance for the current quarter. Shares are down more than 10 percent today but compared to what we've seen from a lot of other businesses that are, if not straight-up cloud businesses, at least Cloud adjacent. F5 seems like it's holding its own.
Tim Beyers: I mean, it's been a winner. This is an old rule breaker. This is one that I gave up on too quickly many, many years ago. Long before it was Cloud transitioning, or as you put it, Cloud adjacent. F5 is one of those companies that the earnings report revenue was up 10 percent year-over-year. This is an old company, so that shouldn't be surprising, but there are a lot of these companies, Chris, I don't love the term cloud-native, but it's a thing, and cloud-native means this is a company that was born in the cloud, all of its services are cloud, it's always been cloud. It never had to be something else and become cloud. F5 is the latter. It was something else. It had to become cloud, and it is still something else. The reason that guidance is low is because it's important to remember there's a lot of tech companies that are getting thrashed, and I'm getting asked a lot of questions like how do you know which one is a cloud company that has a better long-term outlook and like it has a lot more steam behind it?
The F5, for all its recent performance, Chris, is the cloud company I'm concerned about because it's a transitional company and it still sells a lot of hardware and a lot of its hardware is the original big, IP line of hardware products, which were originally load balancers. What a load balancer is, Chris, it's you're crossing guard. It's your traffic cop. It's hey, you come, you stay. It manages the load on a network, which is important. But in the world of tech, it's a little more commodity. You can do a lot of that in software. F5 is trying to do more of that in software. But I get nervous about companies like this. Supply chain issues hurt F5 this quarter, could hurt in the future. They're subject to different things than the other cloud-native companies are. In answer to the question of what kind of cloud company is going to survive this and thrive? The answer is, I think the ones that are a little more cloud-native are ones you should look at. So that's more like Snowflake, MongoDB, and companies like that and less hardware companies that are trying to be Cloud companies which is more like F5.
Chris Hill: Tim Beyers, always great talking to you. Thanks for being here.
Tim Beyers: Thanks, man. Appreciate it.
Chris Hill: Collectively, Abbott Laboratories, Moderna, and Pfizer have generated tens of billions of dollars in sales related to COVID-19. How are they investing that money? Is one doing a better job than the others? For more, Here's Olivia Zitkus.
Olivia Zitkus: Hello Fools. I'm on with Keith Speights, a healthcare analyst, here at the Motley Fool. Keith, it is great to be with you. Thanks for being here.
Keith Speights: Great to be with you too Olivia.
Olivia Zitkus: I have Keith here today, because he's been following COVID-19 stocks very closely, really since we've dubbed them. COVID-19 stocks. Keith today, I don't want to talk so much about the intricacies of vaccines and boosters or treatments, but rather what the companies who sell these products are doing with the windfall of cash they've received from their sales. I'm particularly curious about how Pfizer, Moderna, and Abbott Laboratories, are spending their money on research and development, and building up their pipelines. I will briefly set the stage, in its recent quarter, Pfizer's revenue from commodity and boosters was responsible for $11.1 billion of $24.1 billion in overall revenue, Moderna's revenue from Spikevax and it's boosters was 5 billion, right now that vaccine is it's only revenue source, and Abbott Labs revenue from its testing business is driving more than half its organic sales growth. In the recent quarter, Abbott's COVID testing related sales totaled about $1.9 billion, led by BinaxNOW, Panbio, and the ID NOW rapid testing platform. That's of about $10.9 billion in total revenue. Now, all three of these companies are using their new found COVID-related revenue, to find pipeline projects and RND. But investors are rightfully curious about who's spending most wisely and who's prospects are brightest. So, Keith, let's start with the big question. What areas of RND are just beckoning to be funded with this cash.
Keith Speights: Olivia, I think it's helpful to look at the research and development areas that these three companies are already prioritizing. Pfizer is the biggest of the bunch in and has the most cash to invest. If you look at Pfizer's pipeline, they're investing heavily on oncology. Pfizer has roughly 30 programs. That's around one third of its entire pipeline focused on cancer. Of course, cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, despite the significant progress that has been made in recent years. It's also potentially lucrative area for Pfizer to target and Pfizer is already a big player in this market with several blockbuster cancer drugs. Pfizer is also investing heavily and surprisingly, in vaccine research. Pfizer has 17 vaccine programs in its pipeline. I'm especially interested in the company's messenger RNA efforts. Pfizer has an experimental flu vaccine that's an early stage testing.
That's one to really keep your eyes on. Of course, the company has been working with this partner, buy-on Tech on the COVID-19 vaccine commodity. But Pfizer is looking to go it on its own somewhat in messenger RNA. That'll be an interesting area for investors to keep their eyes on. Pfizer is also investing a lot in inflammation and immunology. The company has 16 pipeline programs. Now, two of those recently won FDA approval. You can back that number out. But Pfizer is also has promising experimental drugs targeting atopic dermatitis, lupus, and a lot more. Pfizer is also looking at beeping up its portfolio in rare diseases, genetic diseases, and the company has several pipeline candidates on that front. Then finally, one area that I think is intriguing, is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH. This is a liver disease that doesn't have any really effective approved therapies, and it's a big potential market. If a drug maker can come along you have a successful product. So far that hasn't been the case really, but Pfizer has some candidates targeting NASH that I think are interesting to watch.
Olivia Zitkus: Great. Let's turn to Moderna.
Keith Speights: Moderna of course, is a big player in messenger RNA vaccines, and that's the main area to watch with Moderna. The company has a pipeline that focuses exclusively on mRNA. The company's lead candidate outside of COVID-19, is a cytomegalovirus, or CMV vaccine. There aren't any approved CMV vaccine right now. This is an interesting candidate to watch. Moderna is also developing a combination COVID flu and RSV vaccine. The company says, it could be ready and a best-case scenario anyway with this vaccine by the winter of 2023. A combination vaccine like this could have a lot of potential if it's successful. If it's both safe and effective. That's definitely one to watch. Moderna is also developing some personalized cancer vaccines using its mRNA technology. The company has a pre-clinical HIV vaccine, one with one program targeting HIV potentially soon advancing into clinical testing. Moderna has a lot of mRNA vaccines in the hopper. But it's also focusing on mRNA therapies, and it's targeting how auto-immune disorders, cancer, and rare diseases there.
Olivia Zitkus: How about Abbott Labs?
Keith Speights: I think the intriguing area to watch with Abbott, is its investments in developing consumer bio wearables. Abbott is developing several consumer bio wearables that track glucose for diabetics, tracking ketones, which are chemicals made in the liver and they're important for diabetes monitoring, tracking lactate. These are high levels that can be caused by dehydration or anemia or even leukemia or be symptoms of that, and it could have devices like when they track alcohol levels. Abbott is also focusing on Connected Health technology, including remote heart monitoring. So Abbott has a lot of intriguing development efforts underway on the medical device side.
Olivia Zitkus: That's a great friend down Keith, and I hate to ask for you to pick a favorite, but as an investor, are you more excited about one of these three companies over the others based on their pipelines?
Keith Speights: I will say Olivia, I'm excited about the development efforts for all three of these companies. I think they have a lot of good things in the works. Abbott is really one of the best run and most innovative companies around, Moderna has an absolutely huge opportunity over the long run with it's mRNA technology. As an investor though, I think that Pfizer is probably the most attractive all around right now. Pfizer is poised to continue making billions of dollars, with its COVID-19 vaccine. Company also has a highly effective COVID pill that will also undoubtedly be a huge moneymaker. Pfizer already has contracts to supply doses that will make it billions of dollars from this COVID pill called, Paxlovid. Pfizer also has several strong products in its lineup including blood thinner Eliquis and rare heart disease drug called vyndagel. Company has an incredibly robust pipeline across all of the areas we've already talked about oncology rare disease, vaccines, inflammation, and immunology, and it doesn't hurt that Pfizer also offers a solid dividend. The yield right now is around three percent. Investors who are looking for really solid growth prospects for such a huge company, as well as an attractive dividend, Pfizer is a great one to take a look at.
Olivia Zitkus: Yeah, Moderna and Pfizer in particular are a pretty different status in their lifecycle. It's interesting that we often talk about them in tandem, because of COVID, right? For Moderna, research and development expenses were $521 million for the three months ended September 30th of last year, compared to 344 million for the same period in the year prior, that's a 51 percent increase. But Pfizer, a longer tenured, large-cap healthcare company, also upped RND spending 50 percent to $3.4 billion. Just a mammoth increase in spending for a company that's already doing well. It had drugs on the market for a really long time. That brings me to my final question. These are big, profitable businesses. If we turn toward valuation, who has the most room for a run-up in share price?
Keith Speights: That's a good question Olivia, if you look at the stock chart, Moderna's shares are down more than 60 percent from the highs last year. This stock has really been bitten down quite a bit. However, there is a strong case to be made that Moderna's valuation really became too frothy last year, and it's now getting close to more of a reasonable and fair valuation. Both Abbott and Pfizer are around 10 percent below their highs, maybe a little more than that now. Between these two though, I think Pfizer appears to be the better bargain right now. This pharma stock trades at only around 9.5 times expected earnings. There are two big questions for Pfizer though. Number 1, what's the demand going to be for COVID vaccines and therapies beyond 2022-2023?
We don't know the answer to that question just yet. The second big question for Pfizer is, how will the company fair with the patent cliff that it faces in the second half of this decade? Pfizer has several of its top-selling drugs that lose patent exclusivity, starting in 2026-2027 timeframe. I do think though that Pfizer's pipeline and acquisition strategy will help it address the second issue relatively well. I think Pfizer is going to be able to handle losing patent exclusivity for some of this top drugs because it has a strong pipeline, and it has quite a few newer drugs that will be really gaining momentum over the next several years. Then on the first question about whether or not the demand is going to be there for COVID vaccines and therapies over the next several years, I think if new variance emerge, or COVID continues to be problematic, even as it transitions from pandemic to endemic, Pfizer's stock could still have plenty of rental run at its current valuation. I think the start was pretty attracted.

2022-02-01 00:00:00+00:00,Marvell Technology (MRVL) Outpaces Stock Market Gains: What You Should Know,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/marvell-technology-mrvl-outpaces-stock-market-gains%3A-what-you-should-know-1,,,"Marvell Technology (MRVL) closed at $72.42 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.43% move from the prior day. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.69%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.78%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.28%.
Heading into today, shares of the chipmaker had lost 20.16% over the past month, lagging the Business Services sector's loss of 8.04% and the S&P 500's loss of 5.29% in that time.
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Marvell Technology as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Marvell Technology to post earnings of $0.38 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 31.03%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.32 billion, up 65.61% from the year-ago period.
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Marvell Technology. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell).

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

5 Stocks to Buy Despite Market Fluctuations
U.S. stock markets have been suffering from extreme volatility since the last week of December. All major stock indexes have fluctuated 2-3% in either direction almost regularly. The primary reasons are the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus and market participants’ concerns regarding a tougher-than-expected hawkish Fed.
Nevertheless, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong and the proposed $1.2 billion infrastructure plan of the Biden administration should drive the stock markets. Robust performance of the U.S. economy and record-high corporate profit in 2021 are the other positives.
At this stage, investment in U.S. corporate behemoths that are currently trading at a lucrative multiple with a favorable Zacks Rank should be fruitful. Five such stocks are General Motors Co., Tesla Inc., Marvell Technology Inc.,FedEx Corp. and Zoetis Inc.
A More Hawkish Fed
On Jan 26, after the conclusion of the first Fed FOMC meeting of this year, Chairman Jerome Powell signaled the first rate hike in three years as early as in March. The central bank’s quantitative easing program will also come to an end in March.
Although the Fed refrained from stating the month and magnitude of the interest rate hike, Powell said, “Inflation risks are still to the upside in the views of most FOMC participants, and certainly in my view as well. There’s a risk that the high inflation we are seeing will be prolonged. There’s a risk that it will move even higher.”
The Fed Chairman further added, “In light of the remarkable progress we’ve seen in the labor market and inflation that is well-above our 2% long-run goal, the economy no longer needs sustained high levels of monetary policy support.”
In a separate press statement, the FOMC has also indicated that the Fed is thinking of shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet later this year. Powell said, “There’s a substantial amount of shrinkage in the balance sheet to be done. That’s going to take some time. We want that process to be orderly and predictable.”
Wall Street Tumbles
Wall Street plummeted in January owing to huge uncertainty regarding the movement of liquidity and market interest rate going forward. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 4.4%, 7% and 12% respectively.
The Nasdaq Composite is in deep correction territory plunging 15.1% from its all-time high. The S&P 500 briefly entered the correction zone last week and is currently trading 8% down from its all-time high. The Dow has slipped 6% from its all-time high. The small-cap-centric Russell 2000 is also in deep correction territory plummeting 19.9% from its all-time high.
Our Top Picks
We have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate giants (market capital > $50 billion) that are currently trading on the dip. These stocks have positive growth potential for 2022 and have witnessed solid earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Tesla has acquired a substantial market share within the electric car segment. Increasing Model 3 delivery, which forms a significant chunk of TSLA’s overall deliveries, is aiding its top line. Along with Model 3, Model Y is contributing to its revenues.
In addition to increasing automotive revenues, Tesla’s energy generation and storage revenues should boost its earnings prospects. TSLA said that its overall deliveries surged 20% in the third quarter from its previous record in the second quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter-on-quarter gain.
Tesla has an expected earnings growth rate of 31.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 3.2% over the last 7 days. This Zacks Rank #1 stock is currently trading at a 39.7% discount from its 52-week high.
General Motors faced challenges in the second half of 2021 due to semiconductor-driven plant downtime. While the plan to spend $35 billion through 2025 to launch gen-next EVs and self-driving vehicles augur well for GM, it would strain near-term margins.
Nevertheless, General Motors' hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado and Equinox along with upcoming electric vehicle launches including GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Lyriq EV are likely to boost its prospects. GM’s Ultium Drive system and collaborations with Honda and EVgo are likely to scale up its e-mobility prowess.
General Motors has an expected earnings growth rate of 2.1% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.4% over the last 7 days. This Zacks Rank #1 stock is currently trading at a 25.2% discount from its 52-week high.
Marvell Technology is benefiting from solid demand for its storage and networking chips from the 5G infrastructure and data-center end markets. Strong supply-chain executions are helping MRVL to address the strong demand from cloud datacenters for its Smart NICs and security adapters.
Moreover, the wireless infrastructure business of Marvel Technology is showing signs of improvements. The recent acquisition of Inphi is boosting the top line of MRVL. Further, the storage business is steadily recovering from the coronavirus impacts.
Marvel Technology has an expected earnings growth rate of 42.6% for the current year (ending January 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 15.7% over the last 60 days. This Zacks Rank #1 stock is currently trading at a 29.3% discount from its 52-week high.
FedEx's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks even in the current challenging scenario is noteworthy. In line with its shareholder-friendly approach, FedEx's board cleared a new $5-billion stock buyback program last year. FDX's liquidity position is also solid. Favorable pricing and a healthy demand scenario.are also aiding FedEx.
FDX has an expected earnings growth rate of 14.6% for the current year (ending May 2022). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.5% over the last 30 days. This Zacks Rank #2 stock is currently trading at a 23.5% discount from its 52-week high.
Zoetis’ momentum continues on its innovative portfolio of petcare parasiticides, including Simparica Trio, as well as dermatology products (Apoquel and Cytopoint). ZTS also upped its annual guidance. The uptake of Librela and Solensia, its new monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, is encouraging in Europe and should boost growth.
The companion animal portfolio maintains momentum for Zoetis. The launch of innovative products (ProHeart, Librela, Revolution Plus, and many vaccines) bolstered the portfolio and should fuel the growth of ZTS in the upcoming quarters.
Zoetis has an expected earnings growth rate of 11.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.6% over the last 60 days. This Zacks Rank #2 stock is currently trading at a 21.7% discount from its 52-week high.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
As one investor put it, “curing and preventing hundreds of diseases…what should that market be worth?” This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-01-29 00:00:00+00:00,3 High-Growth Chip Stocks to Buy for 2022 and Beyond After the Market Sell-Off,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-high-growth-chip-stocks-to-buy-for-2022-and-beyond-after-the-market-sell-off,,,"2022 has gotten off to a rough start, especially for richly valued high-growth tech stocks. Even semiconductor stocks, which are coming off a banner year in 2021 thanks to the chip shortage, are hitting the skids on worries that amplified sales growth could (eventually, maybe in 2023) be due for a downturn.
But after cratering in recent weeks, some of these premium-priced stocks look like compelling buys right now -- assuming an investor plans to hold for years (and even better, has spare cash to make more purchases down the road). Here's why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) are worth a look right now.

1. Nvidia: The bedrock of AI, autonomous vehicles, and entertainment
Nvidia stock is down about 35% from its all-time high, which it hit right before news of the omicron variant started dominating headlines in mid-November. That was followed by the market sell-off spurred on by the Fed's indication that it plans to raise interest rates this year. Even after the steep price drop, Nvidia stock is valued at an incredible 82 times trailing-12-month free cash flow, so it's no surprise shares have seriously cooled off.
The thing is, Nvidia trades for such an outrageous premium for a reason. It's providing all sorts of companies the hardware they need to build out data centers that support high-end cloud-computing services and AI. Nvidia's self-driving car system will also be available for production starting with 2024 model-year vehicles. Then there are video games, the company's roots, which are now everyday entertainment for hundreds of millions of people around the globe. Because of the chip shortage, most video gamers have yet to upgrade to the latest and greatest Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) in their gaming computers.
On top of all this semiconductor innovation from Nvidia is a library of software. The company has always been known for packaging great software together with its hardware systems to make them easy for developers to deploy. Nvidia has only just begun to dip its toe into the cloud-based software-sales world.
Its latest big announcement is the commercial availability of Omniverse -- software for content creation that helps remote designers work in a collaborative space in real-time. There are all sorts of capabilities within the toolbox that is Omniverse. Nvidia thinks one of those tools -- Avatars used to create lifelike digital assistants -- could be worth billions of dollars in annual sales someday.
In the meantime, Nvidia is already growing at an incredible rate from its data center and video game segments. Fiscal 2022 fourth-quarter (ending January 2022) revenue is expected to be up 48% year over year at the midpoint of guidance, and the average Wall Street analyst expects Nvidia to reach nearly $32 billion in sales this next year (about another 19% annual increase in revenue if those predictions prove true).
If you believe the cloud, AI, and high-end gaming will continue to expand in the next decade, Nvidia is a great place to get started building a portfolio to bet on these secular-growth trends, and the stock is currently discounted.
2. AMD: Still lots of market share up for grabs
AMD is almost 37% down from its high watermark, also reached in November before the market went haywire. With the stock trading at 47 times trailing-12-month free cash flow, the former underdog of the semiconductor industry still isn't ""cheap."" But considering how much market share it can still accumulate in the years ahead, there's still plenty to like about AMD, even at this price point.
AMD's central processing units (CPUs) for everything from PCs to laptops to data centers have been winning over lots of customers in recent years. Growth in the general computing and IT industries have helped, but many of these new sales have come at the expense of industry-leader Intel. For example, in Nvidia's latest DGX A100 system for AI computing in the data center, the company utilizes two AMD EPYC CPUs versus Intel CPUs in previous generations of the hardware.
Additionally, AMD is trying to open up a new front against Intel with its pending acquisition of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) leader Xilinx. That deal is still pending, though the two companies now say they expect it will be complete sometime in the first quarter of 2022.
If the merger goes through, AMD will get a lot bigger by adding Xilinx's business to its own (Xilinx had nearly $3.5 billion in sales over the last 12-month stretch, compared to AMD's own $14.9 billion in revenue). Even without integrating Xilinx, though, AMD said it expects full-year 2021 sales to be up 65% from 2020. The average analyst is forecasting another 20% growth on top of that in 2022.
Intel is prioritizing chip manufacturing right at the moment, so that could keep the door open for AMD to land more chip-design wins in the coming years since it has no manufacturing segment. It spun off its chip fab business a long time ago into what is now GlobalFoundries. Thus, after its recent tumble, AMD looks like a solid buy, given its potential in the coming years as it tries to woo over some of Intel's nearly $80 billion in annual sales.
3. Marvell Technology Group: A complete makeover by way of acquisition
Marvell Technology Group is a lesser-known name in the semiconductor space. However, with an enterprise value of over $60 billion and trailing-12-month revenue of nearly $4 billion, the company is beginning to show up on the radar of more investors. The high-growth chip designer is down more than 30% from its all-time highs reached just a couple of months ago.
Marvell is undergoing a massive change right at the moment. It has made multiple acquisitions in recent years, capped off with the purchase of network hardware companies Inphi and Innovium in 2021. Together with the company's existing portfolio of products, the purchases make Marvell a one-stop-shop for networking and data-management solutions -- from cloud-computing services to AI to the modern tech-enhanced vehicle.
The fast pace of acquisitions means Marvell is currently operating in the red (net losses of $411 million in the last 12 months), although the company is generating free cash flow (positive $469 million). As it works its way through the elevated expenses associated with purchasing Inphi and Innovium, Marvell is already beginning to reap the rewards of its revamped product line.
Management said it expects a 9% quarter-over-quarter rise in sales in Q4 fiscal 2022 (using sequential growth for now since the company didn't own Inphi or Innovium yet a year ago). And the average stock analyst thinks Marvell's revenue could swell to nearly $5.9 billion this next year.
Put another way, Marvell is better-positioned than ever before to take advantage of growth from data center construction, next-gen network buildout (like 5G mobile), and connected and autonomous vehicles. Marvell isn't the most well-known name in chip design like Nvidia and AMD, but that could change over the next few years. It's time to give this data and high-end computing semiconductor company a serious look after the recent sell-off.

2022-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,March 11th Options Now Available For Marvell Technology (MRVL),MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/march-11th-options-now-available-for-marvell-technology-mrvl,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options begin trading today, for the March 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new March 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $60.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $65.51/share today.
Because the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.69% return on the cash commitment, or 65.30% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $65.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $66.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.40. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $65.51/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $66.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.99% if the stock gets called away at the March 11th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $66.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $66.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.24% boost of extra return to the investor, or 69.97% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $65.51) to be 45%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-01-26 00:00:00+00:00,Semiconductor Stocks: A Smart Bet for the Long Haul,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/semiconductor-stocks%3A-a-smart-bet-for-the-long-haul,,,"The semiconductor industry grabbed headlines in 2021 mostly due to a supply shortage that crippled industries, such as autos, for which chips are a key component. The world awoke to the fact that seemingly everything these days – from garage-door openers to rockets – runs on what's now dubbed ""the new oil.""
The acute supply-demand imbalance, induced largely by pandemic disruptions, should ease as we move through 2022. But the insatiable appetite for semiconductors, and by proxy, semiconductor stocks, will continue to surge.
Angelo Zino, an analyst forinvestment researchfirm CFRA, foresees a ""super cycle"" for the industry over the next decade as the content per device and sophistication of semiconductors grow. For example, artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, which essentially replace the human brain and require high-performance chips, are expanding in industries ranging from autos to medicine to data centers.
Devices are getting smarter. Applied Materials (AMAT), the largest equipment supplier to the semiconductor industry, projects that between 2020 and 2025, the value of semiconductor content will jump 50% per automobile, to $690, and it will double for an average data center server, to $5,600. The growing adoption of 5G telecommunications will help boost the value of chip content of a high-end smartphone to $275. Overall, the industry should expand by 2.5 to 3 times the rate of gross domestic product growth and become a $1 trillion market in 2030.
With this inexorable growth in mind, we identified six attractive semiconductor stocks that range from chip designers to manufacturers to equipment suppliers. Valuations in the industry aren't cheap, but they have come down in recent weeks along with those of the tech sector overall, hit by the recent run-up in interest rates.

Applied Materials
Market value: $134 billion
Price-to-earnings ratio: 19
Dividend yield: 0.6%
One-year return: 60.5%
Semiconductor manufacturing is an enormously capital-intensive business, with foundries and logic- and memory-chip companies spending tens of billions of dollars each year to expand capacity and to keep up with the blazing pace of technological change. Applied Materials (AMAT, $151) is the world's largest maker of semiconductor equipment, an industry niche that has consolidated in recent years to just five major players.
Igor Tishin, a tech analyst at Harding Loevner Funds, likens the leading tool makers to ""arms suppliers to a growth industry."" That's because regardless which chipmaker is up or down, all of them need to buy from the same handful of equipment suppliers.
Applied sells its complex machines, such as etching equipment, to aglobal market Last year, about 75% of sales went to Asian industrial powers China, South Korea and Taiwan; only about 10% of revenues were booked in the U.S.
AMAT has used its close relations with chipmakers around the world to boost its services business (such as machine maintenance), which generates high recurring, subscription-like revenues and is less volatile than machine orders. Applied generates a towering return on equity (a measure of profitability) of approximately 50% and is expected to increase earnings by nearly 20% in its fiscal year ending in October 2022.

Marvell Technology
Market value: $70 billion
Price-to-earnings ratio: 40
Dividend yield: 0.3%
One-year return: 70.0%
Marvell Technology (MRVL, $83) is a good example of a so-called fabless semiconductor company – a chipmaker that designs semiconductors in-house but outsources manufacturing to third parties, thereby tamping down capital intensity.
Business is booming because most of the company's sales are to high-growth markets such as cloud data centers and 5G telecommunications infrastructure – net­working customers include Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Dell (DELL). A leader in items such as controllers for storage systems, Marvell supplies hard-disk-drive makers including Toshiba, Seagate (STX) and Western Digital (WDC).
Many of the chips it designs are customized for clients, which increases customers' costs to switch suppliers and enhances the ""stickiness"" of sales.
CFRA's Zino expects Marvell's revenues to grow 30% this year and earnings per share to double in two years. As with other semiconductor-industry companies, one potential vulnerability is Marvell's dependence on China, where it books nearly half of sales.

Nvidia
Market value: $681 billion
Price-to-earnings ratio: 54
Dividend yield: 0.1%
One-year return: 104.3%
In 2020, Nvidia (NVDA, $272) dethroned Intel (INTC) to become the most valuable semiconductor stock.
It's been quite a ride since 1999, when this disrupter invented graphics processing units (GPUs), which redefined the PC gaming industry. More recently, Nvidia has used its high-speed, leading-edge GPUs to grab market share in sectors including gaming, data centers, cloud computing, machine learning, cryptocurrency mining and robotics.
Adam Benjamin, manager of Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio, says that Nvidia ""stands on its own right now"" in leading the shift to AI-driven systems for everything from autonomous-driving vehicles to medical research and diagnosis.
The market understands that the world is Nvidia's oyster. Highly profitable, with sales growing at multiples of the overall semiconductor industry, the stock returned nearly 100% annualized over the past three years, double the industry's average.
Yet many investors still find it irresistible. ""Every time I cut back, it turned out to be a mistake,"" Plumb Funds' Tom Plumb says of his largest stock holding.

NXP Semiconductors
Market value: $59 billion
Price-to-earnings ratio: 19
Dividend yield: 1.0%
One-year return: 27.8%
The semiconductor content in autos is surging due to the migration to electric vehicles (EVs) and the addition of increasingly sophisticated features in cars, such as enhanced safety and audio-infotainment systems. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI, $221) is well placed to ride the wave.
Autos account for half of NXP's revenues, a proportion that is growing (chips for home and industrial automation are also a major business for the Netherlands-based firm).
NXP supplies automakers including BMW, Ford (F), Tesla (TSLA) and Volkswagen (VWAGY) with chips for battery-management systems in EVs, advanced radar systems to avoid accidents, and in-vehicle networking.
The company, which plows more than 15% of revenues back into research and development, projects annual sales growth of 8% to 12% until 2024. NXP jacked up its dividend 50% last year and has a habit of aggressive share repurchases.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Market value: $640 billion
Price-to-earnings ratio: 24
Dividend yield: 1.6%
One-year return: 2.0%
In the 1980s, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM, $124) pioneered the foundry business – the contract manufacturing of chips for others.
With a global foundry market share of more than 50% (three times higher than Samsung Electronics, which ranks second) and a virtual lock on leading-edge chips, Taiwan Semi makes semiconductors for Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm (QCOM), Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others.
Vying with Nvidia to be the most valuable semiconductor company (by market value) in the world, Taiwan Semi is investing $100 billion from 2021 to 2023 in new chip-fabrication facilities to meet supply shortages and rapidly expanding demand.
Harding Loevner's Tishin labels this indispensable chipmaker a ""natural monopoly,"" but an enlightened one in that it doesn't abuse its pricing power and treats customers ""fairly and equally."" (The firm's motto is ""Everyone's Foundry."")
Taiwan Semi has little competition, so its largest risk may be the rising political tension between China and Taiwan, where most of its fixed assets are based.

Texas Instruments
Market value: $166 billion
Price-to-earnings ratio: 22
Dividend yield: 2.6%
One-year return: 9.35%
We may be in the digital age, yet the demand for analog chips is still enormous and growing.
Venerable Texas Instruments (TXN, $179), founded in 1930, is the global leader in analog semiconductors, which find their way into pretty much every electronic product to provide power to run devices, for instance, and for tech interface with humans.
""People think analog is not sexy because it's not at the forefront of technology, but you find it everywhere,"" says Hendi Susanto, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. TI, whose product catalog of 80,000 devices also includes processors that convert sound to digital data, counts 100,000 customers around the world, with two-thirds of its sales from Asia.
The unglamorous analog business (the industrial and personal electronics sectors are the two largest end customers) grows steadily and is highly profitable for TI, which is tightly managed for shareholders. Compared with digital chips, analog product life cycles are long and capital spending needs are modest. Unlike many competitors, TI manufacturers its own chips, which helps to reduce cost.
With high and rising profit margins, the company generates $7 billion of free cash flow a year, and TI returns nearly all of it to investors by repurchasing shares and paying dividends, which the firm has increased for 18 consecutive years.

2022-01-25 00:00:00+00:00,Should iShares Russell MidCap Value ETF (IWS) Be on Your Investing Radar?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-ishares-russell-midcap-value-etf-iws-be-on-your-investing-radar-0,,,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market, the iShares Russell MidCap Value ETF (IWS) is a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 07/17/2001.
The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $14.55 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market.
Why Mid Cap Value
With market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion, mid cap companies usually contain higher growth prospects than large cap companies, and are considered less risky than their small cap counterparts. These types of companies, then, have a good balance of stability and growth potential.
Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. While value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long-term performance, growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets.
Costs
Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.23%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.47%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 16.70% of the portfolio. Industrials and Real Estate round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Marvell Technology Inc (MRVL) accounts for about 0.76% of total assets, followed by Ihs Markit Ltd (INFO) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC).
Performance and Risk
IWS seeks to match the performance of the Russell MidCap Value Index before fees and expenses. The Russell Midcap Value Index measures the performance of the mid-capitalization value sector of the U.S. equity market.
The ETF has lost about -5.28% so far this year and was up about 16.77% in the last one year (as of 01/25/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $96.73 and $123.59.
The ETF has a beta of 1.13 and standard deviation of 25.72% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 705 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
IShares Russell MidCap Value ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, IWS is a great option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.
The iShares S&P MidCap 400 Value ETF (IJJ) and the Vanguard MidCap Value ETF (VOE) track a similar index. While iShares S&P MidCap 400 Value ETF has $8.55 billion in assets, Vanguard MidCap Value ETF has $15.48 billion. IJJ has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VOE charges 0.07%.
Bottom-Line
While an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.
