2022-06-28 00:00:00+00:00,7 Growth Stocks to Buy After the Market Crash,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-growth-stocks-to-buy-after-the-market-crash,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The 2022 bear market is in the middle-to-late phase. Consumer confidence is at an all-time-low level. March 2022’s stock market rebound tricked investors into thinking that buying the dip would work. Between April and May, markets tried to rally. Each time, sellers emerged in droves.
The selling throughout this year triggered a bear market with a loss of 20% from the high. This negative crowd might lead to a market crash next. The macroeconomic weakness is only intensifying. The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by 75 basis points.
Markets haven’t received a shock of this size since 1994.

The central bank reacted to the consumer price index rising by 8.6% with urgency. It is so severely behind in raising rates that it needs to increase that amount.
Stock markets are still unprepared for this. Technology stocks, many of which are down 80% or more, are still overvalued. Retail investors are avoiding companies that do not earn a profit and sold off companies that traded at unsustainable valuations.
But there are still some gems. In the table above, Stock Rover issued strong quality scores for five of the seven stocks in this gallery.
7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy for a Secure Retirement
So here are seven growth stocks investors should buy after the market crash. Though since it’s is impossible to time a bottom in the stock market, investors should instead build a stock buying list and ease in at good prices.
AAPL Apple $141.66
INTC Intel $38.63
MA Mastercard $328.83
MO Altria $43.19
MSFT Microsoft $264.89
NEE NextEra Energy $77.90
SHOP Shopify $373.09
Apple (AAPL)

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a $2.3 trillion market capitalization title at the end of last week. It is also trading at 21.4 times forward earnings. Markets will struggle to justify Apple at its current price.
At lower levels, investors will find many reasons to own AAPL stock.
Apple is aggressively building its streaming content service. On June 14, 2022, it signed a deal with Major League Soccer. Fans may stream every soccer match on the Apple TV app. It’s also still in play for the NFL Sunday Ticker. This might give Apple a significant edge over other streaming services. Viewers will not have any local broadcast blackouts. Furthermore, they do not need to pay for a traditional pay-TV bundle.
Consumers will cut their spending as inflation rates soar. Many will tune out of traditional TV. Apple’s MLS deal is another reason for sports fans to sign up for the Apple TV app instead.
In the second quarter of 2023, Apple is expecting to release a mixed reality headset. Since sales of computers, tablets and smartphones are not slowing, the company may take its time developing an augmented reality peripheral.
Intel (INTC)

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) failed to launch a graphics card at the start of 2022. Impatient investors dumped the stock in frustration. After much delay, the chip giant debuted its GPU in China.
Intel Arc A380 Photon is the first custom GPU based on an Intel Xe-HPG/DG2 architecture. To test consumer response, the company introduced the card in China. It has many technical advantages. It needs 92 watts of power. Furthermore, this model is overclocked and may run as fast as 2450 MHz. The card will have 15.5 Gbps of memory.
Intel chose to bundle the A380 Arc with pre-built systems first. This will shelter the product from GPU price fluctuations.
Why does that matter? This month, cryptocurrency prices crashed. Crypto miners will panic by selling GPUs on the secondary market. But this excess supply should not affect Intel’s GPU launch.
7 Bargain Income Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever
Intel needs to manage through the worsening market conditions. China is slowly emerging from its latest Covid-related lockdown. The PC market is weakening. Consumers already upgraded their systems during the pandemic. Still, as unit prices fall and manufacturers release budget-priced boards for Intel’s Alder Lake, demand will recover.
Mastercard (MA)

Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is fairly well insulated from the crash in fintech stocks. Traditional credit card firms have a stronger, more secure infrastructure and better customer support. Instead of waiting weeks or months for an email reply from a fintech service, customers may get help on the phone.
On May 24, 2022, Mastercard strengthened its cybersecurity consulting practice. It will protect customers with its Cyber Front threat simulation platform. Mastercard’s Cyber Front continues to update its library of over 3,500 scenarios based on real-life threats. By protecting customers in real-time, fintech competitors cannot match this company’s level of security.
Admittedly, Mastercard’s openness to NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and Web 3.0 is a potential distraction. On June 9, 2022, it allowed people to use their Mastercard cards for NFTs purchases.
The crumbling value of NFT suggests that such marketplaces will realize lower sales from here. Still, NFT marketplaces enjoyed more than $25 billion in sales in 2021.
Altria Group (MO)

Altria Group (NYSE:MO) stock fell hard recently after a report said President Joe Biden’s administration will pursue a plan that requires tobacco makers to cut nicotine levels in cigarettes.
For over a decade, Altria has joined other tobacco firms under government scrutiny. Every time MO stock fell, investors bought the dip and Altria stock recovered.
Income investors get $3.60 a share in dividends for taking political risks.
Investors also worried about tobacco consumption falling because of rising gas prices and poor consumer sentiment. This concern is misguided. Cigarettes are a non-deferrable purchase. They are low cost and are a necessity for many customers. Consumers have better ways to save money. They will cut spending on high-priced items or drive less to save on gas.
Furthermore, they may negotiate with employers to work more often at home, cutting travel costs.

Smokers will give up other things before quitting cigarettes. Still, if they reduce smoking only slightly, it will not have a meaningful impact on Altria’s business.
Microsoft (MSFT)

Software sales are weakening but Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a broad portfolio to rely on.
In cloud computing, Microsoft’s Azure will keep growing. Corporations need to consolidate their software sources. For example, customers that use Microsoft Office, SQL Server, and Microsoft Teams may consider Azure, too. They would benefit from switching away from Amazon.com’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS. By running on one Microsoft platform, customers will realize efficiencies while cutting down on complexity.
Investors tend to punish all stocks during a market crash, including selling MSFT stock. But then they’ll regret this mistake when market conditions improve.
In five years, shareholders should expect Microsoft to generate at least $400 billion in revenue and nearly $150 billion in earnings.
During the technology software bubble, companies that could not produce a profit got a lot of attention. After investors sold those stocks, they will look for long-term profitable ones. Microsoft will reward investors who have a five to 10 year time horizon.
NextEra Energy (NEE)

Earlier this month, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) announced higher adjusted earnings per share expectations during its investor conference.
On June 14, the firm raised its expected adjusted earnings per share for the next four years to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.90; $2.98 to $3.13; $3.23 to $3.43; and $3.45 to $3.70, respectively. In 2025, its growth rate is between 6% and 8%. This positive trend will lead to regular dividend payment increases.
In the first quarter, NextEra Energy posted non-GAAP earnings per share of 74 cents. Shareholders briefly sold the stock in disappointment over its 22.5% year-over-year revenue decline, to $2.89 billion. Fortunately, the company will clear up uncertainties surrounding established tariffs with the Commerce Department.

NextEra’s Florida Power and Light continue to perform well. In the next four years, the company has strong visibility in the unit’s performance after the settlement agreement. The company will benefit as it realizes over $400 million in run-rate savings in the next few years.
Shopify (SHOP)

Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) led the decline as investors sold e-commerce firms. On June 14, 2022, producer price index figures fell slightly. This suggests peak inflation, which would benefit Shopify’s business.
Merchant sales volumes recover when inflation rates slow or decline. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive fight against inflation will benefit Shopify’s ecosystem in the end. While the company ignores the stock price dropping, it is investing in fulfillment logistics.
In May 2022, Shopify bought Deliverr for $2.1 billion in cash and stock. The acquisition will give Shopify’s independent business customers an edge. They will have a powerful logistics platform that increases the customers’ satisfaction. Shopify’s moat as the de-facto e-commerce platform strengthens after it combines Shopify Fulfillment Network (SNF) with Deliverr’s Shop Promise. Shop Promise gives customers two-day and next-day delivery. It also expands options for facilitating merchant storage, freight, inventory management, and product returns.
In 2019, Shopify acquired 6 River Systems. The purchase increased the speed and reliability of warehouse operations. The system facilitated inventory replenishment, picking, sorting and packing activities.

2022-06-27 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) Gains As Market Dips: What You Should Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-gains-as-market-dips%3A-what-you-should-know-2,,,"In the latest trading session, Intel (INTC) closed at $38.63, marking a +0.05% move from the previous day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.3% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.1%.
Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's largest chipmaker had lost 13.33% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.24% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.62% in that time.
Investors will be hoping for strength from Intel as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Intel is projected to report earnings of $0.75 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 41.41%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $17.98 billion, down 8.42% from the year-ago period.
Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.50 per share and revenue of $75.38 billion. These totals would mark changes of -36.01% and -3.4%, respectively, from last year.
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Intel. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.
Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.73% lower within the past month. Intel is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Intel has a Forward P/E ratio of 11.03 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 10.15, so we one might conclude that Intel is trading at a premium comparatively.
Meanwhile, INTC's PEG ratio is currently 1.47. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Semiconductor - General industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.91 as of yesterday's close.
The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 165, putting it in the bottom 35% of all 250+ industries.
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

2022-06-27 00:00:00+00:00,Still Think Tesla Is Expensive? This Stat Will Change Your Mind,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/still-think-tesla-is-expensive-this-stat-will-change-your-mind,,,"Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has probably been the biggest success story on the stock market in the last few years. Even after a pullback this year, the stock is up 1,500% over the past three years, rewarding investors who held through a volatile period with 16x gains.
Tesla's status as one of the biggest battleground stocks is also no secret. CEO Elon Musk may be as well known for making controversial remarks as he is for being a visionary leader, and critics have long cheered for the company's demise. They've argued at one point or another that Tesla is bound for bankruptcy, its results are only propped up by government credits, or that competition will come along and wipe out its premium valuation.
Bears love to argue that the company is massively overvalued, saying it's driven mostly by hype, and in some ways that charge makes sense. At recent prices, Tesla has a market cap over $750 billion, while larger automakers like Ford and General Motors are valued at just $48 billion and $51 billion.
However, apples-to-apples comparisons are difficult with these stocks since Tesla is a fast-growing electric vehicle maker with high profit margins, while Ford and GM are slow-growth, low-margin incumbents. Though both Ford and GM are transitioning to produce electric vehicles, their sales of EVs are only likely to cannibalize sales of their traditional combustion vehicles. It's a classic innovator's dilemma. Tesla, on the other hand, has a clear edge with a decade-long head start in EV technology as well as advantages like its supercharger network, well-loved brand, and it doesn't face the kind of conflicts that legacy automakers will, including dealer networks that are resistant to EV's since they require less maintenance. It also offers firmware-over-the-air updates, which most of its legacy competitors have been unable to match.
Not only that, but the numbers themselves don't indicate that Tesla is overvalued, at least not compared to the broader market.
The PEG ratio
There's no perfect way to value a stock. Many investors like to use the price-to-earnings ratio, which offers a good snapshot for how a company's price compares to its current earnings.
The flaw with the P/E ratio though is that it ignores a company's future growth, which is often the most important factor in determining its value. Tesla, for example, currently has a P/E ratio around 96, but it's expected to grow revenue by 59% this year, and earnings per share is forecast to jump 79% to $12.11, giving it a more reasonable forward P/E of almost 60.
The best way to measure both price-to-earnings and growth is with the PEG ratio, a favorite metric of famed hedge fund manager Peter Lynch. The PEG ratio divides the price-to-earnings ratio by the expected earnings growth rate, generally the compound average over the next five years. Since high P/E companies tend to have high growth rates, the PEG is a good way to compare valuations of both high- and low-growth stocks.
Lynch, who ran Fidelity's Magellan Fund in the '80s, theorized that an accurately valued stock would trade at a PEG of 1, while a PEG over 1 would indicate the stock was overvalued, and a PEG under 1 would mean that it's undervalued. However, back then, stock valuations were much lower, due in part to sky-high interest rates. The P/E of the S&P 500 was below 15 for nearly all of the time Lynch ran his fund. By comparison, since 2000, the P/E of the S&P 500 has almost never been below 15, in part because of the emergence of the fast-growing tech sector. As P/E ratios have inflated, so has the PEG, and a PEG of 1 no longer seems like an accurate benchmark.
At recent prices, Tesla trades at a moderate PEG of 1.66. That ratio actually makes the stock cheaper than the average stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has a PEG of 2.41. And that doesn't include the four stocks on the index that have negative PEG values due to expected declining earnings.
You can see the list below.
DOW COMPONENT PEG RATIO
American Express 1.22
Amgen 1.42
Apple 2.36
Boeing 6.53
Caterpillar 1.56
Cisco 2.21
Chevron 3.85
Home Depot 2.31

Data source: S&P Global Market Intelligence
Not only does the average Dow stock trade at a significantly higher PEG ratio than Tesla, but 19 of the 26 companies above are also more expensive than Tesla based on the PEG ratio. In other words, when you factor in growth, Tesla is cheaper than your typical blue-chip stock.
The PEG ratio isn't perfect, of course, and divining Tesla's growth rate, especially five years from now, may be a fool's errand. But it's a mistake to discount the company's growth rate, especially since Tesla has a solid track record of beating analyst estimates in recent years, topping them in 10 of the last 11 quarters.
Tesla is the clear leader in EVs, penetrating a massive addressable market that will take shape over the next 10 or 20 years. A lot can change during that time, and competition is likely to rise, but given Tesla's early leadership and brand strength, it's the clear favorite in the industry.
Bears will surely continue to knock the stock. But at this point, if you're arguing that it's overvalued, the numbers simply don't back that up.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-06-24 00:00:00+00:00,7 Large-Cap Stocks to Buy After the Next Big Correction,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-large-cap-stocks-to-buy-after-the-next-big-correction,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It seems that aggressive, contractionary monetary policies have already paved way for another correction for equities. With inflation, aggressive rate hikes and fear of a recession, I would focus on large-cap stocks to buy.
It’s worth noting that large-cap stocks generally have a low beta. As such, a big move in a short time period does not come often. However, with several headwinds, revised earnings and margin guidance have resulted in some knee-jerk reaction. Even for large-cap stocks.
A good example is Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock, which traded at highs above $160 in April 2022. Currently, the stock trades 26% below those highs. I believe that these corrections provide a golden opportunity to grab quality large-cap stocks at attractive valuations.
7 Retirement Stocks to Buy in Unexpected Sectors
With the markets still bleeding, let’s focus on seven large-cap stocks to buy that are worth keeping in the radar. Any significant correction in these stocks would present a good entry opportunity. Over the next few years, rewards will come in the form of dividends and stock upside.
TICKER COMPANY RECENT PRICE
CVX Chevron Corporation $142.43
COST Costco Wholesale Corporation $475.00
JNJ Johnson & Johnson $179.66
KO The Coca-Cola Company $61.88
MCD McDonald’s Corporation $243.58
TSLA Tesla, Inc. $705.21
INTC Intel Corporation $37.41
Chevron

Even with broad market correction, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) stock has remained in an uptrend. However, with growing fears of recession, there is likely to be some correction in oil prices. A potential 10% to 15% correction in CVX stock would be a good buying opportunity.
Chevron is possibly among the best oil and gas stocks in terms of balance sheet fundamentals. As of first quarter 2022, the company reported a net-debt ratio of 10.8%.
Further, with low break-even assets, the company has the potential to generate robust cash flows. For the current year, Chevron is on-track to deliver operating cash flow in excess of $30 billion.
With strong fundamentals, Chevron expects to invest $15 to $17 billion annually. These investments are likely to translate into sustained growth and cash flow upside.
The company is also investing significantly in renewable assets. The acquisition of Renewable Energy Group will make Chevron the largest producer of renewable fuels in North America. Overall, CVX stock is worth keeping in the radar for an attractive entry point.
Costco Wholesale

Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock has corrected from 52-week highs of $612 to current levels around $460. While the correction has been meaningful, COST stock still trades at a forward price-to-earnings-ratio of 34.9. On a relative basis, the stock seems expensive in the retail space.
Having said that, Costco is a quality name to consider for long-term exposure. The company’s comparable store sales growth has been robust. Further, with omni-channel presence, sales growth has accelerated. For Q2 2022, Costco reported 16.4% growth in sales to $51.61 billion.
Costco also generates robust cash flows from membership fees. In the last 12 months, the company reported $4.1 billion in membership income. With a high renewal rate and growth in member households, growth in membership fees will boost cash flows.

Inflationary pressure is a near-term headwind, coupled with the possibility of a recession in 2023. If these trigger further correction in COST stock, it would be a good buying opportunity.
Johnson & Johnson

Among large-cap stocks to buy on correction, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)  is worth keeping in the radar. The 2.7% dividend yield stock has been sideways for year-to-date 2022. Even as broader markets corrected. Even a 10% correction would be a good entry point in this low-beta stock.
In November 2021, Johnson & Johnson announced that it plans to split into two companies. The consumer product and pharmaceutical division would be separate entities in the next 12-18 months. This is likely to be positive for shareholders with the pharmaceutical division likely to be the key value creator.
For Q1 2022, the company’s consumer division reported sales decline of 1.5%. However, sales growth in the pharmaceutical and medical devices segment was 6.3% and 5.9%, respectively. In the pharmaceutical segment, the oncology and infectious disease segment were the key growth drivers. With an attractive innovation pipeline, growth is likely to sustain.
Overall, JNJ stock is worth adding to the long-term portfolio. The stock resilience in the last few months is an indication of the value the company holds.
The Coca-Cola Company
Source: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock has also been resilient amid the broad market carnage. I believe that the stock is slightly expensive at a forward P/E of 24.0. However, the stock is worth keeping in the radar for shopping on any potential correction.
For 2022, Coca-Cola has guided for revenue growth of 7% to 8%. However, in Q1 2022, the company guided for mid-single-digit percentage headwind on comparable cost of goods sold. With inflation continuing to accelerate, there might be a case for more than expected margin compression.
Any correction due to the margin pressure factor will provide long-term investors with an attractive entry point. Beyond the inflationary headwind, the company’s growth outlook remains stable. The company has been gaining value share in total non-alcoholic, ready-to-drink beverages.
7 Retirement Stocks to Buy in Unexpected Sectors
Also, long-term cash flows are likely to remain robust. For Q1 2022, the company’s free cash flow was $400 million. This implies an annualized FCF potential of $1.6 billion. KO stock dividends are therefore safe and a dividend yield of 2.97% looks attractive.
McDonald’s
Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock is another large-cap stock that’s attractive for the long-term. However, it makes sense to wait for some correction before exposure.
Inflation is a concern for the restaurant industry. The impact of higher food inflation will be felt in the coming quarters. This is one factor that can trigger a correction in MCD stock. Recession is also a concern. However, it’s unlikely that a recession would have a significant impact on sales.
In terms of positives, McDonald’s reported global comparable sales growth of 11.8% for Q1 2022. With sustained growth in digital sales, the overall momentum is likely to sustain.
Additionally, McDonald’s guided for 1,400 new restaurant openings in 2022. In the near-term, this growth will be offset by the divestment of the company’s Russian business. However, aggressive new restaurant openings will ensure that long-term growth sustains.
For long-term investors, McDonald’s is likely to remain a cash flow machine. The current dividend yield of 2.3% is sustainable and there is visibility for dividend growth.
Tesla
Source: Christopher Lyzcen / Shutterstock.com
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has already witnessed a deep correction from 52-week highs. However, TSLA stock still trades at a forward P/E of 53. If there is further correction for the broad markets, the stock can go lower.
Having said that, it makes sense to accumulate some TSLA stock even at current levels. The electric vehicle industry has multi-year tailwinds and Tesla is likely to remain the market leader.
7 REITs to Buy for a Profitable Summer
Even with supply chain concerns, the company has reported healthy production and delivery numbers. It’s worth noting that Tesla also has an attractive line-up that includes Cybertruck, Tesla Semi and Roadster.
Vehicle deliveries growth is therefore likely to remain steady. Ramp-up of production at the Gigafactory in Europe will also contribute to revenue upside. Tesla has already been generating robust cash flows. Considering the industry outlook and the company’s global presence, there is ample headroom for value creation.
Intel
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has also been in a correction mode. At a forward P/E of 10.3 the 3.95% dividend yield stock looks very attractive.
In the near-term, Intel has disappointed the markets with a lowered guidance. This is the key reason behind a 15.5% correction in the last one month. However, the long-term outlook is still positive with the chipmaker focusing on innovation and gaining back market share.
It’s worth noting that for Q1 2022, the client computing segment reported a 13% decline in revenue on a year-on-year basis. However, data-center and AI group revenue increased by 22%. With strong demand for Xeon from hyperscale and enterprise customers, the segment outlook remains positive.
Intel has also invested in emerging businesses that can create long-term value. A good example is Mobileye, which is also due for listing through an IPO.
Overall, semiconductor demand is likely to remain stable in the long-term. Intel will continue to deliver robust cash flows. At current valuation, there seems ample scope for stock upside. Dividends are also sustainable in the long-term.

2022-06-23 00:00:00+00:00,3 Must-Have Chip Stocks to Buy for Q3,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-must-have-chip-stocks-to-buy-for-q3,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Equity markets have suffered a full recession this year, and the bulls are still struggling to find footing. They have had strong days, but not in sequence long enough to make a difference. Therefore the algo behavior has been consistently selling rallies. As a result, the Nasdaq has now corrected 31% off of its highs. Today we will discuss three opportunities that have come to life among the chip stocks posse. They make a good bit of the Nasdaq index, so there are bargains among them.
But first we have to acknowledge the risk from the macroeconomic conditions. Even though the correction has been harsh so far, there’s still plenty of potential downside to go. The Nasdaq, for example, is still 19% above the 2020 January highs. Those highs quickly vanished. This is to say that some bargains may actually still be bull traps. Therefore careful consideration is necessary to find the real ones.
There are many segments among the chip stocks, and I varied my choices among them. Narrowing the list down to a worthy few is a tough task, so I know I wasn’t perfect. There are other companies that deserve to be on here that I omitted. The logic I used would allow you to expand the list to include your favorite chip stocks.
I’m focusing first on quality, because I want to eliminate all intrinsic questions. This keeps me from having to focus on external risks. Second, I’m looking for stocks that have fallen far enough to have technical support readily available.
7 REITs to Buy for a Profitable Summer
For example, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an outstanding leader in the segment. But its stock is still 50% above the pandemic breakout. Although there is support below, I fear the bearish altitude that is still available back to the 2020 levels. This is a little bit better for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD); nevertheless it is still still too high for me to feel comfortable with it.
INTC Intel $37.32
MU Micron $56.46
SMH VanEck Semiconductor ETF $207.19
Intel (INTC)
Source: Charts by TrendSpider
Among major chip stocks, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is the cheapest. Its stock is also the only one deep inside support zones below 2020 levels. It may not be the sexiest headliner, but it’s a critical player.
INTC stock has already shed all of its Covid-19 rally weight and is bouncing off of support from 2015. In fact, those levels were also important at the tail end of the dot-com bubble burst. These are signs that the easy work for the bears is complete. To take it significantly further south from here will take a lot more hard work.
There is tremendous value inside the company, and it is tangible. The financial metrics of Intel stock are beyond reproach. While it is not excitingly explosive, the dollars it produces are huge. The only knock against it is that perception that it’s boring and lagging.
I don’t believe that perception is everything, so this will eventually change. I have recently purchased two AMD computers, and I already plan on going back to Intel for my next. My perception of AMD’s supremacy was wrong.
If stocks markets are building a bottom, then Intel stock is worth holding a starter position.
Micron (MU)
Source: Charts by TrendSpider
The underlying thesis behind investing in chip stocks is that the world is going digital. This is a trend that started decades ago, but it has accelerated exponentially in the last three years. The urgency to go online has created a wave to sustain businesses like Micron (NASDAQ:MU). Mu stock has been a star before, but has failed to crack into the three digits. The trend is proper enough to forecast more upside in the long term.
Its last attempt at $100 per share ended this year $1.55 short. Since then, MU stock has lost 44% of its value. It is now at a place of balance near January 2020 levels. These are lines that were in play two years prior. Such pivotal zones usually provide support for stocks on the way down.
Support does not always translate into an absolute floor, so we should consider the potential for lower prices. When the micro-economic conditions are this iffy, taking partial positions at first makes total sense. The fundamental metrics for Micron are impressive enough to eliminate risks of management flubs. I would like to see more improvement in net income since growth is tepid.

Nevertheless, last year the company generated $12.5 billion in cash from continuing operations. That’s pretty close to the peak of 2018. In other words, management is doing a better job in tougher conditions. Those are votes of confidence in my book. For this reason, MU deserves to be among the chip stocks to buy on this dip.
VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)
Source: Charts by TrendSpider
Another pick could have easily been Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) or Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). But instead I will make it a blanket bet on the sector. This approach diffuses the risk inherent in any single stock. So my last pick today is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH).
This one encompasses two of our picks today and the rest of the greats. Each has varying degrees of influence on SMH, and they collectively trade together. My only concern here is that SMH stock is still about 10% above its 2020 breakout levels. So for that reason I would consider this my least favorite of the three today.
Since it’s an ETF, it inherits its fundamental metrics from its components. And there are very few stocks within it that have questionable futures. My confidence in the quality of these chip stocks within it is high. But since it is not absolute, I would leave room for error. Going all in here would be a bit of an exaggeration of my endorsement.

2022-06-23 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting INTC Put And Call Options For August 5th,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-intc-put-and-call-options-for-august-5th,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options begin trading today, for the August 5th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new August 5th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $37.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $37.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $35.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $37.33/share today.
Because the $37.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.14% return on the cash commitment, or 43.59% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $37.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $38.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.56. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $37.33/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $38.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.97% if the stock gets called away at the August 5th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $38.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $38.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.18% boost of extra return to the investor, or 35.47% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the call contract example above is 38%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $37.33) to be 32%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-06-23 00:00:00+00:00,Driverless Taxis Are Here. How Should Investors Play It?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/driverless-taxis-are-here.-how-should-investors-play-it,,,"Y
esterday was a massive day in the world of self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (AVs). Cruise, a subsidiary of GM (GM), gave rides in their completely driverless AVs to fare-paying customers in San Francisco, marking the first time that has happened in the U.S.
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) subsidiary Waymo has been offering an autonomous ride-hailing service since 2020 with a “safety driver” behind the wheel, but this still marks a big step forward.
If some of the fearmongers are to be believed, we should brace ourselves for a series of horror stories about fiery crashes killing those foolish enough to get in a car without a human in charge. So far, however, in the first day of operation, that hasn’t been the case. Given the massive number of accidents caused every day by human error, and the fact that there have been only 18 reported accidents involving Waymo in the past 20 months, that is a pretty good start for AVs. For investors, however, safety isn’t the issue.
The biggest problem that the industry faces at this point, of course, is not logic, but feelings. Logically, having a computer drive your car, which unlike a human being, cannot be drunk, overly tired, distracted by its phone, in a bad mood or be the cause of a crash for whatever reason, is inherently the safer option. That, however, doesn’t matter to a lot of people. They simply cannot get their heads around the fact that the car doesn’t have a person at the wheel and feel that it simply must be dangerous.
That sentiment will fade eventually, just as resistance to every revolutionary technology does. This means that there will be some huge opportunities for companies in the space, and therefore for investors in those companies. The problems for investors, though, are somewhat more complex and harder to overcome.
First and foremost, as you may have noticed, both of the operational AV ride-hailing services at this point are operated by subsidiaries of much larger companies. You can buy stock in Alphabet or GM to play on their success, but even with rapid expansion, Waymo and Cruise will represent only a tiny part of those two companies’ operations for years to come. The same argument applies to other car makers who have a strong commitment to AVs, such as Ford (F), Volkswagen (VWAGY) and Tesla (TSLA).
It can also be said of chip makers who have committed to the space, such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC), but that still may be a good way for long-term investors to play the coming boom. They have developed specialized chips for AVs, demand for which can be expected to grow exponentially over the next decade, whether the most successful AV maker during that time is one, some, or all of the above, or even if it turns out to be a name not yet known.
In cases where there is a bright future for an industry, but uncertainty about who will dominate it, an ETF that spreads your single-company risk can often be the best answer for investors. But with AVs, it isn’t that easy. There are several offerings that incorporate AVs, but almost all of them also hold stock in electric vehicle companies that may or may not be fully committed to AV technology. The closest ETF to an AV only play is probably the SPDR Kensho Smart Mobility ETF (HAIL), but even that has holdings in things like airlines that aren’t directly tied to self-driving cars.
In short, the problem for investors is that there is very little out there that acts as a “pure play” investment in autonomous vehicles. This is a case, though, where we shouldn’t allow perfect to be the enemy of good. The auto industry is being transformed and that will lead to a boom with huge potential profits. So, dedicating a small percentage of your portfolio to a few relevant stocks such as chip makers, car companies committed to the technology, and something like HAIL will probably pay off in the long run.

2022-06-22 00:00:00+00:00,The Ultimate Growth Stocks to Buy With $100 Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-ultimate-growth-stocks-to-buy-with-%24100-right-now-0,,,"The stock market is crashing, and high-growth companies are now available at enticing valuations, which means now is a great time for investors to buy some solid stocks on the cheap.
More importantly, investors can start buying shares of top companies amid the ongoing stock market sell-off even with small amounts thanks to the power of fractional investing. For instance, investors can buy fractional shares of growth stocks such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) even if they have limited funds -- say $100. Let's look at the reasons it would be a good idea to put $100 into the graphics specialist right now.
Nvidia is a top growth stock to buy right now
Nvidia stock is available at a nice discount today. It is trading at 42 times trailing earnings, which makes it way cheaper than 2021's price-to-earnings ratio of 90. Buying $100 worth of Nvidia stock at this valuation looks like a good deal considering its impressive growth and bright prospects.
Nvidia had delivered fiscal 2023 first-quarter revenue of $8.29 billion, up 46% from the prior-year period. Near-term challenges are going to weigh on Nvidia's growth, but analysts remain upbeat about its prospects in the long run. The semiconductor giant's earnings are expected to clock average annual growth of nearly 23% for the next five years, though it won't be surprising to see it clock faster gains thanks to a bunch of solid catalysts.
The video gaming and data center markets should help Nvidia sustain its terrific growth in the coming years. However, the lucrative opportunities in fast-growing niches such as automotive and the omniverse, which are already giving the company's business a nice shot in the arm, could accelerate the company's business gains.
But then, Nvidia isn't the only growth stock you may want to invest $100 in. There are quite a few other fast-growing companies that are available at mouthwatering multiples.
This little-known chipmaker is benefiting from a massive opportunity
Ambarella (NASDAQ: AMBA) may not be a household name, but it has been clocking impressive growth lately thanks to the markets it serves.
Ambarella's chips power cameras used for automotive and security applications. The chipmaker's fiscal 2023 first-quarter revenue increased 29% year over year to $90.3 million. Adjusted earnings shot up to $0.44 per share from $0.23 per share in the prior-year period.
Supply chain challenges will hurt Ambarella's near-term momentum. But the growing deployment of cameras in the automotive industry along with an upgrade cycle in the security camera market means Ambarella has a huge addressable revenue opportunity ahead of it. In the automotive segment, for instance, Ambarella estimates that its serviceable addressable market could exceed $7 billion by fiscal 2028, which would be a big increase over this year's estimate of just over $2.5 billion.
The good part is that Ambarella has already scored $700 million worth of design wins in the automotive market that it expects to realize over the next five fiscal years. A design win means that Ambarella's chips have been selected for deployment in vehicles by its customers, and they should translate into revenue once those vehicles go into production. What's more, Ambarella says it has an additional $1.1 billion worth of automotive design wins in the pipeline.
As such, Ambarella's impressive growth could continue in the long run. With the stock trading at 7.6 times sales as compared to last year's multiple of 24, buying this potential growth stock looks like a smart move right now.
A no-brainer stock to buy
There is a massive demand for semiconductors around the globe that chipmakers can't meet, and Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) is one company that can play a key role in alleviating that shortage. The company's products are in huge demand as it had generated a record $23 billion in revenue in fiscal 2021 (which ended on Oct. 31, 2021), an increase of 34% over the prior year.
However, Applied Materials stock slid 43% this year as the company itself has fallen prey to the supply chain snarls that are impacting the entire semiconductor industry.
But this slide means investors can now buy Applied Materials stock for just 13 times trailing earnings, a big discount over last year's earnings multiple of over 24. Buying the stock at this valuation looks like a no-brainer. That's because Applied Materials' semiconductor manufacturing equipment is used by major chipmakers such as Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC, while Intel is another major customer.
Samsung and TSMC together accounted for 35% of Applied Materials' total revenue last year, and the good part is that both foundries have pledged to spend huge amounts on ramping up their capacities in the long run. TSMC, for instance, is expected to raise its capital spending by 47% this year to $44 billion, while Samsung plans to invest $150 billion in its foundry business through the end of the decade.
IC Insights estimates that the semiconductor industry's capital spending could increase 24% in 2022 to a new all-time high of $190 billion. It won't be surprising to see the trend of higher capital spending continue in the long run as the semiconductor industry is expected to generate annual revenue of $1 trillion by 2030 as compared to $600 billion in 2021, according to McKinsey.
So, Applied Materials has a lot of room for growth in the future. The company had an order backlog worth $8 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which increased further in the second quarter, though the company didn't give an exact figure. The good part is that Applied Materials expects its order inflow to remain strong going into 2023 and beyond.
All this indicates that Applied Materials could turn out to be a top growth stock in the long run, and the stock's slide gives investors a great opportunity to buy on the cheap.

2022-06-21 00:00:00+00:00,Which Old-School Tech Dividend Stocks are Most Buyable?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/which-old-school-tech-dividend-stocks-are-most-buyable,,,"New-age tech and other unprofitable growth companies have seen their share prices implode over the past year. It's been brutal for new investors who failed to diversify their portfolios beyond the exciting plays that seemed to only surge higher in 2021.
The days of easy money are coming to an end. Still, many old-school tech companies with solid cash flows have been dragged lower amid the latest tech carnage.
Though many higher-yielding tech companies have challenges of their own, they seem less scary to scoop up amid the Fed's tightening. In this piece, we used TipRanks' Comparison tool to compare three old-tech dividend payers to see which offers the best bang for one's buck.
Cisco (CSCO)
Cisco stock is in the midst of a nasty slump, now down around 32% from its peak just north of $60 per share. The $180 billion network equipment maker looks to be flirting with 2020 lows again. Though Cisco has endured serious supply-side constraints, its focus on software and services could help the firm expand upon its margins over the long haul.
For now, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China have created a perfect storm of headwinds. As the digital transformation continues, though, demand for Cisco's hardware and software is unlikely to wane for too long a duration.
Looking ahead, an economic slowdown could take a bite out of demand. Pending a hard-landing from the Fed, though, enterprise spending on Cisco products may not plunge nearly as drastically as some expect.
At the end of the day, Cisco is an old-time company with staying power. At writing, the stock trades at 15.2 times trailing earnings and 3.5 times sales, with a dividend yield of 3.5%.
Wall Street is staying bullish on the name, with the average Cisco price target of $52.17 implying 20.2% upside.
IBM (IBM)
IBM is another slumping old-school tech company that's seen its dividend yield swell over the years. The stock yields 4.89% after its latest slump. Unlike most other tech firms, IBM has held its own rather well in 2022. That's because it's been a multi-year slog for IBM, which has failed to impress investors seeking cutting-edge innovation.
While IBM is still innovating, it's at risk of falling even further behind the competition. Undoubtedly, the 5%-yielding dividend is a hefty commitment that takes away from R&D. With the low-growth Kyndryl now spun off, IBM has a heavy weight off its shoulders. However, it's unclear as to how the long-time tech titan can get its growth groove back.
IBM's business clientele has proven sticky over the years. Still, we could reach a point where the high switching costs are worth enduring to enjoy the innovations provided by IBM's cloud peers.
As a $121 billion behemoth, IBM is doing its best to pivot. However, it's hard to do so with so much bloat built up over the years. The Kyndryl spin-off is a critical first step towards getting back on track. That said, switching costs seem to be falling across the industry, with software-as-a-service cloud companies that could move to usage-based pricing from the subscription-based one that's commonplace today.
Wall Street remains bullish on IBM, with the average IBM price target of $152.11, implying 12.7% upside.
Intel (INTC)
Intel is the chip giant that's lost its lead over the years. Like most other old-tech companies with huge dividend yields (Intel yields 3.95% at writing), the company needs to balance rewarding shareholders and innovation efforts. While Intel has a mighty dividend and a plan to return to the top, I'd be much more comfortable if the firm slashed its payout and focused more of its capital on innovation.
The chip space is wildly competitive, and once you lose the lead, it can be hard to get it back. Though I think Intel can meet the goals laid out in its multi-year plan, it's worth noting that Intel's rivals are also getting stronger over the timeframe.
As chips get faster and cheaper with time, Intel could be at risk of discounting, and that could impact margins negatively. Big tech firms think they can produce their own chips. As they cut Intel out of the equation, Intel seems like an underdog with lousy odds.
Betting on an underdog comes with its perks, like the higher dividend and a rock-bottom multiple. At 1.9 times sales and 6.1 times trailing earnings, Intel is a deep-value stock with not a lot of expectations baked in.
Turning to Wall Street, analysts are bullish, with the average Intel price target of $51.19 implying 38.44% upside.
Conclusion
Betting on tech firms that have fallen behind the curve can be tricky. As rates rise, their small, unprofitable rivals could begin to slow in pace. Higher rates are detrimental to small, unprofitable tech. However, for profitable firms that have fallen behind, higher rates could bring forth an opportunity to catch up.
Of the three old-school tech titans in this piece, Wall Street seems most upbeat on Intel.

This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.22% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.13%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.22%.
Coming into today, shares of the world's largest chipmaker had lost 11.24% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 9.55%, while the S&P 500 lost 10.02%.
Intel will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Intel to post earnings of $0.70 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 45.31%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $17.98 billion, down 8.42% from the prior-year quarter.
For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $3.50 per share and revenue of $75.38 billion, which would represent changes of -36.01% and -3.4%, respectively, from the prior year.
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Intel should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.

2022-06-20 00:00:00+00:00,Intel seeks $624 mln in interest from EU after antitrust fine win,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-seeks-%24624-mln-in-interest-from-eu-after-antitrust-fine-win,,,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS, June 20 (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Intel INTC.O has filed a claim for 593 million euros ($624 million) in interest from the European Commission, five months after it convinced Europe's second-top court to scrap a 1.06-billion-euro EU antitrust fine, an EU filing showed on Monday.
Europe's top court paved the way for such damage demands last year in a landmark ruling which ordered the EU executive to pay default interest on reimbursed fines in annulled antitrust cases.
Judges said late payment of interest will itself incur interest as well.
Intel in its application to the Luxembourg-based General Court said the Commission, which acts as the competition watchdog in the 27-country European Union, had refused to reimburse the company the default interest.
The Commission returned $1.2 billion to Intel after its court defeat in January this year.
Intel said its claim is based on an interest rate equivalent to the European Central Bank's refinancing rate of 1.25% beginning from May 2009, and that this should be increased to 3.5% from August 2009 to February this year when the EU repaid the company fine, minus 38 million euros in an interest amount paid to Intel by the Commission.
The case is T-236/22.

2022-06-20 00:00:00+00:00,Apple’s Innovations Position the Stock for Long-Term Growth,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apples-innovations-position-the-stock-for-long-term-growth,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Despite ongoing supply chain and regulatory pressures, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to roll out new features and products that will help keep its business and the AAPL stock price buoyant over the long-term.
Apple just wrapped up its annual Worldwide Developers Conference where it introduced several new software features and products that impressed attendees and generated positive media coverage. And while AAPL stock continues to decline along with the broader market, down 26% year-to-date at $132 a share, the Cupertino, California-based company’s innovations and new products position it to rebound strongly when the market finally acquiesces and begins to recover.
AAPL Apple $132
Pay Later Service
The big news coming out of Apple’s developer’s conference was a pay-later option that moves the company further into the financial services sector. The new payment feature, called Apple Pay Later, is an addition to its popular Wallet app, and part of the consumer electronics giant’s expansion into the world of online finance.
7 Long-Term Stocks That Never Go Out of Style
Apple Pay Later enables people to pay for things over four equal installments, paid monthly without any interest being charged. The move into the pay later loan segment puts Apple into direct competition with major financial technology (fintech) players such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM).
However, Apple, which has had success launching its own credit cards, is well-positioned to succeed and win market share in the buy now, pay later space, say analysts.
Other news coming out of Apple’s weeklong conference was the unveiling of the latest iPhone software, iOS 16, which includes a new lock screen; two new Mac computers, including the biggest refresh of its MacBook Air model in more than a decade; improvements to the Apple Watch that include the addition of atrial fibrillation detection to help with heart health; an overhaul of Apple CarPlay that will integrate it more with a vehicle’s instruments such as the speedometer and other gauges; and more multitasking features for the iPad, including a long-awaited weather app.
All the new technologies will use Apple’s proprietary M2 chip, which the company developed internally after ending its long-term relationship with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
Overseas Challenges
The latest upgrades, products and features position Apple for a strong future and should help the company remain at the front of the pack in the consumer electronics space.
However, in the near-term, Apple continues to manage a number of overseas challenges that are weighing on its share price. These include ongoing Covid-19 lockdowns in China that have impacted its manufacturing and difficulty sourcing components and managing supply chains throughout Asia that threaten production of its iPhone.
Any challenges to the iPhone are bad news for Apple, as global sales of the popular smartphone continue to account for more than half of the company’s revenue, generating almost $192 billion in 2021.
On the other side of the world, in Europe, Apple also faces some near-term headwinds. European antitrust regulators have charged Apple with restricting rivals’ access to its chip technology in a move that could force the iPhone maker to open its mobile payment system to competition on the continent. The European Commission said it has sent Apple details of how the company has abused its dominant position in markets for mobile wallets on iOS devices and ordered that changes be made.
Separately, the EU has agreed to a single charging port for mobile phones, tablets and other electronic devices. That decision is seen as a blow to Apple, which must now change the connector on its iPhones sold in Europe by 2024. iPhones are in a unique position as they are charged from a Lightning cable that’s made in-house by Apple, while rival Android-based devices use more standard USB-C connectors.
Apple has warned that the proposal, which is designed to cut down on electronic waste, will hurt innovation going forward. However, it’s not clear how Apple will get around the new European requirements.
AAPL Stock Is Built for Long-Term Success
Despite some immediate issues, Apple continues to be the world’s dominant consumer electronics company and is likely to remain in that position for many years to come. Even as it manages supply chain issues in Asia and shifting regulations in Europe, the company continues to upgrade its existing products and introduce new ones that offer users constant improvements.
This approach has proven to be a recipe for success and should help Apple rebound mightily when the current market selloff finally ends. In the meantime, investors should view the current downturn in Apple’s share price as a buying opportunity. AAPL stock is a strong buy.

2022-06-19 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Stock Is an Undervalued Buy at Its 52-Week Low,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-stock-is-an-undervalued-buy-at-its-52-week-low,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock recently hit a new 52-week low as tech stocks have been hit hard due to a gloomy market outlook. Most high-beta technology stocks have plummeted recently due to a fear of yield curve inversion, which is a leading recession indicator. In addition, risk-aversion is causing all kinds of problems, causing many new market participants to run for the hills as a bear market emerges, subsequently causing the market to overshoot to the downside.
Despite the troubled market sentiment, many technology stocks are oversold, including Intel. I’ve had a thorough look at INTC stock’s prospects, leading me to think that it’s a must-own at its current price. Here’s why.
INTC Intel Corporation $36.90
INTC Stock From an Operational Perspective
Global semiconductor demand is still growing strongly. The industry’s latest top-line data reveals a 21% year-over-year increase in April sales. According to Semiconductor Industry Association CEO John Neuffer, “global semiconductor sales have increased by more than 20% on a year-to-year basis for 13 consecutive months, indicating consistently high and growing demand for semiconductors across a range of critical sectors.”
Although supply-chain issues persist, Intel owns a solid market position, as indicated by its gross margin of 54.32% and its return on invested capital of 8.67%. Solid market positioning gives the firm bargaining power over its suppliers, which could see it survive transitory supply-chain hurdles.
Furthermore, Intel exhibits high-quality commercial prospects. INTC still holds 63.5% of the central processing unit (CPU) market share. Despite the abrupt growth of the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, CPUs still represent a market that’s 10 times larger. Furthermore, CPUs have garnered renewed attention lately due to their application in artificial neural networks.
The company recently beat its first-quarter earnings target by 8 cents per share amid achieving key production milestones and product delivery goals. During the quarter, data center sales continued to rise, posting 22% year-over-year growth, network and edge group sales increased by 23%, and Intel’s foundry service revenue more than doubled to $283 million.
Assessing INTC’s Price Level
Intel stock is undervalued after dropping more than 28% since the turn of the year. I decided to utilize a relative valuation approach in my analysis, which accounts for mean reversion. Firstly, INTC stock’s price-to-earnings ratio is at a 33% discount to its 5-year average, suggesting that its earnings per share prospects are underpriced by the market. Moreover, INTC’s price-to-earnings ratio is at a peer group discount of 53%, implying that it’s a significantly overlooked stock.
Another factor that could support INTC stock from here onwards is its dividend profile. The stock sports a forward dividend yield of 3.9% with a dividend coverage ratio of 4.3%, conveying that INTC is a top-class dividend stock pick.
Flimsy markets stimulate demand for high-dividend stocks as investors flee risk-on assets. For example, high-dividend stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 on a relative basis in the past year, conveying investors’ “guaranteed yield-seeking” attitude during trying economic times. Thus, the current market environment could be suitable for Intel stock.

Intel stock is undervalued at its current price. The company owns a solid market share, exhibits attractive dividend properties, and provides innovative solutions. In addition, the market’s overreaction to a possible recession has left the stock oversold at a relative strength (RSI) of a mere 30, suggesting that a lucrative entry point has presented itself.

2022-06-17 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Corporation (INTC) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-corporation-intc-is-a-trending-stock%3A-facts-to-know-before-betting-on-it,,,"Intel (INTC) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -11.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -8.3% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Intel belongs, has lost 10.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.70 per share, indicating a change of -45.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $3.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -36%. This estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.66 indicates a change of +4.5% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +136.1%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Intel.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Intel, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $17.98 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -8.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $75.38 billion and $78.43 billion estimates indicate -3.4% and +4.1% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $18.35 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.7%. EPS of $0.87 for the same period compares with $1.39 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.18%. The EPS surprise was +8.75%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

2022-06-17 00:00:00+00:00,The 7 Smartest Dow Stocks to Buy if You Have $250 Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-7-smartest-dow-stocks-to-buy-if-you-have-%24250-right-now,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
While it doesn’t rank as the most exciting avenue in the market, investing in the companies listed on the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average could be one of the smartest moves, particularly because they’re some of the world’s most proven businesses. Still, you don’t want to just acquire anything. If you’re limited to just $250, you need to narrow down your list of Dow stocks to buy.
Given that the market has taken a turn for the volatile, it’s best to go with companies that can weather a recessionary storm. Here, analysts aren’t just being worrywarts. With the consumer price index indicating that inflation has run higher than anticipated, the Federal Reserve is raising benchmark interest rates until circumstances get under control. Therefore, Dow stocks to buy must take this dynamic into account.
7 Long-Term Stocks That Never Go Out of Style
To be clear, economic headwinds present speculative opportunities as many shares are now discounted from their highs. On the other hand, there are some names that might benefit from a downturn. We’ll tackle both topics for the below Dow stocks to buy if you have $250 right now.
Ticker Company Current Price
INTC Intel Corporation $37.34
WBA Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. $39.67
KO The Coca-Cola Company $57.09
MRK Merck & Co., Inc. $84.89
WMT Walmart Inc. $120.62
JPM JPMorgan Chase & Co. $113.43
CVX Chevron Corporation $155.48
Dow Stocks: Intel (INTC)

Semiconductor and technology specialist Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the hardest-hit names, putting INTC into the speculative discount category among Dow stocks to buy. With shares plunging 27% on a year-to-date basis, the idea here is to gamble that at some point, the tech firm will make its way higher. During the interim, you can collect its 3.9% dividend yield.
While that doesn’t initially sound like a pleasant narrative, the main focus for Intel investors is its vast business footprint, which ranges from data centers to personal computers to artificial intelligence and machine learning. The latter two categories is especially intriguing because of long-term projections.
According to Grand View Research, experts forecast that by 2030, sector revenue for the global AI market will hit $1.81 trillion. This tally represents a staggering compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.1% from 2022 to the end of the forecasted period.
Finally, an important anecdote: the cryptocurrency market launched during the Great Recession, meaning that tech never sleeps, even during economic downturns.
Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)

To be fair, while tech itself never sleeps, it doesn’t necessarily mean that every competitor in the space will be successful – far from it. To reduce the level of risk for your Dow stocks to buy but still maintain upward potential in choppy waters, you might want to direct your attention to Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA).
Operating the second-largest pharmacy store chain in the U.S., Walgreens (under the WBA parent organization) has fortuitously enjoyed significant relevance because of the coronavirus pandemic. Primarily, you can conveniently schedule your Covid-19 vaccine if you so wish. Further, it’s quite possible that should the monkeypox outbreak get out of hand, Walgreens will receive another dose of good fortune.
Second, the global pharmacy market size is poised to grow from $1.07 trillion in 2021 to $1.63 trillion by 2030, representing a CAGR of 4.7%. While it’s not the most page-turning growth stat, the consistent flow of consumer demand helps make WBA one of the best Dow stocks to buy.
Coca-Cola (KO)
Source: phloxii / Shutterstock.com
Just for pure marketing smarts, you might want to add Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) shares to your list of Dow stocks to buy. Recently, the soft-drink giant made headlines when it announced a partnership with Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF.A, NYSE:BF.B) to combine the Coke and Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey brands into one alcoholic beverage.
Interestingly, Coca-Cola has been aggressively expanding its alcohol drink options, per a CNN Business report. Cynically, some evidence indicates that as the economy goes down, drinking goes up. So, the iconic beverage firm is in the right business as far as I can tell.
Seriously, though, Coca-Cola’s traditional business has historically been pegged as a recession-resistant investment. Fundamentally, part of the reason stems from the “cheap respite” thesis. We all need a break during hard times and a sugary drink can provide the endorphins necessary to get us going.
Also, consumers may skimp out on expensive lattes and switch to Coke products, thus benefitting the underlying company.
Dow Stocks: Merck (MRK)
Source: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.com
Easily one of the best Dow stocks to buy should a recession hit us, pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE:MRK) doesn’t need an extra shot of relevance. However, it got one anyways in 2020 when the Covid-19 crisis broke out. Suddenly, the public at large was more vested in pharmaceutical and biotech innovations. And this impact could be felt for generations much like an economic crisis can leave a permanent imprint on young people.
But as fears of Covid-19 itself fades, Merck stands to benefit again. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “an estimated 40.9% of U.S. adults have avoided medical care during the pandemic because of concerns” related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. But now that the crisis is slipping into the rearview mirror, it’s excellent news for Merck’s top-tier pipeline.
Specifically, treatments like Keytruda – Merck’s top product – can be distributed more widely as the healthcare system normalizes. Therefore, MRK is one of the Dow stocks to buy on a favorable pivot.
Walmart (WMT)
Source: Harun Ozmen / Shutterstock.com
I’m going to preface the inclusion of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) with a caveat: I fully understand that WMT is risky based on the circumstances. Mainly, the consumer is getting absolutely rocked with inflation, which has contributed to a worrying decline in the dollar’s purchasing power. Plus, Walmart and other big-box retailers made some inventory forecasting boo-boos when they failed to account for experience-based demand (i.e., revenge traveling) stealing share from demand for physical goods.
Still, let’s be brutally honest: Walmart is one of the Dow stocks to buy because a recession could boost its profile, relatively speaking. As the pioneer of everyday low pricing, Walmart is built for a downturn. Heck, every time I walk into one of its stores, I get a depressing feeling.
In full transparency, from the perspective of technical analysis, WMT gap down moves following its most recent earnings report is troubling. Thus, prospective investors may want to wait a bit before diving in. Still, this is one of the Dow stocks to buy on discount as shopping won’t stop altogether – and Walmart knows how to offer this as cheaply as possible.
JPMorgan Chase (JPM)
Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com
Personally, I’m not exactly the greatest fan of big banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). While a higher interest rate environment theoretically helps JPM and its ilk through the ability to charge higher lending fees, the bigger concern is the stability of the economy. At some point, borrowing costs will get too onerous, thus killing risk incentive and broader growth.
Still, one area that could do really well for JPMorgan Chase is its wealth management division. You see, during a bull market, any Tom, Dick and Harry with a YouTube channel can give seemingly prescient advice. However, did you notice how these gurus look a little silly now that a certain cryptocurrency was struggling at $20,000?
Well, that’s where JPM and its wealth managers come into the picture. These folks are the real experts, having guided high-net-worth clients through bull and bear markets. So, if they can get the proper messaging out, JPM could be a surprising idea among Dow stocks to buy.
Dow Stocks: Chevron (CVX)
Source: JL IMAGES / Shutterstock.com
The majority of the Dow stocks to buy on this list suffered significant market losses, thus drawing the attention of speculators. That’s not the case at all with oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX). With Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) kicked out of the Dow 30, Chevron is basically the last of the Mohicans. And CVX is representing its sector well, gaining over 32% in 2022.
Technically, it’s on a small discount, down 12% over the trailing five days. But that’s not exactly why I’m mentioning CVX. Rather, the oil and gas market appears primed to rise higher throughout this year, if not into 2023. Of course, the catalyst is Russia’s destabilizing invasion of Ukraine, which has effectively shelved a significant portion of global energy flows, thus dramatically raising prices.
Interestingly, U.S. energy companies are reluctant to start new oil drilling projects because many in the industry are unsure whether high prices will stay elevated long enough for investors to make a profit. In my opinion, this decision to stay on the sidelines is short-sighted but that’s cynically good news for CVX.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., June 16 (Reuters) - SANTA CLARA, Calif. A Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW executive said at a conference on Thursday that the world's biggest chipmaker will have the next version of ASML's ASML.AS most advanced lithography tool in 2024.
""Looking ahead, TSMC will bring in high-NA EUV scanners in 2024 to develop the associated infrastructure and patterning solution needed for customers to fuel innovation,"" said Y.J. Mii, senior vice president of research & development, during TSMC's technology symposium in Silicon Valley.
Mii did not say when the device, the second generation of extreme ultraviolet lithography tools needed to make smaller and faster chips, would be used for mass production. TSMC rival Intel Corp INTC.O has said it will use the machines in production by 2025 and has said it would be the first to receive the machine.
As Intel enters into the business of making chips that other companies design, it will be competing with TSMC for those customers. So the industry is watching closely on which company has the edge on the next generation of chip technology.
Kevin Zhange, TSMC senior vice president of business development, later clarified that TSMC wouldn't be ready for production with the new high-NA EUV tool in 2024 but that it would be mostly used for research purposes with partners.
""The importance of TSMC having it in 2024 means they get to the most advanced technology faster,"" said TechInsights’ chip economist Dan Hutcheson, who was at the symposium. ""EUV technology has become so critical to being on the leading edge ... high-NA EUV is the next major innovation in the technology that will put the chip technology at the lead.""

2022-06-16 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm Fell Today",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-advanced-micro-devices-qualcomm-fell-today,,,"What happened
Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) were all down big again Thursday, off by 5.4%, 8.1%, and 7.2%, respectively, as of 1:16 p.m. ET.
Obviously, the entire market was down too, and the technology sector was especially hard hit. There are likely a couple of factors driving the sell-off, including the rapid tightening of fiscal policy by central banks worldwide, which is intensifying investors' fears that a recession is coming.
Additionally, an Nvidia insider sold a significant amount of stock earlier this week. That could be further dampening sentiment for the chipmaker and the whole sector.
So what
Late Wednesday, Nvidia released a form filed with the SEC showing that company director Mark Stevens had sold 227,650 shares of stock over the course of June 13 and June 14 for a total of about $36 million. This is, of course, not what Nvidia investors want to see, especially with the stock already down 44% on the year and 54% below its all-time high.
Still, before investors panic and run for the hills, they should note that even after these sales, Stevens still holds just over 3 million shares of Nvidia worth nearly $500 million. As such, those sales amounted to less than 10% of his stake in the company. Insiders sell stock for all kinds of reasons, and Stevens could very well be raising cash to pursue other investment opportunities, as many assets other than Nvidia stock have become quite cheap.
Of course, Thursday's sell-off wasn't just an Nvidia problem. The market has really been on a downturn ever since last Friday's Consumer Price Index report showed inflation in May had been higher than expected. Previously, some economists had thought that inflation might have peaked in March, but the May report showed inflation spreading further into the broader services economy.
That prompted the Federal Reserve to hike the federal funds rate by 75 basis points on Wednesday, the largest single-step increase to that benchmark interest rate since 1994. The Federal Reserve is trying to prevent inflation expectations from becoming unanchored, and raising interest rates to slow the economy is the chief tool available to it.
However, there is a possibility that those rate hikes could cause a recession, and intensifying worries on that front can cause investors to pretty much sell everything, including semiconductor stocks that tend to be sensitive to economic growth. So while Nvidia's sell-off may seem justified due to its high valuation at over 40 times earnings, even AMD and Qualcomm, which sport price-to-earnings ratios of 30 and 12.3, respectively, were also trading lower.
All of these companies have been reporting excellent growth and profitability, and have been best-in-class in their categories for a while. Nvidia is the outright leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), AMD has been taking market share from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in the central processing unit (CPU) market, and Qualcomm dominates mobile phone modems. The fear is that a broader economic recession would cause a slowdown or decline in purchases of PCs, which would affect all three companies, and smartphones, which would affect Qualcomm especially.
The current beacon of chip strength is the data center market, which has been and remains strong. Companies are still moving their digital operations to the cloud en masse, and artificial intelligence and automation are helping companies cut costs. But if the economy goes into a recession, even data center investment could slow.
Now what
In times like this, it's important to stick to your long-term investment plan. Are these great companies stocks you wish to own for many years? Also, how are each of these companies executing? And do they trade at reasonable valuations?
While their valuations may be somewhat in question, each of these companies looks well-positioned to thrive in their niches, and each is profitable, which not all tech companies can say. While the semiconductor industry has been cyclical in the past, it also seems to get stronger with every cycle, as more and more chips are going into more and more devices over time. The semiconductor industry is forecast to nearly double its annual revenues by 2030. That would be higher-than-average long-term growth compared to other sectors.
Basically, this sell-off is a marketwide phenomenon and not a company-specific phenomenon, and investors should view it as such. That being said, inflation and interest rates will be the wildcards for the near term, and share prices could remain volatile. But attempting to guess what the market will do on a short-term, day-to-day basis is no way to invest.
If you believe in these companies' long-term prospects and are investing with a time horizon of many years -- or decades -- then you shouldn't be concerned, because nothing has really changed about their long-term outlooks since yesterday or a week ago.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Holding 25 stocks or more is one way to protect your portfolio from drastic swings in a single stock or industry. But some businesses can provide different types of diversification within their own company. Starbucks, for example, has revenue from China, creating geographic diversification for investors.
In a hypothetical situation where I could only buy one stock, I would look for one with impressive internal diversification, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company has operations in multiple markets that are growing fast and could each be huge over the long term.

Getting into lucrative industries
Nvidia is primarily known for its gaming graphics processing units (GPUs). In the first quarter (ended May 1), gaming GPUs made up almost 44% of the $8.3 billion in revenue Nvidia generated across all its business units. But the company operates in other industries as well, and has seen tremendous success in these markets, namely in data centers. First quarter revenue in this segment soared 83% year over year, reaching $3.75 billion and taking the spot as Nvidia's biggest revenue driver in Q1.
The chipmaker's core business products are considered to be the gold standard in their respective industries. Nvidia is a top dog in the gaming industry, holding roughly 83% market share in the discrete GPU space as of Q3 2021, according to Jon Peddie Research. Within data centers, the company has 67% of the top supercomputers using its products. Nvidia's professional visualization unit already boasts over 90% market share in graphics for workstations.
But Nvidia's optionality expands beyond these key segments. The company provides chips for artificial intelligence (AI), omniverse, and autonomous vehicle industries. These industries create a total addressable market worth $600 billion combined for Nvidia in the future.
Nvidia has also attracted big dogs as customers, and these partnerships could allow the chipmaker to further capitalize on the massive potential ahead. For example, in 2022, Nvidia landed Lucid Group, BYD, and Tata Motors' Jaguar Land Rover as customers for the Nvidia Drive solution, which is a suite of products covering everything from autonomous vehicle hardware to software and simulation tools to gather vehicle data. These partnerships are enduring and highly sticky, so Nvidia's success in the early stages of this space could allow for long-term leadership.
Nvidia has the profits to withstand the competition
Many of Nvidia's endeavors which I find so appealing are still in their infancy, meaning there are plenty of opportunities for Nvidia to see continued expansion over the long term. Take artificial intelligence (AI) software, for example. Nvidia doesn't yet break out revenue for that venture but estimates that it could become a $150 billion business, with a total market worth $1 trillion ahead of it.
The risk, of course, is that the company might not be able to capitalize on these potential markets. Competition is fierce, and there's no guarantee that Nvidia will conquer all of the industries it's currently targeting. However, Nvidia isn't playing a winner-take-all game. These segments are so large that there can be multiple winners, leaving room for both Nvidia and its competitors.
To remain a major player, Nvidia will have to invest heavily in research and development and maintain its high-quality products. Luckily, the company is gushing cash. In Q1 alone, the company generated over $1.35 billion in free cash flow (FCF) and $1.6 billion in net income.
Why I love Nvidia for the long haul
At 50.5 times free cash flow, Nvidia shares are not cheap -- especially compared to other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which trade at 33 times and 16 times FCF, respectively. But again, the chipmaking field is not a winner-take-all game, meaning that all three companies could live up to their respective valuations. Nvidia is undoubtedly trading at a premium today, but it is justifiable given its opportunity.
Despite its high valuation, all signs point to Nvidia being a quality investment. It's quickly diversifying across industries that have immense potential, and that variety helps the company to better weather the market's cyclical demand for chips. While there is substantial execution risk, I think that Nvidia's leadership across core and emerging industries gives the company a cushion for stability and a blueprint for future success. As long as the company sees continued growth across the board, especially in its emerging segments, Nvidia would be my top choice if I could only buy one stock.

Nvidia has the profits to withstand the competition Many of Nvidia's endeavors which I find so appealing are still in their infancy, meaning there are plenty of opportunities for Nvidia to see continued expansion over the long term.","Why I love Nvidia for the long haul At 50.5 times free cash flow, Nvidia shares are not cheap -- especially compared to other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which trade at 33 times and 16 times FCF, respectively.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the engineers formerly known as Google, is America’s best weapon against inflation. With costs for labor, energy and raw materials skyrocketing, there may be no better place to put your money than GOOGL stock.
It’s true that GOOGL stock is down 24% in 2022. But bear markets pass. What’s happening is that Google’s earnings multiple is being compressed. It’s now worth less than 20 times earnings, which is a reasonable valuation.
We take past Google miracles for granted. The idea that you can answer any question, from literally anywhere, was science fiction when I became a journalist. But no one is buying yesterday. We want to know how Google will make money for us tomorrow. The answer lies in getting businesses to pay for its cloud.
GOOGL Alphabet $2,195.29
Cloud Profit Coming
I may be one of the fiercest critics of Google Cloud chief Thomas Kurian. Despite enormous investment, and enormous public praise, Kurian hasn’t gotten Google Cloud’s market share out of the single digits. As Google’s first-quarter results make clear, he hasn’t made the company any money, either. Google Cloud lost $931 million in the last quarter, $43 million more than a year earlier.
All that may be about to change, though. Google is expanding its software services into open-source cybersecurity. It is letting customers bring artificial intelligence and machine learning directly into their data centers. Even if Google Cloud doesnt reportmarket share gains, the unit is growing by 40% per year. Its value to business customers is also increasing.
As companies look to fight inflation by taking costs out of supply chains, workflows and distribution channels, cloud software is their best weapon. Kurian has spent over three years now transforming Google Cloud from an infrastructure company into a software company. Instead of providing plain infrastructure customers must turn into applications, Kurian now sells operating systems and software tools customers and other software companies depend on to run their operations.
Google Cloud was Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Now it’s Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). I’d rather be Microsoft.
What Cloud Profit Means for Investors
Once Google Cloud starts showing a profit, which I think will happen later this year, the underlying company will be transformed.
That’s because, right now, Google is still an advertising company. Over 80% of its revenue last year came from ad-based services. While advertising revenue may be on the decline, analysts are still expecting big things from Alphabet. The consensus estimate is for profits to rise 7% from the last quarter to $26.55 a share, and for revenue to increase 4% to $70.85 billion. They may be disappointed.
Whether Google meets its quarterly numbers is less important than that it uses cloud profits to beat full-year estimates of $111.52 a share in earnings ($5.57 post-split) and $297 billion in revenue. If it can hit those marks, investors in GOOGL stock will be paying less than 5 times revenue for 15% growth at a time when other companies are flailing or failing.
To me, that spells safety and long-term value. Selling ads against anything is a bet on the economy. Selling services that cut costs is a much firmer platform for growth.
The Bottom Line on GOOGL Stock
Google search, Google Android, Google YouTube and all other Google services ride on Google’s cloud.
Google put nearly $10 billion into purchases of property and equipment last quarter. It still had over $15 billion in free cash flow.
There’s short-term risk in GOOGL stock, as the company’s ad-based services are tied to the economy. That risk is reduced by the profit potential of Google Cloud. Selling subscription software to business pays for itself in productivity and lower operating costs.
We like to think of Google as essential consumer infrastructure. If it also becomes essential business infrastructure, its future growth ceiling is unlimited.

June 15 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has opened 2,000 positions for hiring, Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao said on Wednesday, a sharp contrast to a slew of job cuts by companies operating in the digital currency space.
""It was not easy saying no to Super bowl ads, stadium naming rights, large sponsor deals a few months ago, but we did. Today, we are hiring for 2000 open positions for #Binance,"" Zhao said in a tweet to his 6.4 million followers on the social media app.
Binance did not immediately respond to Reuters request for additional details on the new jobs.
The move by Binance comes amid extreme volatility in the cryptocurrency market as investors are dumping risky assets over fears that soaring inflation would force the U.S. Federal Reserve to aggressively raise interest rates and tip the economy into a recession.
Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc COIN.O said on Tuesday it would cut about 1,100 jobs, or 18% of its workforce, the latest company preparing to ride out a downturn in the cryptosphere.
BlockFi and Crypto.com have also slashed hundreds of jobs, while Meta Platforms META.O and Intel Corp INTC.O also tapped the brakes on hiring.
Bitcoin BTC=BTSP tumbled on Wednesday to a new 18-month low, dragging smaller tokens down with it and spurring a sharp fall in the digital currency market sparked by crypto lender Celsius freezing customer withdrawals.

LUXEMBOURG, June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm QCOM.O on Wednesday won its fight against a 997-million-euro ($1.05 billion) fine imposed by EU antitrust regulators four years ago for paying Apple AAPL.O to use only its chips and blocking out rivals such as Intel Corp INTC.O.
The European Commission in its 2018 decision said the anti-competitive practice took place from 2011 to 2016, with Qualcomm paying billions of dollars to Apple to use its chips in all its iPhones and iPads.
The General Court, Europe's second-highest, annulled the EU finding, dealing EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager a major blow.
""A number of procedural irregularities affected Qualcomm's rights of defence and invalidate the Commission's analysis of the conduct alleged against Qualcomm,"" judges said.
The EU competition enforcer can appeal on matters of law to the EU Court of Justice (CJEU), Europe's highest.
The case is T-235/18.
