AMSTERDAM, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Intel INTC.O has placed the first order with ASML ASML.AS for a new, advanced chipmaking tool that will cost ""significantly"" more than $340 million, as semiconductor manufacturers look to get ahead in a booming industry.
Alongside better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, ASML said on Wednesday it had received orders for five of its next- generation lithography machines, plus an order for an even newer model that is still being designed.
In a separate joint statement, the companies said Intel was the buyer.
ASML's most advanced machines in current commercial production, known as EUV lithography systems because of the ""Extreme Ultraviolet"" light waves they use to map out the circuitry of computer chips, are as big as a bus and cost around $150 million each.
A cutting-edge chip plant needs 9-18 of these machines, which are one of the biggest capital costs for chipmakers.
ASML is the only maker of such machines and its EUV customers include the world's biggest chipmakers, TSMC 2330.TW of Taiwan, Samsung 005930.KS of South Korea and Intel, among others.
ASML said it has received orders for five prototypes of the next iteration of the system, known as ""High NA"" EUV machines, which will have a different optical system with a higher numerical aperture, will be even larger, and cost around $300 million each.
The first prototypes are to be shipped to customers for testing in 2023, CFO Roger Dassen said at a post-earnings press conference.
Intel, which is trying to win back its position as maker of the smallest and fastest chips from current leader TSMC, had previously identified itself as the first buyer of a prototype High NA machine, ASML's EXE:5000.
Intel said on Wednesday it would also buy the first EXE:5200, the first model intended for use in commercial production, which it may receive by the end of 2024.
Dassen said the cost of EXE:5200 systems would be ""significantly"" above $340 million.

2022-01-18 00:00:00+00:00,See Which Of The Latest 13F Filers Holds Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/see-which-of-the-latest-13f-filers-holds-intel,,,"At Holdings Channel, we have reviewed the latest batch of the 22 most recent 13F filings for the 12/31/2021 reporting period, and noticed that Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) was held by 16 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.
Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.
Having given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in INTC positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:
FUND NEW POSITION? CHANGE IN SHARE COUNT CHANGE IN MARKET VALUE ($ IN 1000'S)
Apella Capital LLC Existing -427 -$35

Salem Capital Management Inc. Existing -850 -$66
TNF LLC Existing UNCH +$29
Fairhaven Wealth Management LLC Existing -189 -$20
Aggregate Change: +17,350 -$344
In terms of shares owned, we count 5 of the above funds having increased existing INTC positions from 09/30/2021 to 12/31/2021, with 8 having decreased their positions and 1 new position.
Looking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the INTC share count in the aggregate among all of the funds which held INTC at the 12/31/2021 reporting period (out of the 325 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of INTC shares those same funds held back at the 09/30/2021 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for INTC. We found that between these two periods, funds increased their holdings by 413,442 shares in the aggregate, from 15,395,625 up to 15,809,067 for a share count increase of approximately 2.69%. The overall top three funds holding INTC on 12/31/2021 were:

Investors have been able to count on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) for impressive returns over the past four years. Since 2018, AMD stock has been on a high growth trajectory, up 1,237%. However, starting last November, that growth has sputtered.

In fact AMD shares are currently down 15% from their November, 2021 high close. I think there’s still plenty of fuel in the AMD tank, and the latest news about the global PC industry re-enforces my position. 
If you can pick up shares in this Portfolio Grader “B” rated semiconductor stock at its current discount, your portfolio will be better for it. Here’s the latest news about global computer sales and why it spells good news for AMD stock.
Worldwide PC Shipments “Soared” in 2021
Advanced Micro Devices sells chips that are used in a wide range of applications. This includes  enterprise silicon — a high growth sector thanks to the demand for servers.
7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy and Hold Until 2030
The company designs custom SoCs (system-on chip), which you’ll find in the high-demand Xbox One S/X and Playstation 5 game consoles. AMD also sells embedded processors. In its latest quarter, the revenue from these segments was up 69% year-over-year.
That’s what investors want to see, and the company’s success here is an important reason for AMD stock’s performance.
However, as well as the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom division has performed, its the Computing and Graphics division that’s responsible for the lion’s share of AMD revenue. In the last quarter, that was $2.4 billion or 56% of the total.
That makes a new report from Canalys good news for Advanced Micro Devices. According to data published by Canalys, global PC shipments “soared” to 341 million units in 2021. That’s 15% higher than 2020 — which was also a very good year for the industry.
It puts 2021 sales of laptops and desktop PCs at their highest level since 2012. That growth came despite ongoing supply chain challenges. 
More good news. Canalys researchers noted that many of the purchases are net new rather than replacements for existing computers. This means the global PC base is expanding, making continued growth more likely. Canalys is projecting that 2022 PC sales will be even stronger. 
With PC processors and graphics cards making up such a large chunk of AMD’s revenue, the Canalys numbers bode well for the return to growth of AMD stock.
AMD Continues to Make PC Gains
The overall growth of the PC market is a good thing for a company that sells CPUs. However, AMD is in the enviable position of also increasing its market share against rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). 
Last November, it was reported that AMD had hit a total market share of 24.6% versus Intel’s 75.4%. That’s AMD’s highest showing since 2006. AMD has lagged slightly in laptop chips (it hit 22%), but at CES 2022 the company unveiled new Ryzen 6000 series mobile chips that took home Innovation awards.
Intel made headlines with its own new 12th generation Core mobile chips with hybrid architecture, but the reality is that Ryzen 6000 mobile processors are likely to increase AMD’s gains in the laptop market. Intel is finally showing signs of getting its act together, but at best this is expected to only slow AMD’s momentum.
With a growing market share in an expanding market, the formula is there for AMD stock growth. 
Bottom Line
AMD stock was the top performer for the S&P 500 in 2019 with a 150.2% return. It was an S&P 500 top eight performer in 2020, with a 99.8% return. 2021 wasn’t quite as good. With the slump that started in November, AMD stock finished the year with a 57% gain.
Let’s put that in perspective. I don’t know many investors who would complain about a 57% annual return on a low-risk stock. AMD is unlikely to repeat its 2019 or 2020 performance this year. 2021 may be a stretch as well. But with shares still down significantly from 2021 levels, its enterprise revenue surging, and PC sales expected to continue being red-hot in 2022. AMD stock is a pretty good option for a growth portfolio.

2022-01-18 00:00:00+00:00,"PREVIEW-ASML Q4 earnings seen up 12%, eyes on Berlin fire impact",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/preview-asml-q4-earnings-seen-up-12-eyes-on-berlin-fire-impact,,,"By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM, Jan 18 (Reuters) - ASML Holding NV ASML.AS, a key supplier to computer chip makers, is expected to report a 12% increase in quarterly net profit on Wednesday and update customers on whether a fire at its factory in Berlin could affect production plans.
Analysts are expecting ASML, Europe's largest technology company by market capitalisation, to report fourth quarter net profit of 1.51 billion euros ($1.72 billion), up from 1.35 billion euros a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data.
Sales are expected to rise 20% to 5.1 billion euros.
ASML is trying to expand production as its customers - which include TSMC 2330.TW, Samsung 005930.KS Intel INTC.O - invest heavily in new capacity to try to ease a global semiconductor shortage.
ASML said in September it was benefiting from long-term trends in the electronics industry and should double-digit sales growth in the coming decade.
However, investors received a shock at the start of 2022 when the company suffered a fire at a factory in Berlin.
ASML shipment delays could have a ripple effect on semiconductor markets, but the company's statements seem to indicate the fire's damage was limited.
In an initial assessment on Jan. 7, ASML said it expected no disruption to deliveries of its workhorse product, DUV lithography machines, currently used in the manufacture of most of the world's logic and memory chips.
However, it said it was too soon to say whether there might be any delays in deliveries of its most advanced EUV systems, machines that cost $150 million apiece and are used to map out the circuitry of cutting edge computer chips.
ASML's shares, which quadrupled over 2018-2021, are down about 9% so far this year.

2022-01-17 00:00:00+00:00,"1 Green Flag for Intel in 2022, and 1 Red Flag",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-green-flag-for-intel-in-2022-and-1-red-flag,,,"Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) latest turnaround efforts have caught Wall Street's attention, as the fallen chip giant is showing signs that it could deliver on its promise of regaining lost market share from rivals that have pulled ahead on the technology front in recent years.
Northland Capital markets upgraded shares of the semiconductor giant in the first week of January 2022 to outperform with a price target of $62, which implies an 11% upside from the stock's closing price on Jan. 12. Northland analyst Gus Richard cited Intel's coherent strategy and execution as the reason for upgrading the stock.
Wall Street's newfound confidence in Intel stock isn't too surprising, as the chipmaker has laid out an aggressive long-term plan to get back in the game. Could this be the year when the plan starts to bear fruit? Let's investigate one green and one red flag.
Image source: Getty Images.
Intel's turnaround could gather momentum in 2022
Intel has been giving investors reasons to cheer over the past couple of months as its new line of Alder Lake processors is reportedly doing well in independent benchmarks, giving rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) a run for its money. Intel's Core i9-12900HK laptop processor has been reported to deliver desktop-class performance and outperform AMD's Ryzen Threadripper 1950X.
What's more, the 12th-generation Alder Lake processors have helped Intel regain the gaming crown from AMD, according to independent benchmarks, with Chipzilla's offerings coming out on top of AMD's chips in terms of price-to-performance. For instance, the Core i9-12900K that's priced at $589 matches up to the performance offered by the $799 Ryzen 9 5950X.
Not surprisingly, AMD has been forced to reduce the price of its chips after Intel's latest offerings hit the market. More importantly, Intel is expected to push the envelope further as the year progresses with its Raptor Lake chips expected to hit the market in the second half of 2022. The Raptor Lake processors will reportedly pack more efficiency into its cores, ideally leading to improved power efficiency and performance.
Intel's new processors are gaining favor among customers and boosting the company's market share. This could set the stage for Intel to start getting back at AMD in 2022. It is worth noting that Intel had managed to hold on to a 60% share of the central processing unit (CPU) market in 2021 in each of the four quarters, according to third-party estimates. That was a big improvement from 2020 when the company finished the year with 61.5% of the CPU market after starting the year with a 68.4% share.
Potential market share gains in CPUs could be a green flag for Intel this year and give the company's client computing group (CCG) a shot in the arm. The CCG is Intel's biggest business in terms of revenue and accounted for 53% of its top line in the third quarter of 2021, but sales were also down 2% year over year during the period. An improvement in this area could go a long way in boosting confidence in Chipzilla stock and accelerating its turnaround.
The red flag investors should be wary of
Sales of personal computers (PCs) are expected to slow down in 2022 after two years of rapid growth spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. According to market research firm IDC, PC sales increased an estimated 13.5% last year, but they could decline nearly 5% in 2022. PC sales are expected to drop in 2023 as well, with growth expected to return only in 2024.
This potential weakness in the PC market could spoil Intel's turnaround, as it will have to compete with AMD for a smaller pool of processor sales compared to the past two years. However, there are expectations that the commercial demand for computers will continue to remain strong in 2022 and drive the PC market's growth. Additionally, the return of lockdowns across the globe to curb the spread of the omicron variant could give the PC market a boost as consumers could turn toward their computers for work, education, and entertainment like they have in the last two years.
Moreover, the PC market is expected to return to growth in the long run, clocking a compound annual growth rate of 3.3% through 2025. So, the market share gains Intel makes this year and beyond should help drive its growth.
Investors should consider looking past the potential near-term weakness in the PC market, which seems like a red flag for Intel right now. The tech giant seems on the road to redemption, which could act as a catalyst for the stock. As such, investors looking to buy a cheap tech stock right now should keep Intel on their watch lists. It is trading at just 10.6 times trailing earnings, and market share gains against AMD could drive growth in its biggest business and its stock price.

2022-01-17 00:00:00+00:00,Is iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) a Strong ETF Right Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-ishares-msci-usa-value-factor-etf-vlue-a-strong-etf-right-now-0,,,"Launched on 04/16/2013, the iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.
Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.
But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.
Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance.
The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Because the fund has amassed over $17.37 billion, this makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Value. VLUE is managed by Blackrock. VLUE seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index before fees and expenses.
The MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index is based on a traditional market capitalization-weighted parent index, the MSCI USA Index which includes U.S. large and mid capitalization stocks.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for VLUE are 0.15%, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.
The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.12%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
For VLUE, it has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector --about 27% of the portfolio --while Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, At&t Inc (T) accounts for about 6.44% of total assets, followed by Intel Corporation Corp (INTC) and General Motors (GM).
The top 10 holdings account for about 33.42% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
So far this year, VLUE has added about 3.43%, and was up about 24.92% in the last one year (as of 01/17/2022). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $89.78 and $114.92.
The ETF has a beta of 1.08 and standard deviation of 25.68% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 153 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
IShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.
IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) tracks Russell 1000 Value Index and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) tracks CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $59.53 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $93.92 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.19% and VTV charges 0.04%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Value.

2022-01-14 00:00:00+00:00,Good Stocks To Invest In 2022? 4 Value Stocks To Watch Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/good-stocks-to-invest-in-2022-4-value-stocks-to-watch-right-now,,,"4 Value Stocks To Check Out In Mid-January 2022
The increasing volatility in the stock market has caused many investors to feel uneasy about their investments. Naturally, the idea of investing in value stocks will resurface as they offer more stability than growth stocks. For one, they are often established companies that appear to trade below their intrinsic value. Besides, some of the top value stocks tend to have the ability to weather through tough times. 
Seeing the Federal Reserve is suggesting interest rates will rise quicker than some expected, many stocks have started selling off. Particularly, high growth companies with little or no profitability are getting hit the hardest. On the contrary, value stocks with stable underlying businesses are holding up relatively well. They may not post strong gains, but they can bring respectable returns over the long term.
For instance, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is a highly profitable company. Since Pat Gelsinger took over as CEO, the company is investing heavily to regain the edge in manufacturing capabilities. Should Intel’s investment pay off, it might be able to strengthen its position in the semiconductor industry. With top value stocks appearing to be leading the charge this year, investors may consider taking a more defensive approach. Considering the recent market sentiment, would you put up a list of top value stocks to buy in the stock market today?

2022-01-14 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Metaverse Stocks to Buy in January,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-metaverse-stocks-to-buy-in-january,,,"Wall Street expects 2022 to be a banner year for the adoption of the metaverse, as several companies are expected to come out with hardware and software offerings that will help consumers work, play, or learn in the virtual three-dimensional world.
Crunchbase estimates that $10 billion was invested in virtual reality (VR)-related start-ups last year, while Meta Platforms reportedly spent an identical amount on its AR (augmented reality) and VR initiatives as well. Goldman Sachs estimates that the spending on metaverse-related technologies could hit $1.35 trillion over time, indicating that there's a long-term opportunity at hand for investors to take advantage of.
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Himax Technologies (NASDAQ: HIMX), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are three tech stocks that could win big from the metaverse. Let's look at the reasons why.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Intel
Intel management pointed out in December 2021 that the metaverse could be the ""next major transition in computing"" as more people will come to rely on digital technology to ""communicate, collaborate, learn and sustain"" their lives. Management added that this will create the need for major networking upgrades to support the creation of life-like environments and human-like avatars in the virtual world in real-time.
According to Intel executive Raja Koduri:
Truly persistent and immersive computing, at scale and accessible by billions of humans in real time, will require even more: a 1,000-times increase in computational efficiency from today's state of the art.
Not surprisingly, the metaverse is likely to spawn the need for more hyperscale data centers that can support the massive workloads that this emerging technology trend will create. The Dell'Oro Group estimates that spending on hyperscale data centers could increase 30% in 2022. The long-term forecast also appears bright as the hyperscale data center market could clock an annual growth rate of 22% through 2028 as per a third-party estimate.
Intel is in a solid position to take advantage of this rapid growth as its share of the server processor market stood at a whopping 90.5% in the second quarter of 2021, according to Mercury Research. Though Chipzilla has been facing some heat in this market from Advanced Micro Devices, it is setting itself up to defend its impressive share with an aggressive product roadmap that's aimed at helping it regain its technology lead over rivals.
As such, Intel could turn out to be a top metaverse stock, in the long run, thanks to its dominant position in the data center processor market that's expected to witness solid growth. Given that Intel is trading at less than 10 times trailing earnings, now may be a good time for investors to buy shares of this chip giant as it looks primed for a turnaround, with the metaverse set to act as an additional catalyst.
2. Himax Technologies
Himax Technologies may not be a household name, but this chipmaker was a metaverse player way before this concept became popular. In 2013, Google picked up a stake in Himax to fund the chipmaker's display business. The latter was making liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) chips and modules for the Google Glass, a pair of smart glasses that ultimately failed to take off at that time due to privacy concerns.
However, with the tech world finally warming up to the concept of the metaverse, Himax could find new customers for its LCoS displays that can be deployed in AR headsets and AR-enabled glasses. Himax points out that LCoS is going to play a critical role in AR headsets, since this technology can make headsets compact and more power-efficient while lowering manufacturing costs.
The company adds that its list of customers consists of some of the top players that are launching AR/VR headsets. So, investors looking to mint money from the metaverse should keep a close watch on Himax, as the demand for its LCoS chips could jump once sales of AR/VR headsets hit critical mass. According to market research firm IDC, shipments of AR/VR headsets hit 9.7 million at the end of 2021. By 2025, nearly 44 million AR/VR headsets are expected to be sold as per IDC's estimates, indicating that the market is set to clock a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 46%.
With Himax stock trading at 6.7 times trailing earnings and 1.6 times sales, savvy investors should keep this potential metaverse winner on their radar given its rapid pace of growth. The chipmaker's revenue in the third quarter of 2021 had shot up 75% year over year to $421 million, while adjusted earnings per share rocketed to $0.79 per share from $0.07 per share in the year-ago period.
Himax can sustain such terrific growth thanks to the booming demand for its chips in the automotive and smartphone display markets, and the metaverse is likely to become another lucrative market for the chipmaker to tap into.
3. Nvidia
Share prices of Nvidia have slipped nearly 5% in 2022, which has opened a nice opportunity for investors to get into this potential metaverse winner as it is now trading at 86 times trailing earnings. While that multiple isn't cheap by any means, Nvidia is now trading at a discount to its 2021 earnings multiple of over 90. If the stock continues to slip in the near term thanks to potential interest rate hikes causing a sell-off in tech stocks, investors should consider going long with Nvidia, as it can win from the metaverse in several ways.
For instance, the demand for Nvidia's data center GPUs (graphics processing units) could spike to support the creation of the metaverse. In an interview with market research firm Dell'Oro in November 2021, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had explained that data centers will have to evolve to meet the needs of the metaverse. The creation and delivery of virtual 3D worlds at scale to consumers across the globe means that data center servers will have to be accelerated with multiple GPUs.
It is worth noting that the global data center GPU market is already expected to clock a 42% annual growth rate through 2027 and hit $20 billion in revenue. The metaverse could accelerate that already impressive rate of growth.
Another way Nvidia is looking to tap into the metaverse is through its Omniverse Enterprise platform that allows creators to create ""physically accurate 3D world and digital twins."" The chipmaker had pointed out on its November 2021 earnings conference call:
Initial market reception to Omniverse has been incredible. Professionals at over 700 companies are evaluating the platform, including BMW, Ericsson, Lockheed Martin and Sony Pictures. More than 70,000 individual creators have downloaded Omniverse since the open beta launch in December. There are approximately 40 million 3D designers in theglobal market
Nvidia has now made the Omniverse platform generally available to individuals so that artists, designers, and creators can make virtual worlds in collaboration with each other. So, Nvidia won't just provide the means to power the metaverse through its chips but will also enable consumers to experience the same with its tools that will help creators make 3D worlds.
So, the metaverse could turn out to be another massive growth driver for Nvidia in the long run in addition to the company's other catalysts. In all, Nvidia is a top growth stock to buy to take advantage of this emerging tech trend that could help it grow its earnings at a faster pace than Wall Street's estimated CAGR of 40% for the next five years.

Microsoft to Manufacture Own Chips to Maintain Dominant Market Share
Microsoft holds a dominant position in the desktop PC market, with its operating systems being utilized in the majority of PCs worldwide. However, the company relies heavily on Intel and AMD to provide the chips for its different computing and cloud platforms.

Such dependence on third-party manufacturers amid a pandemic-induced global supply crunch of chips remains a concern for Microsoft.

Also, the PC market is slowing down and rapidly transitioning, which has persuaded Microsoft’s key suppliers to shift business gradually from PC-centric business to data-centric businesses — such as AI and autonomous driving.

This will impact Microsoft in two possible ways. Firstly, the already existent chip shortage in the PC market will impact Microsoft’s capabilities to create operating systems, which in turn will affect the company’s revenues.

Secondly, AMD and Intel’s entry into data-centric business can turn these two companies into potential competitors for Microsoft across various platforms where the company already faces intense competition.

These reasons compel Microsoft to stop relying on third-party chip providers and manufacture its chips.

2022-01-13 00:00:00+00:00,7 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next Decade,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-best-long-term-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-for-the-next-decade,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
One of the best ways to generate wealth from the stock market is to invest over in long-term stocks. As the saying goes, it’s not timing the market, it’s time in the market. This saying holds just as true today as it did 10 years ago.
For those looking to invest over the next 10 years, now’s certainly an interesting time. Those looking to put fresh capital to work have a number of considerations to think about. First of all, will the pandemic even be relevant in a few years’ time? How many companies that look great today have business models that could falter via competition or other market forces over the next decade? And what’s the margin of safety with a given company, relative to other great options out there?
Indeed, being a stock picker and thinking about long-term stocks isn’t easy. We live in a society where trading and short-term trends and technical analysis rein supreme. However, those looking at longer-term trends and the potential winners from these trends may be asking different questions.
7 Stocks to Buy Under $10 in January
With this backdrop, let’s take a look at a few companies with the potential to succeed long-term. These companies are from all different sectors, and represent intriguing opportunities in my books. Here are seven companies on my watch list right now as potential long-term stocks:
Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN)
Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT)
Altria Group (NYSE:MO)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)
Novartis (NYSE:NVS)
StoneCo (NASDAQ:STNE)
Top Long-Term Stocks: Coinbase (COIN)
Source: Primakov / Shutterstock.com
Let’s start with perhaps the most speculative pick on this list, shall we?
Coinbase Global is among the most well-known cryptocurrency exchanges out there. However, Coinbase is a relatively recent addition to the market, only going public last year. Since reaching its high of nearly $430 per share immediately following its market debut, shares of COIN stock have been on the downtrend, now trading for nearly half that peak.
What gives? Well, the crypto market has been extremely volatile over the past year. A few tokens have done extremely well, but the massive losses we’ve seen in certain tokens have provided many investors with reason to be cautious with this space. Fair enough.
However, looking at the longer-term performance of various cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, it’s easy to make the case that Coinbase could be a long-term holding. That’s because this exchange’s fee-based revenue stream does well when the crypto market as a whole does well. Thus, investors don’t need to pick a winner, just simply bet on a longer-term trend. I like that.
Applied Materials (AMAT)

Applied Materials is a big player in the semiconductor capital equipment sector. Additionally, the company has also transformed into a leader in the manufacturing of advanced displays. For longer-term investors looking for sectors with strong secular tailwinds, these are good places to look.
Of course, as a long-term holding, Applied Materials has the kind of stock chart most investors like to see: It goes up and to the right. However, more and more of the company’s stock price performance is derived from the company’s fundamentals. With a price-earnings ratio that’s reasonable (around 24 times), and a small but growing dividend, there’s a lot to like about this tech infrastructure play.
The 7 Best Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for 2022
In the company’s advanced packaging segment, Applied Materials has seen impressive growth in its 3D NAND production in recent years. As a result of the pandemic, Applied Materials’ role in the semiconductor and advanced manufacturing space is becoming more important. Investors are realizing that in order for everything to work in the global tech supply chain, companies like Applied Materials need to do well. Accordingly, this is a company long-term investors may want to take a look at on any dips moving forward.
Top Long-Term Stocks: Altria Group (MO)
MO) logo of US producer and marketer of tobacco and cigarettes is seen on a mobile phone screen."" width=""300"" height=""169"">

Famous for being the company behind the Marlboro brand of cigarettes, Altria is a company investors either love or hate. Indeed, this company’s core business is still one that turns many investors off. Fair enough. Cigarettes are big business, but there’s no doubt this line of business is terrible for the overall health of our global population.
Of course, Altria may not be for every investor for this reason. However, those looking past where Altria got its start to where it’s headed may want to look at this company. That’s because a greater percentage of the company’s sales are actually coming from non-cigarette related businesses over time.
Among the growing businesses under Altria’s umbrella is e-cigarettes, vapes, and other cannabis-related products. The company’s market share in these growth segments is taking off. And many investors like the direction this company is headed — encouraging reduced smoking and tobacco alternatives.
This is a major shift for Altria. However, the company reported very strong results this past quarter, boosting its dividend on the back of strong projected forward cash flows and excellent earnings. For those looking for a stock with a 7.3% dividend yield, Altria is a great option to look at right now.
Intel (INTC)
INTC) logo in blue on a black screen."" width=""300"" height=""169"">

One of the more legacy companies to make this list is Intel. This semiconductor (computer chip) company was formerly the leader in the server and desktop market. However, these markets have been shifting quite rapidly of late. Many investors have sought fit to seek out other higher-growth, younger companies in this field in recent years.
Intel has lost market share to most of its peers in the mobile processors business. AMD took over Intel’s desktop market with its high-powered Ryzen processor. Further, AMD’s Epyc chip outperforms Intel’s Xeon option. In the semiconductor space, Intel is losing ground, and investors have noticed.
7 High Risk Stocks That Are Worth The Volatile Vibes
That said, this chip giant has been making strategic moves worth considering. In addition to cutting prices to shore up market share, the company’s 12th generation Alder Lake processor is likely to spur additional growth over the medium-term. The competitive dynamics of this space are difficult to assess. However, Intel has been a leader for decades for a reason. I like the company’s fundamentals, which include a price-earnings ratio around 10, and a dividend yield of 2.5%.
Top Long-Term Stocks: Pfizer (PFE)
PFE) logo on the windows of a corporate building"" width=""300"" height=""169"">

Big pharma company Pfizer has been on quite the run this past year. As a truly diversified global player in a range of pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other therapeutics and treatments for a wide range of ailments, Pfizer is a company with a long track record of healthy performance over time.
However, the focus on Pfizer of late has been directed at its high-profile partnership with BioNTech for a leading Covid-19 vaccine. This vaccine is expected to reach $65 billion in sales by the end of this year. That’s impressive, and has certainly provided a boost to Pfizer’s fundamentals of late.
However, it’s important to remember that Pfizer is much more than a company with a Covid-19 vaccine. In fact, before the pandemic, Pfizer was often known as the “company that owns Viagra.” The range of brand name drugs this company has developed or acquired over time is impressive. Those betting on continued growth from the pharmaceutical industry can’t go wrong owning Pfizer over the long-haul.
Novartis (NVS)
Source: Denis Linine / Shutterstock.com
Another healthcare player to make this list, Novartis is certainly an interesting company to watch. This provider of a range of pharma and healthcare products is one I’ve recently started looking at for its fundamentals. Novartis currently boasts a dividend yield of 3.6%, alongside a price-earnings ratio of 19 times earnings, and relatively stable long-term growth.
During the company’s most recent earnings report, Novartis noted revenue growth of 6% to $13 billion on a year-over-year basis. While these short-term results may have fallen short of some investors’ expectations, the company’s upcoming Entresto and Cosentyx drugs are likely to improve sentiment over time. That’s because Entresto, a medication for blood pressure, is expected to bring in $5 billion of revenue in the years to come. Additionally, predictions are that Cosentyx, a monoclonal antibody aimed at treating psoriasis, could bring in $7 billion in top-line revenue. These are not menial numbers.
7 Safe Stocks for Your Retirement
Novartis, like Pfizer, is a large-scale and slower-growth company that many investors may like to see. However, from a stability and defensiveness standpoint, I like this company. It’s hard to find a company with a meaningful yield but also an attractive long-term growth outlook in this market. However, Novartis fits the bill right now.
Top Long-Term Stocks: StoneCo (STNE) Source: Shutterstock
Finally, we have StoneCo, a financial technology provider, to cap off this list. Perhaps the riskiest pick on this list for longer-term investors, those taking a more speculative approach may like the value behind this company.
First of all, SoneCo is an omnichannel play for retailers, particularly in the Brazilian market, to integrate physical, online and mobile sales. In essence, StoneCo helps retailers become truly integrated into the online economy and has seen previous surges in interest during the onset of the pandemic.
However, the past year has not been as friendly to this company. That’s because technical delays and the suspension of a key product lowered the company’s net margin outlook. From a fundamentals standpoint, there’s some hair with this stock, and investor sentiment remains depressed.
However, those taking a longer-term view of this stock may look past the company’s recent negative earnings and slower-than-expected growth. In the high-growth Brazilian market, StoneCo is growing its market share among small and medium sized businesses. Accordingly, those taking the really long-term view may want to consider this niche growth player, now trading at a discount of more than 80% from its 52-week high.

2022-01-13 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) to Power Turkey E-Commerce Platform for SMEs,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-to-power-turkey-e-commerce-platform-for-smes,,,"Intel Corporation INTC recently collaborated with Hepsiburada HEPS to launch an e-commerce platform for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Turkey. Dubbed DigitalSME, the program is likely to accelerate the digital transformation of local SMEs and drive the region's overall economic growth.

Founded in Istanbul in 2000, Hepsiburada operates as a leading e-commerce technology firm in Turkey and is reportedly the fastest-growing e-commerce operator in Europe. The company’s name translates to English as “all here” or “everything is here” with more than 43 million products available on its platform. The products are offered through a ‘Super App’ that can offer everything from same-day groceries, clothing, beauty products, auto supplies and electronics to flights and payment services, via an embedded digital wallet called Hepsipay. Hepsiburada has also pre-built an installment payment service facility into its platform, along with a seamless free return policy involving a super-efficient logistics network.

Hepsiburada now aims to tap the technological prowess of Intel to help SMEs develop their e-commerce platform and expand their digital business through DigitalSME support program. The participants in this program will be eligible for discounted hardware and software tools, along with requisite training for effective advertising methods, improvement in brand awareness, maximization of social media coverage and operational tips for enhancement of customer satisfaction. Intel will offer a 10% discount on its 11th generation products and additional discounts on printers, network and antivirus software. Moreover, SMEs will also get free training for HepsiAd – the advertising platform of Hepsiburada – and a grant of 1,000 Turkish lira.

Intel is betting big on the IoT business and is investing heavily to gain a higher market presence. While the focus was earlier on making the best computing chips and generating industry-leading margins from them, the company now prefers to focus on a product range targeting different market segments. Management believes that the higher-end business in more developed economies continues to look up, but the new strategy should help it get into many more device categories, where Intel products will continue to enjoy a premium based on performance and cost of ownership.

However, Intel is witnessing intensifying competition in the server, storage and networking markets. Moreover, delay in 7 nm process-based chips is a major concern. The company detected a defect mode in the 7 nm process, which caused yield degradation. Notably, Intel’s chips utilize process technologies that are designed in-house. Intel anticipates the release of data center GPU design, Ponte Vecchio, sometime this year. The chipmaker now expects initial production shipments of the first Intel-based 7 nm client CPU in late 2022 or early 2023. Moreover, initial production shipments of Intel’s first in house-based 7-nm data center CPU design are scheduled in the first half of 2023. This, in turn, is likely to lead to pricing pressure and limit margin expansion in the near term. Amid such a scenario, collaboration with the e-commerce platform of Hepsiburada is expected to help extend its market presence in emerging markets like Turkey.

The stock has lost 6% over the past year against the industry’s growth of 49.4%. Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.

A better-ranked stock in the industry is STMicroelectronics N.V. STM, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Over the past year, STMicroelectronics has gained a modest 21.1%. Earnings estimates for the current year for the stock have moved up 14% over the past year, while that for the next fiscal is up 34.3%. STM has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 5% and delivered an earnings surprise of 3.4%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.

NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, sporting a Zacks Rank #1, is another solid pick for investors. It delivered an earnings surprise of 7.7%, on average, in the trailing four quarters and has a long-term growth expectation of 19.2%. Earnings estimates for the current year for NVIDIA have moved up 48.8% since January 2021, while that for the next fiscal is up 54.1%.

Over the past year, the stock has gained a solid 106.9%. NVIDIA is gaining a decent market share among the gaming service providers. The strong line-up of advanced graphics cards has made it a favorite graphics card provider among PC makers. A strong uptick in PC gamers, esports players and higher spending on the gaming GPUs are key catalysts. Further, NVIDIA’s Turing GPU and its real-time ray tracing technology are witnessing a massive adoption.

2022-01-13 00:00:00+00:00,Taiwan Semiconductor's 2022 Spending Plans Are Mind-Boggling,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/taiwan-semiconductors-2022-spending-plans-are-mind-boggling,,,"Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), better known as TSMC, surged on Thursday. The company reported fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street's estimates and, perhaps more importantly, provided some impressive details on its plans for 2022.
Not surprisingly, given the global shortage of semiconductors and the company's market-leading position, TSMC's Q4 results were excellent. Strong demand for 5-nanometer chips gave the company tremendous operating leverage, helping drive its operating margin to 41.7% for the quarter, above its own guidance.
A TSMC semiconductor factory, or ""fab"", in Nanjing, China. TSMC will spend at least $40 billion on new facilities and manufacturing equipment this year. Image source: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd.
As for the current (first) quarter, CFO Wendell Huang said that chip investors can expect incremental sequential gains in revenue and margins, supported by recovering demand from automotive clients and ""milder smartphone seasonality than in recent years.""
It was all good stuff. But it was TSMC's spending plans for 2022 that got investors' attention on Thursday. Simply put, if you think the $30 billion that TSMC spent on capital expenditure (capex) in 2021 was a lot -- and it was! -- wait'll you hear about its plans for this year: $40 billion to $44 billion in new capex spending.
""Every year, our capex is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the future years,"" Huang said. ""We are witnessing a structural increase in underlying semiconductor demand underpinned by the industry megatrends of 5G-related and HPC applications.""
That's all true, and it has led to tight supplies of semiconductors around the world as anyone who has tried to buy a car recently knows. But the big spending is also about keeping TSMC atop the global chip rankings -- and ahead of key rivals like Intel and Samsung -- as new products like connected vehicles and ever-more-advanced gaming devices will continue to drive chip demand higher in coming years.

Ahead of the  CES show, held earlier this month, many investors accumulated shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). INTC stock bottomed in November 2021 and has since trended higher. Though the stock briefly rallied on Intel’s Dec. 7 announcement that it would spin off its Mobileye unit, the chip giant is still a rebound play.

Intel lost market share to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in the last few years, as AMD redesigned its computer chips, becoming the preferred CPU for high-end gaming systems.
Recently, Intel has started to give investors hope. It released another CPU late last year, announced the planned Mobileye spinoff, and committed to soon launch a new graphics card.
INTC Stock Has Deep Value
Intel trades at a price-earnings ratio of around ten times,  The stock’s dividend yield is 2.5%. AMD, conversely, has a  P/E ratio of 42.5, making the stock vulnerable to a correction. The Federal Reserve’s multiple, upcoming, expected rate hikes are pressuring richly valued stocks. Fortunately, INTC stock is cheap, as investors do not expect the company to grow a great deal in 2022.
Meanwhile, technology sites are praising Intel’s new Alder Lake chip.  With this chip, Intel created a good balance between high computing power and low power usage. Most importantly, Alder Lake is priced competitively with AMD’s chips. For mainstream and budget users, Intel is a better choice than AMD.
At this year’s CES show, Intel said that Alder Lake would power over 100 laptop models. Expect tech websites to give those computers positive reviews, leading to strong chip sales for Intel.
7 Stocks to Buy Under $10 in January
Thanks to Intel’s strong supply chain, computer makers will have an abundance of its chips available. As a result,  Intel’s revenues should climb next quarter.
The Spin Off  of Mobileye
In a deal that will unlock value for  its shareholders, Intel said that it would take its Mobileye subsidiary public in mid-2022.  Furthermore, Intel will still own a majority stake in Mobileye, which is likely to become a big player in the autonomous-vehicle market. And by tapping the stock market, Mobileye will get more funds to support its growth.
Intel’s Discrete Graphics Product
Arc is the graphics card brand that Intel is counting on to disrupt the GPU market, which is currently dominated by  Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD . Thanks to the chip shortage and strong demand from cryptocurrency miners, neither Nvidia nor AMD is updating its GPUs.
Gamers currently need to wait many months to receive the out-of-stock AMD and Nvidia GPUs they order. Alternatively, consumers may shop for a card at one of Best Buy’s (NYSE:BBY) stores. Due to the low inventories of the GPUs made by AMD and Nvidia, the two firms are opening an opportunity for Intel to gain market share in the sector.
Intel said that it would launch its graphics card in Q2. Given the powerful demand for  GPUs, Intel can charge relatively high prices for Arc.
Fair Value
The average price target of the 24 analysts covering INTC stock is $55.29, according to Tipranks. Analysts have little conviction in Intel’s growth prospects, as there are more analysts with “hold” ratings than those with “buy” ratings on the shares.
Analysts may not understand the magnitude of the positive impact that Arc will have on Intel’s revenue. The graphics gaming card sector is quite large and can easily support a third company, in addition to AMD and Nvidia.
By the time analysts realize the extent to which Arc will lift Intel’s financial results, their estimate adjustments and upgrades will be late. Consequently, the stock could rally sharply in the coming months before INTC stock gets its first big upgrade.
Consumers who have shopped for a computer recently will notice that Intel has a good pricing strategy for its CPUs. Specifically, in order to attract mainstream users, Intel competitively prices these chips. Some of them have a price-performance ratio that is on par with or better than the equivalent AMD chip.
For now, AMD will primarily serve the high-end market. While AMD prepares its next-generation products, Intel may gain market share.

  The table above indicates that INTC stock is in deep- value territory and is  a quality name with high returns on investment. The company, however, scores lower when it comes to growth metrics. That will change after it launches its graphic card this year.
Intel is a deep-value semiconductor stock.  Investors should consider buying its shares before they rise further.

More details on Validea's John Neff strategy
About John Neff: While known as the manager with whom many top managers entrusted their own money, Neff was far from the smooth-talking, high-profile Wall Streeter you might expect. He was mild-mannered and low-key, and the same might be said of the Windsor Fund that he managed for more than three decades. In fact, Neff himself described the fund as ""relatively prosaic, dull, [and] conservative."" There was nothing dull about his results, however. From 1964 to 1995, Neff guided Windsor to a 13.7 percent average annual return, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return during that time. That 3.1 percentage point difference is huge over time -- a $10,000 investment in Windsor (with dividends reinvested) at the start of Neff's tenure would have ended up as more than $564,000 by the time he retired, more than twice what the same investment in the S&P would have yielded (about $233,000). Considering the length of his tenure, that track record may be the best ever for a manager of such a large fund.

2022-01-12 00:00:00+00:00,Who Led the Patent Race in 2021?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/who-led-the-patent-race-in-2021,,,"T
he World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) defines a patent as “an exclusive right granted for an invention. In other words, a patent is an exclusive right to a product or a process that generally provides a new way of doing something or offers a new technical solution to a problem.”
Therefore, patenting an idea or innovation is crucial to securing and converting a company's research and development (R&D) efforts into potential economic gains.
Here’s an overview of the patent landscape in 2021 with rankings based on the data by IFI Claims Patent Service.
Trend: 2016 to 2021                             
IBM continues to lead the way
IBM (IBM), popularly referred to as the Big Blue, has been leading the U.S. companies for decades in the number of patents received annually. The year 2021 was no exception with IBM marking the 29th consecutive year of patent leadership. The company received 8,682 patents in 2021, a 5% decline from the previous year. In terms of the cumulative patent holdings globally, IBM ranked eighth with 41,937 active patent families. The entry of six Chinese entities pushed IBM down from the second spot in 2020 to the eighth position in 2021. Since 1920, IBM has received more than 150,000 U.S. patents.
IBM’s patent portfolio is in sync with its vision for the future, which the company believes “will be powered by a blend of high-performance computing, AI and quantum computing, all integrated through the hybrid cloud.” IBM’s strategic investments over the years in advanced technologies have improved its competitive position and profit dynamics. IBM sees hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) as the two next great shifts in the technology landscape and is positioning itself to play a key role in this massive transformation. According to IBM, its “R&D operations differentiate it from its competitors.” The company has been investing approximately 9% of its total revenue in R&D, focusing on “high-growth, high-value opportunities.”
Samsung is steady in the second spot
Samsung (SSNLF) continues to rein at the second place with 6,366 patents awarded during 2021, marginally down by 1% as compared to the previous year. In terms of cumulative patent holdings, Samsung is the world leader with 90,416 active patent families. The South Korean conglomerate Samsung is the largest non-U.S. spender on R&D. Samsung spent ₩21.11 trillion during FY2020, which constituted 8.9% of its sales. During the first nine months of FY2021, ₩15.93 trillion was spent on R&D activities.
Samsung’s research is guided by its vision to ""shape the future with innovation and intelligence."" Core research areas include AI, data intelligence, robotics, next-generation communications and media, life care and new experiences, and security. Samsung operates three levels of R&D organizations, the first being a business unit development team that works on market ready technologies with a 1–2-year outlook, the second being the research institute that develops mid- to long-term technology with a 3–5-year outlook, and the third being the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology that develops core technology as seeds for future growth engines. In August 2021, Samsung announced an investment of $206 billion in the next three years to expand its footprint in biopharmaceuticals, AI, semiconductors and robotics in the post-pandemic era.
Canon takes the third spot
With 3,021 patents, Canon (CAJ) ranked third for the number of U.S. patents awarded in 2021. Canon has ranked in the top five for the number of patents granted for 36 consecutive years. Canon, a well-known global brand of Japanese origin, is a leading provider of consumer, business-to-business and industrial digital imaging solutions. The company has retained the number one spot among Japanese companies for the 17th consecutive year. When seen in terms of cumulative patent holdings, Canon holds the ninth position (from third in 2020) with 40,706 active patent families.
Canon is focusing on four key business areas, which include commercial printing, network cameras, medical and industrial equipment. In addition, the company is working to create new business in the fields of next-generation imaging, next-generation healthcare and smart mobility. 
The company’s R&D expenses were ¥272,312 million in FY2020, equivalent to 8.6% of net sales. In the first nine months of FY2021, the company spent ¥211,010 on R&D. Canon has been allocating 8-9% of its net sales to R&D expenses over the years. Canon believes that “new products protected by a robust patent portfolio will not easily allow competitors to surpass them and will give the company an advantage in establishing standards in the market and industry.”
TSMC enters the top five at position four
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) entered the top five patent holders in 2021. TSMC was awarded 2,798 patents during the year. Back in 2020, when majority companies witnessed a drop in patents in 2019, TSMC registered a 22% growth and moved up from the 12th place in 2019 to be at the sixth spot.
TSMC is the world’s leading dedicated semiconductor foundry dominating more than 55% of the market share: “Built the world's largest semiconductor design ecosystem, Open Innovation Platform, and collaborated with its partners to form the most powerful force of semiconductor innovations—about 85% of worldwide semiconductor start-up product prototypes were enabled by TSMC.”
TSMC reported a revenue of NT$1,587.42 billion in FY2021, an increase of 18.5% compared to the same period in FY2020. The company continues to spend 8-9% of the revenue on R&D. In April 2021, TSMC announced its plans to invest $100 billion over the next three years to increase capacity at its plants. In November 2021, the establishment of a subsidiary of TSMC in Japan with a minority shareholding of Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation was announced. The construction of the subsidiary named Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing (JASM) will begin in 2022, with production targeted to begin by the end of 2024. 
Huawei takes a jump to enter the top five
Chinese companies have shown a spectacular rise of 10% in the number of patents awarded in 2021. Huawei moved up by four places to make its place among the top five in 2021. It was in the ninth spot in 2020. Huawei was awarded a total of 2,770 in 2021 as compared to 2,761 patents in the previous year.
Huawei is a leading global provider of information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure and smart devices. While the company is yet to report its final revenue for FY2021, a note at the start of 2022 by the company’s chairman mentions that Huawei “expects to round off the year with a total revenue of ¥634 billion.”
Over the years, Huawei has been investing over 10% of its sales revenue back into R&D; its R&D spending constituted 15.9% of its total revenue of ¥891.37 billion in FY2020. The number of people working in the company’s R&D constitutes more than half of its total workforce. The company has three guiding principles when it comes to ecosystem and industry development—growing in the industry, working together and sharing value. Huawei has partnered with major industry players to innovate in emerging domains such as cloud computing, 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT).
Rounding up the top ten
Intel (INTC) slid to the sixth place. INTC was placed at the fourth spot during 2017 and 2018 and then at the fifth place during 2019 and 2020. Intel received 2,615 patents during 2021, a drop of 9% since 2020.
Apple (AAPL) moved one place up with 2,541 patents during 2021 despite a 9% fall in patents awarded during the year. The company had witnessed a 12% increase in patents during 2020, taking the tally to 2,791 patents.
With 2,487 patents, LG Electronics is at the eighth place, one rank down compared to 2020. The number of patents awarded to LG experienced shrunk by 12% during the year.

2022-01-12 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Intel vs. AMD,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-intel-vs.-amd,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) have experienced contrasting starts on the stock market in 2022, with the former heading higher despite the sell-off in tech stocks.
AMD, meanwhile, has lost ground, as investors seem to be hitting the sell button on tech stocks trading at rich valuations thanks to a potential increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. On the other hand, the signs of a turnaround at Intel and its cheap valuation have probably made it an attractive bet for investors hunting for value plays.
AMD data by YCharts.
So does this mean that Intel is a better buy than AMD even though the latter is growing at a much faster pace than its bigger rival? Let's find out.
The case for Intel
Intel's loss of market share to AMD has been a headwind for the former in recent years, but it looks like Chipzilla has finally found the firepower to arrest its slide in the form of its Alder Lake processors. Third-party testing indicates that Intel's latest processors are 30% more powerful than their AMD counterparts. What's more, Intel has priced its processors aggressively, causing AMD to feel the heat and reduce the price of its Ryzen processors.
It is also worth noting that Intel's portfolio of 60 Alder Lake processors will be featured in a whopping 500 new laptop and desktop models. More specifically, its most powerful Alder Lake H-series notebook processors have been selected by major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to power over 100 laptop designs that will be aimed at gamers and creators.

However, this is not the only way Intel is planning to get back at AMD. Chipzilla's Arc discrete GPUs have gained solid acceptance on launch. Intel says that it has already started shipping these processors that have landed more than 50 design wins across laptops and desktops.
It won't be surprising to see Intel take away market share from AMD in the lucrative graphics card space because it is packing technology that's on par with rivals. Additionally, Chipzilla's 75% share of the personal computer CPU market means that it is in a strong position to push sales of its discrete GPUs by promising more powerful performance when its cards are paired with compatible Intel processors using the Deep Link technology.
So Wall Street seems to be betting on a turnaround at Intel, which explains the semiconductor stock's impressive start to the year despite the turmoil in the broader technology sector.
The case for AMD
Shares of AMD may have got off to an inauspicious start in 2022, but investors shouldn't forget that the chipmaker could regain its mojo thanks to several catalysts. Analysts expect AMD to record 19% year-over-year revenue growth in 2022 along with bottom-line growth of nearly 27%.
While that may look like a major drop over AMD's estimated 2021 revenue growth of 65%, the company could surprise investors thanks to rising demand for gaming consoles, increasing graphics card demand, and its growing stature in the server market.
Gaming consoles, for instance, should continue to remain a big growth driver for AMD this year, as shipments of Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S consoles are expected to increase substantially. Sony, for example, is planning to make 22.6 million units of the PS5 in the next fiscal year that begins in April 2022, up from the current fiscal year's forecast of 15 million units.
Of course, component shortages may pose a challenge for Sony and Microsoft, but there have been signs of an improvement in chip supply lately. As a result, the demand for AMD's chips that power the PS5 and the latest Xbox consoles should continue to remain robust in 2022.
The data center market, on the other hand, is a prime target for growth for AMD this year. That's because AMD's share of the lucrative server market is expected to jump from an estimated 16% in the second quarter of 2021 to 25% this year, according to third-party estimates. Such impressive market share growth in servers could give AMD's top line a nice shot in the arm, as the market reportedly clocked $92 billion in revenue last year, according to research firm Omdia.
As such, AMD looks set to deliver yet another year of impressive growth, and that is one factor that sets it apart from Intel.
The verdict
Analysts expect Intel to have another bad year despite the positive developments highlighted above. The company's earnings are forecast to drop nearly 30% in 2022, while revenue is expected to remain flat over last year. That's why AMD looks like a proven growth stock to buy right now despite its rich valuation.
AMD stock is trading at 40 times trailing earnings, which is higher than the S&P 500's earnings multiple of 28.8. The valuation appears to be justified given that AMD's earnings are expected to grow at an annual pace of 35% for the next five years. Intel, meanwhile, is expected to clock just 3% annual earnings growth for the next five years, indicating that AMD is the better growth play for investors who are willing to buy the stock at its rich valuation.
Intel, however, is trading at just 10 times trailing earnings and it is gunning for a comeback with an aggressive product road map backed by massive capital spending. This makes Intel an ideal bet for investors looking to buy a tech stock with long-term potential at a cheap valuation.

2022-01-12 00:00:00+00:00,Why ASML Holding Shares Rose 63% in 2021,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-asml-holding-shares-rose-63-in-2021,,,"What happened
Shares of ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) gained 63.2% last year, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The maker of lithography systems that are used for manufacturing semiconductor chips is among the handful of companies that benefit from the long-running shortage of chipmaking facilities around the world.
So what
If you're making computer chips, your clean room probably has some of ASML's lithography machines installed. The company is not only a market leader in this field, but also stands alone on the leading edge of advanced lithography systems. So when Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is investing billions of dollars in next-generation manufacturing facilities and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is entering the chip foundry market along with another massive infrastructure boost, ASML is definitely reaping plenty of system orders from those factory-building ambitions.
The company dug into that opportunity in 2021. Sales added up to $6 billion dollars in the first three quarters of the year, a 40% constant-currency increase over the same period of 2020. Earnings soared 90% higher over the same period. At the same time, ASML has a backlog of unfilled system orders worth $21.8 billion, which works out to a 172% year-over-year increase.
Image source: Getty Images.
Now what
ASML is enjoying a golden age right now, and the back-ordered systems should keep the revenue streams flowing for at least a couple of years. The company is making the most of these rare market conditions.
However, market makers have already baked most of the good news into ASML's stock price. Shares are trading at 49 times trailing earnings and 14 times sales -- valuation ratios typically seen in skyrocketing software start-ups.
The company also had some bad luck on Jan 3, 2022, as a fire disrupted operations in ASML's Berlin factory. Smoke and fire damage shut down several manufacturing lines for a few days. The company is still evaluating the impact of this event, but the Berlin plant is getting back in action already.
This richly valued stock is not every investor's cup of molten silicon crystals. Value investors may want to give ASML's red-hot stock a chance to cool down before taking action. In particular, the stock might take a dive when management reports the Berlin incident's final impact. Expect that update to arrive as a part of ASML's fourth-quarter earnings report on Jan. 19.

2022-01-11 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Continues Gains on Micron’s Loss,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-continues-gains-on-microns-loss,,,"If the chip market weren't brutal enough already, the latest news from Intel (INTC) will only drive the point home harder. Recently, Intel made some solid gains after revealing it has a new addition to its C-suite that will start next Monday. The story of that new addition—and what happened to his former employer—is what really sells it. I was already bullish on Intel before, and this story does nothing to shift that perception.
Intel's year in share prices has had its ups and downs. In particular, there was one big up, followed by a big down. Intel started the year on an upward cant, going from just under $52 to just over $61 in just under two weeks. Its peak didn't last, though, as the company—just a week later—slipped to around $52.
That kicked off a massive upswing in which Intel not only broke $65 but made $70 look like a genuine possibility by April. Intel couldn't make those gains stick either, as the stock dropped back to around $53 by mid-May.
The company then largely plateaued, holding around the $55 mark until late October, when another drop took the company to around $47.50 in just six days. Intel has been fighting back from that drop ever since to recover to $55, which is roughly where it started a year ago.
The latest news seems to be giving Intel some new traction. The company hired David Zinsner to serve as its new chief financial officer starting in February.
Zinsner will be replacing George Davis, who announced plans to retire back in October. Interestingly, Zinsner was CFO at Micron Technology (MU) until the move was announced. That wasn't the only loss, though; Intel also noted that its head of client computing, Gregory Bryant, is poised to leave the company when January ends.
Musical C-Suite Chairs
It's interesting that Micron Technology shares lost while Intel gained as a result of one shift in the CFO slot. It's clear Intel has made a solid move in replacing its outgoing CFO. It helps that Zinsner has already held that slot previously and in pretty much the same industry.
Intel has basically just assured shareholders that very little is likely to change as a result of this move, for better or worse. When it comes to the CFO, ""status quo"" is seldom bad news. Innovation in accounting isn't that welcome anyway, in many cases.
A little status quo should also give Intel a hand as the market shifts fundamentally. When the latest numbers of chip production come out, it's a safe bet that Intel will lose its rank as the leader in chip production to Samsung Electronics. Investors seem to be responding accordingly, migrating to firms like Nvidia (NVDA). However, Intel's move could be in place to reassure the skittish investor that the company is in solid hands.
Worse, Intel is finding trouble with politics as well. Intel recently modified a letter it sent to suppliers, pulling all references to ""Xinjiang"" from said letter. Chinese social media took Intel to task over said letter, which asked suppliers to avoid doing business with Xinjiang firms over allegations of human rights issues. Intel apologized, insisting that Intel sent the letter specifically to comply with laws in America. 
However, INTC is still one of the leading chipmakers around, and its recent move to enhance its production capabilities only helps. Intel investigated enhancements to its Malaysian chip making operations, planning to spend $7 billion on enhancements therein.
It's also building two new operations in Arizona, valued at around $20 billion total. Just to top it off, Intel's dividend history is solid and has been on the rise for at least the last two years.
Wall Street's Take
Turning to Wall Street, Intel has a Hold consensus rating. That's based on six Buys, 12 Holds, and seven Sells assigned in the past three months. The average Intel price target of $55.52 implies 0.7% downside potential.
Analyst price targets range from a low of $40 per share to a high of $80 per share.
Concluding Views
Looking for Intel to be a growth stock is likely to be a bad idea. It's already trading close to its average price target. Intel isn't likely to see big moves up or down. Its current position between the highest and lowest targets helps ensure that.
No, Intel looks like it will be a solid stock for users to hold and treat as an income producer. Intel holds an excellent position in a growing industry right now, thanks to its position as a major chipmaker. It might be losing some ground to Samsung in the short term, but there are expansion projects in the works that may address this.
Intel hiring an experienced CFO directly away from the competition helps as well; it demonstrates a push for stability. Thanks to its solid position and excellent potential as an income stock, I'm bullish on Intel.

Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Tuesday as investors picked up beaten-down stocks ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony that may offer fresh insight on policy tightening and the central bank's plans to tackle inflation.
The rise in futures set the S&P 500 index .SPX on course to break a five-day slump, while the Nasdaq .IXIC was set to extend thin gains from Monday as big tech stocks gained after being battered by rising bond yields.
Megacap growth companies including Apple Inc AAPL.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Meta Platforms Inc FB.O and Tesla Inc TSLA.O rose up to 1% in premarket trading.
Marko Kolanovic, chief global markets strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co, called the recent pull-back in riskier assets ""arguably overdone"" and said it presented investors with a buying opportunity.
Powell is set to appear before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 a.m ET for consideration for a second four-year term as head of the Fed, while Lael Brainard is set to appear before the same panel on Thursday for promotion to a four-year term as Fed vice chair.
At 6:54 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 95 points, or 0.26%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 19.25 points, or 0.41%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 93.5 points, or 0.6%.
Equity markets have been battered since the start of this year after minutes from the Fed's December meeting pointed to a sooner-than-expected rise in interest rates due to rising inflationary pressures.
Investors will eye key consumer inflation data on Wednesday, with the headline CPI expected to come in at a red-hot 7% on a year-on-year basis, adding to fears that it could sway the trajectory of the Fed's interest rate hikes.
The center-piece event of the week is the start of the fourth-quarter earnings season on Friday, with big banks expected to show an uptick in quarterly core revenue thanks to new lending and firming Treasury yields.
Big banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Goldman Sachs GS.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N, Morgan Stanley MS.N and Citigroup Inc C.N gained between 0.4% and 0.6%.

2022-01-11 00:00:00+00:00,7 Semiconductor Stocks With the Most Upside in the New Year,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-semiconductor-stocks-with-the-most-upside-in-the-new-year,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The annual Computer Electronics Show (CES), which bills itself as “the most influential tech event in the world,” marked the start of 2022. CES 2022 is an opportunity for technology companies to showcase their upcoming products. It also marks a seasonal peak for tech stocks. Investors tend to buy picks in the sector — like semiconductor stocks — ahead of the event, and then sell them. They expect the technology companies will not post anything new afterward.
The seasonal selling pressure may not show up this year. Covid is still disrupting public events and supply chains. Tech firms could also adjust their press release schedule. They might announce some of their new products and wait until later in the year to share bigger news.
For investors focused on the long-term, tech firms will continue thriving in 2022 and beyond. One crucial factor impacting the tech sector is semiconductors, which are vital to much of the technology that is seeing high demand. Chipmakers stand to benefit this year and beyond as they supply components needed across several sectors.
The semiconductor cycle is amid a secular growth phase. Demand for automobiles, personal computers, mobile phones and cloud computing will rise again this year. Prices will remain at current levels or increase due to tight supply chains.
7 High Risk Stocks That Are Worth The Volatile Vibes
With that backdrop in mind, these seven semiconductor stocks have the most upside potential this year:
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
MACOM Technology (NASDAQ:MTSI)
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU)
NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)
Ultra Clean Holdings (NASDAQ:UCTT)
United Microelectronics (NYSE:UMC)
Stocks with scores in green have a good score.

From the quantitative scores supplied by Stock Rover, most companies score well on all metrics, especially on quality and growth. Companies that have weak value scores may risk a brief correction. However, investors are used to this volatility. Many semiconductor stocks trade at a premium because they offer strong growth in the year ahead.

In the high-end gaming market, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dominates. This year, it will solidify its product offerings with the release of a Ryzen 9 6980HX mobile chip. The central processing unit (CPU) is a positive inflection point for AMD. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) will manufacture the chip with its 6-nanometer process.
The chip is a gamechanger for the laptop gaming market because of its small size. It also runs on 5 gigahertz and will need only 45 watts of power. The company’s new Ryzen 9 6900HX will have the same 8 cores and 16 threads as the 6980HX, but will run slightly slower. AMD could sell this chip to gamers for less.
In the graphics market, AMD will consolidate its market share with a mobile Radeon RX 6850XT. The graphics processing unit (GPU) will have plenty of memory and good performance.
Wall Street is cautious with AMD stock. The fair value is $143.71, according to Tipranks. Consider waiting for the stock to pull back first before buying. AMD already enjoyed a strong run-up in the last year.
Intel (INTC)

Intel is slowly catching up to AMD in the personal computer (PC) chip space. Its newer Alder Lake processor performs better than the i7-11900K series that preceded it. Additionally, its GPU segment is a potential catalyst that can unlock the discount in INTC stock.
Intel trades at a low price-to-earnings multiple. The company needs consumers to warm up to its discrete GPU release set for the first quarter. What might be better news is that Intel will reportedly release two DG2 Gaming GPUs in March.
Arc Alchemist, its new GPU series, will feature at least three cards. Its high-end offering will have 16GB of GDDR6 memory. Consumers will get the equivalent of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070’s or 3070 Ti’s performance with this Intel product.
7 Safe Stocks for Your Retirement
Intel has a good chance of undermining Nvidia and AMD by becoming a major supplier of graphics cards. In 2021, both firms refreshed their GPUs with minimal performance enhancements. They raised the prices, taking advantage of the chip shortage and the overwhelming demand exceeding supply levels.
Semiconductor Stocks: MACOM Technology (MTSI)

Macom develops radio and wave semiconductor devices and components. It posted a strong fiscal fourth quarter that reaffirmed the business strength will continue.
In Q4, Macom posted revenue of $155.2 million. The gross margin was 58.1%. It enjoyed a net income of $17.1 million, or 24 cents a diluted share. In the current first quarter ended Dec. 31, 2021, Macom expects revenue of up to $161 million. The gross margin will be between 60% and 62%.
By 2025, Macom is on a good trajectory to reach its $1 billion revenue target. Chief Executive Officer Steve Daly said the company is starting the year with almost a near-record backlog. It is bringing better products to market. That suggests a margin expansion and higher profits for the long term.
Just as other chip firms are constrained, Macom is, too. For example, it has supply disruptions that have an impact on its capacity. This is hurting its assembly and test activity. Customers are adjusting to the delays by pushing out their system build schedules.
Micron Technology (MU)

Memory provider Micron posted strong quarterly results. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the data economy is still in the early phases. This economy includes sectors like artificial intelligence, electric vehicles and data centers.
Micron is ramping up the release of 1-alpha dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and 176-layer NAND products. Helped by strong demand in the first quarter, it will deliver record revenue in fiscal 2022. Unlike many hyped technology firms that lose money, Micron will post robust profitability. Tech investors tired of losing money in speculative stocks should consider MU stock instead.
Micron trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio below that of the industry. As the table shows above, Micron scores a 91/100 on value.
The chip giant will work through the supply constraints by securing components. Eventually, the supply shortage will ease throughout 2022. Investors should expect Micron’s profit margins to expand next. At current valuations, Micron is still a discounted stock.
7 Best Stocks to Buy to Kick Off the New Year
Readers may build a five-year discounted cash flow growth exit model. Revenue growth may slow in that period. The model still implies a fair value of more than $102.
Semiconductor Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)

Nothing highlights the extent of the GPU shortage quite like this story of a shopper being shut out by a cashier when buying an RTX 30-series card. Gamers need to spend more than $3,000 for an Nvidia RTX 3090, or around $1,500 for an RTX 3080. This is above the launch price of $699 for the RTX 3080.
Instead of waiting for prices to fall, consumers may rent Nvidia’s RTX 3080 power through its cloud gaming service. GeForce Now will potentially add plenty of recurring subscription revenue. It offers three membership tiers: free, priority and RTX 3080. The varying performance levels will appeal to gamers of all types.
Nvidia is not asking much from gamers interested in the service. This will lift the company’s margins for 2022. With the chip shortage showing no signs of easing, Nvidia may increase its monthly subscription rate to maximize profits.
More recently, Meta’s (NASDAQ:FB) investments in the metaverse will benefit Nvidia and AMD. Virtual worlds will need graphics chip power. As Nvidia sells more GPU cards and online services, its revenue will grow at strong rates for years to come.
Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT)

Ultra Clean Holdings supplies critical subsystems, components and parts for semiconductors. It also offers purity cleaning solutions for the chipmaking industry.
In the third quarter, UCTT posted revenue growth of 52.4% year-over-year (YOY). It earned $1.07 a share on a non-GAAP basis (and 70 cents in GAAP EPS.) The company is growing quickly because it supplies many critical elements related to the semiconductor production process. With the chip shortage, customers cannot risk further delays related to packaging and test failures.
UCTT will expand its market by growing in four segments. It currently gains most of its revenue from its service, non-semiconductor, foundry and logic wafer fab equipment (WFE), and memory WFE offerings (per slide 10.)
The company navigated the supply bottlenecks well in the last quarter. It is working with its supply chain team to plan for delayed deliveries. By communicating setbacks with customers, UCTT will not lose its business.
7 Tech Stocks to Buy That Also Have Solid Dividends
Furthermore, it actively engages with suppliers. UCTT uses a collaborative planning and forecasting model. It has a strong sense of its output capability. Customers across key markets appreciate its timely deliveries.
Semiconductor Stocks: United Microelectronics (UMC)

United Microelectronics (UMC) is a global semiconductor foundry company in the integrated circuit fabrication market. Expect its strong revenue growth to continue this year.
For October 2020, UMC said that revenue grew by 25.36%. Additionally, the average selling prices for the 8-inch wafer equivalent will likely rise in the year ahead.
Notably, Asia accounted for 65% of revenue in Q3. Yet North America has strong demand and was only 22% of UMC’s business. As demand from communications grows, this chip company may beat investor expectations.
In the third-quarter conference call, CEO Jason Wang said that the P5, 10-K expansion (28 nanometers) would come online in Q2 2022. Its P6 expansion will come online late in 2023. The company has a systematic ramp schedule that will fuel its operating margin expansion in the next few years.
UMC is among the safest tech firms for investors. It has a disciplined capital expenditure philosophy. Even though the market is hot, the company is not overextending itself to chase profits. Instead, it drives a sustainable structure by limiting capex spending.
UMC always aligns its offerings with customer demand. Only after that review does the company make spending decisions.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd.
Another major name to consider among dividend stocks now would be the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

Not to mention, the company is actively planning to invest $100 billion towards growing its manufacturing capacity through 2024.

As it stands, TSM stock currently trades at $129.17 as of Tuesday’s close. This would be after gains of over 8% in the past month alone. Despite its current momentum, TSM does not appear to be slowing down anytime soon. Notably, the company continues to see persistent strength in demand for its offerings. This is evident from its record quarterly sales figures posted yesterday. For reference, TSM raked in a total revenue of about $5.6 billion in December, marking a new high for monthly revenue.
