2022-07-12 00:00:00+00:00,Five-Star Analyst Quinn Bolton’s Views on Semiconductor Stocks,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/five-star-analyst-quinn-boltons-views-on-semiconductor-stocks,,,"Our expert for today, Quinn Bolton, is the Managing Director of Equity Research at Needham & Co. with expertise in covering U.S.-based communications integrated circuits (ICs) and consumer semiconductor companies.
Based on his analysis of a “slowdown in demand across most end markets coupled with several quarters of inventory purge,” Bolton believes that semiconductor sales are going to peak in Q2 of this year, with inventory levels expected to peak in Q2/Q3 of 2022.
As a result, the period between 4Q of 2022 and 2Q of 2024 will witness an inventory purge as “semiconductor sales will trend below natural consumption.”
So what's the good news? This period of lull will be followed by two years of boom, marking double-digit revenue growth. Based on this thesis, Bolton has lowered the revenue and earnings estimates and price targets of most companies in his coverage.
Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI)
Analog Devices is an American multinational semiconductor company specializing in data conversion, signal processing, and power management technology. The company manufactures analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing integrated circuits (ICs) used in electronic equipment.
ADI stock has lost 14.5% so far this year. ADI, led by the inflated demand for chips amid the dire supply chain constraints during the pandemic, consistently outperformed earnings expectations. It is scheduled to report its Q3FY22 results on August 17, with consensus earnings per share (EPS) pegged at $2.43.
Despite his bullish stance on ADI stock, Bolton has drastically cut the price target to $170 (13.4% upside potential) from $205. Meanwhile, the analyst has also lowered the EPS estimate for 2022 to $8.96 from $9.20.
The Street has a Strong Buy rating consensus on ADI stock based on six Buys and two Holds. The average Analog Devices price forecast of $194.13 implies 29.5% upside potential to current levels.
Bolton initiated coverage of ADI Stock in June 2021 and has since maintained his optimistic view. However, the analyst has generated a poor success rate of 13% on the stock, with an average loss per stock of 7.6%.
Monolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ: MPWR)
Monolithic Power Systems provide power circuits for systems found in cloud computing, telecom infrastructures, automotives, industrial applications, and consumer applications. MPWR stock has lost 19.8% so far this year.
Notably, MPWR has surpassed expectations for the past several quarters and is slated to report its Q2FY22 earnings on July 27. The consensus earnings estimate is pegged at $2.94 per share.
With seven unanimous Buys, MPWR commands a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average Monolithic Power price forecast of $552.57 implies 39.7% upside potential to current levels.
Bolton had a Hold rating on MPWR stock between the periods of May 2019 and February 2020. However, before and after the aforementioned period, he has consistently recommended a Buy rating. The analyst has modestly reduced the price target on the stock to $500 (26.4% upside potential) from $530 while also lowering the 2022 earnings per share (EPS) forecast to $10.73 from $11.22.
Notably, Bolton enjoys a success rate of 89% on MPWR stock while generating an average profit per share of 38%.
Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL)
Marvell Technology designs, develops, and markets analog, mixed, and digital signal processing products and embedded and standalone ICs. Although the company has constantly exceeded expectations, the stock has lost 47.3% year to date.
Marvell is scheduled to report its Q2FY23 earnings on August 25, with a consensus earnings estimate of $0.57 per share. Bolton has slashed the price target on MRVL stock to $66 (40.5% upside potential) from $75 while maintaining a Buy rating. And he has also lowered the FY23 EPS estimate to $2.25 from $2.33.
Based on 16 Buys and two Holds, MRVL stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average Marvell Technology price target of $82.28 implies a whopping 75.1% upside potential.
Bolton enjoys an impressive 37.7% average return per stock on his multiple calls on MRVL stock with a 79% success rate.
Semtech Corporation (NASDAQ: SMTC)
Semtech is a supplier of analog and mixed-signal semiconductors and advanced algorithms for consumer, enterprise computing, communications, and industrial end-markets. SMTC stock has lost 40.8% year-to-date, despite constantly outpacing Wall Street’s earnings expectations.
SMTC is slated to release its Q2FY23 results on August 31, and the consensus for earnings stands at $0.85 per share. Bolton has significantly cut the price target on the stock to $58 (8.9% upside potential) from $75 while also lowering the FY23 EPS forecast to $3.08 from $3.35.
With eight Buys and two Holds, SMTC stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average Semtech price forecast of $82.60 implies 55.1% upside potential to current levels.
Bolton has given consistent Buy recommendations on SMTC stock since May 2020. He enjoys a success rate of 62% on his calls on SMTC with an average return per stock of 11.8%.
Ending Thoughts
According to the TipRanks Star Ranking system, Bolton ranks #2 out of the 7,924 analysts in its universe, and #6 among the 20,710 experts tracked overall. Remarkably, Bolton has had a success rate of 66% with an average return of an impressive 41.5% over the past year. Moreover, his calls have generated an alpha of 29% and 23.7% over the S&P 500 (SPX) and the benchmark, respectively, during the same period.

2022-07-07 00:00:00+00:00,Best Stocks To Buy Today? 5 Chip Stocks In Focus Today,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/best-stocks-to-buy-today-5-chip-stocks-in-focus-today,,,"Are These The Best Chip Stocks To Buy Right Now?
Chip stocks, much like most tech sectors in the stock market today, have been under significant pressure over the past year. Sentiments around the $550 billion chip industry were mixed on concerns of weakening consumer demand. Fortunately, it appears that there could be light at the end of the tunnel. On Thursday, Samsung posted a “better than feared” earnings guidance for its second quarter. Making it one of the earliest major chip companies to report earnings after a pivotal quarter. 
The company announced that it expects the upcoming quarter’s revenue to increase to $59.8 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Meanwhile, its operating profit would likely grow by 12% to $10.6 billion. To say the least, it appears that fears of a slowdown among tech manufacturers could be less severe than initially expected. With Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), another major chip company, scheduled to release its earnings next week, all eyes could be on the sector. Building off these positive sentiments, chip stocks could be worth a look right now. So, here are five of the top names in the industry worth noting in thestock market today 
Chip Stocks To Watch Right Now
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD)
Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU)
Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MRVL)
Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ: TXN)
Intel
First, we have one of the top names in the industry, Intel. Put simply, the company designs and manufactures products and technologies. For more than half a century, the company has been the heart of computing breakthroughs. Even now, many believe that Intel will play a huge role in several technological inflections such as artificial intelligence (AI), 5G network transformation, and many more. Now, why is that so? Well, silicon and software is the main driver for these inflections, and the company is at the heart of it all. 
Recently, Intel officially acquired the land required for its Ohio manufacturing plant. According to NBC, an Intel spokesman confirmed that crews have begun work on the land. It appears that a team led by Gilbane Building Company will be responsible for the construction site preparation for its planned factories. Investors would be delighted with this piece of news as there were speculations that the $20 billion project could be scaled back if the CHIPS Act is not passed in the near term. Considering these circumstances, should investors be optimistic about the future of INTC stock?

Advanced Micro Devices
Similar to Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is a force to be reckoned with in the chip sector. In detail, its segments include Computing and Graphics, and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi Custom. Today, AMD offers the industry’s broadest portfolio of leadership high-performance and adaptive processor technologies. The company combines CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, Adaptive SoCs, and deep software expertise to enable leadership computing platforms for cloud, edge, and other end devices. Therefore, AMD stock is often mentioned among the top chip stocks in the stock market. 
On top of that, AMD is not one that easily rests on its laurels. Late in June, the company announced the Versal™ AI Core series has been selected by Canon for its Free Viewpoint Video System. The Versal AI Core devices can deliver powerful machine learning-based video processing at the edge for Canon camera systems. With this, one may expect a revolution in the viewing experience for live sports broadcasting and webcasting. With that in mind, would AMD stock make it to the top of your watchlist?

Micron
Micron is a world leader in innovating memory and storage solutions. The company aims to accelerate the transformation of information into intelligence, inspiring the world to learn, communicate and advance faster than ever. Despite the company predicting a slightly weakened industry demand, Micron is still fundamentally sound. During its third quarter, the company reported revenue of $8.64 billion, an increase of 16.2% year-over-year. Meanwhile, its GAAP net income was $2.63 billion, or $2.34 per diluted share. Overall, the company is still confident that its long-term growth plans are intact.
Furthermore, Micron announced on Wednesday the commercial and industrial channel partner availability of its DDR5 server DRAM. This is in support of industry qualification of next-generation Intel and AMD DDR5 server and workstation platforms. It is a significant development as DDR5 memory enables up to an 85% increase in system performance over its previous generation, DDR4 DRAM5. Hence, as data continues to grow over time, this will address the critical need for the success of most businesses today. All things considered, would you bank on the future of MU stock?

Marvell
Following that, we have a semiconductor company that focuses on chip development for the data infrastructure industry, Marvell. Through Marvell’s cutting-edge chips, tech firms across the globe can move, store, process, and secure their data assets. Among Marvell’s core end markets are the enterprise, cloud, automotive, and carrier architecture industries. As tech firms continue to upscale their data processing infrastructure, MRVL stock could be worth looking out for.
Last month, the company announced an expansion of its Canadian presence in Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver. With growth in mind, Marvell will be adding over 120 new employees to the Marvell Canada team. The team in Canada will be working on the development of critical technologies and solutions for some of the fastest-growing and lucrative end markets in the chip sector. Aside from that, it also shows that the company is reinforcing its commitment to hiring top semiconductor talent across major hubs around the world. With all said and done, would you consider investing in MRVL stock?

Texas Instruments
To sum up the list, we will be looking at Texas Instruments. Essentially, the company designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits. Specifically, Texas focuses on developing analog chips and embedded processors, which account for more than 80% of its revenue. It is also one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world based on sales volume. Additionally, the company produces its digital light processing technology and education technology products such as calculators and microcontrollers. 
In June, Texas announced the expansion of its connectivity portfolio with a new family of wireless microcontrollers. These will allow high-quality Bluetooth Low Energy at half the price of competing devices. Not to mention, these microcontrollers feature the best-in-class standby current and radio-frequency performance. The SimpleLink™ Bluetooth LE CC2340 family is built on the foundation of the company’s decades of wireless connectivity expertise. Given such an exciting development, should investors be keeping a close tab on TXN stock?

Marvell Technology Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.06 on 7/27/22, Verizon Communications Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.64 on 8/1/22, and Steelcase, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.145 on 7/18/22.

In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 0.58% for Marvell Technology Inc, 5.00% for Verizon Communications Inc, and 5.51% for Steelcase, Inc..
In Tuesday trading, Marvell Technology Inc shares are currently down about 2.3%, Verizon Communications Inc shares are down about 0.8%, and Steelcase, Inc. shares are down about 1.7% on the day.

2022-07-04 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Marvell Technology (MRVL) is a Strong Growth Stock,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-marvell-technology-mrvl-is-a-strong-growth-stock-0,,,"It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.
The research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, more confident investor.
It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.
What are the Zacks Style Scores?
The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.
Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:
Value Score
Value investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.
Growth Score
While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.
Momentum Score
Momentum traders and investors live by the saying ""the trend is your friend."" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.
VGM Score
If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank
A proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.
Investors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.
With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.
That's where the Style Scores come in.
To have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.
As mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.
A stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.
Stock to Watch: Marvell Technology (MRVL)
California-based Marvell Technology is a fabless designer, developer and marketer of analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits. The company operates in Bermuda, China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
MRVL is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.
Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. MRVL has a Growth Style Score of B, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 48.4% for the current fiscal year.
11 analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2023, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.04 to $2.33 per share. MRVL also boasts an average earnings surprise of 7.2%.
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, MRVL should be on investors' short list.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-06-30 00:00:00+00:00,August 12th Options Now Available For Marvell Technology (MRVL),MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/august-12th-options-now-available-for-marvell-technology-mrvl,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options begin trading today, for the August 12th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new August 12th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $43.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.25. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $43.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $39.75 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $43.35/share today.
Because the $43.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.56% return on the cash commitment, or 64.16% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $43.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $44.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.20. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $43.35/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $44.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.88% if the stock gets called away at the August 12th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $44.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $44.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.38% boost of extra return to the investor, or 62.66% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $43.35) to be 54%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Over the past couple of years, semiconductor stocks have certainly made their presence felt in the stock market. However, the industry faced a number of curveballs such as lockdowns in key chipmaking cities in China and the Fed’s multiple interest rate hikes. Despite all this, semiconductor stocks remain relevant. This would be thanks to factors such as the growing adoption of 5G-enabled devices and the automotive industry’s shift towards electric vehicles (EVs). Moreover, there’s also the digitization of industries, which is further driving the demand for semiconductors. 
With the future looking to grow increasingly reliant on semiconductors, investing in semiconductor stocks right now could be worthwhile for the long run. One of the companies that investors may be watching right now is Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU). The company will be reporting its earnings after market close tomorrow. Analysts are expecting the semiconductor company to post a revenue of $8.7 billion, an increase of 16.8% year-over-year. Along with that, earnings are expected to be $2.46 per share, up by 30.9% from last year. All things considered, watch out for these five semiconductors stocks in the stock market today.
Semiconductor Stocks For Your July 2022 Watchlist
Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM)
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) 
Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ: TXN) 
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)
Marvell Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVL)
Qualcomm 
Starting us off today is Qualcomm, a company that creates semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology. As a matter of fact, it is a global leader in developing and commercializing foundational technologies that are used in today’s wireless products. The company also licenses its intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights to manufacture and use certain wireless products.
Yesterday, prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) will likely be using Qualcomm’s 5G modems for its 2023 iPhones. At the moment, Apple relies on its own in-house modems for its iPhones. If this checks out, Qualcomm will remain the exclusive supplier for 5G chips of this year’s new iPhones, with a supply share of 100%. Prior to this, Qualcomm said that it was expecting to supply 20% of iPhone modems in 2023 as part of a bullish financial forecast. Given this development, will you be watching QCOM stock?

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) is one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Put simply, TSM manufactures and sells integrated circuits and semiconductors. On top of that, the company also offers customer service, account management, and engineering services. In addition, TSM owns and operates the largest semiconductor design ecosystem globally, the Open Innovation Platform.
On June 17, executives from TSM said that the company is expecting to have the next version of ASML’s (NASDAQ: ASML) most advanced chip-making tool in 2024. The tool, called “high-NA EUV” produces beams of focused light that create the microscopic circuitry on chips used in phones, laptops, cars, and artificial intelligence devices such as smart speakers. For those unfamiliar, EUV stands for extreme ultraviolet, the wavelength of light used by ASML’s most advanced machines. TSM being able to get its hands on this tool in 2024 essentially means they get to the most advanced technology faster. As such, should you invest in TSM stock?
Texas Instruments 
Another notable semiconductor name to consider would be Texas Instruments (TXN). In essence, the company designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits. Specifically, TXN focuses on developing analog chips and embedded processors, which account for more than 80% of its revenue. It is also one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world based on sales volume. Besides semiconductors, TXN produces its digital light processing technology and education technology products such as calculators and microcontrollers.
Last week, TXN announced the expansion of its connectivity portfolio with a new family of wireless microcontrollers. Impressively, these microcontrollers enable high-quality Bluetooth Low Energy at half the price of its competitors. “The adoption of Bluetooth LE is accelerating and our embedded world demo of the CC2340 family will show you how to quickly and easily add the technology to any application” said Marian Kost, Vice President and General Manager of Connectivity at Texas Instruments. “The new MCUs will provide high-quality RF and power at an affordable price, backed by unrivaled technical support and internal manufacturing capacity investments that will help meet our customers’ demand for years to come.” Given TXN’s competitive chips, should you buy TXN stock?

NVIDIA 
Following that, we have NVIDIA, a multinational tech company that sells its graphics processing unit (GPU) and tech services. In fact, it is a pioneer of GPUs and has essentially driven the growth of high-performance computing and artificial intelligence (AI). The company’s pioneering work in accelerated computing has also reshaped trillion-dollar industries like transportation and health care. Late last month, NVIDIA announced that a slew of the world’s leading computer makers is adopting its new NVIDIA Grace Superchips.
These Superchips will play an important role in creating the next generation of servers, turbocharging artificial intelligence (AI), and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads for the exascale era. Dell (NYSE: DELL) and Lenovo among others are planning to deploy servers built with the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip and NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip. As supercomputing enters the era of exascale AI, NVIDIA’s chip will allow its partners to tackle challenges that were previously out of reach. With that being said, will you be adding NVDA stock to your watchlist?
Marvell Technology
Marvell Technology is a semiconductor firm that primarily focuses on developing chips for the data infrastructure industry. Through Marvell’s cutting-edge chips, tech firms across the globe can move, store, process, and secure their data assets. Among Marvell’s core end markets are the enterprise, cloud, automotive, and carrier architecture industries. As tech firms continue to upscale their data processing infrastructure, MRVL stock could be worth looking out for.
Last month, the company reported its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. For starters, Marvell brought in a net revenue of $1.45 billion, an increase of 74% year-over-year. That also exceeded the midpoint of the guidance the company provided in March. Marvell attributes this growth to higher-than-forecasted results from the data center end market. In the same report, Marvell provided its outlook for the second quarter. Namely, it expects revenue at the midpoint to grow by 5% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. All in all, given the strong quarter, is MRVL stock one to add to the portfolio?

2022-06-23 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting MRVL Put And Call Options For February 2023,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-mrvl-put-and-call-options-for-february-2023,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available this week, for the February 2023 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 239 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new February 2023 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.85. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $38.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $46.55/share today.
Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 15.22% return on the cash commitment, or 23.24% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $45.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $47.50 strike price has a current bid of $7.85. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $46.55/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $47.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 18.90% if the stock gets called away at the February 2023 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $47.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $47.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 42%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 16.86% boost of extra return to the investor, or 25.75% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 57%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 55%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $46.55) to be 54%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-06-20 00:00:00+00:00,Add Up The Pieces: IVDG Could Be Worth $12,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/add-up-the-pieces%3A-ivdg-could-be-worth-%2412,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Invesco Focused Discovery Growth ETF (Symbol: IVDG), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $12.12 per unit.
With IVDG trading at a recent price near $9.02 per unit, that means that analysts see 34.39% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of IVDG's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL), Globant SA (Symbol: GLOB), and AMETEK Inc (Symbol: AME). Although MRVL has traded at a recent price of $46.04/share, the average analyst target is 88.97% higher at $87.00/share. Similarly, GLOB has 53.45% upside from the recent share price of $177.72 if the average analyst target price of $272.71/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting AME to reach a target price of $160.36/share, which is 49.68% above the recent price of $107.14. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MRVL, GLOB, and AME:
Combined, MRVL, GLOB, and AME represent 5.93% of the Invesco Focused Discovery Growth ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
Invesco Focused Discovery Growth ETF IVDG $9.02 $12.12 34.39%
Marvell Technology Inc MRVL $46.04 $87.00 88.97%
Globant SA GLOB $177.72 $272.71 53.45%
AMETEK Inc AME $107.14 $160.36 49.68%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2022-06-11 00:00:00+00:00,5 Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks to Buy and Hold,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-undervalued-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-and-hold,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Undervalued semiconductor stocks have declined sharply in 2022, pushing many stocks to 52-week lows. Supply-chain issues have yet to be ironed out and the 40-year high inflation has only added to suppliers’ woes.
Despite these challenges, the demand for semiconductors remains strong worldwide. Recent research highlights that the global semiconductor “market is projected to grow from $483.00 billion in 2022 to $893.10 billion by 2029, at a CAGR of 9.2% in forecast period.”
Presently, however, investor optimism for semiconductor stocks is still subdued. Accordingly, the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index has fallen around 24% year-to-date (YTD). In comparison, the S&P 500 index has only dropped 14%.
Despite recent challenges, the semiconductor sector is poised to gain significant ground in the future. An increasing number of industries, such as robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), electric vehicles (EVs) and household goods have started utilizing semiconductors in new and exciting ways.

2022-06-08 00:00:00+00:00,J.P. Morgan Says There’s Room for at Least 50% Gains in These 2 Stocks,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/j.p.-morgan-says-theres-room-for-at-least-50-gains-in-these-2-stocks,,,"Despite the modest rally that we’ve seen since late May, volatility still rules the markets. The overall trend for the year has been down – to the tune of 14% on the S&P 500 and 23% on the NASDAQ. It’s not exactly an environment that would encourage large-scale buying.
But Marko Kolanovic,global marketstrategist from JPMorgan, takes the contrarian view, explaining why, in his view, current low prices represent opportunities.
“As the market got into oversold conditions, it didn’t take much to completely reverse losses—there were measured comments from the Fed (Bostic), and management of financial institutions giving hope that a policy error and recession may be avoided. Corporate buybacks kicked in post earnings… We believe that this will be a template for the whole year, in the sense that the market sold off in the first half of the year and will be followed by a gradual recovery in the second half,” Kolanovic opined.
In the meantime, Kolanovic’s colleagues among the JPMorgan stock analysts are not shy about pointing out two stocks with potential for solid gains going forward – gains on the order of 50% or better. According to TipRanks' database, both have received plenty of love from other analysts as well, earning a 'Strong Buy' consensus rating. Let's take a closer look.
Volaris (VLRS)
The first JPMorgan pick is Volaris, a discount airline and a major carrier in the Mexican air travel market. Prior to the pandemic, Volaris held a 28% market share in its home country’s domestic market, giving it a leading position. The airline offers ultra-low-cost fares to destinations across Mexico, the US, and Central and South America.
Volaris has, since the third quarter of 2021, shown a strong revenue rebound from the depressed results of the pandemic period. In the recently reported 1Q22, the company showed a top line of US$567 million, up 80% from the first quarter of 2021. Volaris’ total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM), a key industry metric, rose 18% to reach 7 cents. All of this led to quarterly cash generation of $9 million, and a total cash position – including other liquid assets – of $750 million. The total cash position represented 31% of the previous 12 months’ total operating revenue.
The company credited a combination of factors, including higher capacity and continued strong demand despite ongoing COVID cases, for these gains. Passengers transported increased by 64% year-over-year during the first quarter, with domestic travel gaining 58% and international gaining 95%. The company’s available seat miles (ASM, another key industry metric, measuring capacity), grew 50%.
Higher fuel costs, however, powered an increase in operating costs to $598 million in the quarter, resulting in a net loss of $31 million. Volaris reported a net loss per American Depositary Share of 42 cents.
Despite the losses, J.P. Morgan analyst Fernando Abdalla lays out an upbeat case for this discount airline, writing: “Within our LatAm airline universe, Volaris is our top pick, based on: i) a competitive CASM, given its low cost model; ii) well positioned in the Mexican market and appropriate fleet, supporting future growth; iii) solid financial discipline; and iv) strong potential for air travel expansion in Mexico. We find interesting upside potential on the name, as we believe it trades at an undeserved discount to its LatAm peers.""
Putting these comments into quantifiable numbers, Abdalla sets a $23 price target, suggesting a 55% gain for the stock by year’s end. Along with this, he rates the shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy). (To watch Abdalla’s track record, click here)
While JPM is bullish, it’s no outlier on this airline. Volaris has picked up 4 recent analyst reviews, and all agree that the stock is a buying proposition, for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is currently priced at $14.81 and its $26.50 average price target implies a one-year upside potential of ~79%. (See Volaris stock forecast on TipRanks)
Marvell Technology (MRVL)
Now we’ll change direction, and focus on a semiconductor chip company. Marvell, a $50 billion giant, is known for its wide range of chipsets. The company’s products are used in automotive systems, data processors, ethernet network switchers, security processors, storage accelerators, and SSD controllers, to name just a few applications. Marvell’s versatile product line brought in $4.46 billion in revenue for the company’s fiscal year 2022.
In the current fiscal year, Marvell is continuing to see increasing sales and revenue. The company reported $1.45 billion at the top line in fiscal 1Q23, reported at the end of last month, and a non-GAAP diluted EPS of 52 cents. Marvell also reported cash flow from operations of $194.8 million. Revenues were up 8% year-over-year, while the EPS measure was up 79%, and the cash from ops was a massive turnaround form the 1Q22 loss of $13.7 million.
Looking forward, Marvell is guiding toward a fiscal 2Q23 top line of $1.51 billion at the midline, which will translate to non-GAAP diluted EPS of 56 cents. These results are supported by the company’s strong position in the data center and SSD markets.
In addition, Marvell offers investors a reliable, albeit low-yield, dividend payment. The company has paid out 6 cents per common share every quarter going back as far as 2012. Not many firms can match that level of reliability. Marvell also has an active share repurchase program to support the stock price.
In his most recent comments on Marvell shares, JPMorgan 5-star analyst Harlan Sur sees plenty of potential for the company.
“We believe that the enterprise/cloud SSD (eSSD) controller opportunity and future CXL memory/storage connectivity solutions represents a $1.5-$1.7B silicon/firmware opportunity in CY24/CY25 and drive an 18-20% growth CAGR. For Marvell, we estimate the team will grow its eSSD controller + CXL revenues to $650M+ in revenues in CY25 (from $275M in CY21) and drive a 23-25% revenue CAGR – capturing 40%+ share and a strong #1 leadership position in this segment of the market,"" Sur noted.
""We believe the market continues to underestimate the strong growth outlook in Marvell’s networking, compute, and storage silicon franchises and the eSSD controller/CXL opportunity in cloud/enterprise storage is a great example of the team’s strong market leadership position and opportunity,” the analyst added.
Sur doesn’t stop there. He puts an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on MRVL stock, and backs it with a $100 price target – which at current levels implies a one-year upside of 68%. (To watch Sur’s track record, click here)
Tech firms like Marvell typically get plenty of attention from the Street, and this stock has 18 recent analyst reviews on file. These break down to an impressive 17 to 1 split in favor of Buys over Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. MRVL shares are priced at $59.35 and their average target of $85.44 indicates potential gains of ~44% over the next year. (See MRVL stock forecast on TipRanks)

2022-06-08 00:00:00+00:00,2 Growth Stocks Analysts Recommend Investing In,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-growth-stocks-analysts-recommend-investing-in,,,"As investors dumped stocks that produced great returns amid the pandemic, shares of several high-growth companies lost considerable value. 
Furthermore, the U.S. Fed’s aggressive policy to curb inflation, an elevated cost environment, supply-chain disruptions, and an uncertain economic trajectory all contributed to a further decline in the growth stocks.  
While the steep correction in high-growth stocks provides an opportunity to invest, not all stocks are worth buying the dip. To find stocks with strong potential to bounce back, let’s turn to the TipRanks Top Analyst Stocks tool. This tool helps investors identify the stocks that are most recommended by the best-performing Wall Street analysts. Leveraging this tool, let us take a look at two top-rated growth stocks.
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)
Internet giant Amazon lost substantial value amid the recent selloff. Normalization in demand, incremental cost pressure, and the bleak short-term outlook are to be blamed for this decline.
Undeniably, tough year-over-year comparisons and cost pressure could hurt its near-term financials. However, the company's growth could reaccelerate as comparisons ease and benefits from its investments start to show up. Also, incremental cost pressure could subside as the year progresses and the company begins to lap the higher cost environment. 
What stands out is the continued momentum in its high-margin cloud business. Moreover, the strength in its advertising business is positive. 
Showing confidence in AMZN stock, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt stated that Amazon is poised to benefit from its leadership position in the e-commerce and cloud sector. Moreover, he remains upbeat about the “emerging high margin marketing business.” 
Devitt added, “we believe Amazon remains well positioned in a recovery scenario given cloud services, marketing services and certain eCommerce categories/geographies are still in the early phases of development.” 
Along with Devitt, most Wall Street analysts are bullish about AMZN stock. It sports a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 36 Buy, one Hold, and one Sell. Further, the average analyst price target of $180.13 implies 46.5% upside potential.   
Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL)
Chipmaker Marvell continues to witness strong demand for its products, reflected by the stellar growth in its revenues. Despite the robust demand environment, MRVL stock has fallen quite a lot due to industry-wide supply constraints. Further, the negative investors’ sentiment amid the worsening of the macro headwinds remained a drag. 
Nevertheless, the company’s management is upbeat about achieving strong growth driven by solid demand from the data center, 5G, and automotive end markets. Also, higher average selling prices led by increased sales of products with more content and features augurs well for growth. 
What’s worth mentioning is that the company expects to see the benefits of its investments in supply-chain, leading to a much-improved supply outlook that would add to its growth. All in all, strong demand and an improving supply outlook bode well for growth. 
Needham analyst Quinn Bolton has termed MRVL stock as his “Top Pick in Semis in 2022.” He added that Marvell is “one of the fastest growing large-cap semiconductor companies.” Bolton finds MRVL’s valuation attractive compared to its peers and recommends accumulating it at current levels. 
Including Bolton, 17 analysts have rated MRVL stock a Buy. Meanwhile, it sports a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks. The average analyst price target of $85.44 implies 40% upside potential.
Bottom Line   
While these stocks have lost significant value, their fundamentals remain intact. Notably, most of their challenges are transitory, and they have multiple growth catalysts. Furthermore, analysts are optimistic about the prospects of these growth stocks.

Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) continued their rally today following its quarterly earnings. Tech stocks overall were up, as measured by the Nasdaq Composite's 1.2% gain as of 11:30 a.m. ET, but Nvidia was up 5.6%. Another market analyst is weighing in on the high-performance computing company, and they like what they see.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya named Nvidia as his top large-cap semiconductor stock yesterday. Arya also reiterated bullishness on some other top chip companies, which the analyst has dubbed MANGO stocks -- an acronym for Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL), AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Nvidia, GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: GFS), and ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ: ON).
Besides Nvidia, Arya also specifically called out Marvell and AMD yesterday for those companies' exposure to cloud computing and data centers, and ON for its automotive-chip portfolio.
Last week, following Nvidia's first-quarter report, ARK Invest went shopping for the stock, and Evercore analyst C.J. Muse also maintained a buy rating on Nvidia. Since the quarterly update on the evening of May 25, the stock is on a run about 20% higher -- though it is still down 46% from all-time highs reached late in 2021.
Now what
It's encouraging to see a short-term bounce here, but long-term shareholders of Nvidia should stay focused on the bigger picture. There is uncertainty in the video game segment as the company has suspended sales to Russia, recent pandemic lockdowns in China affect chip supply, and gamers await a refresh in Nvidia's lineup of PC hardware later this year. However, this looks like it could be largely offset by the data center segment, which could be the largest end-market for Nvidia in the future.
The opportunity in the decade ahead is hard to quantify given that artificial intelligence is spawning new uses for data centers, according to CEO Jensen Huang. But for the patient investor, this looks like a top stock in the semiconductor space to buy and hold for the long haul.

With the stock market attempting a recovery last week, investors may arguably be keeping tabs on the best semiconductor stocks in the stock market right now. This could be the case considering the rise of internet-of-things, which has contributed to chip demand skyrocketing in the past few years. From electric cars to medical equipment to our smartphones, semiconductors are needed in virtually every modern device these days. As such, seeing that the industry will continue to benefit from this growing demand, semiconductor stocks would continue to be in focus.

2022-06-01 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Marvell Technology (MRVL) is a Strong Growth Stock,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-marvell-technology-mrvl-is-a-strong-growth-stock,,,"It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.
Featuring daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.
It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.
What are the Zacks Style Scores?
Developed alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.
Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:
Value Score
For value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.
Growth Score
Growth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.
Momentum Score
Momentum traders and investors live by the saying ""the trend is your friend."" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.
VGM Score
If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank
The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.
#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.
With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.
That's where the Style Scores come in.
To maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.
Since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.
Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.
Stock to Watch: Marvell Technology (MRVL)
California-based Marvell Technology is a fabless designer, developer and marketer of analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits. The company operates in Bermuda, China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
MRVL is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.
Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. MRVL has a Growth Style Score of A, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 45.9% for the current fiscal year.
Three analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.01 to $2.29 per share. MRVL boasts an average earnings surprise of 7.2%.
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, MRVL should be on investors' short list.

2022-05-31 00:00:00+00:00,This Tech Stock Is Soaring After a Blockbuster Quarter,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-tech-stock-is-soaring-after-a-blockbuster-quarter,,,"Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) has borne the brunt of the stock market sell-off in 2022 so far, but shares of the chipmaker were soaring following the release of its fiscal 2023 first-quarter results (for the three months ended April 30) on May 26.
The company, whose chips are used in several fast-growing areas such as data centers, automotive, enterprise networking, and carrier infrastructure, reported impressive growth in revenue and earnings. Even better, Marvell's guidance showed investors that its impressive growth is here to stay, which explains why the stock price popped 6.7% after the results were out.
Let's take a closer look at Marvell's quarterly performance and check why this semiconductor stock could sustain its impressive growth for a long time to come.
Image source: Getty Images.
Marvell Technology is growing at a red-hot pace
Marvell Technology's fiscal 2023 first-quarter revenue shot up 74% year over year to a record $1.45 billion, driven mainly by a stronger-than-expected performance from the data center market. As it turns out, 88% of Marvell's quarterly revenue came from selling chips to the data infrastructure end market, which is witnessing healthy demand thanks to cloud computing, 5G wireless networks, and automotive applications.
The chipmaker also reported a sharp jump in the bottom line, with non-GAAP earnings coming in at $0.52 per share as compared to $0.29 per share in the prior-year period. Wall Street would have settled for earnings of $0.51 per share on $1.43 billion in revenue. Marvell's guidance was the icing on the cake, as the company expects revenue to increase 41% year over year to $1.51 billion in fiscal Q2, while non-GAAP net income is expected to land at $0.56 per share. That would be a big improvement over the prior-year period's adjusted earnings of $0.34 per share.
What's more, analysts are upbeat about Marvell's long-term prospects, and expect its earnings to grow at a compound annual rate of 42% for the next five years. It won't be surprising to see the chipmaker achieve such an impressive pace of growth over the long run given the end markets it serves.
The chipmaker can sustain its high pace of growth
A closer look at Marvell suggests that the data center market is a key growth hotspot for the company, as it accounted for 44% of its top line last quarter.
Revenue from the data center business increased 131% year over year to $640 million thanks to the deployments of Marvell's chips in high volumes to support faster connectivity and more bandwidth. Marvell expects more customers to deploy its data center chips going forward, and it also anticipates that its next-generation high-speed chips will help it gain more content in data center servers.
At the same time, Marvell is witnessing robust demand for its data center storage solutions. The company points out that the demand for its solid-state drive (SSD) and hard-disk drive (HDD) controllers is increasing thanks to the growing demand for high-capacity storage in the cloud. With Marvell winning contracts to supply next-generation storage controllers to memory OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), its data center storage business should continue to remain in good health.
More importantly, the data center chip market is expected to clock 21% annual growth through 2027 and hit $19 billion in revenue. Marvell supplies different types of data center chips that include data processing units (DPUs), ethernet controllers, switches, and storage solutions, among others, which should pave the way for robust growth in this segment thanks to the secular opportunity at hand.
Meanwhile, the company is also winning big from the 5G wireless infrastructure market, which is evident from the growth of the carrier infrastructure business, which produced 18% of its top line last quarter. Revenue from this segment jumped 50% year over year to $252 million last quarter, driven mainly by an increase in 5G deployments of Marvell's chips at multiple base station customers.
Marvell counts the top 5G infrastructure providers as its clients. As a result, the company is in a solid position to take advantage of the fast-growing 5G base station market, which is expected to grow at an annual pace of 37% through 2030, according to a third-party estimate.
In all, the fast-growing nature of the markets that Marvell serves tells us that it could keep growing at an eye-popping pace for a long time to come. As such, Marvell is a top semiconductor stock to buy, especially considering that it is trading at 25 times forward earnings, as compared to last year's multiple of 38.

Tech stocks could be worth considering even with the stock market being closed on Memorial Day. Overall, this section of the market represents an increasingly relevant and viable global industry. Like it or not, tech plays a major role across countless aspects of our daily lives today. From the cars we drive this Memorial Day weekend to the apps and devices that we use to navigate roads, this is apparent. As such, some could argue that the companies behind such crucial elements of life would be worth keeping an eye on.
For one thing, the tech industry is a wide and expansive one. On one hand, you have cybersecurity stocks like CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) that are constantly updating their offerings. This would serve to meet the constantly changing security needs of businesses in an increasingly digital work environment. On the other hand, companies like Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) are riding the return of travel. Earlier this month, the homestay rental giant posted stellar figures in its first fiscal quarter report. Notably, Airbnb’s quarterly revenue, according to the press release, is up by over 70% year-over-year. If anything, investors have no shortage of choices when it comes to the tech industry today.
Not to mention, tech industry titan Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) could also be worth checking out this week. This would be thanks to the company’s plans to split its stock on a 20-for-1 basis on June 6.

Zscaler Inc.
Another tech company worth noting now could be Zscaler. In essence, it primarily operates as a cybersecurity software-as-a-service provider. Through its cloud-native tech platform, the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange (ZTE), the company serves enterprise clients in a variety of ways. For a sense of scale, the company’s operations are distributed across over 150 data centers worldwide. This would be thanks to the company’s ZTE platform being the largest in-line cloud security platform.
Despite its impressive operations, Zscaler does not seem to be slowing down in the least bit. Just last week, the company posted overall solid results in its latest quarterly financial report. According to the release, Zscaler’s total revenue for the quarter is $286.8 million. Year-over-year, this translates to gains of 63%. Aside from that, Zscaler’s total calculated billings are up by 54% year-over-year, totaling $345.6 million. Providing some insight into the company’s main growth drivers is CEO Jay Chaudry. He highlights that Zscaler’s enterprise solutions remain in demand throughout the quarter. In his words, “Enterprises continue to consolidate point products in favor of our integrated Zero Trust security platform, resulting in larger, multi-year commitments to Zscaler.” As a result, the company also adds that it is raising its fiscal year guidance on “all financial metrics” as well.
Not forgetting, the company also remains hard at work bolstering its partnership network. As of last week, Zscaler is working with Siemens (OTCMKTS: SIEGY) to showcase the world’s first “Zero Trust OT Security Platform.” They will be doing so at the Hannover Messe Fair this week. Simply put, Zscaler highlights that it is an automation software solution. The likes of which will allow organizations to manage their automated manufacturing setups “from any workplace in any location.” With all this in mind, would ZS stock be a top tech stock for you?

With market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion, mid cap companies usually contain higher growth prospects than large cap companies, and are considered less risky than their small cap counterparts. These types of companies, then, have a good balance of stability and growth potential.
Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Looking at their long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets. They are however likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.23%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.53%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 15.90% of the portfolio. Industrials and Real Estate round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Marvell Technology Inc (MRVL) accounts for about 0.77% of total assets, followed by Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC) and Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).
The top 10 holdings account for about 5.93% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
IWS seeks to match the performance of the Russell MidCap Value Index before fees and expenses. The Russell Midcap Value Index measures the performance of the mid-capitalization value sector of the U.S. equity market.
The ETF has lost about -5.11% so far this year and is up about 0.68% in the last one year (as of 05/30/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $107.54 and $123.59.
The ETF has a beta of 1.08 and standard deviation of 26.54% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 707 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
IShares Russell MidCap Value ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, IWS is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.
The iShares S&P MidCap 400 Value ETF (IJJ) and the Vanguard MidCap Value ETF (VOE) track a similar index. While iShares S&P MidCap 400 Value ETF has $7.86 billion in assets, Vanguard MidCap Value ETF has $16.67 billion. IJJ has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VOE charges 0.07%.
Bottom-Line
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
