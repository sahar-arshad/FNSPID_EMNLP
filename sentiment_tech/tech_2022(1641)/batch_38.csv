2022-04-11 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Stock Sinks to Multi-Year Low,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-stock-sinks-to-multi-year-low,,,"Shares of fallen chip maker Intel (INTC) have fallen considerably over the past few quarters.
With the stock looking to hit at a multi-year level of support at around the $45 per-share range, questions linger as to what the firm's next course will be as it attempts to move forward with its plan to retake the lead in processors.
Undoubtedly, it's hard to play in the chip space if you've fallen behind by so much. With new rivals, including the likes of Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), building their own chips, Intel's glory days seem to be in the rear-view mirror.
Even if the company can get back up to speed with its current architecture roadmap, the total addressable market could shrink as more firms look to in-house internal hardware components. Indeed it's not a significant trend in the tech space for a firm that once was vital in the hardware space.
There's never been a better time to reduce one's reliance on other firms' supply chains. Simply put, the next five years seem very uncertain, as the company risks falling victim to rising competition that looks to have been given a bit of a jolt by the COVID-19 pandemic. I am neutral.
Historic Turnaround Effort
Though Intel is still in the early innings of its multi-year plan to retake the lead in the chip space, its newly appointed CEO Patrick Gelsinger already appears to be raking it in, with a whopping ~$180-million pay package in 2021. That's a rich sum, especially early on in the man's tenure.
If Gelsinger can steer Intel stock back to its former glory, I'm sure investors will be happy with Gelsinger's big payday. Until then, time is of the essence for the firm whose stock has underperformed the S&P 500.
With shares of INTC falling into single-digit earnings multiple territory, the name is likely to gain the attention of technically inclined value investors.
Of course, it's hard to evaluate the company as it navigates between the line of value and value trap. For that reason, I'm hesitant to load up on shares until the company can share updates on its long-term investment plan.
How Intel Can Retake the Lead
Intel is still in the race, though its valuation would suggest otherwise. At writing, Intel stock trades at a mere 9.7 times trailing earnings and 2.5 times sales.
With Apple's M2 line of chips on the horizon, it's clear that Apple is looking to change the game. It's raising the bar on per-watt performance. So much so that it could make its last generation of chips look bad.
At this juncture, I think it's incredibly unlikely that a Mac computer will have anything other than an Apple-made ARM-based chip. The company has invested way too much, and every year, the M-series could increase the gap between its own performance and that of its peers.
Despite losing its spot in the latest and greatest Apple-powered computers, Intel still has a world of share to spread its wings in the PC market. Intel is spending considerable sums to close the gap with its rival AMD (AMD). The company knows it needs to sprint to get ahead, which is a major reason it recently decided to pour €33 billion into European R&D.
A commoditized industry is at risk of becoming more commoditized, in my books. Just how much of a discount is warranted on the old players like Intel remains a mystery for now.
Still, I think a lot of the negativity and doubt surrounding Intel's future is already mostly baked into the share price. A single-digit P/E multiple leaves a low bar ahead of a firm that's more than capable of surprising.
In any case, the stakes are high in the semi market, but so too are the potential rewards, as various trends like IoT (Internet of Things) fuel the appetite for processing power across a broader range of devices.
Wall Street's Take
According to TipRanks’ consensus rating, INTC stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 28 analyst ratings, there are seven Buy recommendations, 13 Hold recommendations, and seven Sell recommendations.
The average Intel price target is $52.67, implying 12.2% upside potential. Analyst price targets range from a low of $40 per share to a high of $70 per share.
Bottom Line on INTC Stock
Intel may be an underdog, but it's still generating ample cash flow from its PC and server CPU markets.
Though it may have to get more competitive with pricing, I think too many investors are counting the firm out of the game, when it's still on track to hit its goal over the coming three years.

2022-04-11 00:00:00+00:00,Qualcomm and the Great Tech Downgrade,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/qualcomm-and-the-great-tech-downgrade,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Qualcomm (QCOM) stock is down like that of most major tech players.
Analysts worry about smartphone demand declining.
Qualcomm insists there are new markets and that the future looks bright.
Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock is selling for about what it did a year ago despite 45% growth for fiscal 2021 and nearly 15% growth so far this year. That is a price of $138.55 per share, a market cap of $156.15 billion, and a price to earnings ratio of 15.88. There is also a dividend hike to $3 per year, which will yield over 2% at the present price.
Blame the great tech downgrade. Since last November, when unprofitable tech stocks began rolling over, the whole sector has been under pressure. Since 2022 started, Qualcomm stock is down 24%.
Even an endorsement from TV analyst Jim Cramer hasn’t helped. You can still get Qualcomm for about the price he says his investment club paid for it on Mar. 10.
QCOM Qualcomm Incorporated $138.55

Qualcomm has dominated the communication chip market for decades. Chances are excellent your phone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor.
7 Chip Stocks Keeping the Tech Sector Running
Under former Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm fought a global war over its intellectual property. Its technology was put into universal standards, but critics charged it wasn’t licensing it under Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) standards, making it impossible for them to compete. At one point, Qualcomm even filed to stop production of iPhones in China over patent rights. 
The main Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) dispute was settled in 2019. But Apple continues to move toward bypassing Qualcomm and making its own chips. Qualcomm also lost an antitrust suit in South Korea.
If Apple can make its own smartphone chips, other Chinese phone makers think they can do the same. China wants to control its supply chain just like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is consolidating in the U.S.
Under Mollenkopf’s successor, Brazilian engineer Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm is now taking its fight to the market and looking to create new markets. It is fast-tracking the release of its latest Snapdragon chip. It has bought Arriver to enhance its offerings for self-driving cars. It is promising to locate users within 3 feet. Its machine learning performance is comparable to that of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
What a Fool Believes
Tech stocks usually rise or fall ahead of the economy. Right now, they’re pointing toward economic trouble ahead.
Excuses for investment losses are easy to find. One is Qualcomm’s continuing competition with MediaTek of Taiwan. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) fears a drop in smartphone demand.
Inflation, war, and supply chain problems are all worrying investors. There is a fear that 5G, the mobile technology Qualcomm and its customers have been hyping for years, was oversold. The threat that wireless would replace wired cable TV service is said to be overblown.
But the fears of investors have yet to appear in the chip market. Qualcomm sees its smartphone chip sales growing 12% per year through 2024. The dividend hike from 68 cents per quarter to 75 cents is an indication it believes its profits are sustainable.
The Bottom Line for QCOM Stock
Amon insists Wall Street is getting his company wrong.
He says Qualcomm is on the cusp of a revolution in artificial intelligence, with smart glasses and holographic displays that change how work is done.  He insists the problem at Qualcomm is supply, not demand.
Wall Street doesn’t agree. They’re focused on the limits of smartphones. They’re selling the metaverse.
This creates a unique opportunity for investors. Technology is the greatest force we have for fighting inflation. It has been coming through since the 1980s. What will change the investment equation are applications and case studies where augmented reality, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence increase productivity.
The killer app is out there. Qualcomm and other chip companies have the tools to build it. If you agree with me on that, now is the time to buy the stock when it is cheap.

2022-04-11 00:00:00+00:00,Is Microsoft Stock Fairly Priced?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-microsoft-stock-fairly-priced,,,"Microsoft’s stock (NASDAQ: MSFT) has lost approximately 12% YTD as compared to the 5% drop in the S&P500 index over the same period. Further, at its current price of $297 per share, it is trading 20% below its fair value of $371 – Trefis’ estimate for Microsoft’s valuation. The technology giant topped the consensus estimates in the second quarter of FY2022 (FY July-June), with revenues increasing 20% y-o-y to $51.7 billion. Each of the three segments posted growth in the quarter – productivity and business processes (up 19%), intelligent cloud (up 26%), and more personal computing (up 15%). The productivity and business processes mainly benefited from growth in office commercial products & cloud services and LinkedIn revenues. Further, intelligent cloud revenues increased due to higher server products & cloud services revenue driven by Azure and other cloud services. On a similar note, more personal computing growth was because of higher Windows, search, and news advertising revenues. Overall, the net income improved 21% y-o-y to $18.8 billion. It was driven by revenue growth and a slight increase in the operating margin. 
The company’s total revenues increased 18% y-o-y to $168 billion in FY 2021, mainly driven by growth in the intelligent cloud segment (up 24% y-o-y). Further, its total revenues for the first half of FY2022 increased 21% to $97 billion. This was because of a 21% rise in the productivity and business processes unit, followed by a 28% jump in the intelligent cloud segment, and a 14% increase in the more personal computing division. All in all, the above growth in the top-line and improvement in operating margin from 42.1% to 43.8% translated into a cumulative six months net income of $3.93 billion – up 34% y-o-y.
Microsoft is likely to continue its growth momentum in the second half of FY2022. Notably, consensus estimates for third quarter revenues and earnings are $49.04 billion and $2.19 respectively. Overall, Microsoft revenues are expected to touch $199.3 billion in FY2022. Additionally, MSFT’s net income margin is likely to see a slight drop from the FY2021 levels, although growth in the top line will likely make up for the lost ground. It will likely result in a net income of $71.3 billion and an annual EPS of $9.44. This coupled with a P/E multiple of just above 39x will lead to the valuation of $371.

2022-04-11 00:00:00+00:00,Why Many Semiconductor Stocks Were Down Last Week,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-many-semiconductor-stocks-were-down-last-week,,,"Despite the continuous chip shortage, 2022 has not been a great year for the semiconductor industry. Today's video focuses on popular stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), which are all down over 20% year to date due to downgrades and the increased risk of consumer spending decreasing. Still, there is some good news: TSM issued its monthly report, and it continues to show strong growth. Here are some highlights from the video.
The semiconductor industry continues to get hit due to the increased risk of consumer spending slowing down. The risk has now started a wave of analysts downgrading or lowering price targets for numerous companies. On April 8, an analyst from Truist Securities reduced Nvidia's price target due to the fear of a slowdown in the second quarter of 2022, but the analyst still believes in strong growth for the second half of the year.
TSM announced its March 2022 monthly revenue report and saw a 33% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth. This is following a strong February, for which it reported 38% YOY revenue growth. From TSM's side, it seems that there is not much slowdown at the moment.
It is important to remember that semiconductor companies like Nvidia and Intel provide solutions not only to consumers but also to data center providers, the automotive market, enterprises, and much more. As one market slows down, it is possible that other markets are growing.

2022-04-10 00:00:00+00:00,3 Powerful Stocks That Can Beat Inflation,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-powerful-stocks-that-can-beat-inflation,,,"As investors continue to digest the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's March meeting, the stock market remains turbulent. In a nutshell: The Federal Reserve is going to make a serious effort to fight inflation, and higher benchmark interest rates are on the way. That's putting the present values of stocks under pressure.
However, despite the volatility, businesses that have the ability to raise their prices with limited consequences in an inflationary environment should still do exceptionally well. Three Fool.com contributors think Disney (NYSE: DIS), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and American Tower (NYSE: AMT) fit that description, and view them as quality names worth a look for investors now.

A premier company in entertainment -- and entertainment technology
Nicholas Rossolillo (Disney): Inflation is blasting consumers these days, but it's been a problem for entertainment businesses for years. With the rapid growth of new streaming services, there's been an explosion in demand for new films and TV series. Add in supply chain issues, and one can understand why entertainment production costs have been skyrocketing at double-digit percentage paces annually.
However, I believe Disney has pricing power in this space. Disney+ is a fantastic product. For fans of Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and more, the company's marquee streaming service is the home of the latest and greatest content. Even if Disney boosts the monthly subscription price, I don't see many viewers getting upset enough to cancel. But there's an additional advantage in play here. Disney's technology should help it keep content creation costs in check.
For example, when Mickey and Co. acquired Lucasfilm in 2012, it got more than just the Star Wars franchise. It also got cinematography tech assets like Industrial Light & Magic (ILM). One innovation that has come out of ILM in recent years is StageCraft, visual effects technology that uses walls of LED TV screens for on-set production. Basically, there's no need to send an entire cast and crew to exotic locales for filming anymore, thanks to those mega-sized screens. And multiple ""sets"" can be quickly changed out on the same day. ILM StageCraft has been used on Disney TV shows and movies, as well as for commercials and music videos.
Disney's vertical integration will work wonders for it if the cost of doing business rises significantly due to inflation. The company owns the whole pipeline of entertainment production, from technology to popular franchises to distribution channels. All told, while Disney continues to rebound from the effects of the pandemic, it boasts a fantastic business model that's built to withstand all sorts of stresses. I expect Disney will grow its revenue at a modest pace in the coming years, but anticipate its profitability will balloon as Disney+ makes progress toward breakeven -- a milestone it's expected to hit in the company's fiscal 2024.
Disney stock currently trades for 23 times forward earnings. With the stock down by some 30% over the last year, I'm a buyer at these levels.
The world's most essential chip producer is already raising prices
Billy Duberstein (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing): When looking for stocks that can beat inflation, look for companies that provide unique, essential services, and can also raise their prices if necessary.
Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest semiconductor foundry, and has a lead over competitors in producing leading-edge semiconductors. If you're Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) or Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and need the most advanced process technology, you need to go with Taiwan Semi -- at least for the foreseeable future. Rivals Samsung and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are attempting to catch up, but that process could take years, if they are able to at all.
Since there's still a semiconductor shortage, and also a scarcity of materials such as silicon wafers, Taiwan Semi is raising its prices. The company actually started that process in August, boosting prices on leading-edge semiconductors by 10% and lagging-edge mature nodes by 15% to 20%. While there are shortages of all types of chips, it's actually the ones manufactured with older processes -- which are widely used in autos and Internet of Things applications -- that have been experiencing the biggest shortfalls. And just last month, it was reported Taiwan Semi would be raising prices for lagging-edge chips by another 10% to 20% in the third quarter of this year.
The price increases announced in August took effect in the first quarter of 2022, so they should lead to stronger results when Taiwan Semi reports on the quarter on April 14. Since Taiwan Semi also regularly reports its monthly revenues, we already know sales grew by 35.8% year over year in January and 37.9% in February. Expect strong revenue growth this quarter, and for Taiwan Semi to hike its 2% dividend in line with revenue and earnings growth later this year.
All in all, demand for semiconductors should continue to increase even if the economy slows down. That's because the growing AI, the Internet of Things, 5G, and cloud computing markets all need more semiconductors. Since it can raise prices to keep up with inflation without fear of losing sales, Taiwan Semi is a stock to buy with confidence amid the tech sector pullback.
The complete package
Anders Bylund (American Tower): For a company to be a reliable hedge against inflation, it should come with a few specific qualities.
It needs to have staying power for the long run, offering products or services that will be in high demand for decades.
The stock should be positioned to beat the broader market, either due to a low buy-in price or a history of upward momentum.
The stock should offer a dividend with a meaningful yield.
Cell tower manager American Tower checks all of these boxes.
It leases out space on cell towers and other wireless network hubs to telecoms around the world. Yes, around the world -- the company name is a bit misleading. Half of American Tower's 2021 revenues came from international assets, and the company's fastest-growing markets are in Africa and Latin America. As long as people need wireless networks, American Tower will be in business.
The stock isn't exactly cheap, trading at 47 times earnings and 13 times sales. You get what you pay for, though -- a high-quality business with industry-leading scale, financial growth, and profit margins. Meanwhile, the stock is down more than 9% year to date in 2022. There should be a serious rebound somewhere in this stock's near future.
And then there's the dividend. As a real estate investment trust (REIT), American Tower is obligated to pay out at least 90% of its taxable income every year in the form of dividends. Otherwise, it would lose the tax benefits that come with its REIT status. As such, you can rest assured that American Tower will keep those payouts coming. At today's share prices, it's delivering an effective yield of 2.1%.
Taken together, American Tower's fantastic long-term growth prospects plus a modest dividend bonus should add up to shareholder returns that far outpace inflation. What's not to love?

In this clip from ""The M&A Show"" on Motley Fool Live, recorded on April 1, Motley Fool contributor Travis Hoium discusses the steps the company is taking to be a growth company with two distinct businesses.

{% sfr %}
Travis Hoium: It's a turnaround play. It's not a guaranteed company. They're in decline. I think the semiconductor business is really hard to wrap your head around as I try to learn more and more about it because the decisions you make 5-10 years ago are reaching fruition now. If you look at their past performance, it looks really good. It looks like a value stock.
Jason Hall: It's a ton of momentum.
Hoium: If you look at where the momentum is, it's not in Intel's favor. Pat Gelsinger is doing a lot of things to try to turn that around in the hopes that in five years from now, they can be a growth company with these two distinct businesses, one as a foundry services, and one designing their own chips. I think the acquisition, like we talked about, is a deal that could try to add value to probably that chip-designing side in the data centers, where they do have a leg up on the competition. They probably have some stickiness, especially with some of their bigger buyers. I like their chances. It seems a little bit to me like airlines, where there's only so many big players, but there's only so many chip giants. Right now, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) has a huge leg up. They have a strategic advantage, they have all the big buyers, they have the best technology. But, often times, these things go like this. Intel's down right now. The question is, can they make that comeback? They're desperate enough. I like the position that they're in from a financial perspective because, if they succeed, it could be multiples from where it is in 5-10 years.

Analysts expect Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) growth to slow from recent record levels
Clouds offer lower margins than PCs and game machines
It’s still a buy and it is now a bargain
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock is down around 27% in 2022. This breaks a streak of gains going back to Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su’s appointment in 2014 when the stock traded near $2.
Traders are mystified and even angry. Investors like me are doubling down.
There is a good reason for AMD’s fall. Even at its Apr. 7 price of $104.30, it is trading at over 10 times revenue and 40 times last year’s earnings. Given the state of the market and the world, that is too high. There are better bargains out there.
AMD’s new push into the data center market, highlighted by its bid to buy Pensando for $1.9 billion, is also confusing people who don’t know the market.
But if you are willing to make time your ally, it is easy to justify buying AMD stock. Here’s how.
AMD Advanced Micro Devices $113.05
Cloud Growth
AMD began its rise with PCs and gaming machines. But now clouds are the growth market. AMD sales in clouds doubled in 2021. Cloud buyers are price sensitive. Data centers offer smaller margins than retail. But they make it up in volume. If you also have useful software, you can make up those margins.
7 Safe Stocks to Buy to Guard Against a Recession
AMD’s share of the server market is substantial at 16%, but still has room to grow. The cloud is how it will do that.
There are over 300 new “hyperscale” data centers in the works, which most of us call clouds. Half of the capacity is inside the U.S. The market is still growing around 20% each year. Data centers represented $185 billion in spending last year.
That is why AMD is buying Pensando. Pensando’s business is optimizing data centers, moving work around to increase performance. This lowers the total cost of ownership for data centers. Along with Xilinx, the programmable chip company that became part of AMD in February, it means AMD now has a wide line of both hardware and software for data centers.
Numbers Get Serious
Last year was awesome for AMD. Some slowing is expected as numbers grow bigger.
For its fourth quarter reported on Feb. 1, AMD earned $974 million, 80 cents per share, on revenue of $4.8 billion. Earnings were down from a year earlier, but revenue was up by 49% year-over-year. For the full year, revenue rose 68% and net income was up 27%.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects AMD growth to slow this year, with earnings closer to analyst estimates. Their estimate for 2022 earnings is $4.17 per share. That makes the forward price to earnings ratio for AMD just 25.
Analysts at Tipranks don’t seriously disagree. There are 21 ratings and 14 say buy it.  Their average price target of almost $150 is about 32% ahead of its current trade. Even the lowest price target of $115 represents a near-2% gain.
The Bottom Line on AMD Stock
The fall of AMD stock is an opportunity for long-term investors. You can buy profitable growth of at least 20% per year for just 25 times the current year’s earnings.
AMD is, at heart, a software company. Software benefits from Moore’s Law in clouds because its online distribution cost is practically zero. Hardware, on the other hand, must be fabricated and Moore’s Second Law means those costs keep rising.
AMD depends on Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and Global Foundries (NASDAQ:GFS), which was spun-out of AMD over a decade ago, to fabricate its chips. The enormous capital spending at TSM and even Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will increase AMD’s supplies, thus its sales.
The time to buy any stock is when it is out of fashion. Last year was a bad year to buy fast-growing tech stocks, but they will come back. When they do, you’ll be in good shape if you nibble on AMD stock now.

2022-04-07 00:00:00+00:00,Chancellor: In praise of slack,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chancellor%3A-in-praise-of-slack,,,"Reuters
Reuters


LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - In recent decades we have lived through an era of optimisation. In the name of greater efficiency, more and more output has been extracted from a given amount of input. The Oxford English Dictionary defines “optimise” as to “act as an optimist”. The dictionary also notes that “optimism” was “the doctrine propounded by (the German philosopher) Leibnitz … that we live in the best of all possible worlds.” But, like Voltaire’s Candide, we are discovering that isn’t the case. This has important implications for the way companies are managed.
American executives were those who most enthusiastically embraced the move to optimisation. Under the banner of delivering shareholder value, companies contracted out manufacturing to suppliers on the other side of the world, ran down inventories – operating instead on a “just-in-time” basis – and replaced equity funding with debt. Optimisation boosted the components that determine return on equity (ROE): corporate profit margins, asset turns and leverage. U.S. public companies boasted the highest returns in the world, reporting a 17% ROE last year, compared with just 9% for their Japanese counterparts.
But as Nassim Nicholas Taleb pointed out in his 2012 book “Antifragile”, the pursuit of optimisation creates instability. In recent years, we’ve witnessed a succession of what might be described as “optimisation crises”. The global financial crisis of 2008 showed that undercapitalised banks were overly dependent on the capital markets for liquidity. When Covid-19 struck many countries discovered their public health systems had too few hospital beds and inadequate staffing levels to cope with the pandemic. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has further exposed weaknesses in Europe’s energy system. Not only was Germany hopelessly dependent on Russian oil and gas, but the country had also underinvested in its military.
Optimisation has rendered the corporate world more fragile. Companies with too much debt are vulnerable to unexpected downturns. Globalisation works wonders when all goes according to plan. But it’s a complex trading system prone to unexpected breakdowns. As Taleb writes, globalisation “brings fragilities, causes more extreme events as a side effect … in such a complex system, the predictability of consequences is very low.” Recent events have borne out his concerns. 
Pandemic lockdowns disrupted global supply chains, and those disruptions were still unresolved in late February when Russia unleashed the largest military operation in Europe since World War Two. Globalisation has been badly fractured. Earlier this year an American ban on the import of goods manufactured in China’s Xinjiang region caused a pile-up of shipping in the port of Los Angeles. Semiconductors are in such short supply that ASM International, a leading European producer of chip manufacturing equipment, can’t get hold of them. Most of the world’s semiconductors are manufactured in Taiwan, whose independence is constantly threatened by China.
The easiest way to reduce fragility is to build more redundancy, or slack, into the system. For instance, after the global financial crisis regulators required banks to hold more capital. The UK government has announced that it will increase the number of healthcare staff available at periods of peak hospital demand. Germany is looking to construct terminals for imports of liquefied natural gas and has promised to spend more on defence. Slack is the new buzzword.
The corporate world is also seeking to reduce fragility. Having experienced frequent supply disruptions, some companies are turning away from just-in-time production. Others are looking to bring manufacturing back onshore. Chip giant Intel plans to build plants in the United States and Germany.
The era of optimisation sounded the death knell for vertically integrated companies which owned and controlled the entire production process. The tide could be about to turn. In a recent note entitled “The End of Optimisation”, Julien Garran of MacroStrategy suggests that companies will have to bring more key activities in-house. European luxury goods brands are already buying their suppliers, he says. 
The return of inflation exacerbates this trend. Rising prices are often accompanied by supply bottlenecks, but also create uncertainty about input costs. Companies typically respond by hoarding stocks, which requires them to operate with more working capital. Higher inflation and interest rates also raise the cost of operating across overextended global supply chains.
The end of optimisation will produce winners and losers. So-called “platform” companies that have few physical assets face a bleaker future if they are required to invest in their own manufacturing facilities. Taleb observes that small firms are inherently less fragile than larger ones, while large corporations are doomed to break. These factors make it more likely that “value” stocks, which trade at low multiples relative to their underlying assets, will outperform more highly priced “growth” stocks, Garran predicts.
American executives have been the keenest practitioners of optimisation. As a result, U.S. companies sport the highest valuations in the world according to forecasts compiled by Boston-based money manager GMO (my former employer). But these companies have also taken on masses of debt in recent years. In future, it will be harder for companies to boost their earnings per share and stock price simply by borrowing to repurchase their shares. When Howard Schultz, the returning chief executive of Starbucks, announced this week that the company would end buybacks and spend the cash instead on staff and cafés, the coffee chain’s share price fell. As returns on equity decline, the U.S. stock market will lose its premium rating.
The end of optimisation requires fewer financial engineers and more genuine engineers. That should be good news for Japan, one of the few developed economies to have retained its manufacturing base. It’s true that Japanese companies have shifted some production abroad, but they have also been wary of becoming overly dependent on China.
The concept of shareholder value has always been viewed with suspicion in Japan, where companies have given priority to the interests of other corporate stakeholders: customers, suppliers, employees and society at large. Japan’s conglomeration of business organisations, known as keiretsu, also operate with plenty of redundancy. In the past, Japanese companies may have delivered suboptimal returns compared to their U.S. counterparts, but they are less indebted and more robustly designed for uncertain times ahead.

Pensando’s distributed services platform includes a high-performance, fully programmable packet processor and comprehensive software stack that accelerate networking, security, storage, and other services for cloud, enterprise, and edge applications.
Pensando’s products have already been deployed at scale across cloud and enterprise customers; a stacked list that includes Goldman Sachs GS, IBM Cloud IBM, Microsoft Azure MSFT, and Oracle Cloud ORCL.
By partnering with Pensando, Microsoft Azure VP Girish Bablani says, “We have seen a 40x improvement in overall cloud-based connection related performance. Pensando delivered this in less than 12 months. This partnership has enabled a transformational “limitless networking” shift that will ensure our customers have access to the highest performing products and services they expect from Microsoft Azure.”
Benefits
It’s crucial to have the ability to operate data centers at a massive scale efficiently, a primary reason why AMD took the acquisition head-on. Pensando claims that its robust programmable packet processor provides between 8x and 13x better performance than its rivals’ similar products. The processor controls how workloads move through hardware infrastructure, bouncing tasks off the CPU whenever able, considerably increasing efficiency. Obtaining this high level of efficiency is expected to propel AMD.
The acquisition comes at a time when Intel INTC and Nvidia NVDA have both expanded their portfolios; Intel has its infrastructure processing unit (IPU) and SmartNICs (network interface cards), and Nvidia has Bluefield DPUs (data processing units) and DPU-based SmartNics. However, these companies don’t have the cutting-edge system software Pensando provides, giving AMD an edge on two of its largest competitors.
Dr. Lisa Su, the highly distinguished CEO and chair of AMD re-iterated in a press release the importance of building a leading-edge data center with the best performance, security, flexibility, and lowest total cost of ownership. She says, “Today, with our acquisition of Pensando, we add a leading distributed services platform to our high-performance CPU, GPU, FGPA, and adaptive SoC portfolio.”
AMD
After peering into Pensando a little deeper and laying out a few of the acquisition perks, let’s take a deeper look into AMD’s financial performance by analyzing a few key metrics and summarizing the performance of the company’s latest earnings reports.
The company’s shares have been weathering the brutal sell-off within high-growth stocks, declining 28% year-to-date. However, it’s worth noting that the adverse price action has caused the company’s forward earnings multiple to slide down to 26.7X, a fraction of its 2021 November high of 67.8X and much lower than 2022’s January high of 63.1X. To me, the steep decline in valuation provides a rare opportunity to buy one of the best growth stories in the market at a deep discount.

Quarterly reports for AMD have been stellar, beating earnings estimates each time in its last four quarters by at least double-digit percentages and acquiring a four-quarter trailing average EPS surprise of a notable 17%. The company beat the $0.75 per share estimate by nearly 23% in its latest quarter, officially reporting EPS of $0.92. Additionally, AMD’s bottom line is forecasted to expand by a considerable 30% over the next three to five years.
Fueled by a surge in demand for its robust technology, AMD’s top line skyrocketed nearly 69% from 2020 to 2021. The company has crushed quarterly sales estimates, chaining together nine consecutive quarters of revenue beats dating back to October 2019. Furthermore, something that caught my eye is that the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate for the current year reflects year-over-year top-line growth of nearly 31%. The company is clearly expected to grow, further displayed by its Growth Style Score of an A. AMD is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

NVDA
Before concluding, let’s look at Nvidia NVDA, one of AMD’s biggest rivals. Nvidia sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with an overall VGM Score of a C.
Over the last 60 days, NVDA has seen its current full-year earnings estimate increase 7.5% to $5.55 per share, and the consensus estimate trend for next year has climbed 8%, reflecting full-year EPS of $6.37 per share.
NVDA has a four-quarter trailing average EPS surprise of 7%, and in its latest quarter, Nvidia beat earnings estimates by almost 9%, reporting EPS of $1.32 per share.

Final Thoughts
The acquisition bodes well for the company’s future direction and displays a commitment to consistently advancing and staying ahead of the curve. Additionally, it’s very healthy for the microchip space to remain competitive, as it is one of the most crucial industries moving forward on a global scale.
After a brutal start to 2022, shares have declined to an attractive buying level. Investors should be wary of the high-risk nature growth stocks carry during market weakness, but I still believe that AMD is an excellent investment that will continue to climb as the world further embraces the digital shift.

2022-04-06 00:00:00+00:00,"Down on the Year, AMD Stock Remains a Best-in-Class Semiconductor Pick",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/down-on-the-year-amd-stock-remains-a-best-in-class-semiconductor-pick,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
AMD shares are attractively priced following a pullback in recent months
The company has provided stronger than expected guidance for its 2022 sales
The recently completed acquisition of Xilinx strengthens AMD’s competitive position.
The shares of semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) look like a steal at current levels, with AMD stock down nearly 26% on the year.
Brought low by a broader retrenchment in technology stocks, semiconductors in particular, the weakness seen in AMD stock in recent months is no reflection on the company’s fundamentals or its long-term prospects, which remain bright.
Despite this year’s pullback, shares of Advanced Micro Devices remain up 31% from a year earlier, which is a testament to how far the stock has run. The current price of just under $107 a share provides an attractive entry point for investors.
AMD Advanced Micro Devices $106.82
Strong Fundamentals
 On Feb. 1, AMD issued another in a string of strong earnings reports. The Santa Clara, California-based company announced that it earned 92 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2021, which was up 26% from a year ago and much better than the $0.76 earnings per share (EPS) that Wall Street analysts had been calling for.
7 Biotech Stocks to Buy With Key Catalysts for April
AMD’s revenue amounted to $4.83 billion, which was 49% higher than a year earlier and beat the $4.53 billion that analysts had forecast.
Perhaps best of all, AMD issued bullish forward guidance, saying it anticipates 2022 revenue of $21.5 billion, which exceeds the $19.26 billion analysts had penciled in for the company. The 2022 sales figure represents a 31% increase over 2021′s sales number and is expected to be driven largely by strong server and PC processor sales, the company said.
Taken together, the Q4 results and 2022 forecast showed again that Advanced Micro Devices remains a best-in-class semiconductor company. AMD stock jumped 10% higher immediately after the earnings report was made public.
Divided Analysts
Despite the stellar quarter and strong forward guidance, analysts remain divided over the outlook for AMD and the entire semiconductor market. Chip stocks are down 13% on the year, as reflected in the price of iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX). AMD stock is the third-largest holding, at 7.11% of assets, in the exchange-traded fund’s 32-stock semiconductor-focus portfolio.
AMD stock took a hit at the end of March when a prominent analyst at Barclays (NYSE:BCS) downgraded the shares, citing competitive pressures for chips in both the personal computer and gaming sectors. Blayne Curtis lowered his rating on AMD to “equal weight” from “overweight” and cut his price target on the shares by about 20% to $115.
Other analysts continue to express concerns about the ongoing global shortage of semiconductors that has impacted manufacturing of everything from smartphones to motor vehicles.
However, not every analyst is sounding a pessimistic note when it comes to AMD and the semiconductor space. Rosenblatt Securities took direct issue with Barclays’ downgrade in a note to clients, reiterating that it remains extremely bullish on the semiconductor sector, and AMD stock in particular, noting that the company is in no danger of missing its exceptionally strong 2022 sales forecast.
Rosenblatt reiterated its “buy” rating on AMD stock and set a street high $200 a share price target, which would be 74% higher than where the shares currently trade.
Among 32 professional analysts who cover AMD, the median price target on the stock is currently $152.50, implying 41% upside from current levels.
Xilinx Acquisition
In addition to strong organic growth in sales of AMD chipsets used in both video game consoles and cloud computing, which each grew more than 30% in 2021, AMD is also expected to achieve growth from its recently completed $35 billion acquisition of Xilinx that positions AMD to better compete with rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the market for data center chips. AMD completed the Xilinx purchase when it received regulatory approval for the deal from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in mid-February.
Closure of the Xilinx purchase stands in stark contract to rival Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) decision to abandon its planned acquisition of British chipmaker Arm Ltd., which ended up being scuttled by regulatory hurdles and vocal industry concerns. NVDA stock, however, is up 4.9% in the two months since that deal was officially called off.
Xilinx enables AMD to increase its position in key markets for semiconductor chips such as data centers, artificial intelligence and fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks, particularly related to the automotive and aerospace industries. “Those are all markets that AMD has had very little presence in and they all need high performance computing,” said AMD chief executive officer Lisa Su in announcing the conclusion of the Xilinx deal.
Buy AMD Stock
The pullback in AMD stock since the start of this year shouldn’t dissuade investors from taking a position. If anything, it should encourage people to take a new position or grow their existing holdings of this leading semiconductor company. Far from being in financial straits or struggling to gain market share, AMD remains a company that is firing on all cylinders.
Strong earnings, bullish forward guidance and the recently completed purchase of Xilinx should all give investors confidence that AMD can continue to compete and win in the highly competitive chip industry. AMD stock is a buy.

2022-04-06 00:00:00+00:00,Qualcomm’s Autonomous Vehicle Ambitions Get a Boost,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/qualcomms-autonomous-vehicle-ambitions-get-a-boost,,,"Anyone who's been stuck in a traffic jam for any length of time appreciates the value of the autonomous vehicle. Communications company leader Qualcomm (QCOM) is part of the drive to get us there.
That drive just got a little easier thanks to a new acquisition the company's making. Between its current line of smartphone-heavy business, and its new potential push into driverless cars, the end result is reason to be bullish on Qualcomm.
The last year for Qualcomm has featured a major upward thrust followed by a slow decline to more “normal” levels. From April 2021 to nearly November, the company held to a fairly tight range between $120 and $150 per share. November saw a substantial upward spike that proved unsustainable, and now the company is back around the $140 range once more.
The latest news might get Qualcomm back up past those spike levels. The company concluded its efforts to acquire Arriver, the self-driving vehicle arm of Veoneer. With Arriver in its fold, Qualcomm will be better able to compete against Intel's (INTC) Mobileye, currently regarded as a leader in the industry.
Wall Street's Take
Turning to Wall Street, Qualcomm has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That's based on 12 Buys and five Holds assigned in the past three months. The average Qualcomm price target of $216.88 implies 55.7% upside potential.
Analyst price targets range from a low of $185 per share to a high of $250 per share.
Hedge Funds Losing Faith, but Dividends Inspire Hope
Right now, hedge funds are significantly less interested in Qualcomm than they once were. The word from the TipRanks 13-F Tracker shows that, once more, hedge funds have reduced their stake in Qualcomm by about two million shares last quarter.
This is a return to form for hedge fund appraisal of Qualcomm; hedge funds had sold shares in Qualcomm from March 2020 straight on to June 2021. The first increase in hedge fund stakes took place in September 2021, but December 2021's departure saw a further reduction in stake.
However, for income investors, Qualcomm offers a welcome dividend. Qualcomm's dividend history shows just what dividend stock investors like to see: a dividend that regularly increases, and has been doing so over the last four years.
Even during 2020 and the worst of the COVID-19 restrictions, Qualcomm maintained, and even raised, its dividend.
Qualcomm Needs Help
Granted, the autonomous vehicle market has been rough for its entrants in the last few years. Even Elon Musk noted that actually getting an autonomous vehicle to market was a “hard problem.”
Given the sheer range and extent of the problems Tesla (TSLA) has seen in that vein, it's not surprising that actually getting such a car out is proving a taller order than most expect.
Worse yet for Qualcomm, there are signs that smartphones aren't quite as ubiquitous as they once were. The “dumbphone” is making something of a comeback. “Dumbphones” are basically the cell phones that most had back in the 2000 to around 2010 range.
Dumbphone sales were on track to hit one billion units in 2021, up from just 400 million in 2019. With smartphone sales on the decline, that could mean some trouble for Qualcomm sales going forward.
With that in mind, it's little surprise that Qualcomm would work to branch out. While the smartphone trade is unlikely to go away, potential weakness therein might prove a limiting factor. If Qualcomm can make good on self-driving cars, having a piece of that market would likely easily make up for smartphone losses.
While Qualcomm will likely have the same level of problem that Musk and Tesla had with self-driving vehicles, Qualcomm is advancing in this field. Qualcomm already had Snapdragon Ride, and Arriver was using Snapdragon Ride chips in its operations for the last several years.
By way of comparison, Nvidia (NVDA) has around $11 billion worth of sales pipeline operations for its DRIVE autonomous vehicle platform. Since Nvidia focuses mainly on premium cars, that leaves a whole range of budget models open for the Qualcomm platform.
Concluding Views
Qualcomm is branching out, and that's good news for investors. While the exact value of the self-driving car market may be limited until the potential sales pipelines become actual sales numbers, having a stake in a market that most will likely eagerly get in on is worth doing.
Better yet, the numbers look great for Qualcomm as well. With Qualcomm trading significantly under its lowest price targets, there's plenty of upside potential.
So Qualcomm has a solid position in a currently solid market -- smartphones -- but also a potentially sound position in a market that will be solid in the future in self-driving cars. That combination makes for a stock worth being bullish about.

2022-04-06 00:00:00+00:00,Is Most-Watched Stock Intel Corporation (INTC) Worth Betting on Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-most-watched-stock-intel-corporation-intc-worth-betting-on-now,,,"Intel (INTC) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Over the past month, shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned +1.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Intel falls in, has gained 8.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.80 per share, indicating a change of -42.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $3.49 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -36.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.71 indicates a change of +6.3% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Intel.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Intel, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $18.32 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -6.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $75.39 billion and $78.36 billion estimates indicate -3.4% and +3.9% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $19.53 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.8%. EPS of $1.09 for the same period compares with $1.52 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.7%. The EPS surprise was +21.11%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

The two companies expect to close the deal by the second quarter of 2022.

Pensando, which was founded in 2017, makes products to accelerate networking, security, storage and other services for cloud, enterprise and edge applications.

AMD has made this strategic deal to strengthen its technology portfolio and expand its rapidly growing data center business amid strong competition.

Following the announcement, AMD’s shares surged on Apr 4 and closed the day with a 2.16% gain.

In the year-to-date period, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have fallen 23.1% compared with the Zacks Electronics-Semiconductors industry’s and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 15.1% and 10.9%, respectively.

AMD’s Acquisition Strategy: A Key to Win Market Share
AMD decided to buy Pensando to build a leading-edge data center cost-effectively without compromising on security to provide the best performance to customers and intensify competition amid the industry peers.

However, with expected revenues of $5 billion, an acquisition of $1.9 billion appears to be a costly affair. The company also completed the acquisition of Xilinx in an all-stock deal worth $35 billion. As of Dec 25, 2021, AMD had cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $3.61 billion as opposed to a total debt (long-term plus short-term) of $313 million.

Together AMD and Xilinx will cater to some of the most important growth segments for the industry, including data center, gaming, PCs, communications, automotive, industrial and aerospace and defense.

NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is one of its major competitors of AMD. The competition between the two companies has only intensified of late.

NVIDIA is a dominant name in the data center, professional visualization and gaming markets where the company peers are playing a catch-up role. NVIDIA is a major competitor of AMD in the GPU market, and competition in the mobile segment has been intensifying following NVIDIA’s acquisition of ARM Holdings.

Intel INTC recently completed the first phase of the sale of its manufacturing facility in China in sync with its long-term strategic goals. The company is gradually reducing its dependence on the PC-centric business by transitioning to data-centric businesses such as AI and autonomous driving.

Intel's acquisition of Israel-based Mobileye, an autonomous vehicle technology provider, is positive. The buyout will help the company rapidly penetrate the autonomous car technology market that is currently dominated by NVIDIA.

The collaboration ensures data-driven decision-making across air, sea, land, space and cyber domains in light of national security.

Intel’s 5G solutions are utilized in Lockheed Martin’s 5G.MIL Hybrid Base Station, which acts as a gateway for communications between military personnel and platforms like satellites, aircraft, ships and ground vehicles.

Lockheed Martin uses Intel’s processor, network and edge technologies to bring cloud capabilities to the needs of modern defense systems.

Intel and Lockheed Martin are leveraging 5G technology to deliver enhanced connectivity, more reliable networks and data capabilities to the DOD.

The companies previously collaborated to provide U.S. military and commercial customers advances in high-performance cloud and edge computing.

The collaboration has already improved the security and resiliency of the communications from the enterprise cloud to service members in the field.

In late 2021, Lockheed Martin and Intel, using Lockheed Martin’s 5G-enabled ground vehicles, demonstrated how security and 5G.MIL capabilities in cloud computing can enhance survivability capabilities for military personnel.

The companies have worked together on semiconductor packaging applications for high-density electronics.

Lockheed Martin’s collaborations with Intel align with its vision to create 5G.MIL defense and deterrence solutions.

Intel is benefiting from the growing demand in the Data Center Group, with strong server recovery in enterprise and government.

The stock has lost 25% in the past year against the industry’s rally of 31.6%.

2022-04-05 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Uses Old Tech to Battle Intel's Alder Lake,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-uses-old-tech-to-battle-intels-alder-lake,,,"When Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) launched its Ryzen 5000 series of desktop CPUs toward the end of 2020, budget chips were conspicuously absent. The lowest-priced chip available at the time was the $299 Ryzen 5 5600X. Prices have come down since then, but anyone looking for a sub-$200 processor had to turn to older products.
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) took advantage of this situation with its Alder Lake chips, the bulk of which launched earlier this year. Not only did Intel make strides in the high end of the market, but the company also offered multiple options below $200. Reviewers at Anandtech found that the $143 i3-12300 from Intel beat out AMD's high-end CPUs in single-threaded performance, making it a potent option for gamers on a budget.
Image source: AMD.
Turning to Zen 3
AMD isn't expected to launch chips based on its next-gen Zen 4 architecture until later this year, and when it does there's no guarantee that budget chips will be part of the lineup. AMD depends on Taiwan Semiconductor for manufacturing, along with scores of other fabless semiconductor companies, so the company is limited by how much advanced manufacturing capacity it can secure. Intel doesn't have that problem since it manufactures most of its own chips.
By not launching budget CPUs, users of AMD's older budget processors haven't had a viable upgrade path. Someone who's running an inexpensive Zen 2 chip from a few years ago and wants to upgrade without breaking the bank hasn't had a good option on the AMD side.
AMD is rectifying this situation by turning to its aging Zen 3 architecture. The company is launching two new chips, the $159 Ryzen 5500 and the $199 Ryzen 5600, that finally bring Zen 3 to the sub-$200 market.
For those running older AMD processors looking for a performance bump, these chips are great options. AMD has been using its AM4 socket since 2016. With some exceptions, AMD chips going back multiple generations can simply be replaced with these new 5000-series processors. Switching to an Alder Lake chip from Intel requires a new motherboard, so the switching costs are higher than just the price of the processor itself.
Beyond upgraders, though, AMD's new budget chips are a tough sell. They don't beat out comparable Alder Lake chips in terms of performance, and AMD's AM4 platform is not future proof. AMD is moving to its new AM5 platform with the Zen 4 launch, for one. And AM4 doesn't support faster DDR5 memory, among other things.
Better late than never, but AMD could have locked down the budget category had these chips launched a year ago. Instead, these new chips are mostly a way to minimize the number of cost-conscious customers jumping ship to Intel.
The tides are shifting
The story in the CPU market over the past few years has been a resurgent AMD taking market share from a flat-footed Intel. AMD was able to leverage industry-leading manufacturing tech from TSMC to pull ahead of Intel, which struggled with manufacturing delays for years.
That story now appears to be changing. Intel has aggressively priced its Alder Lake chips, making them highly competitive across the entire price spectrum. It's now AMD that's scrambling to plug gaps in its product line.
The launch of Zen 4 later this year will change the competitive landscape again, although Intel is planning to follow up Alder Lake with Raptor Lake before 2022 comes to a close. Intel has an aggressive roadmap. The company is no longer sitting idly by as AMD steals market share.
AMD's new budget chips play an important role by providing a viable upgrade path. But they don't change the equation much for anyone building a new budget PC.

2022-04-05 00:00:00+00:00,7 Real Estate Trends to Megawatch Over the Next Decade And How to Profit From Them,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-real-estate-trends-to-megawatch-over-the-next-decade-and-how-to-profit-from-them,,,"For most people, there are two reasons real estate investing can be so attractive.
You can be as active as you'd like, buying and managing properties or renovating and selling them in a flip for profits. Or you can take the passive approach, letting others manage affairs while you enjoy the income in the form of dividends, for instance, as an investor in shares of real estate investment trusts (REITs).
Regardless of how you choose to invest in real estate, you have to pay attention to what's happening in the big world around us. Change is always afoot, and when we're talking about a long-term commitment, it's particularly important to watch the trends and then make your best interpretation of how they'll affect your current and future investments.
Here are a few thoughts on some of those megatrends and why it might be a good time to keep a ""megawatch"" on them.
Image source: Statista.
Watch rates with interest
As the chart above shows, it took a long time for interest rates to get as low as they did in late 2021 before they began their rapid rise this year. How fast and how high they go now will make a big difference in the real estate market, especially housing but certainly for commercial real estate as well.
For example, a monthly payment of $1,073 on a 30-year note at 2.99% rises to $1,184 at 3.99%, and we're already there. Watch this figure closely. The effects will be profound, both on your personal investments and the markets you're watching. When it's more expensive to borrow, it's more expensive to build and expand and manufacture, and all those costs get passed on to the end user.
From the investor perspective, that can make providers of essentials such as groceries and gas -- and the real estate they occupy -- look more attractive and stable. Look at businesses that held up well during the pandemic collapse for possible winners here, beginning with companies like Realty Income and Kroger.
Keep an eye on affordability, wages, employment, and foreclosures
The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) recently calculated that every $1,000 jump in home prices pushes about 150,000 households out of the market. Other reports say that about 60% of renters can't afford to buy a home in their own city.
Meanwhile, employment levels and wages are rising but, for the latter, not as fast as inflation in many places. Altogether, it's a good idea to keep an eye on affordability in the areas you're considering investing. One clue that it might be an issue is if you see foreclosures on the rise. Predictions of a return to a foreclosure crisis during the pandemic never materialized, but that doesn't mean it's not something to keep watching. Things can always change.

Watching for a bubble
House prices continue to rise at a breakneck pace even as sales levels begin to show some signs of slowing down. This can't go on forever, of course, and some Fed economists have just released a report that speaks to how fundamentals have become disconnected from price hikes, i.e., a bubble.
While the consensus continues that the fundamentals now are much different from the Great Recession housing collapse, that may just mean the deflation in prices and sales will be more gradual. The best investing advice here might be to avoid paying too much in overheated markets.
Easy to say, right? For guidance, keep an eye on such studies as the Buying vs. Renting Housing Index regularly updated by a group of economists based at Florida Atlantic University.
Speaking of renting, rents are on the rise, too, especially in the hottest markets. The big operators make great sense as an investment since they have the scale and savvy, presumably, to operate profitably in this environment. Considerations here include AvalonBay Communities and Equity Residential.
A shortage of housing nationally should help prevent a dramatic bursting of the bubble, but where the demand goes bears watching.
Remember: location, location, location
With apologies to Horace Greeley, instead of ""go West,"" it might be time to ""go Midwest"" for those thinking of getting ahead of the megatrends. While people and the businesses they work for and own are migrating in great numbers to the Sun Belt, less-expensive areas -- many of them in the central U.S. -- may soon emerge as the next hotspots.
Remember, growing numbers of people can live pretty much anywhere and do their jobs remotely. That's only going to become even truer as broadband access quietly and inexorably pushes further into rural areas. Already, small and midsize cities across the heartland offer a much lower cost of living, and the schools, housing options, and other amenities make one think they won't be overlooked much longer. Investors might want to get ahead of that curve now.
By the way, Equity Residential's chief executive officer already sees trouble ahead and has sold off a lot of the company's Sun Belt apartments because of what he sees as a coming supply glut. That's strategic thinking in action. And as an individual investor, buying shares in companies like that give you liquidity and transparency not easily accessible through other investment channels.
Follow the supply chain
It's not just people moving inland -- companies are, too. The supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic helped accelerate that trend. One good example of a market where that's happening is in Columbus, Ohio. There, Intel just announced a $20 billion chip-plant project in the far exurbs that will have a strong ripple effect in all kinds of real estate for miles around.
Move fast to take advantage of those big splashes but keep an eye out for others. Local brokers are a great source for that info if you have the wherewithal to get involved directly. And there are a number of industrial REITs that are responding to that opportunity as well.
There will always be an aging population
It's old news that the boomer generation is aging and in growing need of medical care and senior-living options. The next big generation after that, the millennials, is not far behind, of course. Investing options are plentiful here, including long-term success stories like hospital owner Medical Properties Trust and senior housing giant Welltower.

Is a (sea) changing world the ultimate megatrend?
Miami is wrestling with the idea of building a 20-foot seawall. A major South Carolina hospital has decided to move off the vulnerable peninsula in Charleston Harbor. Tropical systems batter our coasts with growing intensity. Water shortages threaten the fast-growing Southwest. Wildfires grow worse every year in a growing list of states.
You get the picture. If you think these are all a growing reality, these are megatrends you need to follow. They can help inform where you want to live, not to mention invest. For instance, maybe a small town near the Great Lakes and still close to major transportation infrastructure might be the ticket.
That's just one example of beginning with the big picture. Let what you see from that 30,000-foot view help you focus on exactly what you want to do down here on the ground.

2022-04-05 00:00:00+00:00,"Down Almost 8% Last Month, What's Next For AMD Stock?",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/down-almost-8-last-month-whats-next-for-amd-stock,,,"Advanced Micro Devices stock (NASDAQ: AMD) is down almost 8% in the past month (21 trading days), largely underperforming the S&P 500 which was up a little over 3% over this period. If you look at the change over the last five and ten days, too, the stock has returned -9.3% and -2.1%, underperforming the broader market on both occasions. AMD’s recent strong FY ’21 earnings saw revenue jump from $9.76 billion in FY ’20 to $16.4 billion in FY ’21. As cost of sales and other operating expenses rose at a much slower rate, operating income shot up more than 2.5x from $1.37 billion to $3.65 billion over this period. Despite a rise in the outstanding share count and a sharp jump in the effective tax rate, AMD’s EPS rose from $2.10 in FY ’20 to $2.61 in FY ’21. Despite this, the stock dropped recently due to a downgrade from Barclays, who now rates the stock a ‘hold’, cutting the price target more than 20%.
Now, is AMD stock set to continue its underperformance or could we expect a rally? We believe that there is an average 51% chance of a rise in AMD stock over the next month (21 trading days) based on our machine learning analysis of trends in the stock price over the last ten years. See our analysis on AMD Stock Chance of Rise. For additional details about AMD revenues and comparison to peers, see Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Revenue Comparison.

2022-04-04 00:00:00+00:00,Will Intel (INTC) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-intel-intc-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report,,,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Intel (INTC), which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry.
This world's largest chipmaker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 37.58%.
For the last reported quarter, Intel came out with earnings of $1.09 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.90 per share, representing a surprise of 21.11%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.11 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.71 per share, delivering a surprise of 54.05%.
Price and EPS Surprise
With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Intel. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Intel has an Earnings ESP of +1.04% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on April 28, 2022.
With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.
Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
