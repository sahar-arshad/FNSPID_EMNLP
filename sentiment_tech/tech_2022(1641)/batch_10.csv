2022-10-26 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Q3 Preview: Can Shares Rebound?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-q3-preview%3A-can-shares-rebound,,,"The Zacks Computer and Technology sector has tumbled in 2022 amid a hawkish pivot from the Fed, down more than 30% and widely underperforming the S&P 500.
A commonly recognized name in the sector, Intel Corp. INTC, is on deck to unveil quarterly results on October 27th after the market close.
Intel is the world’s largest semiconductor company and primary supplier of microprocessors and chipsets. Gradually, the company has reduced its reliance on the PC-centric business by moving into data-centric businesses.
Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with an overall VGM Score of a D.
How does everything shape up heading into the print? Let’s take a closer look.
Share Performance & Valuation
Intel shares have sailed through choppy waters in 2022, down above 45% and coming nowhere near the S&P 500’s performance.

Over the last three months, sellers have maintained a tight grip, with Intel shares down just above 30%.

The company’s valuation multiples have pulled back amid the stretch of poor price action; its 12.5X forward earnings multiple reflects a 43% discount relative to its Zacks Computer and Technology sector average and is off 2021 highs of 14.8X.
Still, it’s worth noting that the value is above its five-year median of 12.1X.

Quarterly Estimates
Analysts have been bearish for the quarter to be reported over the last several months, with five negative earnings estimate revisions hitting the tape. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.34 suggests a Y/Y earnings decline of roughly 80%.

Intel’s top-line is also undergoing some turbulence; the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate of $15.5 billion indicates a 19% decline from year-ago quarterly revenue of $19.2 billion.
Quarterly Performance & Market Reactions
Intel has consistently exceeded earnings estimates, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in nine of its last ten quarters.
However, its one bottom-line miss came in its latest report, when the chip giant fell short of EPS expectations by nearly 58%.
Revenue results paint precisely the same story; INTC fell short of sales expectations by 14% in its latest print, the company’s first miss out of its last ten. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue o a quarterly basis.

In addition, it’s worth highlighting that the market hasn’t liked what it’s seen from the company; shares have moved downwards following each of its last six quarterly prints.
Putting Everything Together
Intel shares have struggled to find their footing in 2022, underperforming the general market across several timeframes.
The company’s forward earnings multiple sits above its five-year median but nicely below 2021 highs.
Analysts have been bearish in their earnings outlook, and estimates suggest Y/Y declines in earnings and revenue.
The company has a history of posting strong results, but its latest quarter broke a long streak of exceeding estimates.  
Heading into the release, Intel INTC carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with an Earnings ESP Score of -2%.

2022-10-26 00:00:00+00:00,"ANALYSIS-Ford, VW pop the automated-vehicle bubble with Argo AI exit",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-ford-vw-pop-the-automated-vehicle-bubble-with-argo-ai-exit,,,"By Paul Lienert
DETROIT, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The road map to fully self-driving vehicles is being rewritten once again, this time by Ford Motor Co F.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE.
When the two automakers joined forces in July 2019 to share control of self-driving startup Argo AI, it shook up the landscape among other key players.
Wednesday's announcement that Pittsburgh-based Argo is being shuttered and some of its employees moving to Ford and VW underscores the growing realization that automated vehicles may be even further away from mass deployment than industry executives predicted back in 2019.
""It's become very clear that profitable, fully autonomous vehicles at scale are still a long way off,"" Ford CFO John Lawler said on Wednesday.
As Ford, General Motors Co GM.N and other companies began to realize they would need to step up investment over a longer period of time, “it was never clear what the financial returns were going to be” on automated vehicles, Evangelos Simoudis, an investor, author and corporate adviser, told Reuters on Wednesday.
Regarding Ford and Volkswagen's exit from Argo AI, Simoudis said, “I expect we will see more of those decisions.”
As the AV deployment timeline stretches out even further - after an estimated $100 billion cumulative investment by global automakers and suppliers - once-inflated valuations of self-driving companies have come crashing to earth.
VW's initial investment in Argo in 2019 was valued at $2.6 billion, including $1 billion in cash and the $1.6 billion value of VW's European self-driving unit, which was absorbed into Argo. VW also bought Argo shares from Ford for $500 million.
Ford previously injected $1 billion into Argo when it bought control of the company in 2017. On Wednesday, it wrote down $2.7 billion in impairment charges.
Before it acquired the stake in Argo, VW flirted with at least two other U.S.-based self-driving startups: Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Waymo and Aurora Innovation AUR.O.
VW reportedly considered a $13.7 billion investment in 2018 in Waymo for a 10% stake that would have valued Waymo at $137 billion.
The value of Waymo just before then was estimated by Wall Street at $175 billion to $250 billion. Its most recent valuation by PitchBook of $30.75 billion dates to May 2020.
The market cap of Aurora, which went public nearly a year ago, has sunk to $2.5 billion, from a 52-week high of more than $20 billion.
When VW announced its initial investment in Argo in July 2019, it walked away from a development deal with Aurora, when the Silicon Valley firm was valued at $2.5 billion and backed by Hyundai Motor 005380.KS and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.
Hyundai eventually formed a self-driving joint venture called Motional with Aptiv APTV.N. Amazon bought self-driving startup Zoox.
Argo's most recent valuation was $7.25 billion, but that was more than two years ago, according to investor website PitchBook. The company laid off 150 employees in July, when it said it was adjusting its business plan.
The value of its nearest rival, the General Motors majority-owned Cruise, was estimated by PitchBook at $30 billion in January 2021, but its current value likely has dropped since key investor SoftBank sold its stake back to GM earlier this year. GM meanwhile is losing $2 billion a year on Cruise.
Mobileye Global MBLY.Owent public this week, but at a third of the $50 billion valuation it was targeting earlier in its IPO.
The company, which was acquired by Intel Corp INTC.O in 2017 for $15.3 billion, saw its market cap recover to more than $21 billion on Wednesday, reflecting the company's financial strength and reputation, particularly in assisted driving systems. Intel still holds a majority stake.
BREAKINGVIEWS-Detroit automakers head for light at end of tunnel
Ford posts loss, takes sharp turn away from automated driving
Volkswagen no longer investing in self-driving startup Argo AI

2022-10-26 00:00:00+00:00,3 Big-Time Passive Income Stocks to Consider Loading Up On During the Bear Market,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-big-time-passive-income-stocks-to-consider-loading-up-on-during-the-bear-market,,,"Bear markets can be an opportunity for those with cash sitting on the sidelines. With stock prices falling more than 20%, dividend yields are surging. And that means you can earn more passive income from money invested amid a bear market.
Three high-quality companies currently offering big-time dividend yields because of the bear market are Verizon (NYSE: VZ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Walgreen Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA). Here's why passive-income seekers should consider loading up on these big-time dividend stocks.
A cash flow machine
Shares of telecom giant Verizon have tumbled nearly 35% from their recent high. That slump has pushed Verizon's dividend yield up over 7%.
Verizon has an excellent dividend track record. Last month the company increased its quarterly dividend payment by another 2%. That marked the company's 16th straight year of increasing its dividend, the longest in the telecom industry.
The company generates plenty of cash to cover its big-time payout. Verizon's business generated $28.2 billion of cash from operations during the first nine months of 2022, more than covering the $15.8 billion it invested in maintaining and expanding its network. That left it with $12.4 billion of free cash flow, allowing it to fund its $8.1 billion dividend outlay and strengthen its solid balance sheet. The company expects its network investments to drive future growth, which should enable it to continue increasing its dividend.
Multiple funding sources put the dividend on a solid foundation
Shares of semiconductor giant Intel have plummeted more than 50% this year. That has pushed Intel's dividend yield up over 5%.
Intel's expansion plans have weighed on its share price. The company plans to invest $23 billion in capital projects, including constructing several chip manufacturing plants. The company expects its adjusted free cash flow to fall in a range of negative-$1 billion to $2-billion this year as a result. Some investors are therefore concerned that Intel can't afford its dividend, which totaled nearly $3 billion during the first half of this year.
However, Intel has an A-rated balance sheet with $27 billion of cash at the end of the first quarter. It also expects to raise additional money by completing an initial public offering of its Mobileye unit. Meanwhile, the company secured Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) as a funding partner for two manufacturing plants. Brookfield will finance 49% of the up to $30 billion needed to build those facilities. Because of these factors, Intel believes it can maintain and continue growing its dividend during this expansion phase.
The transformation is on track
Walgreens Boots Alliance has lost more than 35% of its value this year, and its dividend yield has risen above 5.5%. That's a very attractive payout for a company with Walgreens' dividend track record.
The consumer-centric healthcare company increased its payout for the 47th straight year. That easily qualifies it as a Dividend Aristocrat and puts it a few years shy of the even more elite class of Dividend Kings.
Walgreens is currently transforming from a pharmacy retailer to a consumer-centric healthcare company. It sees its investments in that strategy driving accelerating core growth in 2023. Meanwhile, it expects its earnings per share to build toward a low-teens annual growth rate in its 2025 fiscal year and beyond. That forecast suggests Walgreens should have no problem continuing to grow its big-time payout in the future.
Boost your passive income with these bear market sales
Stock prices are tumbling as investors price in the near-term possibility of an economic downturn. While a recession will affect some companies' ability to finance their growth and dividend payments, it won't affect Verizon, Intel, and Walgreens since they generate lots of cash and have solid balance sheets. They should be able to continue growing their dividends in the coming years. With their stock prices lower and dividend yields higher, they look like attractive options for those looking to take advantage of the bear market to boost their passive income.

NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Mobileye Global Inc MBLY.O, the self-driving unit of chip maker Intel Corp INTC.O, raised $861 million in an initial public offering (IPO) on Tuesday, braving the trading volatility that has thwarted many stock market hopefuls.
Mobileye priced 41 million shares at $21 per share, the source said, requesting anonymity ahead of an official announcement. The company had previously guided the IPO could be priced at between $18 and $20 per share.
The IPO values Mobileye at $16.7 billion, a far cry from the $50 billion valuation that Intel was initially hoping to achieve.
But Mobileye is selling only a 5% stake in itself, less than the typical 10% to 20% stake sale seen in most IPOs. This means that the financial hit it will take as a result of its lower valuation will be limited.
Mobileye did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Mobileye Global Inc MBLY.O, the self-driving unit of chip maker Intel Corp INTC.O, raised $861 million in an initial public offering (IPO) on Tuesday, braving the trading volatility that has thwarted many stock market hopefuls, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Mobileye priced 41 million shares at $21 per share, the source said, requesting anonymity ahead of an official announcement. The company had previously guided the IPO could be priced at between $18 and $20 per share.
The IPO values Mobileye at $16.7 billion, a far cry from the $50 billion valuation that Intel was initially hoping to achieve.
Mobileye is selling only a 5% stake in itself, less than the typical 10% to 20% stake for most IPOs. This limits the financial hit it will take as a result of its lower valuation.
Mobileye did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
U.S. IPOs are having one of their worst years on record, with traditional offerings on track to raise the least money in over two decades, according to Dealogic which tracks listing data going back to 1995. The Renaissance IPO index, which captures the largest and most liquid U.S IPOs, has slumped 51.4% this year, compared with the S&P 500 index's drop of 19.54%.
The Cboe Volatility Index .VIX, Wall Street's fear gauge, is hovering at about 29. VIX readings above 20 are generally associated with an elevated sense of investor anxiety about the near-term outlook for stocks.
FROZEN MARKETS
Hundreds of companies have postponed IPO plans this year due to volatility in capital markets. Earlier in October, grocery delivery startup Instacart scrapped its plans to go public this year.
Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger has defended Mobileye's decision to push ahead with an IPO, saying the listing was a way to ""move (Mobileye) into the market"".
Intel will retain a large stake, including all the Class B shares Mobileye plans to issue, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Each Class B share will have voting rights equivalent to 10 Class A shares.
Mobileye reported $854 million in revenue for the first six months of the fiscal year, up 21% from same period last year. The company posted a net loss of $67 million.
Mobileye first went public in 2014 at a roughly $5 billion valuation, before Intel acquired it for $15.3 billion in 2017.
Mobileye's shares are scheduled to start trading on Wednesday on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""MBLY"".
Goldman Sachs Group IncGS.N and Morgan StanleyMS.N are the lead underwriters for the offering.

Presumably the only reason for a company insider to choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. Within the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, only seven companies have experienced such buying over the trailing six month period, one of which was Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC), where an investment totaling $746.3K invested across 2 purchases was made by CEO Patrick P. Gelsinger. Click Here to Learn Which Other Six Dow Components Also Had Recent Insider Buying »

Gelsinger's average cost works out to $36.77/share. In trading on Tuesday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) and achieve a cost basis lower than Gelsinger, with shares changing hands as low as $27.00 per share.

Oct 25 (Reuters) - ASM International ASMI.AS expects new U.S. export restrictions to weigh heavily on its sales in China, the Dutch semiconductor supplier said on Tuesday as it reported third-quarter revenue slightly above its own forecast.
July-September revenue increased 33% year-on-year to 610 million euros ($607.38 million), beating the company's guided range of 570 million to 600 million euros, while new quarterly orders came in at 676 million euros, adjusted for the expected negative impact of the recent U.S. export restrictions.
According to ASMI, which counts Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) 2330.TW and Intel INTC.O among its customers, the restrictions will affect more than 40% of its sales in China and the group consequently decided to reduce third-quarter bookings and related backlog.
Earlier this month, the Biden administration published a set of export controls, including a measure to cut China off from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with U.S. tools.
""Our equipment sales in China, at 16% of our total revenue in the first nine months of 2022, have been a growing part of our business with a strong contribution to group profitability"", the company outlined in a statement.
The group now expects practically stable quarter-on-quarter sales in October-December at 600 million euros to 630 million euros, including the contribution from silicon carbide epitaxy equipment business LPE, acquired by ASMI on Oct. 3.
Dutch rival ASML Holding ASML.AS also reported forecast-beating third-quarter sales and profit along with record new bookings, but shrugged off the impact from U.S. sanctions on China. It noted that since it cannot currently keep up with orders in general, if orders for tools from China slow, it could sell them elsewhere.

Oct 24 (Reuters) - Intel Corp'sINTC.OChief Executive Pat Gelsinger on Monday said the initial public offering of its self-driving tech company Mobileye was not a capital raise, but more of an entry into the market.
""It is a move to potentially move them into the market. It's not a capital raise,"" said Gelsinger at the WSJ Tech Live conference when asked about why Intel was moving ahead with an IPO during such tough market environments and whether Intel needed that cash.
""The autonomous vehicle segment is a strong segment for growth. It's a tough market. At the same time, we're believing this company should be public and this is the best way to maximize the company's potential,"" Gelsinger said.
He also said he believes self-driving cars could become commonplace on the streets by the middle of the decade.
Last week, Mobileye said it was targeting a valuation of nearly $16 billion in its IPO, less than a third of what it had reportedly previously expected, as volatility in stock markets and rising interest rates dampen the appetite for new listings.
Mobileye said in a regulatory filing it is offering 41 million shares of common stock priced between $18 and $20 per share, aiming to raise up to $820 million, based on the top end of the proposed range of the listing.
Reuters, citing sources, had reported in April that the stock market flotation could value Mobileye at as much as $50 billion.

2022-10-24 00:00:00+00:00,"One Under-the-Radar Semiconductor Stock With 125% Upside, According to Wall Street",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/one-under-the-radar-semiconductor-stock-with-125-upside-according-to-wall-street,,,"Semiconductor stocks have sold off nearly double the amount of the overall market this year, because of fears over a cyclical slowdown, as well as the cutting off of certain chip sales to China.
Yet recent restrictions on China sales just go to show how important next-gen semiconductors are to the economy. And despite the cyclical downturn, the long-term growth in cloud, artificial intelligence, 5G, electric and autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of Things will all require more advanced chips over the long term.
Within those trends, certain chip production processes are also growing in importance, such as advanced packaging. And a leader in the most cutting-edge advanced packaging tools is Netherlands-based BE Semiconductor N.V. (OTC: BESIY), also known as ""BESI"" for short. Here's why this under-the-radar company should be on your shopping list.
Why advanced packaging could rule the next decade
Over the past decade, wafer-front-end equipment sales saw a boom, as the adoption of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) allowed chipmakers to economically produce chips with transistors below 10nm apart. However, in the 2020s, narrowing the distance between transistors is becoming harder and more expensive, as device scaling rubs up against the boundaries of physics.
Enter advanced packaging, by which chipmakers are now improving a system's power, performance, and functionality through attaching chips together in new, innovative ways, rather than merely shrinking transistor sizes.
In fact, the newest processors by both Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) both employ a new kind of ""chiplet"" architecture. This is a process by which different parts of the processor are actually made separately and optimized for performance, then stitched together through new advanced packaging techniques to create the new chip. The efficiencies gained by optimizing each part of the processor can lead to improved performance again beyond the mere shrinking of transistors.
Don't sleep on BE Semiconductor
The global leader in the most sophisticated types of advanced packaging is BE Semiconductor. Although BESI has 12% market share of the overall assembly and packaging industry, it has a leading 42% share in the die attach potion of the market, and a 75% market share within the most advanced technologies for die placement.
BESI's concentration in the most advanced parts of the packaging industry positions it well for the future. For instance, AMD's EPYC data center chips have gone from four chip placement steps in 2017, to nine advanced placement steps in 2019, to more 30 advanced placement steps in the most recent 2022 model. Intel's upcoming Ponte Vecchio GPU is composed of 47 chiplets, stitched together.
Advanced solutions are leading to industry-leading margins
The concentration in the high-end parts of the packaging and die attach markets have enabled BESI to achieve sustainably higher margins than rivals, all while continuing to expand margins over the cycles. Over the past 15 years, BESI's gross margins have improved from roughly a 34% through-cycle gross margin in the 2006-2009 timeframe to a 58% gross margin over the past four years.
Remarkably, BESI continues to improve its margin profile. Even though the most recent quarter saw a decline in revenues off record highs due to both cyclical and seasonal factors, gross margins have actually improved to 62.3% versus 61% in the second quarter. While net margins came down slightly, as the company maintained its investment in research and development, they were still a very high 34%, even in a ""down"" quarter.
With those profits, BESI opts more for high dividend payments, rather than the share repurchases favored by its American counterparts. In fact, BESI pays out virtually all of its net profits in dividend payments, which fluctuate from year to year, depending on cyclical dynamics. While BESI does do some share repurchases, they are relatively lower, meant only to offset the dilution of stock-based compensation as well as the dilution from its low-rate convertible debt.
This year, the company paid out a 3.33-euro dividend based on 2021's net profits of 3.39 euros per share, good for about a 6.8% dividend yield at the current share price. The first half of 2022 was strong for BESI, but the back half is likely to be significantly lower, so the dividend may come out slightly lower this year. Through the first nine months of 2022, BESI earned 2.40 euros per share, slightly below the 2.58 earnings through the first nine months of 2021.
BESI could be a good option for semiconductor investors
Earnings may decline in the year ahead, but that is largely expected and reflected in BESI's current share price, at least to some extent. But if the scaling of advanced semiconductors continues to grow over the long term, investors should benefit handsomely. Currently, Wall Street analysts agree the stock is undervalued, with an average price target of 71.44 euros, good for a 46% gain over today's price. The highest price target is a whopping 110 euros, which would equate to a 125% gain from here.
BE Semiconductor may be somewhat off the radar for U.S. investors because of its European headquarters, but for dividend-oriented investors who believe in the long-term growth of advanced semiconductors, BESI should be on your ""buy"" list, especially with shares down 45% from their 52-week highs.

2022-10-22 00:00:00+00:00,Should You Buy the Dow Jones' 3 Worst-Performing 2022 Stocks?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-the-dow-jones-3-worst-performing-2022-stocks-3,,,"The Dow Jones Index is made up of 30 of the largest and most dominant companies on the U.S. stock exchanges. However, none of them have had a positive year. So far, the best performer of 2022 is Johnson & Johnson, which is down 0.2% this year.
As for the worst performers, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Nike (NYSE: NKE), and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) are down 47.5%, 45.9%, and 42.3%, respectively, as of October 18. With these companies down so much, investors may wonder if now is the right time to establish a position in these companies. After all, they are significantly on sale.
Intel
Intel used to be the gold standard for technology companies. Its processors, memory, and other semiconductor products were revolutionary in the computing field. A common saying was that Intel allowed rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices to exist so Intel wouldn't have to deal with antitrust lawsuits due to its superior technology. Now that script has flipped.
In the second quarter, Intel's revenue fell 22% YOY (year-over-year) to $15.3 billion. In particular, Intel blamed its Client Computing (personal computers) and Data Center and AI group for the falling revenue. These two segments' sales dropped by 25% and 16%, respectively.
Now let's compare that to AMD. In Q2, Client revenue (similar to Intel's Client Computing) was up 25% YOY, and Data Center sales rose 83% YOY. So in Q2, demand seemed to be there, but AMD did a better job of business execution than Intel.
Moreover, a storm is coming. AMD, which executed much better in Q2 and in multiple previous years, recently announced preliminary Q3 that saw Client demand disappear (the segment was down 40% YOY), but Data Center demand remained strong at 45% growth. If AMD had a lousy quarter, I can't imagine what Intel will report on October 27.
Even though Intel trades for a dirt cheap 5.5 times earnings, it could get even cheaper if its execution is similar to Q2. I see no reason to buy Intel's stock until its execution improves compared to its competition.
Nike
Nike's most recent quarter should be a warning sign for other retailers. As many companies stocked up on inventory after massive demand in 2020 and 2021, that demand is now fleeting. In the quarter, Nike's gross margin dropped due to liquidating its excess inventories across North America.
Even with this liquidation, Nike's inventories were up 44% from last year, so the pain appears far from over. Regardless, Nike's revenues rose 4% YOY to $12.7 billion in its 2023 fiscal year Q1 (ending August 31). Earnings per share (EPS) were down 20% to $0.93, but its price-to-earnings ratio remains steep at 25.4.
Even though Nike has always traded at a premium valuation, it doesn't seem to be living up to its reputation right now. Nike's supply and demand imbalance likely won't be solved soon, and with consumer spending tightening up, it could face top-line pressure.
Nike's woes may not be over, and as its valuation returns to average levels, investors should be wary of Nike, at least for the near term.
Salesforce
Salesforce is more under the radar than Intel or Nike. Its product suite consists of various customer relationship management software programs, as well as data analytics like Tableau and internal communication tools like Slack.
Despite what the stock price says, it has also had a much different year than its other two basement dwellers.
In Q2 of its fiscal year 2023 (ending July 31), its revenue rose 22% YOY, and Salesforce's cash balance was strong enough to announce a $10 billion share repurchase plan. It also delivered impressive full-year guidance, with cash flows expected to rise between 16% and 17%. Additionally, analysts expect 14.7% growth next year, despite the economic headwinds that are stirring.
While Salesforce's price-to-earnings metric isn't useful because it is not fully profitable, it trades for a reasonable 27 times free cash flow and a bargain 5.2 times sales.
Salesforce's 2022 drop has been associated with high-flying tech stocks. While this is a valid relationship, the sell-off has been entirely overdone. As a result, I think Salesforce is a great buy now and is by far the best stock to buy out of this trio.

2022-10-22 00:00:00+00:00,3 Powerhouse Passive-Income Stocks That Each Yield More Than 4%,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-powerhouse-passive-income-stocks-that-each-yield-more-than-4,,,"Red-hot inflation, geopolitical tensions, an uncertain outlook for consumer spending and the housing market -- the list of stock market headwinds goes on and on. One approach for folks looking for a simple way to ride out the volatility is to invest in good companies that have attractive dividend yields.
An advantage of a sizable yield -- particularly a yield of 4% or higher -- is that the dividend on its own is enough to supplement some income in retirement.
However, the 4% level is even more critical right now because rising interest rates have pushed the three-month Treasury bill rate up. In fact, the three-month Treasury bill yield is currently 3.8% -- which is the highest level in 15 years.
A stock with a 4% yield is essentially providing the same amount of passive income as a three-month Treasury bill while also giving exposure to the potential upside and downside of the equity market. Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK), TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE), and Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE: BIP) are three excellent companies that also happen to be high-yield dividend stocks. Here's what makes each a great buy now.
Image source: Getty Images.
The key to the investment case is now the restructuring plan
Lee Samaha (Stanley Black & Decker): It's been an awful year for hardware and tools company Stanley Black & Decker. Investors started the year hoping for the company to begin overcoming supply chain pressures and its raw material costs. In doing so, Stanley would generate margin expansion in a year when it refocused on its core tools and storage and industrial products businesses.
Stanley sold its electronic security business and its automatic doors business this year. Meanwhile, Stanley bought the remaining 80% it didn't own in outdoor and lawn products company MTD at the end of 2021, and investors were looking forward to its integration into Stanley's business.
Unfortunately, almost everything went wrong. The supply chain issues persisted, as did raw material inflation. Meanwhile, Stanley's focus on the consumer, notably the housing market (DIY tools), exposes it to near-term risk as mortgage rates soar and the housing market slows.

In response, management has initiated an aggressive restructuring plan to shave a whopping $2 billion off costs within three years. As such, the key to the investment case is the successful implementation of the restructuring plan, while investors hope the DIY tools market will hold up, so they can enjoy the current 4.2% yield while they wait for recovery. It's a compelling proposition, but perhaps one better looked at after the company's most recent results, due at the end of October.
A well-rounded energy company with the highest yield in its peer group
Daniel Foelber (TotalEnergies): Today, big oil companies are investing in alternative and renewable energy, diversifying their portfolios away from oil and gas. However, there are still only a handful of American and European integrated oil majors that play in the upstream, midstream, and downstream spaces. French multinational TotalEnergies is one of the six majors alongside BP, Shell, Equinor, Chevron, and ExxonMobil. Yet Total is the only European major that didn't cut its dividend during the worst of the oil and gas crash of 2020.
Since then, BP, Shell, and Equinor have made sizable dividend raises, and Chevron and ExxonMobil have continued making moderate increases to maintain their status as Dividend Aristocrats. But Total still has the highest yield of the integrated majors -- with a yield of 5.5% (although taxes and fees apply for U.S. investors earning dividends from foreign companies).
TTE Dividend Yield data by YCharts
What's more, Total is an excellent value, with the second-lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the majors at just 6.5. Investors should keep in mind that P/E ratios for the integrated oil major group as a whole are below their long-term averages despite their stock prices being up. The discounted valuation is likely due to expectations that profits will come down as oil and gas prices stabilize.
Aside from its high dividend yield and low valuation, Total is in a good position to take advantage of strong oil and gas prices and new investments in lower carbon solutions. Total has one of the lowest costs of production of the oil majors. Its aggressive investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG) have given it a 10% share of the global LNG market as Total works toward making natural gas 50% of its sales mix by 2030.
Total has also invested heavily in solar energy -- expanding its installed capacity from 0.7 gigawatts to 10 gigawatts between 2017 and 2021.
In sum, Total has an efficient oil and gas portfolio, a growing LNG and renewable energy portfolio, a discounted valuation, and the highest dividend yield of the oil majors.
Build a better passive income stream with Brookfield
Scott Levine (Brookfield Infrastructure): Paying more at the pump, at the supermarket, at mom-and-pop shops can leave you feeling frustrated that your purchasing power has plummeted. Pinching the pursestrings may help alleviate the strain, but it's very likely that it won't be enough. Many investors, consequently, are turning to strong dividend stocks to boost their passive income -- especially those with appealing yields like the 4.4% forward dividend yield that Brookfield Infrastructure currently offers.
A global leader in infrastructure, Brookfield owns and operates a variety of assets that produce stable cash flows. Provided the company meets its funds from operations forecast and generates $2.70 per unit in 2022, the company will have increased its funds from operations at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% from 2012 to 2022.
In addition to electricity and natural gas utilities, the company's assets include data infrastructure, transportation (such as rail operations and toll roads), and midstream energy pipelines and storage facilities. And the portfolio is poised to grow even larger. Among other projects that the company has in its pipeline, Brookfield Infrastructure is working with Intel to build a $30 billion semiconductor manufacturing facility in Arizona.
In addition to the stock's attractive yield, income investors will also find management's commitment to increasingly rewarding investors alluring. During a recent investor presentation, Brookfield Infrastructure reiterated a distribution growth target of 5% to 9% annually over the long term. For those who question whether this goal is realistic, a glance at the company's previous performance should lend some credibility. Should the company achieve its 2022 forecast and return $1.44 per unit in distributions, it will represent a 9% CAGR in its distributions per unit since 2012.

2022-10-21 00:00:00+00:00,NVDA vs. INTC: Which Chip Stock Should You Dip Into?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvda-vs.-intc%3A-which-chip-stock-should-you-dip-into,,,"Semiconductor stocks have taken even more damage than the overall market, thanks to what certainly seems like a perfect combo of macro headwinds. Supply-chain disruptions, a looming economic contraction, and other nearer-term issues have made the chip stocks falling knives at this juncture. Nonetheless, in this piece, we leveraged TipRanks' Comparison tool to provide a bit of insight into the two chip plays — Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) —that may be most intriguing through the eyes of investors seeking a rebound. In terms of analyst forecasts, NVDA looks better. However, let's dig deeper.
Nvidia and Intel are semiconductor stocks on opposing sides of the spectrum. Though both stocks are under a lot of selling pressure, Nvidia remains one of the pricier (and more exciting) plays, while Intel seems dirt-cheap amid ongoing struggles to reclaim some of the market share it lost over the years.
Undoubtedly, Nvidia is a fallen winner still at the forefront of GPU innovation, while Intel seems to be losing ground to the competition. As the broader tech scene is dragged lower, investors may wonder if it's better to go with the hard-hit but still ""pricy"" leader or pay a rock-bottom price tag for an underdog with hopes that it can close the gap.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Nvidia stock is down about 64% from its all-time high of around $346 per share. The Nvidia growth story is still alive and well. In fact, it may have improved over the past year as shares have sagged. Though Nvidia is leading the charge for the chipmakers, with a foot in the door of so many trends in tech (think AI and the metaverse), the valuation was suspect. It may still be suspect today, even after shedding around two-thirds of its value from peak to trough.
Now, Nvidia stock deserves a premium to the peer group. Its incredible founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, have found a way to raise the bar in the industry. As numerous technological trends continue to evolve, Nvidia's growth rate could surpass the estimates of many. Indeed, it's tough to gauge what demand will be like in five years after the recession has blown over and new trends in tech (think wider adoption of video gaming and mixed-reality headsets).
Indeed, Nvidia is a forward-thinking growth play with a long-term growth rate that's difficult to fathom. It's hard to put a number on Nvidia's 10-year growth rate when emerging tech fields could feed demand steadily over time.
At this juncture, Nvidia stock goes for 33.4x trailing earnings and 10.4x sales. That's not all too expensive for one of the most impressive secular growth companies. Though higher interest rates and demand-waning recession woes could weigh the stock down further over the medium term, I think Nvidia is one of the names worth stashing on a radar.
What is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?
Wall Street remains bullish on Nvidia, with a ""Moderate Buy"" rating. The average NVDA stock price target of $199.83 implies 68.1% worth of upside from today's levels. Undoubtedly, Nvidia's price target has fallen quite a bit in recent months. However, I do think Wall Street is right to stand by the company amid transitory macro headwinds.
Intel (INTC)
Intel is a chipmaker that's seen shares fall more than 62% from peak to trough. Undoubtedly, Intel has lost a bit of its edge in recent years. With the economy ready to pull the brakes, there's fear that Intel could face pressure from all sides. Sluggish PC demand and decaying dominance could pave the way for considerable margin compression.
Undoubtedly, supply-side challenges could evolve into an inventory glut. Though the near-term future looks bleak, Intel is confident it can close the gap with its CPU rivals. The company is spending considerable sums to create a foundation that it hopes can help it regain some of its market share.
In August, Intel co-invested in an Arizona-based manufacturing facility that should help the firm fuel its ""IDM 2.0"" strategy. CEO Pat Gelsinger is confident that the strategy can help Intel turn the tides back in its favor. The market is mostly skeptical, and I think they're right to be.
At 5.8x trailing earnings and 1.6x sales, Intel is a deep-value stock that could offer huge rewards if Intel can make significant strides in 2023. The huge 5.6% dividend yield makes it tempting to bet on the chip underdog.
What is the Price Target for INTC Stock?
Intel shares have been slapped with a lot of downgrades lately. Overall, Wall Street is staying cautious here, with a ""Hold"" rating. The average INTC stock price target of $35.17 implies a rich return of 30.4% over the year ahead.
Conclusion: NVDA Seems Like a Better Pick
Wall Street seems to think it's better to go with the frontrunner in Nvidia rather than the underdog in Intel. I'm inclined to agree. Given the pace of innovation, it's very hard to play from behind in semiconductors.

2022-10-21 00:00:00+00:00,"Unusual Options Activity in Tesla, Intel and More",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/unusual-options-activity-in-tesla-intel-and-more-0,,,"Unusual options activity is ignored by many investors, but for some, it plays a key role in their trading strategies and approach. 
When big institutions make their move in the options market, they can’t hide the trade once the volume shows up and the open interest is logged. Thankfully, there’s a leaderboard of options activity for both calls and puts, helping us keep track of it all when we see outsized volume. 
After Tesla delivered a mixed earnings report earlier this week, some unusual options flow started to show up, so let’s start with that name first. 
Tesla (TSLA)
One Tesla (US:TSLA) trade that really stood out to me was the February 2023 calls, which was sold-to-open all throughout Thursday Oct. 20th, the first trading session after Tesla reported on Wednesday evening. 
The first trade occurred shortly after noon ET when the trader sold $1.1 million worth of the calls. Then less than two hours later, the trader popped off two more sales in the same calls, selling $1.025 million and $902,000 in premium. Finally, with five minutes left in the session, the trader sold $637,000 worth of premium. 
Out-the-money call sales are generally bearish and that’s what these appeared to be as well, unless it is accompanied by a lower-strike call purchase (making it a bull-call spread). However, I have not seen any significant lower-strike purchases to make it such a spread, although they could be “hidden” in a different expiration date. 
On the put side, millions of dollars in bearish premium has been opened with 0 to 8 days until expiration. 
However, the one trade that stood out to me was the $1.386 million in bullish premium one trader sold for the February 2023 $200 puts. These are slightly out-the-money puts, but close to at-the-money. Meaning this trader is looking for a bottom in Tesla stock, at least for the next few months.
Intel (INTC)
Someone is expecting a huge move higher in Intel (US:INTC) -- and they expect it soon. 
These traders scooped up tens of millions of dollars in the $23.50 calls expiring next week on Oct. 28th. All of these trades occurred around the same time, but included $8.6 million, $9.4 million and $1.02 million in premium, along with plenty of others that were in the six-figure range. 
Twitter (TWTR)
Just like last week, Twitter (US:TWTR) again makes the list. That’s as investors keep speculating on the Elon Musk buyout for Twitter.
The trade that stands out was in the $38 calls expiring in two weeks on Nov. 14th, as one trader paid roughly $9 million in premium for the position. 
That’s a big price for what is essentially a binary event, especially an in-the-money position that expires in just two weeks. Remember, these are about $12 in the money already. 
Barrick Gold (GOLD)
Gold is a favorite talking point for many investors and Barrick Gold (US:GOLD) gets a fair amount of discussion as a top miner in the space. 
Someone is putting their money where their mouth is with this long-term bet. This trader paid $2.9 million in premium for the $17 strikes expiring in January 2024, or in more than 450 days. 
Lockheed Martin (LMT)
Last but not least, we have Lockheed Martin (US:LMT). This stock is not known for big options trades, but one jumped out after a trader dropped $2.2 million in premium for the March 2023 $465 calls. 
These calls were about $25 out-the-money at the time of the trade, but are now just $10 out-the-money. The trader has plenty of time on their side if this trade cooperates and LMT pushes higher.

2022-10-21 00:00:00+00:00,Why Shares of ASML Holding Popped This Week,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-shares-of-asml-holding-popped-this-week,,,"What happened
Shares of ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) popped as much as 18.4% this week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The semiconductor equipment company posted a strong earnings report and dismissed any concerns over the U.S. government's new export bans to China. As of the close on Thursday, Oct. 20, shares of ASML are up 15.3% this week.
So what
On Wednesday of this week, ASML released its earnings for the three months ending in September. Revenue was 5.78 billion euros for the period, up from 5.4 billion a year ago, and beat analyst expectations of 5.41 billion euros. Net income was 1.7 billion euros, which also beat analyst forecasts of 1.42 billion for the quarter. These two numbers are the key reason ASML stock jumped after the report, as investors were too pessimistic about the company's prospects this quarter.
Besides these impressive financials, ASML's management gave commentary about the U.S. government's recent export controls on semiconductor equipment to China. ASML will be affected by these new rules, with the company telling all its U.S. personnel to leave the country immediately after the order was announced.
Investors decided to sell off ASML stock in response to this new rule, bringing shares down over 10% last week. However, during this report, ASML's management said that these new export controls would have a limited impact on its 2023 equipment sales -- a nice surprise.
See, ASML makes the most advanced semiconductor equipment machines in the world and has moved the industry further along the cutting edge for data centers and products like smartphones. The U.S. government doesn't want ASML to sell these advanced machines to China for geopolitical purposes, which many investors thought would hurt ASML's sales. However, the company must have enough demand from customers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel, and Samsung to find orders for its current production capacity.
Now what
Even though it is one of the most important companies geopolitically, the investing thesis with ASML is quite simple. The company has a monopoly on the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, meaning that manufacturers have nowhere else to buy if they want to make the most advanced computer chips. This gives ASML consistent demand, zero competition, and pricing power for its products. That is an easy recipe for steady financial growth, which the company has put up over the last decade.
As long as the world still wants advanced computer chips, ASML's business should be fine, regardless of what happens with China.

2022-10-20 00:00:00+00:00,"Despite the Correction, Should You Bet on Semiconductor Stocks?",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/despite-the-correction-should-you-bet-on-semiconductor-stocks,,,"Semiconductor stocks have underperformed so far this year. For instance, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) are down about 60%, 59%, 48%, and 54%, respectively, year-to-date. Despite this significant correction, these stocks could stay under pressure due to multiple headwinds, including the slowdown in demand and the U.S. government’s new regulations for exports to China.
Recently, Lam Research delivered better-than-expected September quarter results. Its revenues of $5.07 billion came ahead of the Street’s expectations of $4.9 billion. Further, its adjusted EPS of $10.42 surpassed analysts’ estimates of $9.57.
While its top and bottom lines exceeded estimates, Lam Research expects the new U.S. export restrictions to negatively impact its financials by $2-$2.5 billion in the calendar year 2023. Earlier, Nvidia stated that it could lose $400 million in sales due to the new restrictions. 
Providing his outlook on the semiconductor sector, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland said, “We downgraded the Semiconductor sector in April ’21 based on a combination of high valuation multiples and “over-ordering,” and while multiples have indeed corrected, we still wait for excess inventory to work through the system (PC/Handset/Consumer working now; Industrial/Auto/Broad-based still yet to come).” 
While Rolland doesn’t see a valuation risk, inventory and growing macro headwinds remain a concern. 
Bottom Line 
While semiconductor stocks remain pressured, let’s see how they stack up on TipRanks’ valuable datasets. With the help of TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, here is a summary of how these stocks compare.
TipRanks’ data shows that Wall Street is cautiously optimistic about the prospects of AMD, NVDA, and LRCX stocks. These companies sport a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TipRanks. However, analysts remain sidelined on Intel stock, which has a Hold consensus rating. 
Further, AMD, NVDA, and INTC stocks have a Neutral Smart Score on TipRanks, and their stocks are likely to perform in line with the broader market. On the contrary, Lam Research stock has an Outperform Smart Score of nine out of 10, while analysts’ average price target of $498.65 implies 51.1% upside potential.

2022-10-20 00:00:00+00:00,"After Rough Month, Intel Stock Set For Come Back?",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/after-rough-month-intel-stock-set-for-come-back,,,"Intel stock (NASDAQ: INTC) is down almost 10% in the past month (twenty-one trading days), performing worse than the S&P 500, which was down 4.9% over this period. However, if you look at the change over the last five days, there has been some bounce back and the stock has performed better against the broader markets, rising 4.8%. Intel’s most recent Q2 ’22 earnings, saw revenue dropping from $19.6 billion in Q2 ’21 to $15.3 billion in Q2 ’22. Additionally, COGS and other operating expenses in fact rose, and EBIT margin shrank from 28.3% to -4.5% over this period. Due to this, net income dropped and EPS came in lower at -$0.11 in Q2 ’22, against $1.25 in Q2 ’21.

2022-10-20 00:00:00+00:00,Earnings Preview: Intel (INTC) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-intel-intc-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline,,,"The market expects Intel (INTC) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.
The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings call it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world's largest chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -80.1%.
Revenues are expected to be $15.49 billion, down 19.3% from the year-ago quarter.
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.33% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Intel?
For Intel, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.21%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.
So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Intel will beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?
While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Intel would post earnings of $0.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.29, delivering a surprise of -57.97%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
Intel doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.
An Industry Player's Expected Results
Another stock from the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, Texas Instruments (TXN), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.37 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +14.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.1 billion, up 9.9% from the year-ago quarter.
Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Texas Instruments has been revised 0.8% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.90%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.
When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Texas Instruments will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.
