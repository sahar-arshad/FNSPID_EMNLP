Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Qualcomm will supply so-called system-on-chips (SoCs) for Cariad's platform that aims to enable automated driving up to Level 4 standards, in which the car can handle all aspects of driving in most circumstances with no human intervention.
No financial details were disclosed.
""We will get system-on-chips (SoCs) designed to enable assisted and automated driving functions up to Level 4 from Qualcomm, an expert in chip design with over 140,000 patents,"" Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess said on LinkedIn.
""The chips of Qualcomm's Snapdragon Ride portfolio will be used in all Group vehicles with the unified Cariad Software generation starting in the middle of the decade,"" Diess added.
Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, would also expand its existing partnership with Intel Corp's INTC.O MobilEye and was already in talks to do so, he said.
Diess took over responsibility for Cariad on the carmaker's management board after a tussle with labour representatives, calling it ""the most ambitious project of our entire industry to tap into the most relevant profit pools of the future"".
Responding to reports about delays at Cariad, Diess said it would take two lifecycles to realise the project: ""So I would like to say to the critics within the group: it is better to work together on progress than just to complain.""

Benjamin Graham Stock Ideas
About Benjamin Graham: The late Benjamin Graham may be the oldest of the gurus we follow, but his impact on the investing world has lasted for decades after his death in 1976. Known as both the ""Father of Value Investing"" and the founder of the entire field of security analysis, Graham mentored several of history's greatest investors -- including Warren Buffett -- and inspired a slew of others, including John Templeton, Mario Gabelli, and another of Validea's gurus, John Neff. Graham built his fortune and reputation after living through some extremely difficult times, including both the Great Depression and his own family's financial woes following his father's death when Benjamin was a young man. His investment firm posted per annum returns of about 20 percent from 1936 to 1956, far outpacing the 12.2 percent average return for the market during that time.

This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 3.27% for Intel Corp, 1.93% for Norfolk Southern Corp, and 0.78% for Columbus McKinnon Corp..

Rising interest rates have hurt the investment case for AMD (AMD) stock
Technology will continue to cut costs and erode inflation
Investors with a three-year time horizon can get a bargain price on AMD now
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has fallen hard in 2022, thanks to rising interest rates and inflation.
Shares that cost $145 each at the start of 2022 opened May 2 at $85. When you can get 3% interest on a government bond, or 5% on a mortgage bond, why buy earnings that don’t generate dividends?
I was caught offside myself, “buying the dip” at $100 and missing lower prices. AMD is still up 4% from a year ago, but that price may also be taken out as the bear market continues.
What’s important to know is that there is nothing wrong with the company or its investment thesis. That doesn’t mean it can’t go down after earnings. It can. But analysts are expecting earnings of 90 cents/share after trading ends May 3, on revenue of $5.5 billion. Keep that up for a year and it’s a price to earnings ratio of 24.
What are you waiting for?
AMD Advanced Micro Devices $85.83
Chip Shortages
The big question around AMD stock isn’t about the last quarter earnings.  It’s about when the current chip shortage may end, imperiling future earnings.
7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy for a Robust Retirement
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) sees it stretching into 2024. That may be a political statement. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger wants the CHIPS Act passed, with sweet, sweet stimulus cash that will let the company ramp up production.
A Truist (NYSE:TFC) analyst is already seeing slowing demand, cutting price targets on AMD and other chip makers.
AMD CEO Lisa Su believes shortages should ease later this year. But it’s important to note what we’re talking about. Supply and demand coming into balance is not a bad thing, either for AMD or the economy. She describes that as things are getting “a little bit better.”
Chips aren’t oil. When oil supply catches up with demand, prices can drop fast, because demand is very inflexible. With semiconductors, demand is far more flexible. Rising supplies mean new designs based on cheaper chips can go into production.
The Next Acts
AMD is beating Intel in microprocessors for PCs and cloud data centers. It’s behind Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in graphics processors for game machines and artificial intelligence applications.
That’s the conventional wisdom. But gamers who’ve looked at the next generation of chips think AMD is narrowing the gap on Nvidia and could even overtake it in gaming.
The other hot new market for AMD is the cloud. There, its acquisition of Pensando, a distributed network platform, is meaningful. As Louis Navellier and his team wrote recently, AMD’s data center sales doubled last year, and the data center market should reach $288 billion in 2027. AMD’s total revenue last year was about $16.4 billion.
Then there’s what I’ve called the Machine Internet. This involves chips that include software and are embedded in just about everything. We talk about cars, but we should also talk about factories, about traffic systems, and about buildings and health devices.
These chips will respond automatically to sensor data, alerting factories when machines go down, or changing traffic light timing when traffic builds. They need to be pre-programmed. That’s where AMD’s acquisition of Xilinx comes in. Xilinx sold chips that included the software needed to run sensor-based applications. That technology can now be embedded in AMD silicon.
The Bottom Line
The end of the chip shortage heralds a new era, where semiconductor chips aren’t just in devices you hold in your hand, or load into cloud data centers. They herald an era where the intelligence of software can be all around us.
AMD is ready to lead that era. That’s why I bought the stock in the first place. The applications, and their resulting demand, aren’t being seen by analysts yet. But give it time. If you believe in the future, you can believe in AMD.

 The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Intel Corp. (INTC), and Citigroup Inc. (C). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
 
You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>
 Apple shares have gained +19.1% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry’s gain of +20.0%. The Zacks analyst believes that the company is benefiting from continued momentum in the Services and robust performance from iPhone, Mac, Wearables and an expanding App Store ecosystem. Availability of new Mac Studio and new iPad Air is expected to drive top-line growth. Apple TV+ is gaining recognition due to award winning shows. This bodes well for the Services segment. Services revenue growth is expected to be in strong.
  However, COVID-induced supply chain disruptions and industry-wide silicon shortages will probably hurt the top line by $4-$8 billion. Unfavorable forex is also expected to hurt revenues. Absence of Russian revenues will hurt the top line.

 Intel shares have declined -13.8% over the year to date basis against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry’s decline of -25.5%. The Zacks analyst believes that Client Computing Group is expected to suffer due to component shortage. Production delays pertaining to 7 nm ramp up remain a concern. A strained Sino-U.S. trade relationship, imposition of fresh lockdown restrictions in some markets, forex woes and high debt burden remain other concerns.
 However, the company expects demand to pick up in the second half of the year. Intel is riding on prospects of the Internet of Things and Mobileye businesses. Recovery in the enterprise business of the data center segment is a positive. Mobileye growth should be driven by design wins amid recovering automotive industry.
 (You can read the full research report on Intel here >>>)
  Citigroup shares have declined -18.5% over the year to date basis against the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry’s decline of -17.9%. The company’s high expenses on transformation investments might limit bottom-line growth. The elimination of overdraft fees will hinder fee income growth in the near term.
 However, rise in deposit balances and book value per share were positives, low capital market activity ailed first-quarter results. Advancing with its strategy to exit the consumer banking business in 14 international markets, Citigroup has signed nine deals to sell such businesses to simplify operations and focus on institutional franchises. Net interest income growth and decent liquidity are positives.

2022-04-29 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Is Falling Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-is-falling-today,,,"What happened
Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were sliding today on no company-specific news. Instead, investors are likely processing comments about supply chain issues in the chip market that Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) management mentioned on the company's conference call yesterday.
The tech stock was down by 1.9% as of 11:42 a.m. ET.
So what
Intel beat Wall Street's expectations for both the top- and bottom-line estimates in the first quarter, but the company's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, highlighted some persistent problems in the semiconductor space that Nvidia investors latched on to.
Image source: Getty Images.
First, Gelsinger said that ""component supply constraints continue to be a challenge with the most recent COVID lockdowns in Shanghai further increasing supply chain risk and contributing to inflationary pressures that are having a negative impact"" on the company's PC total addressable market.
China has implemented a strict zero-COVID policy that has resulted in cities being shut down when coronavirus cases pop up, which has slowed down some chip production for companies.
Adding to Nvidia investors' concerns is the fact that Gelsinger expects more pain ahead.
""The chip shortage cost the U.S. economy $240 billion last year and we expect the industry will continue to see challenges until at least 2024 in areas like foundry capacity and tool availability,"" he said on Intel's latestearnings call
Now what
Nvidia investors clearly weren't happy to see these comments about the chip market today, and they come as the tech company's share price has already tumbled 22% over the past six months.
Nvidia's shareholders will get a better picture of how the company is doing when Nvidia reports its first-quarter results on May 25. But with the semiconductor market currently experiencing supply chain issues and Nvidia's peers seeing ongoing issues in this space, Nvidia investors may want to prepare for some more share price swings ahead.

2022-04-29 00:00:00+00:00,FOCUS-Proposed China investment curb by U.S. sparks debate among chipmakers,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/focus-proposed-china-investment-curb-by-u.s.-sparks-debate-among-chipmakers,,,"By Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Reuters) - Chipmakers are divided over how aggressively to oppose a legislative proposal that would give the U.S. government sweeping new powers to block billions in U.S. investment into China, according to documents seen by Reuters.
The measure is part of the House version of a bill that would also grant $52 billion to chipmakers to expand operations, a boon to the industry that has made some companies loath to forcefully oppose the package's China investment controls.
But the ""outbound investment"" proposal could hamper those companies' investments abroad, leading some chipmakers to advocate for aggressive opposition to its inclusion in the chips bill being hammered out by Senate and House lawmakers.
""It would look hypocritical for companies to be begging for money, but refusing to allow government to have a say on whether they build new fabs in China,"" said one executive at a chipmaking firm.
Another industry executive disagreed, noting that chipmakers could both support the funding and oppose the curb. ""We can walk and chew gum at the same time,"" he said.
The funding puts the industry in the tricky position of aggressively seeking the grants but facing headwinds to their foreign direct investments in Chinese factories and financial backing of Chinese startups should the bill pass with the controversial measure.
At a White House event in January to announce plans to build a $20 billion chip plant in Ohio, IntelCorp INTC.O Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said without government funding ""we're still going to start the Ohio site. It's just not going to happen as fast and it's not going to grow as big as quickly.""
The company was also seeking to expand production at a plant in Chengdu, China, but the Biden administration spurned the plan, Bloomberg reported in November. Intel declined to comment.
The outbound investment measure was originally proposed as a standalone bill by Republican Senators John Cornyn and Senator Bob Casey, but was later added to the House version of a massive bill that includes the grants for chipmakers and is aimed at countering China's rise. A third source noted it was important not to antagonize Cornyn, a strong supporter of the chip funding.
Reuters obtained an email from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), which has been mum on the provision, to its members last week seeking comment on a statement of principles describing the measure as ""too broad,"" and urging a separate legislative process for it.
""SIA encourages the development of policies that do not unnecessarily hinder non-sensitive, legitimate investment and related commercial activity,"" the group wrote in the third version of the draft statement of principles, dated April 22 and toned down from a prior version.
""Prior to advancing outbound investment review policies, SIA encourages Congress to initiate a review process consisting of formal hearings, stakeholder engagement, and committee consideration.""
SIA declined to comment.
The concept behind the measure has support within the Biden administration. U.S. President Joe Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in July the government was working on new investment screening and considering outbound investment as it seeks to better position the United States for competition in technology.
However, Politico reported that the Treasury Department was working to weaken momentum in Congress for the measure, pushing lawmakers to approve a modest fact-finding pilot program instead of new regulatory powers.
Business groups including the Chamber of Commerce have already voiced strong opposition to the legislative proposal, which would require the U.S. Trade Representative to form a committee to evaluate the transactions and recommend to the president which ones pose a national security risk and should be blocked.
A study by Rhodium said 43% of U.S. foreign direct investment transactions in China over the past two decades could have been subject to screening under the broad categories set out by the proposal.
The National Foreign Trade Council, whose members include Amazon, Facebook, Exxon and Chevron, has also circulated a draft letter to other D.C. lobbying groups expressing ""strong opposition"" the measure, and describing the creation of a new regulator as ""unwarranted.""
""Creating a new interagency process will compound regulatory inefficiency and invite protectionism under the flag of national security,"" the letter, obtained by Reuters and directed to House and Senate leaders of both parties, states.
The group declined to comment.

2022-04-29 00:00:00+00:00,"AMD Well-Positioned to Continue Taking Market Share, Says Raymond James",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-well-positioned-to-continue-taking-market-share-says-raymond-james,,,"One of the most prominent trends on Wall Street in 2022 has been to lower expectations. The current uncertain macro environment demands caution what with rising inflation, anticipated interest rate hikes and Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
The market has certainly shown it is weary of the developing narrative; the pullbacks have been brutal with many previous high-flyers crashing badly.
So, time to counter all this bearish sentiment and back those which have the wherewithal to withstand the current macro trends. And looking at the case of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Raymond James’ Chris Caso thinks the company fits the bill.
“As we have become more concerned about cycle risks given potential for slowing consumer demand and elevated inventory levels at customers, we favor those semi companies with strong secular drivers, more muted cyclical exposure and attractive valuations, for which AMD appears well positioned,” the 5-star explained.
Much of Caso’s bullish outlook for AMD is based on its better positioning compared to rival Intel (INTC). Given AMD’s move to the N5 TSMC node, when the next-generation EPYC server CPU Genoa hits the market in 4Q22, Caso believes the technology gap between the two companies will “widen further.”
Both chip giants already have clearly defined roadmaps and Caso thinks time is on AMD’s side. This is because Intel’s roadmap is not expected to show “parity” with AMD’s before the end of 2024. As such, Caso believes “continued share gains for AMD in datacenter are likely inevitable.” Furthermore, given the current tight supply conditions, Caso thinks clients are likely to commit to AMD to “ensure supply.”
Over time, Caso also believes the PC market will turn into a “sustained duopoly.” Even if Intel does execute its process roadmap “flawlessly,” – which Caso believes is in no way guaranteed – and by 2024/25 manages to get near to AMD’s transistor performance, the analyst still doesn’t think Intel will be able to “maintain” its presently dominant share of the market in client and server.
With all this as backdrop, Caso rates AMD shares a Strong Buy along with a $160 price target. This figure makes room for 12-month share gains of an 87%. (To watch Caso’s track record, click here)
What does the rest of the Street think lies in store for the chipmaker? Based on 13 Buy vs. 8 Holds, the analysts’ view is that AMD stock is a Moderate Buy. The forecast calls for one-year returns of 68%, considering the average price target clocks in at $143.94. (See AMD stock forecast on TipRanks)

2022-04-29 00:00:00+00:00,Why Intel Stock Is Slumping Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-stock-is-slumping-today,,,"What happened
Shares of semiconductor maker Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) were falling this morning after the company reported its first-quarter results. Although Intel beat analysts' consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings, investors were disappointed with its second-quarter guidance.
The tech stock was down by 6% as of 10:59 a.m. ET.
So what
Intel's non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 easily beat Wall Street's consensus estimate of $0.80 per share. While the company exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectation, its non-GAAP earnings were actually down 35% from the year-ago quarter.
Image source: Getty Images.
In addition to beating analysts' bottom-line estimate, Intel's revenue of $18.4 billion -- down 7% from the year-ago quarter -- also outpaced the consensus estimate of $18.3 billion.
Intel CFO David Zinsner said in a press release that ""Intel delivered strong first-quarter financial results, and we are reaffirming our full-year revenue guidance.""
But while the company reaffirmed its full-year sales guidance, it issued guidance for the second quarter that was below Wall Street's expectations. Intel's management said that non-GAAP earnings per share will be $0.70 in the second quarter, below the consensus average of $0.83.
Additionally, Intel said its revenue will be $18 billion in the second quarter, lower than Wall Street's expectation of $18.3 billion for the period.
Now what
It's not all that surprising that investors are a bit disappointed with Intel's results today. Beating top- and bottom-line estimates is great, but the company's earnings and revenue both declined from the year-ago quarter, and guidance for the second quarter was below expectations.
Additionally, management's comments about the chip industry didn't exactly boost investor confidence. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on the company's earnings call, ""The chip shortage costs the U.S. economy $240 billion last year and we expect the industry will continue to see challenges until at least 2024 in areas like foundry capacity and tool availability.""
While Gelsinger added that Intel is in a good position to handle the challenges, investors don't appear to be as optimistic.

Sell in May and Go Away? Not So Fast.
What can investors expect going forward? Next week brings the start of a new month – as well as renewed focus on the old ""Sell in May and Go Away"" adage, familiar to many because of the tendency for stock returns to historically underperform in the six months between May and October. Here at Kiplinger, we believe investors are better off just sticking around. 
That certainly doesn't mean that we think stocks have the all-clear to head higher in May. There are numerous worries – inflation and rate hikes, for example – that will likely continue to impact markets.

The company reaffirmed its earlier guidance despite short-term headwinds. It expects demand to pick up in the second half of the year.
Quarter Details
The company reported GAAP net income of $8,113 million or $1.98 per share in first-quarter 2022 compared with $3,361 million or 82 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The significant improvement, despite top-line contraction, was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses and gain on equity investments. Non-GAAP earnings in the reported quarter were $3,586 million or 87 cents per share compared with $5,489 million or $1.34 per share a year ago. Despite the year-over-year decline, non-GAAP earnings exceeded both the company guidance and the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents each.

GAAP revenues were $18,353 million, down 6.7% year over year, owing to softness in end consumer and educational market demand. In addition, the company witnessed lower sales from Russia and Belarus as it stopped shipping in these countries due to U.S. sanctions. Non-GAAP revenues totaled $18,353 million compared with $18,566 million in the year-earlier quarter. The top line surpassed the consensus estimate of $18,320 million.

Intel has reorganized its business segments to better reflect the growth in both large traditional markets and high-growth emerging markets for increased transparency, focus and accountability.

Client Computing Group (CCG, 50.6% of total revenues) revenues were down 13% year over year to $9,294 million. Lower notebook volumes due to component shortage hurt top-line growth. In addition, lower revenues on ramp down of Apple CPU and modem business, lower demand from entry-level consumer and education market and OEM inventory burn affected segment sales.

Datacenter and AI Group (DCAI, 32.9%) revenues increased 22% year over year to $6,034 million, driven by the strength of Xeon processors from hyperscale and enterprise customers. Network and Edge Group (NEX, 12.1%) revenues improved 23% to $2,213 million on solid cloud networking demand and edge computing.

Revenues from Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group (AXG, 1.2%) were up 21% to $219 million, buoyed by Alchemist and Super Compute product ramp ups, while that from Mobileye (2.1%) were up 5% to $394 million due to solid auto production. Intel Foundry Services (IFS, 1.5%) revenues improved 175% to $283 million, driven by increased tool deliveries and automotive revenues.
Other Operating Details
Non-GAAP gross margin was 53.1%, down 570 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP research and development and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased to $5.5 billion from $4.4 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin contracted 1200 bps year over year to 23.1%.

CCG operating income was down 34% year over year to $2,827 million, while DCAI operating income was down 1% to $1,686 million. NEX operating income improved to $366 million from $243 million, while Mobileye’s operating income declined to $148 million from $171 million a year ago.
Cash Flow & Liquidity
As of Apr 2, 2022, Intel had cash and cash equivalents of $6,215 million, with $32,788 million of long-term debt. The company generated $5,891 million of cash from operations in the quarter compared with $5,348 million in the prior year.
Outlook
For the second quarter of 2022, Intel expects non-GAAP revenues to be around $18 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin is likely to be 51%. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be 70 cents per share.

For 2022, the company reiterated its earlier guidance and expects non-GAAP revenues to be around $76 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin is likely to be 52%. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be $3.60 per share. Although the company expects softness in end consumer and educational market demand to continue in the second quarter, it expects demand to pick up in the second half of the year. In addition, lower sales from Russia and Belarus along with new lockdown restrictions in China are likely to affect the top line in the second quarter. However, the headwinds are expected to gradually wane as the year progresses.
Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider
Intel currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Sell) stocks here.

Nokia Corporation NOK, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a solid pick for investors in the industry. Earnings estimates for the current year for the stock have moved up 40% since April 2021.

Nokia pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 205.2%, on average and has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.4%. It has moved up 7.9% in the past year. Nokia is well-positioned for the ongoing technology cycle, given the strength of its end-to-end portfolio. The company’s deal win rate is encouraging, with notable successes in the key 5G markets of the United States and China.

Viasat, Inc. VSAT, carrying a Zacks Rank #2, is another key pick. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 129.9%, on average. The company attracts millions of U.S. consumers and enterprises with its high-quality broadband service.   

Viasat’s impressive bandwidth productivity sets it apart from conventional and lower-yield satellite providers that run on incumbent business models. Viasat has a competitive advantage in bandwidth economics, global coverage, flexibility and bandwidth allocation, making it believe that mobile broadband will act as a profit churner.

KVH Industries, Inc. KVHI, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, delivered an earnings surprise of 20%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.

Despite global supply chain disruptions, KVH Industries is driving growth and margin expansion through new product introduction and subscriber migration to High-Throughput Satellites. The company aims to make decisive inroads into the still-nascent autonomous transportation markets with a strong balance sheet and zero debt. If KVH Industries manages to effectively mitigate supply chain woes, there could be room for cash flow expansion.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

You can find the video below, but here are some highlights.
For the first quarter, Intel reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.87, a decrease of 35% year over year, beating its own guidance by $0.07.
Revenue came in at $18.4 billion, down 1% year over year (YOY) and beating estimates by $0.1 billion.

The company also expects EPS to come in $0.10 higher than the previous outlook of $3.60.
The main reason it is so confident is that all the new products that will launch in the second half of the year will have much better performance features and also higher average selling prices.
Intel Foundry Services hit a $1 billion run rate for the first time.
The Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group (AXG) business is on track to generate over $1 billion in revenue. The first laptops with Intel Arc 3 GPUs are available now, with Intel Arc 5 and 7 to come later this year.

2022-04-29 00:00:00+00:00,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Apple, Amazon, Rivian and Intel",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-apple-amazon-rivian-and-intel,,,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – April 29, 2022 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Rivian RIVN and Intel INTC.
Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:
Markets Rally, Apple & Intel Beat: Amazon Posts Negative Earnings
Markets rallied back Thursday to make some of the big losses they've racked up over the past week of trading. The Dow grew +615 points or +1.85% on the day, while the S&P 500 performed even better: +2.47%. The Nasdaq added 382 points, +3.06% in regular trading, while the small-cap Russell 2000 headed up +1.77%. The Dow and S&P have lost -1.5% over the past five trading days; the Nasdaq is -2% over that time, the Russell more than -3%.
Even with negative Q1 GDP reported this morning — for the first time since the second quarter of the Covid pandemic — market participants managed to see some ""green shoots"" in Q1 earnings from companies among a wide swath of sectors. Jobless claims also stayed at generational lows, speaking to the innate strength in the economy even with a negative quarterly GDP print.
Apple put together a stellar fiscal Q2, especially considering the challenges faced by much of its top competition: earnings of $1.52 per share surpassed the $1.43 expected and the $1.40 per share reported a year ago. Revenues of $97.28 billion also easily outpaced estimates of $94.54 billion. Gross Margins came in at 43.7%, whereas expectations were for closer to 43%.
In a quarter deeply gouged by difficulties in China and productivity issues stemming from them, iPhone sales still came in ahead of the estimated 47.88 billion, to 50.57 billion. It's worth taking another look at this incredible figure: in aglobal marketrife with headwinds, Apple still sol more than 50 billion high-end products in the past three months. Services were relatively in-line and iPad missed by -2%, but iPhone's success continues to lead the Tech sector and pretty much every other measure one cares to use.
Shares are up +2% on the news, following a +4.5% gain during Thursday's regular session. Apple is still -10% year to date, but the company also raised its dividend 5% and issued a share buyback program. An aces quarter for Apple, all the way around.
Amazon initially dumped more than -10% on its Q1 report, putting up surprise negative earnings — -$7.56 per share versus +$8.73 expected; that's some surprise! — on revenues that also came in light of the Zacks consensus: $116.44 billion versus $117.02 billion expected. Revenue guidance was ratcheted down to a high end below current expectations.
The company cited a familiar list of quarterly headwinds: labor, logistics and supply chain costs, as well as a one-time -$7.6 billion write-down on its Rivian holdings. Even though Amazon raised its price for Prime subscriptions, that segment brought in less than anticipated, $8.4 billion. AWS grew +37% year over year — higher than expected. But E-commerce slightly underperformed, in North America and elsewhere.
Intel shares initially dipped on its latest beat on both top and bottom lines in its Q1 earnings report: 87 cents per share surged beyond expectations by 7 cents, on quarterly sales that narrowly surpassed the Zacks consensus to $1.835 billion. Both the PC market and Client Computing were a tad lower than expectations, but Intel has a tremendous earnings beat track record: it has posted no earnings misses since Q3 2014.

2022-04-29 00:00:00+00:00,Should You Sell AMD Stock This Earnings Season?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-sell-amd-stock-this-earnings-season,,,"With shares down 41% so far in 2022, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) investors will be hoping for a turnaround in the stock's fortunes when the company releases its first-quarter results on May 3.
AMD stock jumped nicely in February 2022 after the company reported better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of 2021. But it failed to sustain that momentum thanks to factors out of its control, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, surging inflation, and interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve that turned out to be a pain for richly valued tech stocks.
Let's see what could be in store for this semiconductor stock this earnings season.
AMD is expected to report terrific growth, once again
According to the guidance issued by AMD in February, the company expects revenue to increase 45% year over year to $5 billion due to growth across all its businesses. Additionally, AMD expects non-GAAP gross margin to land at 50.5% for the previous quarter, which would be a nice improvement over the prior-year period's figure of 46% and result in solid bottom-line gains.
Analysts, however, are expecting a much stronger performance from AMD. The company's average consensus revenue estimate for the first quarter stands at $5.5 billion, which would translate into a 60% increase over the prior-year period. Its adjusted earnings are expected to land at $0.91 per share, a 75% increase over last year.

So AMD has its task cut out for it going into its first-quarter report, thanks to the market's heightened expectations. Although, the company has topped Wall Street's estimates successfully in recent quarters, beating the earnings estimate handsomely and raising its guidance as well along the way. For instance, the company was originally anticipating its revenue to increase 37% in 2021 as compared to 2020 levels, but it finished the year with 68% top-line growth.
AMD's stronger-than-expected showing was driven by the robust demand for its processors, which are used in a variety of facilities and devices ranging from data centers to computers to gaming consoles. The company's February 2022 outlook indicates that it will continue to enjoy a favorable demand environment. But there may be a twist in the tale for AMD as a result of rival Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) resurgence, a potential weakness in demand for graphics cards, and supply chain challenges.
These headwinds pose a challenge to the stock's recovery
AMD's market share gains over Intel have played a critical role in driving the former's impressive growth of late. However, it appears that Chipzilla has started to take market share away from AMD in recent quarters following the launch of new processors.
According to a third-party estimate, AMD's share of the CPU (central processing unit) market dropped to 34.1% in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 36.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021. AMD was reportedly sitting on 39.4% of the CPU market in the first quarter of 2021, which indicates that it may have lost significant ground to Intel. The loss of CPU market share over the prior year can hurt AMD's growth and keep the company from meeting Wall Street's expectations.
Another headwind for AMD may arrive in the form of subpar console sales. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to Sony and Microsoft for their latest gaming consoles. The significant demand for the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X/S consoles has been a key growth driver for AMD, but that catalyst may weaken in the near term.
That's because Sony recently lowered its sales forecast for the PS5 for the recently concluded fiscal year that ended on March 31. Its prior estimate was 14.8 million units; the new estimate is 11.5 million units. The cut in Sony's forecast may have a negative bearing on AMD's sales and weigh on the chipmaker's ability to clock eye-popping year-over-year growth.
And finally, the falling prices of graphics cards don't paint a good picture of AMD's computing and graphics segment. Word on Wall Street suggests that the demand for graphics cards may be declining because of an oversupply. The sliding prices of cryptocurrencies and sanctions are reportedly affecting graphics card demand and leading to order cancellations, causing a glut of GPUs (graphics processing units) on the market.
An oversupply of graphics cards will affect AMD's sales, as the company controlled 19% of this market at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. In all, AMD heads into its first-quarter results with multiple headwinds that may create more pressure on the stock price. Weaker-than-expected results or tepid guidance could send the stock packing, but this could also create an opportunity for savvy investors to accumulate shares of AMD given its sunny long-term prospects.

2022-04-29 00:00:00+00:00,India to offer more incentives to lure companies in semiconductors push,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/india-to-offer-more-incentives-to-lure-companies-in-semiconductors-push,,,"By Munsif Vengattil and Akash Sriram
BENGALURU, April 29 (Reuters) - India on Friday said it will expand its incentives for those investing in semiconductor manufacturing, as its government woos global companies in a bid to become a key player in the global supply chain for chips.
A $10-billion incentive plan to attract semiconductor and display makers has drawn applications from companies such as a joint venture between Indian conglomerate Vedanta VDAN.NS and Taiwan's Foxconn 2317.TW, and Singapore's IGSS Ventures.
""After this first tranche gets utilised, we definitely will go for more,"" the country's IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said in an address at India's first semiconductor conference in the southern city of Bengaluru.
""We have appetite for more, we have need for more.""
The Indian semiconductor market, worth $15 billion in 2020, is estimated to reach $63 billion by 2026, the government says.
Even as more firms and countries seek to ensure access to the chips at the core of critical technologies such as 5G and those of the future, the world's chip market is dominated by manufacturers in Taiwan, the United States and few other countries.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the Bengaluru conference India wanted to emerge as a key player in global semiconductor supply chains, urging companies to consider setting up. The push is part of Modi's flagship ""Make in India"" project.
Part of the government's efforts to attract big ticket investments, the three-day meeting has drawn executives of tech giants Intel INTC.O, TSMC 2330.TW and Micron Technology Inc MU.O.
At the event, India's junior IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said the world's leading majors were ""actively engaged in exploring the India opportunity"".
In the race to become India's first chip maker, Vedanta is seeking incentives such as 1,000 acres (405 hectares) of free land, as part of its $20-billion foray into semiconductors and displays, Reuters reported on Thursday.

April 28 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O forecast second-quarter revenue below Wall Street expectations on Thursday on worries of demand weakness from its largest end market, PCs, and increased supply-chain uncertainty due to COVID-19 lockdowns in China.
Shares of the company fell 5% in after-market trading.
The company expects current-quarter revenue of about $18 billion compared with analysts' average estimate of $18.38 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Rising inflation, resurgence of COVID-19 in China and uncertainties around the war in Ukraine have shifted consumer spending away from gadgets, hurting Intel, which saw more than half of its revenue last year coming from the segment selling processors for PCs.
Analysts say the PC market is coming off from searing rates of growth over the last two years as remote working and learning triggered high demand during the pandemic.
As lockdowns in China continue, supply-chain bottlenecks are likely to hurt Intel's customers, in turn affecting the chipmaker's business.
Adjusted revenue for the first quarter was $18.4 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $18.31 billion.

Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) revenue forecast fell short of estimates as the company contends with inflationary pressures and supply issues.
The company recently acquired a non-chip business that should deliver value to shareholders.
Investors should keep INTC stock on their watch list and pounce where there’s more clarity on supply-and-demand issues.

Microprocessor manufacturer Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) second-quarter guidance showed the tech icon is not immune to the global issues plaguing most businesses. The company reported better-than-expected first-quarter adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share, while revenue of $18.4 billion came in slightly ahead of estimates.
However, INTC stock sold off in after-hours trading as its revenue guidance disappointed the Street. Management forecast revenue of $18 billion for the second quarter, versus an expected $18.3 billion, citing economic uncertainty and slowing PC demand.
Semiconductor stocks have been struggling in recent months despite chip sales reaching an astounding half a trillion dollars ($555.9 billion to be more precise) in 2021. The sector has been hit by concerns that the chip shortages may turn into a supply glut as demand slows, even prompting one Wall Street analyst to call chip stocks “almost uninvestable.”
Yet, Intel’s business doesn’t solely consist of semiconductor sales, and a recent acquisition will help to diversify Intel’s business model. Whether this will be enough to move the price of INTC stock higher remains to be seen.
This probably isn’t the ideal time to take a position in INTC stock, but it should be buyable at some point in the future.

Intel Looks to Diversify Amid Chip Challenges
It’s surprising how little coverage Intel’s latest acquisition received. In late March, Intel announced it will purchase Granulate Cloud Solutions Ltd. This Israeli company develops real-time continuous optimization software.
According to the press release, Granulate’s autonomous optimization service reduces CPU utilization and application latencies “by learning the customer’s application and deploying a customized set of continuous optimizations at runtime.” Consequently, users can improve application performance, as well as drive down cloud and data center costs. According to Granulate co-founder and CEO Asaf Ezra, Granulate and Intel “can help customers achieve meaningful cost reductions and five times the throughput across workloads.”
This acquisition should certainly stand Intel in good stead as a more diversified business at a time when the chip industry is under pressure.
Analysts have been cautious to downright bearish on chip stocks. Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse went as far as saying, “From an investment perspective, semiconductor stocks are almost uninvestable today.”
Muse said the short-term outlook for the sector is cloudy at best, noting investors are waiting for reduced forecasts as management teams begin to see supply overtaking demand. “Investors want to buy the ‘cut,’ but that ‘cut’ may not happen until 2H22 at the earliest,” he posited.
Until the dust settles and we get more clarity, Muse recommends investors sit on the sidelines: “Our sense is violent swings will be the new norm (both up and down) until we gain line of sight to whether we will see a soft or hard landing.”
The Bottom Line on INTC Stock
If anyone is under the impression that all technology stocks are overvalued, think again. Intel’s trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is below 10, suggesting shares are a good value.
Intel also offers a forward annual dividend yield of 3.2%, which is decent for a technology company. Furthermore, buying INTC stock means owning a piece of a world-renowned tech giant that continues to innovate and diversify its business.
Unfortunately, the big picture is murky as macroeconomic and supply issues persist. Therefore, it’s wise to take a wait-and-see approach with Intel.

2022-04-28 00:00:00+00:00,"Markets Rally: Apple, Intel Beat; Amazon Posts Negative Earnings",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/markets-rally%3A-apple-intel-beat-amazon-posts-negative-earnings,,,"Markets rallied back Thursday to make some of the big losses they’ve racked up over the past week of trading. The Dow grew +615 points or +1.85% on the day, while the S&P 500 performed even better: +2.47%. The Nasdaq added 382 points, +3.06% in regular trading, while the small-cap Russell 2000 headed up +1.77%. The Dow and S&P have lost -1.5% over the past five trading days; the Nasdaq is -2% over that time, the Russell more than -3%.

Even with negative Q1 GDP reported this morning — for the first time since the second quarter of the Covid pandemic — market participants managed to see some “green shoots” in Q1 earnings from companies among a wide swath of sectors. Jobless claims also stayed at generational lows, speaking to the innate strength in the economy even with a negative quarterly GDP print.

Apple AAPL put together a stellar fiscal Q2, especially considering the challenges faced by much of its top competition: earnings of $1.52 per share surpassed the $1.43 expected and the $1.40 per share reported a year ago. Revenues of $97.28 billion also easily outpaced estimates of $94.54 billion. Gross Margins came in at 43.7%, whereas expectations were for closer to 43%.

In a quarter deeply gouged by difficulties in China and productivity issues stemming from them, iPhone sales still came in ahead of the estimated 47.88 billion, to 50.57 billion. It’s worth taking another look at this incredible figure: in aglobal marketrife with headwinds, Apple still sol more than 50 billion high-end products in the past three months. Services were relatively in-line and iPad missed by -2%, but iPhone’s success continues to lead the Tech sector and pretty much every other measure one cares to use.

Shares are up +2% on the news, following a +4.5% gain during Thursday’s regular session. Apple is still -10% year to date, but the company also raised its dividend 5% and issued a share buyback program. An aces quarter for Apple, all the way around.

Amazon AMZN initially dumped more than -10% on its Q1 report, putting up surprise negative earnings — -$7.56 per share versus +$8.73 expected; that’s some surprise! — on revenues that also came in light of the Zacks consensus: $116.44 billion versus $117.02 billion expected. Revenue guidance was ratcheted down to a high end below current expectations.

The company cited a familiar list of quarterly headwinds: labor, logistics and supply chain costs, as well as a one-time -$7.6 billion write-down on its Rivian RIVN holdings. Even though Amazon raised its price for Prime subscriptions, that segment brought in less than anticipated, $8.4 billion. AWS grew +37% year over year — higher than expected. But E-commerce slightly underperformed, in North America and elsewhere.

Intel INTC shares initially dipped on its latest beat on both top and bottom lines in its Q1 earnings report: 87 cents per share surged beyond expectations by 7 cents, on quarterly sales that narrowly surpassed the Zacks consensus to $1.835 billion. Both the PC market and Client Computing were a tad lower than expectations, but Intel has a tremendous earnings beat track record: it has posted no earnings misses since Q3 2014.
