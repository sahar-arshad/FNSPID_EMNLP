2022-11-28 00:00:00+00:00,7 Growth Stocks to Take Seriously in 2023,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-growth-stocks-to-take-seriously-in-2023,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Optimists would say that 2023 will indeed be better than 2022. While 2022 has been an exceptionally difficult year for growth stocks, tech stocks, and  stock markets in general, there are signs that 2023 could mark a positive turning point. And that would set the stage for the reemergence of growth stocks that have fallen by the wayside in 2022. Moreover, the decidedly rosy economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expect a soft landing in 2023. Given these points, I think it’s a good time for investors to consider my seven growth stock picks for 2023. Here they are. 
ZS Zscaler $136
LAC Lithium Americas $23.55
NET Cloudflare $45.50
MRVL Marvell Technology $42.45
CRM Salesforce $153
MSFT Microsoft $241.50
LI Li Auto $17.10
Zscaler (ZS)

Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) is a cloud-based security platform and firm. Despite the company’s strong growth, its shares have declined alongside the other stocks in its sector. ZS shares traded at $300 to begin 2022 and have fallen all the way to $136 currently. 
That said, Zscaler’s trajectory and that of its sector make it worth taking seriously in 2023 because any easing of economic conditions will seriously help them. The value of the cloud-based security market is expected to exceed $97.3 billion by the end of this decade. That equates to an average compound annual growth rate of 21.4% throughout the period. 
Zscaler is growing even faster, as the firm’s revenues increased 62% during its fiscal  2022, reaching $1.091 billion. In fiscal Q4, ZS recorded $318.1 million of sales, and it anticipated between $339 million to $341 million of revenues for its last quarter which ended in October. In short, growth is not a problem for Zscaler. 
The issue is that Zscaler lost $97.7 million in Q4. That won’t be as much of a concern, however, once the Fed reaches its target interest rate or the signs of economic distress ease. 
Lithium Americas Company (LAC)

There are many reasons to believe that 2023 could be a great year for Lithium Americas Company (NYSE:LAC) and its stock. In essence, it’s a question of where the company is currently and where it’s going. 
Right now, Lithium Americas Company is on the precipice of becoming a major player in a major industry. It controls lithium mining operations in Argentina and the U.S., and its mines are very close to producing lithium. 
LAC lost $40.9 million in the quarter that ended on Sept. 30. But it is well funded with $392 million in cash and a $75 million line of credit. 
And luckily, it sits at the precipice of beginning operations. Further, the company is going to separate its Argentinian and American operations, making its shares very intriguing. The miner’s shareholders will retain shares in both businesses following the split. What’s really interesting, though, is that its Thacker Pass operations represent one of the most advanced lithium projects in the U.S. 
The U.S. government is bolstering domestic lithium production and recently invested significant funds in Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) and other large miners . Lithium Americas Company is likely to receive similar backing and will be an integral part of the EV supply chain moving forward.  
Cloudflare (NET)

Investors should consider web-based cloud security stock Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) based on the confidence the firm is exhibiting in these difficult times. A few months ago, in early August, the company reported that it broke even on an adjusted basis in Q2. That was a positive surprise, given that Wall Street analysts, on average, had been expecting a slight loss. The good news enabled the company to raise its full-year revenue guidance from between $955 million and $959 million to between $968 million and $972 million.  
In short, the strong demand for its products from enterprises  resulted in a better-than-expected quarter. 
The good news didn’t stop there, with Cloudflare increasing its revenue guidance when it delivered its Q3 earnings. The company currently expects its full-year revenue to range between $974 million and $975 million, representing an increase versus its previous guidance. 
The market for web-based cloud security is only getting stronger, and Cloudflare’s performance in this economy has been impressive. 
Marvell Technology (MRVL)

Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a chip maker that focuses on the data infrastructure, computing, and storage sectors. The company’s fundamentals and non-cyclical trends indicate that Marvell Technology will have a bright 2023. 
Marvell Technology turned a corner upon releasing its Q2 earnings back in late August. The firm reported net income of $4.3 million on revenue of $1.516 billion. That represented a drastic turnaround from the same period a year earlier when Marvell reported $1.076 billion of revenue and a $276.4 million net loss. 
Marvell’s customers include data centers,  enterprise networks, and  EV makers, among others. Data centers and enterprise networks accounted for $983 million of the firm’s more than $1.5 billion of revenue. 
The annual growth of the data center market is expected to remain above 10% through 2030, so Marvell’s top customers are well-positioned. Meanwhile, the spending on enterprise networks is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.3% through 2028.
Salesforce (CRM)

Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is the world’s favorite customer relationship management platform, serving more than 150,000 companies. CRM stock is heavily discounted currently, trading at $153 while analysts have an average price target of $211 on the name. 
That big difference makes it easy to see why investors should take it seriously moving into 2023. Salesforce’s growth prospects extend beyond the near term, though. While management has given revenue guidance as high as $31 billion for the current fiscal year, its future potential growth is substantial. Case in point: the company anticipates that its revenues will reach $50 billion by fiscal year 2026. 
So, if Salesforce hits the high end of its 2022  revenue guidance, its top line will have jumped 17. Basically, for Salesforce to reach the $50 billion revenue mark in three years, the company will have to replicate its 2022 growth through 2026. The company’s revenues have grown at an average of 16.6% over the past three years, so its FY26 target is definitely achievable. 
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com
 Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a very strong company, but it’s trading 20% below analysts’ average price target on MSFT stock. 
The company’s revenue increased 11% year-over-year last quarter, reaching $50.1 billion. And Microsoft’s  top line has increased at an average rate of 17.4% over the past three years. So despite its large size, it can clearly be considered a growth stock. 
That said, Microsoft has been hit by issues that are affecting businesses globally. As a result, its net income fell 14% YOY in the quarter, to $17.6 billion. 
Simply put, Microsoft has too much potential to ignore now and while it is a growth stock, it also, unlike most growth stocks, comes with a dividend. All told, MSFT has too many positive attributes to ignore. 
Li Auto (LI)
Source: Carrie Fereday / Shutterstock.com
Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is a Chinese EV firm that, although experiencing trouble, is an excellent growth stock to seriously consider. 
Li Auto reported 10,052 vehicle deliveries for October. That was was approximately in-line with Wall Street  analysts’ mean estimate. That said, the delivery figure was below the 11,531 vehicles that LI delivered in September, and sequential declines aren’t often welcome news. On the other hand, its deliveries jumped 31.4% year-over-year in October anyway. But China’s supply-chain constraints and Covid-19 lockdowns make apples-to-apples comparisons very difficult. 
Overall, Li Auto appears to be very strong, as it reported $1.27 billion of automobile sales in Q2. That represented a 73% YOY increase and is a strong indication of the opportunity provided by LI stock. 
At the same time, Li Auto reported a Q2 net loss of $95.7 million. Overall, however, I believe that LI stock, given Li’s strong growth and huge opportunities, can roughly double over the next year. And given its massive sales thus far, the shares will very likely generate strong returns for their owners over the longer term.

2022-11-28 00:00:00+00:00,‘Patience Pays Off’: Billionaire Ken Fisher Loads Up on These 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/patience-pays-off%3A-billionaire-ken-fisher-loads-up-on-these-2-strong-buy-stocks,,,"Investors looking for a guiding hand to steer them safely through the current hazardous stock market landscape could do worse than listen to what billionaire Ken Fisher has to say.  
The Fisher Investments founder famously started his independent money management firm with $250 in 1979, a company that is now a $197-plus billion going concern, while Fisher’s own net worth stands north of $5 billion.
So, for those getting restless from 2022’s unrelenting bear, Fisher has some very simple advice: ""The things that tend to drop the most in a bear market, when you get to the other side and come up the other side of the V, whenever it is, tend to bounce the most early on. So, that's why patience is a virtue... If you become patient, you’ll become worth more money.""
Turning to Fisher for inspiration, we took a closer look at two stocks the billionaire made moves on recently. Using TipRanks’ database to find out what the analyst community has to say, we learned that each ticker boasts a “Strong Buy” consensus rating from the analyst community. Let’s see why they are considered good investment choices right now.
Marvell Technology (MRVL)
The first Fisher-endorsed stock we’ll look at is a chip industry stalwart. Marvell is a maker of semiconductors and associated tech. The integrated circuit specialist serves a wide range of markets from data centers to automotive, enterprise networking to cloud and carrier infrastructure, amongst others. Following various acquisitions, the company's primary source of revenue has shifted from the consumer electronics sector to data infrastructure (data center, industrial, automotive, mobile network).
Meanwhile, Marvell’s revenue and earnings have been trending in one direction – up. And though supply chain issues have made their presence felt, Marvell still managed to meet Wall Street expectations.
The company will be releasing its fiscal third-quarter on December 1, but in the meantime, we can get a good feel for the company’s situation by looking back at the F2Q22 numbers. Specifically, revenue climbed by 41% from the same period a year ago to $1.52 billion, meeting Street expectations, while the company delivered adj. EPS of $0.57, coming in $0.01 above the $0.56 consensus estimate.
However, citing supply chain hitches, for FQ3, the company expects revenue of $1.56 billion, missing the $1.58 billion anticipated by the analysts, while for the bottom-line, the outlook called for adj. EPS of $0.59 at the midpoint, below consensus at $0.61.
Overall, Marvell has been unable to withstand the bearish market forces and the shares have tumbled ~50% this year.
Fisher obviously thinks they represent excellent value. He upped his stake considerably in Q3, and bought 11,133,134 MRVL shares, now worth in excess of $478 million.
Echoing Fisher’s bullish stance, Credit Suisse’s Chris Caso sees plenty to like about the chip company.
“Our longer-term favorable view of MRVL is due to the number of company-specific drivers that account for well over half of the Street revenue growth expectations heading into CY23,” the 5-star analyst explained. “Those drivers include hyperscale semi-custom silicon, the former Inphi business, automotive ethernet, the Innovium switch business and continued 5G rollouts. We expect that growth in all these areas is much less heavily dependent on end-markets, and will buffer against a market slowdown. In addition, spending by cloud operators has held up better than we would have thought given the compression in ad spending.”
Backing his comments, Caso rates MRVL shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) while his $56 price target makes room for 12-month gains of 28%. (To watch Caso’s track record, click here)
His colleagues agree - almost unanimously so. While one analyst favors sitting this one out, all 11 other reviews are to Buy, providing the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average target is more bullish than Caso will allow; at $61.67, the figure suggests shares will gain ~42% in the year ahead. (See MRVL stock forecast on TipRanks)
Charles Schwab (SCHW)
From the chip industry, let’s now pivot to an entirely different segment for Fisher’s next pick – to that of the financial services sector. Charles Schwab as a leader in the business of investment services, helping both retail and institutional clients invest in capital markets in a smart and efficient manner. Its services range from banking and securities brokerage to wealth and asset management, custody, and financial advisory services. Boasting around ~$7 trillion in client assets, the company is the U.S.’s 7th biggest banking firm.
Part of Schwab’s modus operandi is to collect as many deposits and cash as it can and invest it so to generate interest. This is especially helpful for the present climate in which interest rates are rising and has helped the company perform well in 2022’s depressed environment.
In the latest quarterly report, for 3Q22, revenue rose by 20% year-over-year to $5.5 billion, while beating the Street’s call by $80 million. The company generated a record $2 billion in net income, compared to the $1.5 billion delivered in the same period a year earlier. This resulted in adj. EPS of $1.10, trumping the Street’s $1.05 forecast.
Not wanting to miss out on a compelling opportunity, Fisher pulled the trigger on 15,433,332 shares, giving his fund a new position in SCHW. Looking at the value of the new holding, it comes in at almost $1.26 billion.
While J.P. Morgan’s Ken Worthington notes that the stock’s valuation is not cheap, he thinks there is good reason for that.
“We believe Schwab is a well-managed and highly valued company that trades at a premium to peers based on an industry-leading brand for retail financial services,” Worthington opined. “We view Schwab as a growth company with numerous initiatives to drive both incremental organic growth and a higher fee rate. We see Schwab benefiting from an engaged retail trading base that should drive a future generation of Schwab’s investor clients.”
To this end, Worthington rates SCHW shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) while his $102 average target suggests investors will be pocketing returns of ~26% a year from now. (To watch Worthington’s track record, click here)
Looking at the consensus breakdown, with 9 Buys vs. 3 Holds, the analysts’ view is that this stock is Strong Buy. At $92.9, the average target implies 12-month share appreciation of ~15%. (See SCHW stock forecast on TipRanks)

2022-11-24 00:00:00+00:00,Marvell Technology (MRVL) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/marvell-technology-mrvl-reports-next-week%3A-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-0,,,"The market expects Marvell Technology (MRVL) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on December 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +37.2%.
Revenues are expected to be $1.56 billion, up 28.6% from the year-ago quarter.
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.89% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marvell?
For Marvell, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.68%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.
So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marvell will beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?
While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Marvell would post earnings of $0.56 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.57, delivering a surprise of +1.79%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
Marvell doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

2022-11-24 00:00:00+00:00,Should Vanguard Extended Market ETF (VXF) Be on Your Investing Radar?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-vanguard-extended-market-etf-vxf-be-on-your-investing-radar-4,,,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market, the Vanguard Extended Market ETF (VXF) is a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/27/2001.
The fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $14 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
Why Mid Cap Blend
With market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion, mid cap companies usually contain higher growth prospects than large cap companies, and are considered less risky than their small cap counterparts. These types of companies, then, have a good balance of stability and growth potential.
Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.
Costs
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.06%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.14%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 17.20% of the portfolio. Information Technology and Industrials round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Blackstone Inc. (BX) accounts for about 1.14% of total assets, followed by Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) and Marvell Technology Inc. (MRVL).
The top 10 holdings account for about 6.91% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
VXF seeks to match the performance of the S&P Completion Index before fees and expenses. The S&P Completion Index contains all of the U.S. common stocks regularly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, except those stocks included in the S&P 500 Index.
The ETF has lost about -22.94% so far this year and is down about -25.20% in the last one year (as of 11/24/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $126.36 and $187.19.
The ETF has a beta of 1.18 and standard deviation of 30.59% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 3625 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
Vanguard Extended Market ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, VXF is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.
The Vanguard MidCap ETF (VO) and the iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF (IJH) track a similar index. While Vanguard MidCap ETF has $51.72 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF has $66.10 billion. VO has an expense ratio of 0.04% and IJH charges 0.05%.
Bottom-Line
Passively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.

This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.59%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.28%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.02%.
Coming into today, shares of the chipmaker had gained 5.69% in the past month. In that same time, the Business Services sector gained 7.52%, while the S&P 500 gained 6.89%.
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Marvell Technology as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be December 1, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Marvell Technology to post earnings of $0.59 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 37.21%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.56 billion, up 28.63% from the year-ago period.
MRVL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.24 per share and revenue of $6.14 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +42.68% and +37.56%, respectively.
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Marvell Technology. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.

2022-11-23 00:00:00+00:00,How The Parts Add Up: IWX Headed For $74,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-the-parts-add-up%3A-iwx-headed-for-%2474,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares Russell Top 200 Value ETF (Symbol: IWX), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $73.77 per unit.
With IWX trading at a recent price near $66.81 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.41% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of IWX's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL), Medtronic PLC (Symbol: MDT), and Dominion Energy Inc (Symbol: D). Although MRVL has traded at a recent price of $42.92/share, the average analyst target is 70.28% higher at $73.08/share. Similarly, MDT has 31.29% upside from the recent share price of $77.93 if the average analyst target price of $102.31/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting D to reach a target price of $74.30/share, which is 23.32% above the recent price of $60.25. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MRVL, MDT, and D:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
iShares Russell Top 200 Value ETF IWX $66.81 $73.77 10.41%
Marvell Technology Inc MRVL $42.92 $73.08 70.28%
Medtronic PLC MDT $77.93 $102.31 31.29%
Dominion Energy Inc D $60.25 $74.30 23.32%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2022-11-22 00:00:00+00:00,"MRVL, DIS: Why Analysts Love These 2 Stocks",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mrvl-dis%3A-why-analysts-love-these-2-stocks,,,"Investing in an economy that is on the verge of tipping into a recession can be frightening. TipRanks’s Analysts’ Top Stocks tool makes it simpler to choose stocks by offering a comprehensive view of the most recommended stocks currently on Wall Street. Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) are two stocks that have been most recommended by Wall Street analysts over the past two days.
Marvell (MRVL)
Semiconductor company Marvell Technology is witnessing strong demand for its chips from the 5G infrastructure and data-center end markets. The company’s efficient supply-chain execution is helping it meet the strong demand for its Smart NICs and security adapters from cloud data centers.
Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) analyst Chris Caso initiated coverage of Marvell with a Buy rating and a $56 price target. The analyst identified several company-specific growth drivers which are expected to fuel revenue growth in 2023.
Is MRVL Stock a Buy or Sell, According to Analysts?
Going into the Q3 results, which are expected to be out on December 1, various headwinds are keeping Caso’s expectations low. He believes that while the long-term view is undisputedly bullish, Marvell stock is not necessarily a Buy right before the earnings release. Rather, Caso suggests investors buy during a dip. MRVL stock has plenty of support on Wall Street, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 16 Buys against two Holds. The average price target of $68.89 indicates upside potential of 60.5%.
Walt Disney (DIS)
The hottest news about the entertainment company Walt Disney is the return of Robert A. Iger as CEO. His plans to boost the operations of the Media and Entertainment Distribution unit to a more efficient and cost-effective one are giving fresh hope to investors regarding its lackluster margins and mounting losses.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Jessica Reif Cohen maintained a Buy rating and $115 price target on DIS stock, believing that Iger’s leadership “could significantly boost investor sentiment and introduces a potential upcoming catalyst in the form of a new strategic direction.”
Not only that, but Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Benjamin Swinburne also agrees that Iger’s comeback can materially uplift the stock. Reiterating a Buy rating on DIS stock, Swinburne said that Disney’s content is not being monetized efficiently and not earning as much as it should, and this is what he believes Iger will revive.
Is DIS Stock a Buy or Sell, According to Analysts?
Disney is a Strong Buy on Wall Street, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 17 Buys and three Holds. The average price target for Disney stock is $122.25, suggesting 27.07% upside potential over the next 12 months.
Takeaway: MRVL and DIS Look Like Winners
Both Marvell and Disney are companies with upbeat longer-term prospects. Moreover, with strong business strategies and leadership in place, the companies appear to be long-term winners.

2022-11-16 00:00:00+00:00,Should You Buy Taiwan Semiconductor-Heavy ETFs Now?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-taiwan-semiconductor-heavy-etfs-now,,,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-B) grabbed a stake of about $5 billion in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM, as the veteran investor thinks the world’s leading chipmaker has bottomed out after a selloff of more than $250 billion. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited surged 10.8%.
The Omaha-based conglomerate acquired about 60 million American depository receipts in TSMC in the three months ended September, it said in a filing. The Taiwanese company produces semiconductors for clients like Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Qualcomm Inc. QCOM and is the exclusive supplier of Apple Inc.’s custom Silicon chips. Apple remains the most valuable single holding in Berkshire’s portfolio.
Assuming Buffett purchased TSMC’s ADRs at the average price for the third quarter, the stake would equal to cost of $5.1 billion. They currently trade at $72.80. TSMC’s shares rose as much as 10% just after the disclosure, the largest uptick in more than two years.
Notably, Marvell Technology MRVL recently unveiled a comprehensive 3 nano-meter (nm) silicon technology platform to enhance its solution portfolio across cloud data center, carrier, enterprise and automotive markets. The 3nm silicon platform is currently in fabrication with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) on its 3nm shuttle.
Earnings estimates of TSMC for the upcoming quarter is 53.04% while the year 2022 is 51.94%. Sales estimates of TSMC for the upcoming quarter is 28.96% while the year 2022 is 27.25%. Taiwan Semiconductor has a top-grade VGM score of A.              
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has the manufacturing capabilities to make the world’s most-advanced chips, important to advancing every nation’s future commercial industries like EVs and AI. TSMC said in October it cut capital spending to about $36 billion this year, which would still be a record high, down from at least $40 billion planned previously.  
Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few Taiwan-Semiconductor-heavy ETFs that could be tapped following Buffett’s decision. A company-approach is always better than the basket approach.

2022-10-27 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting MRVL Put And Call Options For December 9th,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-mrvl-put-and-call-options-for-december-9th,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options begin trading today, for the December 9th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new December 9th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $40.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $37.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $40.93/share today.
Because the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.50% return on the cash commitment, or 63.60% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $40.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $43.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.38. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $40.93/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $43.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.87% if the stock gets called away at the December 9th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $43.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $43.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.81% boost of extra return to the investor, or 49.31% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $40.93) to be 62%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-10-27 00:00:00+00:00,U.S. chipmaker Marvell cutting some R&D roles in China - statement,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-chipmaker-marvell-cutting-some-rd-roles-in-china-statement,,,"By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Santa Clara, California-based chip designer Marvell Technology Group Ltd MRVL.O is eliminating some roles in China as part of a realignment of its global research and development investments, the company said on Thursday.
""In China, we will focus our R&D investments on local customers and the China market,"" Stacey Keegan, vice president of Corporate Marketing at Marvell said in a written response to questions sent from Reuters.
""As a part of this realignment, several of our business units and functions are announcing changes to their global location strategy that will result in the elimination of roles in China.""
Marvell did not specify how many staffers would be affected by the cuts.
Domestic China media outlet iJiwei reported late on Wednesday, citing unnamed industry sources, that Marvell planned to lay off a large proportion of its research and development team in China.
Marvell at one point had 1,000 people working in China, about 800 of which were located at its research and development center in Shanghai, according to iJiwei, an online news site tracking the semiconductor sector.
Marvell specializes in chips for switches used inside data centers owned by cloud computing providers.
The company's move comes as chipmakers brace for slowing demand following a boom at the peak of a global chip shortage.
Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS on Thursday reported a 31% drop in profit due to weak demand, and forecast it would stay low until early 2023.
Chip stocks broadly took a hit earlier this month when Samsung and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O announced dour forecasts for the quarter.
Marvell's move also comes after Washington enacted tough sanctions on the Chinese chip sector, which effectively bar U.S.-based equipment makers from servicing Chinese manufacturers of advanced chips.
Amid the geopolitical tensions, a number of U.S.-based companies have scaled back ther R&D operations in China.
In January, fellow U.S.-based chipmaker Micron Technology Inc MU.O shut down its its DRAM R&D center in Shanghai citing shifting investment priorities.

2022-10-24 00:00:00+00:00,June 2024 Options Now Available For Marvell Technology (MRVL),MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/june-2024-options-now-available-for-marvell-technology-mrvl,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 2024 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 606 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new June 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $37.50 strike price has a current bid of $8.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $37.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $29.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $37.82/share today.
Because the $37.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 21.60% return on the cash commitment, or 13.01% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $37.50 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of $9.60. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $37.82/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $40.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 31.15% if the stock gets called away at the June 2024 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $40.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 25.38% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.29% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $37.82) to be 61%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Marvell is benefiting from solid demand for its storage and networking chips from the 5G infrastructure and data-center end markets. In May, the company introduced its third generation Marvell Brightlane Ethernet Switch, the industry’s most advanced automotive secure managed switch, and the first with lockstep dual-core Arm processing redundancy to enable high reliability for mission-critical applications that support vehicle safety and performance.

The growing cloud infrastructure build-out has been recently driving demand for low-latency and high-performance networking solutions. Marvell's Teralynx product line, added to the company's switch portfolio through the acquisition of Innovium, delivers ultra-low latency, optimized power, programmability and innovative telemetry essential to the cloud data center. The Teralynx switches and optical transceivers are addressing the growing traction from cloud data customers.

Meanwhile, Marvell’s Ethernet switch and PHY business is also gaining traction with new products in the enterprise market. Its refreshed switching products continue to grow with new socket wins.

The acquisition of the Cavium business in 2018 has further boosted Marvell’s capabilities in the Ethernet business. It has helped Marvell to expand its capabilities in the networking market and capture significant market share in the fast-growing data-center space.

In March, the company introduced Alaska A PAM4 DSP family for Active Electrical Cables, the industry’s highest performance 400G/800G AEC DSPs to address emerging 100G/lane adoption in cloud data center interconnect architectures. In the same month, Marvell also announced the industry’s first 800Gbps or 8 x 100Gbps multimode platform solution that enables data center infrastructure to achieve dramatically higher speeds for short-reach optical modules and Active Optical Cable applications.

During second-quarter fiscal 2023, Marvell’s revenues from Data Center climbed 48% year over year to $643.4 million. The segment accounted for 42.4% of total quarterly revenues, highlighting the fact that it is currently Marvell’s largest end market compared to the rest.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.

2022-10-19 00:00:00+00:00,Nasdaq Bear Market: 2 Beaten-Down Stocks That Could Double in 5 Years,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nasdaq-bear-market%3A-2-beaten-down-stocks-that-could-double-in-5-years,,,"The Nasdaq Composite witnessed a brutal sell-off so far in 2022. The index lost 31% of its value so far as investors decided to dump high-growth companies, in part because the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to curb the surging inflation. On a positive note, the correction also opened an opportunity for investors to buy some great companies at attractive valuations.
The stocks for electric vehicle (EV) specialist Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and chipmaker Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) are down 38% and 56%, respectively, so far this year. But savvy investors might want to consider accumulating these Nasdaq stocks if the sell-off continues as each company is sitting on terrific catalysts that could supercharge growth in the long run. Let's look at the reasons why these two stocks could double in five years.
1. Tesla is racing ahead in a fast-growing market
Tesla is having a terrible October as the EV maker missed Wall Street's delivery estimates at the beginning of the month. The company produced nearly 366,000 vehicles during the quarter and delivered just over 343,000 units. Analysts, however, were expecting Tesla to deliver just over 359,000 vehicles.
But a higher number of cars in transit was the reason why Tesla's deliveries fell behind expectations. The company pointed out in its press release that the cars in transit ""have been ordered and will be delivered to customers upon arrival at their destination."" It simply means that the cars that Tesla was supposed to deliver in Q3 will now move into Q4.
So, there's no reason for investors to press the panic button, especially considering the pace at which Tesla's deliveries are growing. Tesla's Q3 deliveries increased 54% year over year. Analysts expect Tesla to finish 2022 with total deliveries of 1.5 million vehicles. That would be an increase of over 50% as compared to its 2021 deliveries of 936,000 vehicles.
The company plans to increase its deliveries at an annual rate of 50% over a multi-year period. This explains why Tesla has been aggressively expanding its capacity and has set an ambitious annual sales target of 20 million cars by the end of the decade. All this indicates why Tesla is expected to sustain its terrific growth momentum in the long run.
TSLA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts
The solid top-line growth should filter down to the bottom line as well. Analysts expect 55% annual earnings growth from Tesla for the next five years. The company should end 2022 with $4.10 per share in earnings. Applying a 55% annual growth rate to this year's projected earnings would translate into a bottom-line EPS of around $36 after five years.
Tesla stock has a forward earnings multiple of 37 right now. Even if we assume the stock is trading at a discounted 25 times forward earnings after five years owing to the rising competition in the EV space, its stock price could hover around $875 at the projected earnings of $36 per share after five years. That would easily double Tesla's current stock price of around $220.
2. Marvell Technology can grow rapidly thanks to multiple catalysts
Marvell Technology stock was battered badly this year, but the drop seems unjustified given its eye-popping growth. The chipmaker's revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2023 increased 55% over the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings increased 73% year over year during the same period.
The company's outstanding growth can be attributed to the data center, networking, and carrier infrastructure markets. These three end markets produced 83% of Marvell's total revenue last quarter, and all of them recorded solid growth over the year-ago period.
Marvell's data center revenue, for instance, was up 48% year over year, and the company anticipates further growth in this business thanks to the healthy demand for the various data center chips it sells. The demand for data center storage, for example, could grow at an annual pace of nearly 27% through 2028. As a result, the demand for Marvell's storage accelerators that help in the deployment of solid-state drives and hard-disk drives in data centers should continue to remain robust.
The company also sells data processing units, which is another fast-growing niche within the data center chip market. Meanwhile, the deployment of 5G networks is turning out to be another big growth driver for Marvell. CEO Matt Murphy remarked on the company's August earnings conference call that he sees an ""extended period of growth for our 5G business with multiple regions such as Europe and India yet to launch 5G in a meaningful fashion."" He continued, ""We expect to see further growth in other large geographies such as the U.S., which are only in their first year of mainstream deployment.""
Such impressive growth drivers are the reasons why Marvell's revenue growth is expected to remain strong in the next few years.
MRVL Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts
What's more, analysts anticipate 42% annual earnings growth from Marvell for the next five years. The company is expected to finish the current fiscal year with earnings of $2.29 per share. The projected earnings growth rate points toward a bottom line of $13.22 per share after five years. The stock is currently trading at 13 times forward earnings, and a similar multiple after five years would translate into a stock price of $169, which would be well higher than the current level of $38.
So, Marvell Technology could turn out to be a top semiconductor stock in the long run, and investors may want to start accumulating it following its sharp decline in 2022.

2022-10-17 00:00:00+00:00,MRVL March 2023 Options Begin Trading,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mrvl-march-2023-options-begin-trading,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available today, for the March 2023 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 151 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new March 2023 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $37.50 strike price has a current bid of $5.05. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $37.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $32.45 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $38.33/share today.
Because the $37.50 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 13.47% return on the cash commitment, or 32.55% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $37.50 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $38.33/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $40.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 18.71% if the stock gets called away at the March 2023 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $40.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 14.35% boost of extra return to the investor, or 34.68% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $38.33) to be 61%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-10-17 00:00:00+00:00,Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/marvell-technology-nasdaq%3Amrvl-seems-to-use-debt-quite-sensibly,,,"David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?
What Risk Does Debt Bring?
Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.
What Is Marvell Technology's Debt?
The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Marvell Technology had US$4.60b in debt in July 2022; about the same as the year before. On the flip side, it has US$617.1m in cash leading to net debt of about US$3.98b.
NasdaqGS:MRVL Debt to Equity History October 17th 2022
How Healthy Is Marvell Technology's Balance Sheet?
We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Marvell Technology had liabilities of US$2.16b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$4.48b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$617.1m in cash and US$1.29b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$4.72b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.
Of course, Marvell Technology has a titanic market capitalization of US$31.6b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.
We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.
Even though Marvell Technology's debt is only 2.4, its interest cover is really very low at 1.9. In large part that's it has so much depreciation and amortisation. While companies often boast that these charges are non-cash, most such businesses will therefore require ongoing investment (that is not expensed.) In any case, it's safe to say the company has meaningful debt. Notably, Marvell Technology made a loss at the EBIT level, last year, but improved that to positive EBIT of US$271m in the last twelve months. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Marvell Technology can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.
Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So it is important to check how much of its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) converts to actual free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, Marvell Technology actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last year. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.
Our View
On our analysis Marvell Technology's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. However, our other observations weren't so heartening. To be specific, it seems about as good at covering its interest expense with its EBIT as wet socks are at keeping your feet warm. Considering this range of data points, we think Marvell Technology is in a good position to manage its debt levels. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Be aware that Marvell Technology is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...
Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.
