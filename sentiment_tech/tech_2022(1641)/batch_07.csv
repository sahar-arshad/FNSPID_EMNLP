2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00,3 Semiconductor Stocks To Watch In The Stock Market Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-semiconductor-stocks-to-watch-in-the-stock-market-right-now,,,"Semiconductor stocks have been in the news a lot lately. For the uninitiated, semiconductor stocks refer to the stocks of companies that design, manufacture, or market semiconductors. Semiconductors are electronic components made from materials like silicon or germanium, and they are used in a wide variety of electronic devices, from computers and cell phones to solar panels and LED lights.
As a result, semiconductor stocks have been on the rise in recent years. This comes as the demand for semiconductors has increased. Thanks to the growing popularity of consumer electronics and the increasing use of renewable energy, semiconductor stocks are expected to continue to grow in the future. As a result, investing in semiconductor stocks could be a smart way to take advantage of the booming tech industry. With this in mind, here are three of the most active semiconductor stocks to watch in the stock market today.

2022-11-09 00:00:00+00:00,5 Investors Still Betting Big on Intel (INTC) Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-investors-still-betting-big-on-intel-intc-stock,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Everybody on Wall Street despises microprocessor manufacturing giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), right? That’s actually an unfounded assumption, as some big-money investors are holding large quantities of INTC stock. Maybe they know a good value when they see it, or perhaps they’re bullish on Intel as the chipmaker lays the groundwork for significant cost reductions.
If you’ve been monitoring the semiconductor industry, you’ve probably heard about the challenges facing chipmakers like Intel. These include PC-market weakness, high inflation and, somehow, a chip glut amid supply-chain disruptions.
The combination of these factors has precipitated a steep year-to-date (YTD) decline in INTC stock. Nevertheless, some well-capitalized firms are staying the course with Intel. So, let’s take a quick peek at five of these apparently contrarian institutional investors (according to filings as of June 9, 2022).
These 5 Investors Are Still Betting Big on INTC Stock
By the way, you’ll notice some overlap between these five investors and five large-scale shareholders of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock. Is it possible that these big firms are buying what anxious retail chip-stock traders are selling?
Vanguard: a supersized position of 357.8 million INTC shares, which represents 8.67% of the outstanding shares.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK): 347.95 million shares, or 8.43% of Intel’s outstanding shares.
State Street (NYSE:STT): 176.15 million shares of INTC stock, which translates to 4.27% of the outstanding shares.
Capital International Investors: 87.68 million Intel shares, or 2.12% of the outstanding shares.
Geode Capital Management: a position consisting of 79.98 million shares, which equates to 1.94% of the outstanding shares.
Intel Offers Deep Value and Announces Cost-Cutting Plan
So, what do these high-rolling firms see in downtrodden Intel? Quite possibly, investors like Vanguard and BlackRock are in the market for deep value, and they certainly found it with Intel.
Since so much bad news had already been baked into the proverbial pie, INTC stock now trades barely above its book value — 1.17x, to be specific. Also, Intel’s trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is extremely reasonable at just 8.47x.
Along with that, the aforementioned investors may be encouraged to stay in the trade with Intel due to the chipmaker’s announced cost-reduction efforts. Even while Intel maintains a firm balance sheet with cash balances totaling $23 billion, some shareholders undoubtedly wanted the company to reduce its future expenditures during these uncertain times.
To that end, Intel plans to implement $3 billion worth of cost reductions in 2023. By the end of 2025, the company intends to drive $8 billion to $10 billion in annual savings. Intel CFO Dave Zinsner clarified that the savings “will be realized through multiple initiatives to optimize the business.”
These will include the usual suspects, such as portfolio cuts and the “right-sizing” of Intel’s support organizations. However, there will also be “more stringent cost controls in all aspects” of Intel’s spending. Additionally, expect Intel to utilize “improved sales and marketing efficiency” to further reduce the company’s outlays.
Join the Big Spenders With a Small Stake of Your Own
If you like what you’re hearing about Intel’s value proposition and proposed spending reductions, then here’s some good news. You don’t have to have a Vanguard- or BlackRock-sized account to participate in Intel’s potential upside.
So, consider a small position in INTC stock if you’re ready to join the club. After all, it’s a club with some major Wall Street whales, and you’re invited to dive into the deep end if you dare.

2022-11-09 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel Stock Is Rallying From Its 52-Week Low, but Is It a Buy?",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-stock-is-rallying-from-its-52-week-low-but-is-it-a-buy,,,"It is surprising to see that shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have rallied of late -- gaining 8% since hitting a 52-week low on Oct. 13 -- despite the spate of headwinds that have wrecked the semiconductor giant's top and bottom lines lately.
From a shrinking personal computer (PC) market to a loss of share to Advanced Micro Devices in the client and server processor markets, the odds are stacked against a turnaround at Intel. Still, investors seem to be in an upbeat mood following the company's third-quarter results released on Oct. 27.
But will their happiness be short-lived? Or is Intel's latest plan to turn its business around going to work and help the stock sustain its rally?
Intel's results paint a terrible picture
Intel's revenue and earnings were better than what Wall Street was anticipating last quarter, but that's where the good things about the company's results end.
Intel's revenue of $15.3 billion was down 15% over the prior-year period. The adjusted gross margin shrunk 12.4 percentage points year over year, while the operating margin was down a whopping 21 percentage points. As a result, Intel's adjusted earnings fell 59% year over year to $0.59 per share.
The company's woeful performance was a result of sharp declines in its client computing and data center businesses. Weak PC demand from the consumer and education markets, as well as inventory reductions by OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) considering the poor demand, led to a 17% decline in revenue from the client computing group to $8.1 billion. Intel also shipped fewer server processors last quarter, which led to a 27% drop in data center and artificial intelligence (AI) revenue to $4.2 billion.
The bad news piled up as Intel slashed its full-year guidance. It is now looking at 2022 revenue of $63.5 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, down from the prior guidance of $66.5 billion. That's not surprising, as Intel expects PC shipments to decline in the mid-to-high teens in 2022. The situation in the data center business doesn't appear to be promising either, as AMD is expected to gain more ground by the end of the year.
AMD reportedly controlled 27.6% of the server processor market in the third quarter, according to third-party estimates. Intel is expected to lose more ground in the current quarter, as AMD's share of this lucrative market could hit 30.3%. The market share losses in the data center space don't bode well for Intel, as this niche presents a $42 billion addressable revenue opportunity.
Delays in the launch of new server processors have hamstrung Intel's data center business, handing AMD the advantage in this market. For instance, AMD is expected to release its latest-generation Epyc server processors before Intel brings the competing Sapphire Rapids to market.
Meanwhile, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is set to launch systems powered by AMD's fourth-generation Epyc processors later this month. Sapphire Rapids processors, which were supposed to hit the market in 2021, are now expected to go into volume production only in 2023. Moreover, the PC market's weakness is expected to persist in 2023 as well.
All this makes a turnaround at Intel even more difficult. This explains why analysts expect a 3% decline in Intel's revenue in 2023, which would be an improvement over this year's estimated decline of 14%. But it remains to be seen if Intel could get its house in order and deliver an improved performance in 2023, especially considering that it will be substantially reducing expenses.
Intel plans to achieve savings between $8 billion and $10 billion by 2025. The company says that one-third of those savings will come from reducing operating expenses, so there may be an impact on the company's research and development spending as well. Intel spent $4.3 billion on research and development last quarter, up 13% year over year.
An aggressive capital spending plan was supposed to be the key to Intel's turnaround in the long run. But now that the company is looking to reduce costs, it could impact its ability to ward off AMD's growing dominance in the client and server processor markets.
The rally doesn't seem sustainable
In all, it can be said that Intel's fortunes are unlikely to turn around over the next year. The loss of more market share to AMD and the headwinds in the PC market could dent investor confidence in this semiconductor stock and bring its recent rally to an end.
Of course, Intel stock is cheap, as it is trading at 8.8 times earnings, and investors are probably looking forward to the cost-saving moves that could drive gains in the company's bottom line. But with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.7, which is higher than the trailing earnings multiple, it is evident that analysts are anticipating a decline in its bottom line.
Even worse, Intel's earnings are expected to contract at an annual pace of 21% for the next five years, suggesting that analysts aren't confident in its long-term prospects either. That's why investors on the hunt for beaten-down tech stocks should consider looking elsewhere, as Intel's rally doesn't seem sustainable.

2022-11-09 00:00:00+00:00,"If I Could Only Buy 1 Stock, This Would Be It",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/if-i-could-only-buy-1-stock-this-would-be-it-4,,,"Technology stocks have suffered steep declines in 2022, as rising inflation has slowed consumer spending. However, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has staved off the worst market declines, with its shares down 18% since January compared to the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index's plunge of 40% in the same period.
Apple's innovative business of top-rated products and services has made it a haven for investors this year. The company's unique ability to reinvent existing technology and boost it into mainstream use has had an undeniable effect on consumer technology, and will likely continue doing so for years to come.
Here's why Apple would be my first choice if I could only buy one stock.
Standing strong despite market declines
Decreased consumer spending in 2022 has led to the decline of multiple markets. According to IDC, worldwide PC shipments decreased by 15% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2022.Meanwhile, the smartphone market similarly saw a 9.7% decline in the same period.
However, Apple has continued seeing growth in its segments despite market headwinds. In its Q4 2022 results released on Oct. 28, the company's Macbook business reported a 25% increase from the previous year, earning $11.51 billion.
The significant rise highlights consumer preference for Apple's computer offerings, while competitor Microsoft saw a slight decline in its ""More Personal Computing"" segment, which includes sales from its Surface computer lineup, in its most recent quarter.
Moreover, despite declines in the smartphone market, Apple's iPhone revenue saw a 9.6% bump in Q4 2022, bringing in $42.63 billion.The company has managed to continue growing its earnings while the competition suffers the brunt of the market's downward trend.
In fact, Apple was the only company out of its biggest competitors in Q3 2022 to see year-over-year growth, with its iPhone business rising 1.6%, while competitors such as Samsung, Xiaomi, and OPPO saw declines between 7.8% to 22.3%.
Apple's ability to thrive in poor market conditions makes it an immensely reliable stock and an excellent long-term investment.
A bright future
Apple has made a name for itself, not by always being the first to produce technology but by innovatively redesigning existing tech in a way that catapults it into mainstream use. The company has done this repeatedly, most notably with the smartphone, which quickly became a necessity after the release of the iPhone. Apple did the same with its take on the tablet when it launched the first iPad, the smartwatch with its Apple Watch, and Bluetooth headphones with the immense success of its AirPods.
The company's ability to drive up usability with its custom-designed products leaves plenty of room to continue growing. Rumors of Apple's plans to release an augmented and/or virtual reality device, an electric vehicle, and a folding iPhone mean the company is in a constant state of development and is always on the cusp of taking over a new market.
Additionally, in a more immediate and concrete future, the tech giant still has yet to complete its Intel-to-Apple Silicon transition within its Mac lineup. After exclusively using Intel processors in its computers since 2006, Apple started moving over to its in-house designed Apple Silicon chips in 2020. The company first announced it would move its entire line of PCs to its own custom chips in 2020, beginning with the launch of its M1 MacBook Air, Pro, and Mac Mini.
Apple has slowly replaced each Intel Mac with its own Apple Silicon version over the last few years, introducing an M1 iMac, an M2 MacBook Air and Pro, and a Mac Studio. However, it isn't quite done yet. Numerous reports state Apple has plans to release an Apple Silicon Mac Pro in the first quarter of 2023, while many consumers are still hoping to see a larger and more powerful iMac and a beefier Mac Mini.
Since beginning the transition to Apple Silicon in June 2020, the company's Mac revenue has jumped 115% from $5.35 billion in Q2 2020 to $11.51 billion in Q4 2022. With the additional Macs still waiting to be moved over to the new processors, revenue will likely continue growing.
Suffice it to say, Apple still has decades of innovation left up its sleeve, with no signs of slowing down. The company's unwavering growth and potent line of products are why I would unquestionably buy Apple stock if I could only choose one company to invest in.

2022-11-08 00:00:00+00:00,Which Semiconductor Stock Is Wall Street’s Favorite Pick Amid the Current Pullback?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/which-semiconductor-stock-is-wall-streets-favorite-pick-amid-the-current-pullback,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Semiconductor makers enjoyed strong demand trends earlier in the pandemic due to the spike in sales of laptops and other gadgets amid work-from-home mandates, higher sales of gaming consoles and the rapid digitization of enterprises. However, demand in certain key markets, like personal computers (PCs), has slowed in recent months.
Macro challenges and the growing fears of an impending recession could further hurt demand for chips. Moreover, President Joe Biden’s administration’s new export controls to deny China access to advanced chips could weigh on the sales of major semiconductor makers. Semiconductor companies will have to apply for licenses to export certain high-performance chips, which are usually meant for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, to China.
Setting aside macro pressures and the tension between U.S. and China, the long-term growth potential for semiconductor companies remains attractive, based on the demand in data centers amid continued digitization, automotive, and other AI applications.
Against this backdrop, I used TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool to place three leading semiconductor stocks against each other and select the stock that Wall Street finds most promising at current levels.
AMD Advanced Micro Devices $64.12
NVDA Nvidia $146.04
INTC Intel $28.59
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
Back in October, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) warned investors of lower-than-anticipated third-quarter results due to weakness in PC market demand. The update not only spooked AMD investors but also dragged down other chip stocks.
On Nov. 1, AMD reported Q3 revenue of $5.6 billion, which reflected 29% year-over-year (YOY) growth, but slightly lagged expectations. Higher revenue from the data center, embedded and gaming segments more than offset lower client segment revenue due to the softening PC market. Q2 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) declined 8.2% to 67 cents due to the client segment’s operating loss and a higher share count resulting from the Xilinx acquisition.
AMD expects its Q4 revenue to grow by about 14% YOY, fueled by the strength in the embedded and data center segments but partially offset by lower revenue from the client and gaming segments. Additionally, the company’s full-year outlook reflects growth of nearly 43%. Notably, the launch of AMD’s next-generation EPYC server chip (code-named Genoa), on Nov. 10, is expected to further boost its data center revenue.
Raymond James analyst Melissa Fairbanks feels that AMD’s guidance was better than feared, given the notable weakness in the PC market. While Fairbanks acknowledges the weakness in the second half of the year, she is optimistic about the long-term growth story, backed by new launches across each segment, and the company’s collaboration with industry-leading manufacturing partners.
Fairbanks lowered the price target for AMD stock to $80 from $100 on near-term weakness but reaffirmed a “buy” rating.
All in all, Wall Street is cautiously optimistic about AMD, with a “moderate buy” consensus rating based on 17 buys and nine holds. At $85.62, the average AMD price target implies nearly 36% upside potential from current levels.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is widely known for its high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) that are used in gaming, data centers, automotive and other applications. After witnessing impressive growth during the work-from-home days of the pandemic, the company’s gaming revenue plunged in the second quarter of FY23 (ended July 31, 2022).
Additionally, Nvidia cautioned investors about a sequential decline in its gaming revenue in Q3 as buyers are reducing their inventory levels due to the economic slowdown and are postponing their purchases in anticipation of the launch of upgraded products later this year. That said, Nvidia expects sequential growth in its data center and automotive revenues in Q3.
Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers opines that Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) recently announced capital expenditure guidance for 2023 bodes well for Nvidia and peers Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET), AMD and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG).
Rakers noted that Meta’s 2023 capex estimate of $34 billion to $39 billion indicates an increase of 12% at the midpoint. Meta expects its 2023 spending to be directed toward data centers, servers and network infrastructure, with the rise in AI capacity driving almost the entire capex growth next year. The analyst believes that Meta’s focus on AI investments “will likely be taken as an incremental positive data point” for Nvidia.
Overall, Wall Street has a “moderate buy” consensus rating for Nvidia based on 23 buys and nine holds. The average Nvidia price target of $194.83 suggests 32.35% upside potential from current levels.
Intel (INTC)

Over the past few years, chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has lost ground to rivals, mainly AMD, due to limited innovation, production delays, and execution issues. The ongoing macro challenges and intense rivalry make Intel’s turnaround difficult.
Intel’s Q3 revenue declined 20% YOY to $15.3 billion, while adjusted EPS fell 59% to 59 cents. Nonetheless, the company managed to beat analysts’ estimates. Like AMD, Intel’s client computing revenue declined YOY due to lower demand in the PC market. However, in contrast to AMD, Intel’s datacenter and AI revenue fell in the third quarter, indicating continued market share loss in this area.
Intel lowered its full-year outlook and expects economic challenges to extend into 2023. The company is focused on transforming its business and aims to deliver cost reductions of $3 billion in 2023. It aims to generate annual savings of $8 billion to $10 billion by the end of 2025 through several measures, including headcount reduction and portfolio cuts.
Truist Securities analyst William Stein noted that Intel’s fourth-quarter guidance significantly missed estimates due to lower demand, excess supply and other reasons.
Intel assured investors that it “continues to make progress with its goal of achieving five nodes in four years.” However, Stein expressed skepticism, stating, “If we could gain confidence in INTC’s ability to execute these plans, we might turn constructive, but that’s tough considering recent history.”
In line with his investment thesis, Stein lowered his price target for Intel stock to $29 from $40. He also reiterated a “hold” rating.
Overall, the Street is sidelined on Intel stock, with a “hold” consensus rating based on four buys, 16 holds and seven sells. The average Intel price target of $29.43 implies 2.65% upside potential.
To conclude, Wall Street is cautiously optimistic about Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia, but remains on the sidelines when it comes to Intel. Analysts estimate similar upside potential in AMD and Nvidia stocks. While near-term pressures remain, Wall Street is positive about the long-term prospects of AMD and Nvidia, based on their continued innovation and solid execution.

2022-11-07 00:00:00+00:00,"Want $300 in Quarterly Dividend Income? Invest $20,400 in These 3 High-Yield Dow Stocks",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/want-%24300-in-quarterly-dividend-income-invest-%2420400-in-these-3-high-yield-dow-stocks,,,"This has been a trying year for investors in every sense of the word. Each of the three major U.S. stock indexes has tumbled into a bear market, while the bond market is suffering through its worst year on record. There simply haven't been many safe-havens.
But on the bright side, short-term pain for the stock market can often lead to long-term gains for patient investors. This is especially true for those looking to buy dividend stocks.
Image source: Getty Images.
Income stocks bring a multitude of advantages to the table. For instance, companies that pay a regular dividend are almost always profitable. What's more, they're typically time-tested and have successfully navigated their way through economic downturns and/or recessions before. And did I mention that dividend stocks have substantially outperformed their non-paying peers over multiple decades?
Yet the best aspect of dividend stocks just might be that you don't have to look far to find well-known companies capable of delivering inflation-crushing yields -- at least on a historic basis. The timeless Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) is home to three supercharged income stocks that are ripe for the picking. If you were to invest $20,400 (split equally three ways) in the following three high-yield Dow stocks, which sport an average yield of 5.91%, you'd be able to collect $300 in quarterly dividend income.
Walgreens Boots Alliance: 5.33% yield
The first tried-and-true Dow Jones stock that can help investors generate $300 in quarterly income from an initial investment of $20,400 (split three ways) is pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA). Not only is Walgreens one of the highest-yielding Dow components at 5.33%, but it's increased its base annual payout for 47 consecutive years.
One of the reasons Walgreens has been such a steady dividend stock for decades is due to the fact that healthcare stocks are defensive. Regardless of how the economy or stock market perform, there's always demand for prescription drugs, medical devices, and various healthcare services. In short, there's safety in numbers behind Walgreens' operations.
Although foot traffic into Walgreens' stores took a hit during the lockdown phase(s) of the pandemic, the company has implemented numerous changes designed to boost its operating margins and increase its organic growth rate.
As you might imagine, cost-cutting is part of the plan. Walgreens had already shed more than $2 billion in annual operating expenses. But reducing costs only moves the needle so far. What's far more intriguing is where the company has been spending its cash.
Probably the most-promising venture undertaken by Walgreens Boots Alliance is its partnership with VillageMD (Walgreens is also a majority owner of VillageMD). The two have opened 152 full-service healthcare clinics co-located at Walgreens stores (through Aug. 31, 2022) and aim to reach 1,000 of these physician-staffed clinics by the end of 2027. Being physician staffed differentiates these clinics from its peers and provides a catalyst to bring customers back into its stores.
Walgreens is also investing in its online presence. While this will always be a brick-and-mortar-driven operating model, the convenience and sustained organic growth potential of online purchasing can't be overlooked.
Image source: Getty Images.
Verizon Communications: 7.03% yield
A second high-yielding Dow stock that can help investors bring home $300 in quarterly dividend income is telecom behemoth Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ). Verizon's 7% yield is the high-water mark within the 30-component Dow Jones Industrial Average.
As with Walgreens, Verizon benefits from being a major player in a very defensive industry. Over multiple decades, owning a cellular phone/smartphone and having access to wireless services has grown into something of a basic necessity for most consumers and businesses. With customer churn remaining low, Verizon is capable of delivering very predictable profits and cash flow year in and year out.
As I've been quick to note in the past, Verizon's best days are in the rearview mirror. But just because it's a mature company today, it doesn't mean it's devoid of catalysts capable of moving the needle. In particular, Verizon has two organic growth opportunities that make its forward-year price-to-earnings ratio of 7 looks extremely attractive.
First, there's the steady rollout of 5G-capable wireless infrastructure. Investing in 5G will be costly for Verizon, and upgrading its infrastructure to reach most Americans will take a few years. But given that it's been roughly a decade since the last round of wireless download speed upgrades, 5G should entice businesses and consumers to trade-in their older wireless devices and substantially increase their data consumption. This is all great news for a company whose wireless segment is driven by high-margin data consumption.
The other element of intrigue for Verizon is its bulky investments in 5G mid-band spectrum. In March 2021, Verizon announced that it had spent nearly $53 billion to acquire C-Band spectrum. This hefty investment should help the company offer 5G broadband services to 50 million households and 14 million businesses by mid-decade.
Though Verizon's sales growth isn't knocking anyone's socks off anymore, its 7% yield is rock-solid.
Intel: 5.37% yield
The third high-yielding Dow stock capable of helping you generate $300 in quarterly dividend income from an initial investment of $20,400 is semiconductor stock Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). At no point in the company's storied history has its dividend yield been above 5%, until recently.
There's no sugarcoating the fact that chipmakers like Intel are facing some very real headwinds. Global supply chain constraints (some caused by the COVID-19 pandemic), historically high inflation, chip export restrictions to China, and weakening domestic and international economic growth, are all reasons we've seen demand for semi solutions taper off in recent months. But smart investors aren't buying Intel to hold for a few months. They're buying for the (bad pun warning!) chips that are being put into play.
For instance, Intel should be able to rely on sustainably high cash flow from its legacy operations (e.g., personal computer (PC) central processing units (CPUs)), while coaxing healthy organic growth from its data center and ancillary operations. With businesses shifting their data into the cloud at an accelerated rate since the pandemic arrived, Intel's sizable server CPU market share should come in handy.
It's just as important for investors to understand that Intel isn't dying or going away anytime soon. Even with core competitor Advanced Micro Devices making inroads in PC, server, and mobile CPU market share, Intel remains the undisputed share leader in all three categories. As devices big and small become more technology-dependent, Intel's opportunities should only grow.
One of the more exciting developments of late is the CHIPS and Science Act being signed into law by President Biden. The CHIPS Act sets aside almost $53 billion to aid chipmakers with the construction of domestic manufacturing plants and offers design grants for new innovations. Intel recently broke ground on two new manufacturing plants in Ohio that are on track to be in operation by 2024.
And don't forget about autonomous vehicle company Mobileye, which recently debuted via initial public offering. Intel holds a majority stake in Mobileye, which has consistently been its fastest-growing operating segment (38% year-over-year sales growth in the September-ended quarter).
Intel's business isn't going to turn on a dime, but the puzzle pieces are in place for a strong performance during the next long-winded bull market. This makes its roughly 5.4% yield a no-brainer for patient income seekers.

*Stock Advisor returns as of September 30, 2022
This video was recorded on October 28, 2022.
Chris Hill: The biggest names in tech reported this week and 'tis the season for hot takes on Halloween candy. We got thoughts on all that and a lot more Motley Fool Money starts now.
Everybody needs money. That's why they call it money. From Fool global headquarters this is Motley Fool Money.
It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Chris Hill joining me in studio Motley Fool Senior Analyst Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger. Good to see you as always gentlemen.
Jason Moser: Hey.
Matt Argersinger: Hey.
Chris Hill: It's earnings-palooza, we've got the latest on some of the most widely held companies and as always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar. But we begin with Apple, the biggest tech companies in the world reported earnings this week, but the reaction to Apple's report was different than the rest. Shares up more than 7% on Friday after fourth-quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected. Jason, a little surprising when you consider how important the iPhone is to Apple's business and iPhone revenue was more than half a billion dollars lower than expected.
Jason Moser: But Apple's like pizza. Even when it's bad or it's not that great, it's still pizza. Same thing when Apple, it's still Apple. Did they blow the doors off quarter, nope but it was still a pretty Apple-like quarter and so even if they underperformed anywhere in regard to expectations, it was still a respectable quarter. Phones, services. They could have done a little bit better, but it's not like these were bad results and they point to a company that ultimately remains pretty darn resilient even in the face of a tough economic climate like we're in now. If you look at the numbers, revenue of $19.1 billion was up eight percent from a year ago and that includes 600 basis points of currency impact. To put some numbers around the fiscal year, fiscal 2022, $394 billion in revenue 8% annual growth. Services performed well, but probably not well enough in some eyes, $19.2 billion versus $18.3 billion a year ago, so 5% growth.
For a company we've been talking about, this is becoming a services company. That's not all that inspiring but the flip side of that is they've got more than 900 million paid subscriptions across the services on their platform. That's up more than 155 million over the last 12 months alone, a double what they had three years ago. They are pulling it off. I think they're just going to have to execute a little bit on the pricing side and we're seeing that with music and streaming. They're going to raise prices in music that's primarily due to licensing costs. They're going to raise prices on streaming because they feel like it's a better offering now and they can do it. Mac sales up 25%, iPad revenue was down 13%. Nothing terribly surprising there, wearables/homes/accessories, that was up 10%. I think all things considered, again, didn't blow the doors off the quarter, but a very respectable quarter, particularly when you compare it to the other big tech names that we'll talk about.
Matt Argersinger: I think Apple is always going to benefit from the power users of Apple that people that will buy the new iPhone, the new Mac, at least every two years. I'm just wondering, to your thought, if we do enter a slowdown or recession, consumer-driven or not, will their sales fall off just because people might delay buying that next iPhone, or the next iPad?
Jason Moser: I feel it maybe it does to an extent, but I think what we're seeing, I think a pretty common theme we're seeing this earnings season thus far as at least the current economic conditions and any potential recession that comes down the pike here, it seems to be impacting the lower-income earners as opposed to the higher-end income earners. Apple certainly benefits from that higher spender, that higher earner. It may delay, but I think ultimately that's a timing thing and if it does that, then you probably look at that as an opportunity to buy the stock.
Chris Hill: Amazon's third-quarter results showed slowing growth in the AWS division and the company lowered guidance for the all-important holiday quarter shares of Amazon down 10% on Friday. You tell me, Matt, how bad was this?
Matt Argersinger: Well, not great. I think you hit the two main things. It comes down to AWS and guidance. I want to know if I could tell a quick story really quickly though, before we get to that, which is July 2020, owned Amazon for 10 plus years, I had to sell shares first time because I was making a real estate investment, had some other things going on and I had to sell a bunch of things and I sold half my Amazon stake. I remember I trembled clicking the button to sell those shares because I didn't want to do it. Of course, at that point, the stock had just gone over $3,000 a share pre-split so but $150 post-split today and I was like, I'm going to regret this. I know I am. Of course over the next year, I watched the stock go up to, I think 180,185, almost 4,000 pre-split and I was depressed about that. Watching the stock come, I never thought I would see the stock down on a post-split basis below $100 a share, which it briefly did this week after earnings.
I'm excited about that, but I'm also realizing, there is something to why it's down and you hit it, which is there is this the Amazon Web Services part of this business it's been the crutch, even though the retail business has held up, and if you look at the retail numbers, they were fine. I think it was up 13% overall, which given the maturity of the business, of that e-commerce business, pretty strong. But you see the slowdown in AWS, which is slower-growing now than Google and Microsoft's competitors. I think the bigger thing might be the operating margins of that business have come down quite a bit. If that is the profit engine that is no longer there, or at least it's diminishing to a certain extent that I think had a lot investors worried. Then of course you said the guidance, looking at growth between 2 and 8%, I believe on their guidance range over the fourth quarter, that is probably a lot sharper than investors were expecting.
Chris Hill: Again, this is the holiday quarter.
Matt Argersinger: This is it.
Chris Hill: This is what people expect, not just Amazon but all retailers to really make their bones. Did the range of the guidance surprise you because it struck me as wider than typically we hear from Amazon and I just thought, and not that I fault them for this, but I thought on the low side they might be a little sandbagging.
Matt Argersinger: Probably a little bit and I think Amazon is known for this. I even said that their operating income will between zero and $4 billion. That's a tremendous range. I would not be surprised at all. I think what you're getting at is if they come in at the high end of those ranges when actually report.
Chris Hill: Shares of Meta platforms fell to their lowest level since 2016 this week, after the company's third-quarter report revealed just how much the company is investing in its metaverse division. Jason, we like it when CEOs communicate clearly, Mark Zuckerberg is being very clear about what he wants the future of Meta platforms to be.
Jason Moser: He is indeed. Then that's, we're going to see how that plays out. Certainly, it's not a surprise that there are challenges on the advertising front. At the end of the day it is cyclical and it goes as the economy goes to when those purse strings tighten, ad budgets tighten with them. But you said it, they're basically doubling down on this metaverse which right now is it still just a very squishy concept. You have Google with their moonshots. Those other bets as they call them. For Meta, for Facebook, this metaverse bed is an all in Pluto shot. It's so far out there that most people just can't see it and that's understandable. I'm not saying that it's a waste of investment dollars.
This probably works out in some capacity, but I think it's going to take a while and there are understandable concerns that he's overdoing it. Particularly when you look at the core business itself. Revenue was down if you exclude currency effects, it was up 2%. I think he'd take those bottom-line earnings down 49% from a year ago, which is obviously not good user growth, 4% was a positive, daily actives up 3%, but back to the ad market, while impressions were up 17%, price per ad continues to fall down 18%. They are spending a ton of money, though, capital expenditures $9.5 billion almost double from a year ago.
Guidance across the board not painting a very encouraging picture in the near term, as expenses continue to go up and revenue continues to come down. That repurchase about 32 million shares for the quarter at an average of about $203 per share and given where Facebook's prices today or Meta, I'm sorry. Clearly, that wasn't the wisest use of those dollars. I'm not the biggest fan of this company. I think most people know that said, and honestly from here. The stock is probably an opportunity for those who are able to take that longer view. It is really difficult to disrupt networks of that scale. I think that he will start to moderate those metaverse investments a little bit, but investors should be very prepared for a bumpy ride.
Chris Hill: Speaking of a slowdown in ad spending, Alphabet's third-quarter profits in revenue were lower than expected. Really with the exception of Google Cloud, it was across the board, Matt, shares of Alphabet down 7% this week.
Matt Argersinger: Right. It's important to remember that I think for a lot of these companies especially in the ad space, the comparable from a year ago were hard, they were going to be hard. If you look at Google's revenue, for example in the year-ago third quarter up 41%. The fact that they have any growth at all over those numbers is pretty impressive, but you're right. There's definitely a slowdown here. I think the biggest thing that stood out to me was just that the YouTube, the advertising revenue for YouTube was down. Maybe that was I didn't follow the guidance, so I don't know if that was expected, but that felt like a little bit of a shock to me. I think that's been such a sticky platform that's always gaining popularity in my mind, but it looks like and I don't use it so I don't know if it looks like TikTok is actually finally making some inroads and taking some market share from that short form, medium-term form video.
I feel like the ads slowdown is comparable, the tough, comparable perils last year. Explainable. I think the YouTube slowdown is the thing to watch here. I wish Alphabet, just pay a dividend. You've got all these other things and I know there's other bets. The one thing I'll say about comparing Meta to Alphabet is that the thing I like about Google's approach is that these other bets are spread around a lot of different areas where I feel like Mark Zuckerberg, and Facebook, Meta, it feels like an all-in bet where it's not the case for Alphabet at the same time, I'd rather they clamp down a little bit on that spending and maybe focus on dividends or other things.
Chris Hill: Let me go back to YouTube for a second because I think that part of the reaction we saw was not just to the results themselves, but to the fact that earlier this year, Alphabet already pulled the lever with YouTube in terms of original programming, where they said, you know what, we tried this, it's not working we're just going to pull this. The results we saw from YouTube become slightly more concerning when it's against the backdrop of like, they've already cut the original programming.
Matt Argersinger: That's right. No, that's a really good point.
Chris Hill: Visa, Microsoft and a lot more after the break so stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill is here in studio with Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger. Visa's fourth-quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected and Visa must have some extra cash laying around Jason because they increased their dividend and announced a $12 billion share buyback plan.
Jason Moser: I'm not complaining as a shareholder I'll take it. This was another very strong quarter and a good example of why I think Visa is worthy as a core fintech holding. It was interesting in the call right through that a lot of recession torque and management clearly, they're not planning for a recession in the coming year so maybe take that optimism with a grain of salt. If a recession does hit, we likely see them reassess the outlook, but I think counter to that is this is such a valuable network that leverages so many capabilities across the world.
Given the tailwinds and the electronic movement of money, maybe they're a little bit more immune than others, but to the numbers. The numbers were really strong. Fourth-quarter net revenue up 19 percent from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.93 up 19 percent. Total payments for the core, total payments volume was up 10 percent from a year ago, up 135 percent versus three years ago, cross-border, which is an investment that Visa and MasterCard in particular continued to make. Those volumes were very encouraging up 49 percent from a year ago and 130 percent versus three years ago, and the new flows, which is ultimately it's beyond that consumer to business payments that they've always focused on.
Broader movement of money around individuals' businesses, governments, that was up over 20 percent for the quarter. As you said, they are going to continue buying back stock. They bought back for the year, $11.6 billion in shares at an average price of just over $205. Now the share counts down nine percent since 2017. That's really, that's the MO with owning the stock. They're going to continue to buyback those shares, pay a modest dividend. It's a stock that has offered investors some real stability here this year, just down three-and-a-half percent versus in the S&P's around 20. It's been a good one to own.
Chris Hill: How much should we read into the fact that Visa doesn't think there's going to be a recession next year?
Jason Moser: Again, I think that it's just one of those things that plays into that broader trend of the electronic movement of money. I think they benefit from that, but I would not be surprised if we do hit that recessionary period. You'd likely see management maybe reassess their outlook a little bit.
Chris Hill: Microsoft brought in more than $50 billion in revenue in the first quarter, but shares of the software giant are down a bit this week after guidance for the current quarter, a little bit lower than Wall Street was hoping for, Matt.
Matt Argersinger: Yeah, a lot a lot lower and maybe I'm surprised that the growth, they're guiding for growth of just two percent in the next quarter. That seems very low to me. This was also, by the way, Microsoft's lowest rate of revenue growth in five years. Good news is you still have the Azure Cloud business growing 35 percent. It was the one that was trailing Amazon for many years, but it's really, it's maintained its growth. It's now growing faster than Amazon's Web Services. Stand out to me, does anyone use LinkedIn around here? Because LinkedIn's revenue was up 17 percent. I'm really surprised that the sessions to LinkedIn were up 24 percent. When I remember Jason, we're working on a million-dollar portfolio back in the day and when Microsoft acquired LinkedIn. I just thought this just seems like a real stab in the dark for Microsoft who miss the whole social networking and this was their chance to get in on that. I think they've done a tremendous job with LinkedIn, even though I don't use it very much. I don't really know many people that do.
Jason Moser: I'm with you. Every time I log into it, I wonder why did I just log into this.
Chris Hill: There has been a lot of job movement in 2022, so I think that's part of it. But take solace in the fact that you weren't the only ones. There were plenty of people looking at that acquisition back was it $26 billion that's my memory.
Matt Argersinger: That sounds about right.
Chris Hill: But I remember thinking at the time are they just bored, are they just doing it to just to see because to your point, Matt and also yours is, the way they have consistently monetized it and it's really just been in the, I think the last couple of years that they've broken that out and highlighted that. But it is surprising when you look at the run rate on LinkedIn.
Matt Argersinger: Very impressive.
Chris Hill: Ford Motor posted a loss in the third quarter, but shares up eight percent this week. In part because Ford executives said they are going to stop pouring money into their autonomous driving initiative, Jason. They were very clear about this. We're not doing this anymore.
Jason Moser: Well, certainly the future for now is more EV unless AV and I think shareholders have reason to celebrate there. They will continue to invest in the electric vehicle capability that they've developed and they're the number 2 EV brand in the US now, so I think that says a lot. I wouldn't say they've given up fully on autonomy, but management also recognizes that its a far more complex problem than some would have you believe it requires more time, capital, capability that would take them away from making sure that they focus on success in the near term with the things that they do really well, building cars. EVs are a little bit of a more natural extension, I think at this point. The company is in great fiscal shape of $50 billion in total liquidity.
As they noted in the call, they're going to impair this investment in Argo, which ultimately was that effort at L4 Autonomy, and L4, If you remember, that's considered to be fully autonomous driving, although a human driver can still request control and the car still has a cockpit. They are going to continue to invest in autonomy, but it's going to be more L2, and L3, which ultimately just brings more human judgment into play there. I think that makes a lot of sense because I think most of us agree and I've been very critical of this move toward AVs because to me it feels like the technology for the car I think is there, but we don't have the infrastructure, we don't have the road system that can handle that at this point. Matt you said here earlier today in the production meeting, you got to build a city that's geared for that specific technology there. So far the future, I think it makes it a little bit more sense, but I really do appreciate that they're going to focus more on EV, more on the automobile, ratchet back on the autonomy a little bit and move forward.
Matt Argersinger: You can only innovate so much at the car level you said it. If the infrastructure and the cities and the roads aren't meeting that technology investment, you're never going to be able to do that and I just say kudos to Ford, by the way, a company, unlike other companies we've talked about that decides to cut bait on something that's just not working out instead of doubling down.
Chris Hill: Well, and also saying like, look, we're looking out over the next 10 years, and over the next 10 years, this isn't going to pay off.
Matt Argersinger: Maybe let someone else innovate it and Ford can of course, build vehicles into that eventually.
Chris Hill: After the break, we've got restaurants, more tech, and two dividend aristocrats hitting new all-time highs. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money, Chris Hill here in studio with Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger. ExxonMobil's third-quarter profits were not just a record, but a just shy of $20 billion. The energy giants profits were within shouting distance of Apple's quarterly profits, Matt, shares of ExxonMobil hitting a new all-time high on Friday.
Matt Argersinger: Yeah. All good, when oil prices are at multi-year highs, we know that is the business. But kudos to Exxon. Darren Woods the CEO, I believe he was on CNBC on Friday, and he said, We use lean times like we had beginning of the early on in COVID and the months after to really keep our CapEx programs going, keep exploring to prepare ourselves for the eventual good times like we have today. If you look at ExxonMobil's history, it's an energy giant, but it's also one of the most innovative companies out there. They've always been really great capital allocators.
This is just proving the point that, if you can survive the boom and bust cycles of the energy space, which ExxonMobil has done very successfully for decades, you can do quite well as an investor. I love this, I'm looking at this chart. We're beating too much on Meta, I get it, but it was like a year ago, Meta stock price market capitalization was three times the size of Exxon's. Exxon is now on the verge of being twice the market cap of Meta and that happened in the space of about a year. Think about the turnaround there, but really impressive results. I saw that they raised their dividend. Again, this is of course a long time dividend payer Dividend Aristocrat company so you have that as well.
Chris Hill: Teladoc Health's loss in the third quarter was smaller than expected. Shares of Teladoc up more than 20 percent this week Jason, is the worst if it over?
Jason Moser: Well, I don't want to make a call, but it does feel like we may be finally getting past this mess of an acquisition when they decided to buy Livongo a couple of years ago. The good news is there was no further goodwill impairment this go-round. Maybe we're on the other side of this thing and then get back to focusing on the core business. I think the results were very respectable, revenue was up 17 percent from a year ago to $611 million. The biggest driver of that growth continues to be BetterHelp, their direct-to-consumer mental health brand. That grew over 35 percent compared to the previous year. I think on that note to as much as I hammered them on that Livongo deal because I do, BetterHelp has grown and scaled so quickly and so effectively. It's working now at a run rate of one billion dollars in revenue. Now think about that for a second, they bought it for $4.5 million back in 2015. Livongo, maybe not so great.
Matt Argersinger: You're saying it's the opposite of the Livongo acquisition.
Jason Moser: It's the George Costanza of Livongo's and it's at least something to remember. They ended the quarter with total US paid members, 57.8 million versus 52.5 million a year ago, visit fee only 24.3 million versus 23.6 million a year ago, and average US revenue per member per month was $2.61, that was up nine percent from $2.40 a year ago. Utilization, 22.3 percent up from 21 percent a year ago as well. We're seeing signs that the business is starting to normalize, they talked about pipeline development really taking a turn for the better and in a great position here for the remainder of year and going into 2023, getting through some unforced errors in a difficult macro environment, but I still like what they're doing.
Chris Hill: I don't think any of us believe that a company being acquired is reason enough to buy shares of a company. That being said, when you look at where Teladoc Health is today, do you think it is an acquisition target?
Jason Moser: I'm sure there are folks out there that would like to own it, but I think that Teladoc management would much prefer to be able to forge their own paths. I don't suspect we'll see that, but it's an attractive asset.
Chris Hill: Shares of Intel up 10 percent on Friday after third-quarter profits came in higher-than-expected. The chipmaker also told investors it plans to reduce costs by up to $10 billion over the next three years. Cost-cutting is often music to Wall Street ears Matt.
Matt Argersinger: It is, but to me it's never the panacea to what looks like a pretty steady downtrend for Intel's business. I was looking at the results and trying to figure out, where the good news is and why investor-
Jason Moser: Why is the stock up?
Matt Argersinger: Revenue 15.3 billion down 15 percent year-over-year, adjusted net income down 60 percent from a year ago. I wonder if it's one of the situations where investors just were expecting much worse and it wasn't as bad as they thought, so the stock is up. This is a business that probably could be more efficient so I think that's a good story. If they can save three billion in cost reductions by 2023, maybe 8-10 billion in cost savings by the end of 2025 is what they're outlining. You also have a dividend, by the way, right now that's yielding over five percent. If you're an investor, maybe right now at today's price, there's not a lot that has to go right to really earn a nice return if you have that dividend in place, which they seem like they're going to defend and if they can bring some efficiencies and the business brings some costs down and this cycle comes back, the semi-cycle comes back in a year or two, maybe that works out for Intel.
Chris Hill: Not to be overly cynical, but this is one of those announcements that any company, not just Intel, can go back to over the next three years. This is something they can point to six, 12 months from now and say, Hey, by the way, we made that announcement in late 2022 and so far this year, this is what we've done toward that goal.
Matt Argersinger: Right. It's equivalent to sometimes a new CEO comes in and decides toss this kitchen sink out, we're cutting all these costs, business is going to be lean, but guess what? We can look back a year or two from now and say, Hey, that's when we made the business more efficient, look at our margins today, the business has come back. That's probably what's happening with Intel.
Chris Hill: Chipotle's third-quarter profits came in higher than expected, but customer visits fell and shares of the Burrito Company down a bit this week. Jason, I say this not just as someone who host this show, but also as a shareholder, it is fascinating to watch CEO Brian Niccol and his team continue to walk this line of managing inflation while also managing price increases, they're passing along to customers.
Jason Moser: Yeah. They do a very effective job of it. In with around 3,100 stores today, the management sees an opportunity for this business to get to 7,000 stores in total. Now, if you think that's optimistic, which I do, so let's discount that 20 percent that's still around 5,600 stores they could potentially get to, I think likely will. To me, I think that helps make some sense of today's valuation, get a Burrito maker trading at like 44 times forward earnings. Sounds like a lot, but there's a lot of growth to be had there and they make good foods. When you look at the numbers, I think that really tells us a lot, sales were up 14 percent for the quarter $2.2 billion and that was driven by a 7.6% percent comp versus a year ago.
The in-store sales grew by 22 percent, digital sales represented 37 percent. If that sounds a little low, it is, but that's a sign that people are getting back out there and I think that's a good thing. Restaurant level margin 25.3 percent, that was up 180 basis points from a year ago and ultimately adjusted earnings $9.51, up 35 percent from last year, opened 43 new restaurants, 30 of those with Chipotlanes. Again, speaking to that convenience digital ordering, trying to be wherever the consumer wants them to be, they now have 30 million rewards members up from 24.5 million just a year ago. They continue with modest share repurchases, but ultimately that just offsets dilution.
The balance sheet remains in great shape over $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents. To your point, they're managing the costs and inflation along with pricing yet it does continue to create headwinds. They've seen costs go up 20 percent over the last two years. They just effectively, just methodically pass-through little price increases here and there that customers continue to pay for. Then finally, Chipotle, the tech company I'm really looking forward to seeing how this chippy thing plays out. Talk about your chipmakers. Chip is autonomous chipmaking, like this thing it's a chip making robot. I'm not talking about IT chips Matt, I'm talking about those sausage.
Matt Argersinger: I like those chips so much better, they are important chips.
Jason Moser: I think it's just going to be fun to watch this play out. There is a very innovative management team, they try new things as a lot of fun. I'm happy to continue owning these shares.
Chris Hill: There was a point in time when the growth story for Chipotle involved other cuisines, the Shophouse concept, they were, I think kicking around a burger concept, that thing. Do you get any sense from Brian Niccol that that is something even on the back burner that they are considering or is that completely off their radar?
Jason Moser: I don't get any sense that he has any interest in it at all. I say that as someone I loved those other efforts. I thought they made some really good food, there were tremendous offerings, but it's encouraging to see that he really is going to focus on the core concept here.
Chris Hill: Breakfast. Where are we on Breakfast?
Jason Moser: We've been asking that for years.
Chris Hill: I know.
Jason Moser: Been waiting for it for years.
Chris Hill: But unlike the other concepts where you could find people who would take a bearish outlook and ultimately the company just decided to put those things away. Who's bearish on breakfast?
Jason Moser: Feels like the biggest no brainer in the history. No brainers, Chris.
Chris Hill: Global same-store sales for McDonald's rose 9.5 percent in the third-quarter, helping to push shares to a new all-time high. Matt, unlike a lot of restaurant chains, including Chipotle, McDonald's, seeing an increase in customer traffic.
Matt Argersinger: Yeah. Great results for McDonald's. The one disadvantage McDonald's has by being such a global company versus a Chipotle, which still as far as I know, mostly a North American story, even though their global comp sales were up 9.5 percent, and US comp sales were up six percent, overall revenue was actually down five percent because you got the stronger dollar, lower traffic in a lot of the international stores. That was affecting them a little bit. Operating profits were actually down four percent, but again, in constant currencies, up four percent. McDonald's is, the growing pains of being a very large company that scales across the globe is affecting it a little bit. But those things are outside of management's control, and I'd say can't control currencies or what happens in the macro economy. The results are fantastic from an operating basis. Also raised their dividend 10 percent, so a brand as mature as McDonald's doing this well is really impressive.
Chris Hill: What about these comments that CEO Chris Kempczinski made on the call about the McRib, where he referred to it as the goat of sandwiches and compared it to Michael Jordan and Tom Brady?
Matt Argersinger: Maybe a stretch of the tad stretch I've actually never heard the McRib, so I can't speak to its qualities. But well, to me, there's the question of like really, this is the greatest sandwich of all-time? Also, McDonald's is not in the McRib business, they are in the burger business. On another level, I just find it odd that he was essentially just pushing aside all the burgers and just saying, now there's limited-time offer sandwich we roll out once in a great while. That's the greatest of all time. I was like, really? That seems like a bad message to send.
Chris Hill: It might be, but can't argue with the results so far. Just like stocks, some Halloween candies are overvalued, while others are flat out undervalued. After the break, we've got our picks for overrated an underrated Halloween candies, as well as a couple of stocks on our radar so stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here in studio with Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger. Tis the season guys, Halloween, just hours away actually. As we do every year, let's talk about some overrated and underrated candies, because they're not all fairly rated. Matt, I'll start with you. What is an overrated Halloween candy, in your opinion?
Matt Argersinger: Got to be Jolly Ranchers. They're small, they're cheap. People throw them in your bag. They take forever to consume. They make your mouth turn green and blue for hours.
Chris Hill: They're not chocolate.
Matt Argersinger: No, they're not chocolate. I have to sit there and suck on one for an hour before I get to my next piece of candy, which is inconvenient.
Jason Moser: I understand where you're coming from because it's a very polarizing candy, but it's a true story. I made a new year's resolution, one year, several years back to my wife to stop eating Jolly Ranchers because I couldn't stop I had a ball of those things. I'd throw 20 of them in there during a day because they're so fruity and delightful.
Matt Argersinger: But unsatisfying, so you have to keep eating.
Jason Moser: You're right. That's why ultimately I made that resolution, and I will say I fulfilled that resolution, and now my hankering for Jolly Ranchers is almost non-existent.
Chris Hill: On some level, were you telling yourself you were eating fruit, you were eating something healthy?
Jason Moser: No.
Chris Hill: There's vitamin C, maybe.
Jason Moser: No I think I was just in denial that I had a problem.
Chris Hill: What do you think is overrated?
Jason Moser: For me, this one came right to top of mind, Twizzlers. When I see the commercial even, I don't get it. It's like chewing on a shoe. I don't care what flavor, whether it's licorice, or strawberry, or cherry, whatever, I don't get the attraction to Twizzlers. You find them in those variety bags. It's thrown away. They're not good.
Matt Argersinger: My parents alone loved Twizzlers. They accidentally left a bag of the long Twizzlers open. I don't know if it was on the floor or something, but their dog consumed it. This just a week ago, consumed an entire bag of large Twizzlers.
Jason Moser: At least it wasn't chocolate.
Matt Argersinger: Yeah. The dog is still alive.
Chris Hill: Let's go to the other side Matt. What do you think is an underrated candy?
Matt Argersinger: Rolos. I'm not even a caramel fan, but Rolos, I love the taste that come in a little gold wrapping, which always feels great, but I just feel like I don't know where they've gone. I don't see Rolos that much anymore.
Chris Hill: I will say this about Rolos. I'm blanking on who makes them, but they clearly hit on something good and they just decided, no, we don't need to innovate. It's not like Mondelez with Oreos, where it's like, let's just try new flavors, no. We've got a hit on our hands, we're just going to keep making this here.
Matt Argersinger: No need to innovate.
Chris Hill: What about you, Jason?
Jason Moser: Chris, I get so sized for Whatchamacallit. I can't understand how we don't see them in every variety bag, everywhere. The big candy bars, I think in mini form they would be even better. It takes me back to my childhood. You remember the original Whatchamacallit that didn't have a caramel in it, now that has the caramel and it's still delicious. I just don't understand how this is not a candy we see everywhere. Whenever I find those things in my kid's trick or treat baskets, they're junior and senior in high school, but they still somehow come on with candy. I'm looking for those things. I'll sneak them, I'm not scared.
Chris Hill: Well, they're not listening to this show, so they don't know probably that you're sneaking them. This weekend we have an episode dedicated to the business of candy, because as any Hershey shareholder can tell you, it can be a very lucrative business for shareholders. One of the things they're doing on that episode is power rankings of Halloween candy. Let's go to our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, who's going to be on that episode with his power rankings of candy. But Dan underrated, overrated, any thoughts here either way?
Dan Boyd: I just want to echo that both Jolly Ranchers and Twizzlers are completely trashed here. Throw them directly in the garbage, no need. I want to echo my sentiment from previous years of this, Chris, and remind everybody that the Milky Way is a joke of a product, just completely awful. Just get a Snickers, it's ten times better. Then as far as underrated candies, I want to go with the humble Payday here. The peanut and caramel combination, I think is extremely strong.
Chris Hill: Love and, can't improve on that. Let's get to the stocks on our radar. Dan, I'll hit you with a question. Matt, you're up first, what are you looking at this?
Matt Argersinger: I'm going with one, and I'm sure a lot of listeners haven't heard of, its Lennox International ticker, LII. It's actually been around since 1895. They were pioneer in the business of forced air heating for homes, but they make and distribute HVAC and refrigeration products. Record results in the third quarter. They are a dividend night, which means they have beaten the market over the last 10 years and raised the dividend by more than 10 percent annually over the last 10 years. Since their IPO in 1999, up 1,800 percent versus the market, which is up only about 350 percent. Big time performer.
Chris Hill: Impressive stuff. Dan, question about Lennox International?
Dan Boyd: I don't know about the company, but man, the dividend night label is quickly becoming my favorite way to look at stocks. Is this stock dividend night? Then it sounds pretty good to me.
Chris Hill: Jason Moser, what are you looking at this week?
Jason Moser: Yeah, a company called SiTime. Ticker is SITM. SiTime specializes in designing precision timing MicroElectroMechanical Systems, or MEMS for short.
Matt Argersinger: Wow.
Jason Moser: Not to be confused with some metrics we discussed earlier in the week, like perhaps DTRG or something like that. But regardless, this is a smaller, more efficient chips essentially is what they are. Rugged, accurate, durable, effective. It's really about moving away from coats and toward silicone, which is a better timing keeping mechanism. It's better than the legacy courts-base system. That's what SiTime focuses on their solutions. They're used for everything from data centers, to communications, companies, to those personal devices that we have in our pocket, Chris. As the world moves toward more technology, faster means of communication, the more connected we become, the more MEMS timing systems are going to be required to make all this happen, which just plays right into their wheelhouse. Earnings for SiTime out on Wednesday, November 2nd, given the challenges we've seen in the greater semiconductor space, it will be noteworthy to hear what they had to say.
Chris Hill: Dan, question about SiTime?
Dan Boyd: Now, Jason to say that this market is somewhat saturated is a little bit of an understatement when it comes to chips and your various silicone processors and everything. What about SiTime makes it special and interesting for investing other than a Taiwan Semiconductor.
Jason Moser: Well, I think ultimately it's that specialization in moving away from cords to silicone. Their thesis, and this is one that seems to be playing out is it is even more superior time keeping device and so that's what they're playing into. They sell their chips to big distributors who then sell to end customers. It's worth noting that Apple really is one of their largest end customers, if not the largest end customer,.
Chris Hill: What do you want to add to your watchlist, Dan?
Dan Boyd: In no surprise, I'm going to go with the dividend night, go with Lennox International.
Matt Argersinger: There you go, Dan.
Chris Hill: Matt Argersinger, Jason Moser, thanks for being here, guys.
Jason Moser: Thank you.
Matt Argersinger: Thanks, Chris.
Chris Hill: I'm Chris Hill. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next time.

2022-11-05 00:00:00+00:00,Is Intel's Juicy 5% Dividend Safe?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-intels-juicy-5-dividend-safe,,,"Investors often have different goals for stocks in their portfolios; some want growth, some want resilience, and others want dividends. Given Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ: INTC) attractive 5.1% dividend yield, investors looking for yield might be attracted to the stock.
However, there are many more considerations than just a company's yield. So let's dive into Intel and see if it's worth your investment.
Weakness in a division that should be strong
Intel is no longer focused solely on providing components to the PC market; it's also pursuing data centers as an additional vertical. However, its client computing group (aka consumer PCs) remains its largest segment, and it played a part in Intel's 15% year-over-year non-GAAP revenue decline to $15.3 billion. (Q3 2021 results included a business segment that was spun off.)
SEGMENT Q3 REVENUE YOY GROWTH
Client Computing Group $8.1 billion (17%)
Data Center and AI Group $4.2 billion (27%)
Network and Edge Group $2.3 billion 14%
Source: Intel. Note: Emerging business segments are not included in this table.
Management noted that an industrywide slowdown is affecting its business in both client computing and data centers, but is this true? After all, one of Intel's primary competitors, Advanced Micro Devices, saw its Q3 data center revenue rise 45% year over year, while its client revenue (similar to Intel's Client Computing Group) fell 40%.
Intel is telling one story and its competition is telling another. I think investors should be wary of Intel's Data Center and AI Group's affect on the business, because data centers are still in high demand, as AMD's results reflect. For further proof, the big three cloud computing providers have also discussed ramping up, not slowing down, data center buildouts.
Client computing will always ebb and flow with demand, and it makes sense that this segment is weakening during a time when consumers have less discretionary income due to inflation.
So while sales aren't moving in the right direction, is the dividend in trouble?
Intel has no earnings to pay its dividends
Revenue eventually trickles down to earnings, which a company can pay out as dividends. Obviously, if Intel's revenue shrinks to zero, there will be no money with which to pay dividends. The odds of this happening are low, but investors need to see Intel return to at least a revenue maintenance level, or earnings could take a severe hit.
Earnings per share (EPS) were $0.25, down 85% from last year's level. With a quarterly dividend payment of $0.365 per share, that indicates a payout level of 146%, meaning Intel's earnings don't cover the dividend. However, earnings rise and fall throughout the year, and with fourth-quarter EPS projected to be about a $0.10 loss, Intel's dividend payout source is running dry.
To counteract these falling earnings, Intel announced efforts to reduce operating expenses and the cost of goods sold. Intel expects to save $3 billion in 2023 and $8 billion to $10 billion annually by 2025. For reference, Intel's trailing 12-month cost of goods sold was $37 billion, and operating expenses were $24 billion.
This effort will help save Intel's dividend, but it might not prevent a cut. When a dividend payout ratio rises too high, the business that pays it has to choose whether to reduce the dividend or burn cash to fund it. With Intel's cash and short-term investment balance of $22.5 billion, it could fund its dividends for less than four years before draining its coffers.
It's not advisable to run the balance sheet to zero, so the company will need to get its spending under control to produce tangible profits quickly. But we don't know yet whether Intel can do it, which is why I can't recommend its stock right now despite its juicy dividend.
Stocks only end up with a high dividend yield because of increased risk, which is the situation Intel is in right now. It might make an excellent investment if it can successfully turn the business around. However, Intel's track record has been atrocious: The stock's total return is 67% versus the S&P 500's 230% over the past decade.
Intel has a long way to go before righting the ship, and I won't be personally invested if it does.

2022-11-04 00:00:00+00:00,"AMD's Ryzen 7000 CPUs Aren't Selling Well, According to Amazon",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amds-ryzen-7000-cpus-arent-selling-well-according-to-amazon,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has made a habit of impressing reviewers and customers alike with each of its Ryzen desktop CPU launches over the past five years. The problem the company is facing with its latest Ryzen 7000 chips is not that they aren't good products. They certainly are. The problem is that pricing is completely out of touch with reality.
Amazon ranks its top-selling CPUs, and the good news for AMD is that its products occupy the top two spots. The bad news is that these best sellers are last-generation Ryzen 5000 chips. The first Ryzen 7000 chip on the list is the high-end $699 7950X in the No. 16 spot. You must go down to the No. 22 spot to find the next one, the $399 7700X. The mid-range 7600X, which goes for $299 and should logically be selling more units than its pricier siblings, falls into the No. 34 spot.
This is a single data point, but I think it's safe to say that the Ryzen 7000 launch has not been a rip-roaring success.
Competing with Intel and itself
The first major problem for AMD is Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) Raptor Lake chips. Intel has taken an aggressive approach to pricing, and the result is a lopsided competitive landscape. Tom's Hardware ran Intel's 13700K chip through its paces, finding that not only did it beat AMD's entire Ryzen 7000 lineup in single-threaded tests, but that it was also 35% faster in multi-threaded workloads compared to the similarly priced 7700X.
Intel's price-to-performance advantage is even bigger than it appears because building a system around a Ryzen 7000 chip is also more expensive. Motherboards on the AMD side are pricy, and while AMD's Ryzen 7000 series requires DDR5 DRAM, Intel's Raptor Lake supports cheaper DDR4 DRAM. Factoring in the full cost of building a system, the pricing discrepancy grows.
On top of competing with Raptor Lake, AMD and its customers have an inventory problem. Demand for PCs plunged nearly 20% in the third quarter, leaving the supply chain with excessive inventory levels. AMD and its partners need to clear out last-gen Ryzen 5000 chips, and the only real option is aggressive price cuts.
The top-selling CPU on Amazon is the Ryzen 5600X, which is now selling for nearly 50% off list price. The No. 2 seller is the Ryzen 5900X with a steep 39% discount. Notably, the No. 3 seller is Intel's 13600K, a Raptor Lake CPU.
Customers with older CPUs looking to upgrade have little reason to choose AMD's latest chips. In addition to Raptor Lake being a better choice in nearly every scenario, rock-bottom pricing on last-gen AMD chips takes any remaining wind out of Ryzen 7000's sails.
Take the Ryzen 7600X as an example. Tom's Hardware found it delivered 25% faster single-threaded performance and 34% faster multi-threaded performance than the Ryzen 5600X. But as it stands today, the 7600X is nearly twice the price of the 5600X.
Price cuts are probably inevitable, but not for a while
Oversupply of its Ryzen 5000 chips has put AMD in a tough spot. The company needs to clear out those older chips, but cutting prices on its newer Ryzen 7000 chips would not help that cause. Unfortunately, without price cuts, Intel's Raptor Lake is the clear choice for most people looking to upgrade to a brand new CPU.
AMD is going to have to eventually cut prices on its Ryzen 7000 CPUs if it wants to prevent Intel from clawing back market share. There's just no way around it. But the company will likely have to wait until the inventory situation improves. Intel is also suffering from supply chain inventory issues, but the company seems to be weathering those better than AMD. The top four best-selling Intel CPUs on Amazon are all Raptor Lake models.
Once AMD clears out its older Ryzen chips and demand for PCs stabilizes, the company still must contend with Raptor Lake. Lose market share or cut prices, those are the two options. Either way, AMD's margins will be negatively affected.

2022-11-03 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Stock: Bear vs. Bull,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-stock%3A-bear-vs.-bull,,,"Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) stock price rose 4% in after-hours trading on Tuesday, Nov. 1, following its third-quarter earnings report. The chipmaker's revenue increased 29% year over year to $5.57 billion, which missed analysts' estimates by $80 million. Its adjusted net income grew 23% to $1.10 billion, or $0.67 per share, which was just shy of the consensus forecast by $0.03.
AMD's earnings miss wasn't surprising, since it already partly revealed those growth rates in its preliminary earnings report on Oct. 6. Let's weigh the bear and bull cases for AMD to see if this semiconductor stock is still worth buying.
Image source: AMD.
What the bears saw in AMD's Q3 report
The bears will point out that AMD's year-over-year growth rates were inflated by its acquisition of Xilinx this February. On a sequential basis, AMD's revenue rose 11% in the second quarter and declined 15% in Q3, and it expects roughly flat growth in the fourth quarter. As this table illustrates, AMD's sequential slowdown was caused by the weakness of its client segment, which sells its Ryzen CPUs for desktops and notebooks; and its gaming segment, which sells its Radeon GPUs for PCs and custom APUs for gaming consoles. Both businesses were hit hard by declining sales of PCs in a post-pandemic world.

The embedded segment's revenue surged year over year, thanks to Xilinx, but only grew slightly on a sequential basis. The data center business, which sells its Epyc CPUs and high-end GPUs for servers, continues to grow, but it can't offset the ongoing slowdown of the PC market. IDC expects global shipments of personal computing devices (PCs and tablets) to drop 10.8% this year, dip another 2.3% in 2023, and finally recover (but remain below pre-pandemic levels) in 2024.
AMD expects its revenue to rise about 43% to $23.5 billion this year, but analysts anticipate less than 10% growth in 2023 as it grapples with slower PC sales and laps its acquisition of Xilinx. Its adjusted earnings are expected to increase 29% this year and grow another 8% in 2023.
What the bulls saw in AMD's Q3 report
The bulls will note that even though AMD's revenue growth is cooling off, it still expects its adjusted gross margin to expand from 48% in 2021 to about 52% in 2022 as it generates a lower percentage of its revenue from the lower-margin client and gaming divisions. They'll also point out that while AMD's total adjusted operating margin fell sequentially and year over year to 23% in the third quarter, its data center and embedded segments' operating margins still improved year over year:

AMD also generates much higher operating margins than its rival, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which saw its adjusted operating margin drop 21 percentage points year over year to 11% in its latest quarter. AMD generates a higher operating margin than Intel (even though it sells cheaper chips and has a lower gross margin) because it outsources its manufacturing to third-party contract chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). Intel manufactures most of its chips at its own foundries.
AMD is also growing at much faster clip than Intel, which expects its revenue to drop 19%-20% (14%-16% on an adjusted basis) this year as its adjusted EPS tumbles 64%. AMD's decision to outsource its production to TSMC also enabled it to pull ahead of Intel in the ""process race"" to manufacture smaller and denser chips -- and that technological leap has driven its market-share gains against Intel over the past few years.
Simply put, AMD and Intel both face cyclical headwinds as the PC market cools off. But when that cyclical downturn finally ends, AMD could be better positioned for a quick comeback than Intel, which continues to pour tens of billions of dollars into technological upgrades to catch up to TSMC. AMD and Intel both trade at about 15 times forward earnings. That low valuation should limit AMD's downside potential, but Intel arguably deserves an even lower valuation in light of its latest challenges.
Which argument makes more sense?
I believe the bullish case for AMD makes more sense than the bearish case at these levels. AMD's growth will decelerate significantly next year, but it doesn't face any of the existential challenges that are plaguing Intel. The latter is also on its third CEO in just over four years, while AMD has been helmed by a visionary engineer and CEO -- Dr. Lisa Su -- over the past eight years as it reinvented its CPU and GPU businesses. AMD might not be the best semiconductor stock to buy right now, since it's heavily exposed to the sluggish PC market, but its long-term prospects look bright and its stock is dirt cheap.

2022-11-03 00:00:00+00:00,"AI chip startup SiMa.ai launches auto business with former Bosch, Mercedes executive",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ai-chip-startup-sima.ai-launches-auto-business-with-former-bosch-mercedes-executive,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
OAKLAND, Calif., Nov 3 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley-based AI chip startup SiMa.ai on Thursday said it is entering the automotive industry and has recruited Harald Kroeger, a former executive at top tier auto supplier Bosch and Mercedes Benz MBGn.DE, to lead that business.
Kroeger, who is on the board of electric pickup truck firm Rivian RIVN.O, will join SiMa.ai’s board, which includes top chip industry executives Moshe Gavrielov, a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. 2330.TW board member, and Lip‑Bu Tan, an Intel INTC.O board member.
The announcement comes as chip makers' competition in the automotive industry intensifies with Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, and Intel’s recently listed Mobileye MBLY.O all vying for car makers.
SiMa.ai’s main product called MLSoC, short for machine learning system on chip, processes video and images, an important technology for assisted and self-driving technology.
""I was on the knife's edge,"" said Krishna Rangasayee, CEO of SiMa.ai about the decision to enter the automotive market which he noted can take years to generate revenue from.
“Automotive is 40% of the overall market from a computer vision perspective...Now that we have established our technology, I thought it was the right bet to focus on automotive.”
Kroeger said the focus would be on assisted driving rather than self-driving technology. But SiMa.ai has also been talking to some self-driving tech firms, said Rangasayee.
Even in assisted driving, as car makers want to offer technology that does more than just keep the lanes or distance between cars, Kroeger said a more advanced machine learning-based technology was needed and a more power efficient chip was also key.
""If you looked at today's products in the market right now, some of those things in the cars use up to two kilowatts of power, which means you could fry some eggs in the car on that dissipation power,"" he said.

2022-11-03 00:00:00+00:00,Is Intel Stock a Buy Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-intel-stock-a-buy-now-0,,,"Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) stock jumped 11% on Oct. 28 after the chipmaker posted its third-quarter earnings report. Its revenue declined 20% year over year (and fell 15% on an adjusted basis, which excludes the ongoing divestment of its NAND business) to $15.3 billion, which matched analysts' expectations. Its adjusted earnings dropped 59% to $0.59 per share but still cleared the consensus forecast by $0.26.
For the full year, Intel expects its revenue to drop 19% to 20% (14% to 16% on an adjusted basis), compared to its prior forecast for 9% to 13% decline, as it faces ""continued macroeconomic headwinds."" It expects its adjusted EPS to decline 64%, compared to its previous forecast for a 58% decline.
Image source: Intel.
Those headline numbers were dismal, but investors had already tempered their expectations after AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and other chipmakers warned of the PC market's slowdown in a post-pandemic market. A lot of those concerns had already caused Intel's stock to shed more than 40% of its value over the past 12 months.
Instead, investors seemed to mainly focus on Intel's planned cost-cutting measures and its recent spinoff of Mobileye (NASDAQ: MBLY), which raised $861 million for its former parent in its IPO. But will those streamlining strategies set a floor under Intel's plummeting stock and make it a compelling long-term investment again?
What happened to Intel?
Over the past several years, Intel struggled with chip shortages and product delays as it fell behind TSMC (NYSE: TSM) in the ""process race"" to manufacture smaller and denser chips. Those problems caused Intel to lose ground to AMD -- which outsourced the production of its CPUs to TSMC -- in the desktop and notebook markets. Intel also grappled with jarring management changes as it tried to resolve those issues; it's now on its third CEO in just over four years.
The pandemic still boosted Intel's sales as more consumers upgraded their PCs to work from home, attend online classes, and play higher-end games. The elevated usage of cloud-based services during that period also prompted data centers to upgrade their chips. As a result, Intel's revenue and adjusted EPS still increased 8% and 9%, respectively, in 2020.
Unfortunately, the cracks started to appear again as those tailwinds dissipated. Instead of becoming a fabless chipmaker like AMD, Intel doubled down on upgrading its plants to catch up to TSMC by 2025. As a result, its expenses started rising as its revenue growth cooled off. Its adjusted revenue grew just 2% in 2021 as its adjusted EPS increased 7%.
Those headwinds have intensified in 2022
Intel generated 53% of its revenue from its client computing group (CCG) in the third quarter. The data center and AI (DCAI) segment brought in 27% of its revenues, while another 15% came from its network and edge (NEX) group. The remaining 5% came from its other smaller businesses.
Over the past year, the CCG segment has struggled with the slowdown of the PC market. Inflation and other macroeconomic headwinds have also caused its data center customers (especially in China) to curb their spending.

These headwinds could persist for the foreseeable future. IDC expects global shipments of personal computing devices (PCs and tablets) to drop 10.8% this year and dip another 2.3% in 2023, while the Biden Administration's recent export ban on advanced semiconductors to China will make it even more difficult for its data center business to recover.
Reining in its spending to cope with that slowdown
But there's a silver lining: that slowdown is forcing Intel to rein in its aggressive spending plans. It reduced its full-year capex forecast to just $21 billion, compared to its prior target of $27 billion, and CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company would take ""aggressive actions to reduce costs"" and ""optimize our headcount"" during the conference call. Intel's gross and operating margins still declined year over year in the third quarter, but they improved sequentially as its spending slowed down.

During the call, CFO Dave Zinsner said Intel could grow its gross margin toward 51% to 53% in the ""short term"" and toward the 60s over a ""multiyear journey"" as its operating margins rise into the 40s.
Is it the right time to buy Intel?
Intel's stock might seem cheap at 15 times this year's adjusted earnings, and it pays an attractive forward dividend yield of 5%. But it also hasn't given investors any compelling reasons to buy its stock -- its core markets are sputtering out, it still remains far behind TSMC in the process race, and cutting costs probably won't help it generate any near-term sales growth. Investors should stay away from Intel for now, especially when plenty of better semiconductor stocks are still on sale.

When investors think of tech stocks, they don’t often think of dividends. And dividend investors don’t often think about tech stocks. However, there are undervalued tech stocks with dividends that are worth focusing on.
In fact, there are a handful of tech stocks with low valuations and attractive dividends. Of course, not all tech stocks with nice dividends are worth buying, but a handful of them certainly are.
As investors continue to fish for a low in the stock market, many of these stocks are worth buying on pullbacks by the market.
Regardless of what the Fed is doing or how stocks are trading, businesses in the U.S. remain relatively healthy. Although the demand for their  products and services is easing somewhat, they are generally holding up well.
Let’s look at several tech stocks with dividends right now.
Ticker Company Current Price
AVGO Broadcom $448
IBM International Business Machines $135
INTC Intel $27.80
HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise $13.80
CSCO Cisco Systems $43.65
Undervalued Tech Stocks With Dividends: Broadcom (AVGO)

Chip stocks have had a hard time recently, as this group has been pulverized in 2022. However, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a name worth considering.
At its current prices, Broadcom offers a unique combination of stability, value and yield.
Analysts, on average, expect AVGO to deliver 21% revenue growth this year and 6% growth next year. That’s alongside average forecasts calling for 34% and 8% earnings growth this year and next year, respectively.
Broadcom is trading at an attractive 12 times this year’s earning. While it’s possible that analysts’ mean forecasts won’t prove accurate, the fact that analysts are upbeat on AVGO is positive.
Add in the stock’s 3.5% dividend yield, and  AVGO is poised to succeed. If AVGO stock revisits the low $400s, it will be hard to ignore.
Undervalued Tech Stocks With Dividends: International Business Machines (IBM)

So many investors are obsessed with tech stocks, but most of them overlook the dinosaurs of the sector. One such dinosaur is International Business Machines (NASDAQ:IBM).
No one seems to give this stock any love, yet they are ignoring the obvious: IBM has been a relative strength leader!
Given that fact, it may be an under-the-radar find for some investors.
Analysts, on average, expect 5% revenue growth from IBM this year alongside 15% earnings growth. That’s very high for IBM, as those who have followed this stock for the last decade know. As for next year, analysts expect about 6% earnings growth on sub-1% revenue growth.
At current prices, investors are paying about 15 times earnings and collecting a 4.8% dividend yield. When I last looked at IBM stock about a month ago, it had a lower valuation and a higher yield, but the stock has rallied more than 13% since then
For the year, the shares are now up about  1% versus the Nasdaq’s 33% decline. Over the last 12 months, IBM is up 11.5% while the Nasdaq is down 35%.
How’s that for outperformance?
Undervalued Tech Stocks With Dividends: Intel (INTC)
Source: canon_shooter / Shutterstock.com
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has  been around forever and will likely remain around forever. However, its longevity can’t mask reality, which is rather bleak for the chipmaker at the moment.
Intel is not growing, as shown by its 15.5% year-over-year revenue decline in Q3. The sharp drop of global PC sales, identified by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). may continue.
Analysts’ estimates of Intel’s revenue growth could be better, but it has a 5.2% dividend yield and a healthy payout ratio. It recently raised more cash via the Mobileye (NASDAQ:MBLY) IPO, while INTC still holds some MBLY stock, and INTC will benefit if MBLY rises further.
All that said, I would love to see Intel fall below $25 before buying it. After the shares’ recent rally, their valuation is no longer as attractive as it once was. Plus, as we’re hearing from other semiconductor and chip companies, the sector is not doing well.
But Intel will survive the test of time.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)

PCs may be a problem, but not for Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). This company, is focused on “a cloud operating experience, built-in security, and optimized performance for your workloads to drive your business forward.”
That puts it in a different position than HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and leaves it in a well-suited to focus on other areas of tech. Unfortunately however,, growing has not been easy for HPE.
Analysts expect mild revenue and profit growth this year and next year, but on the plus side, their average estimates do call for top-and bottom-line gains. Further, the shares trade at a meager seven times earnings.
Consequently, HPE stock, which pays a 3.5% dividend yield, may be worth watching.
Cisco Systems (CSCO)
Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com
Finally, we have Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). While it was a darling of investors during the dot-com bubble 20 years ago, that has not been the case in recent years. Cisco has performed okay, but it has been anything but a runaway train.
However, Cisco may be worth an extra look amid the current downtrend.
Worth noting is that the stock trades at just 12.5 times this year’s earnings estimates and pays a 3.4% dividend yield. Cisco is not the most exciting name on this list, but its dependability and low valuation are worth focusing on.
On average, analysts expect 5% earnings and revenue growth from CSCO this year. However, in 2023, analysts’ mean outlook call for 7% earnings growth on and just 4% revenue growth. If CSCO can deliver that type of mid-level growth alongside a solid yield, then we may see the stock push higher over time.
A decline of the shares below $40 would have my attention even more.

2022-11-03 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Time to Buy the Dow Jones' 3 Worst-Performing Stocks This Year?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-time-to-buy-the-dow-jones-3-worst-performing-stocks-this-year-4,,,"Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 often track each other fairly closely over long periods of time, individual years can see their performance diverge by considerable amounts.
This year is one of those times. Whereas the S&P 500 is in bear market territory with a 20% loss in 2022, the Dow 30 stocks have lost just half that amount. That still means they're in market correction territory, but it probably wouldn't be as bad as it is if not for the index's technology components.
Image source: Getty Images.
While it's called the Dow Jones Industrial Average, it's been a long time since it tracked just the pulse of the U.S's biggest industrial companies. And this year, with another ""tech wreck"" in the making, the Dow's tech component is weighing heavily on its performance.
Of the 10 worst stocks in the index, 40% of them are tech stocks that have lost an average of 35% of their value. Two-thirds of the three worst Dow Jones stocks are also tech stocks. Let's see which -- if any -- are worth buying today.
Salesforce
Customer relationship management (CRM) specialist Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) has been performing so poorly this year that activist hedge fund Starboard Value has taken a ""significant"" but undisclosed stake in the stock. Shares are down 37% in 2022 and have lost almost half their value over the past 12 months.
Yet Starboard founder Jeff Smith sees opportunity in the fallen former tech growth stock and believes Salesforce can turn around its ""subpar mix of growth and profitability."" The CRM specialist has struggled in recent periods, in large part because of unfavorable currency exchange rates, as one-third of its revenue is generated in international markets.
While it's founded on helping companies maintain customer relationships and expanding sales, Salesforce has been an aggressive acquirer and has expanded into marketing, e-commerce, and data analytics. That hasn't helped its growth trajectory, however, even as co-CEO Marc Benioff maintains Salesforce is on track for $50 billion in annual sales in fiscal 2026.
Smith may see Salesforce as ""embedded in the fabric"" of its enterprise-class customers, but it's not a favorable market for business at the moment, and bucking the trend could be a difficult task for the tech company.
Image source: Getty Images.
Nike
The non-tech stock on this list is Nike (NYSE: NKE), which has lost 44% this year and is the second-worst performer on the Dow. Consumer spending has slowed under the weight of inflation at 40-year highs and elevated gas prices. With consumer prices far exceeding the income gains made in 2022, people are prioritizing putting food on the table and gas in the tank over buying sneakers that can run into the hundreds of dollars.
The slowdown caused a palpable build-up in Nike's inventory, which is forcing it to get promotional to bring those levels down, a move that's hurting profit margins. The sports apparel company slashed its margin outlook for the rest of the year as a result, and with a possible anemic Christmas shopping season just starting, the outlook for the immediate future is dreary.
Not everyone believes it's as bad as it seems, however. My colleague Jeremy Bowman thinks the sell-off in Nike stock is overdone, and he sees its shares as a ""screaming buy."" Growth may not be as strong as before, but sales are still growing, and Nike has some of the most recognizable brands on the market. Indeed, Brand Finance says Nike is still the world's most valuable apparel brand, and has been since the company consultant began tracking brand values.
I still find it difficult to see where Nike's inflection point is for the foreseeable future, as the Federal Reserve will certainly be stomping on the brakes of economic growth by raising interest rates further. Nike's not going away, but neither is now the time to be buying its stock.
Intel
Chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) might be rising in the wake of its own disappointing earnings results and those of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), which lowered its revenue forecast for the third quarter due to a significant weakening in the PC market.
But Wall Street really isn't expecting its turnaround roadmap to begin bearing fruit until next year at the earliest. Shares of Intel are down 45% this year, making it the worst-performing stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Intel is separating its manufacturing from its product group in a bid to create a fabless foundry infrastructure, which is a seemingly smart move by the tech giant, but it will take at least several years before it can grab any meaningful share of the market.
With spending by consumers and enterprise-level customers expected to slow further in the coming periods, investors may want to stay on the sidelines to see just how the significant cuts Intel's making to control costs play out. There should be plenty of time to move into the semiconductor stock in the future.

Nov 2 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O snatched more market share in the lucrative data center business from rival Intel Corp INTC.O in the third quarter, drawing praise from Wall Street analysts on Wednesday.
Its shares surged more than 3% in early trading as growth in demand for chips used in server processors helped AMD cushion a slump in the personal computer market, which makes up nearly a third of its revenue.
""(AMD) is delivering on their datacenter story, and Intel's rolling collapse has removed some of the constraints on the narrative,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note.
AMD forecast a 14% rise in fourth-quarter sales, which although below market expectations, was in sharp contrast to an expected sales decline at Intel and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O.
""We expect AMD's share gains to continue, as the company's upcoming, next-generation server CPUs are expected to outperform Intel's lineup across price/performance metrics,"" YipitData analyst Nathaniel Harmon said.
However, growth in the data center business too is slowing as its clients Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Microsoft MSFT.O have warned of a moderation in demand for cloud and data centers due to rising inflation.
Also, a recovery in the PC business seems distant, with Chief Executive Lisa Su saying that AMD expects the market will decline by another 10% in 2023.
Even in a weak PC market, some analysts said, AMD was under-shipping chips to clear up the supply chain and this could result in revenue gain next year.
""The team is significantly under-shipping to PC consumption to help flush channel inventories, which should help client revenues to start to inflect to the upside,"" according to J.P. Morgan analysts.
AMD's shares were trading at $61.58. They have lost more than half of their market value so far this year.

Along with its recent partial spinoff of self-driving car chip designer Mobileye, the announcement helped fuel a near 10% rally in Intel stock during the last week of October.
However, even with the post-earnings pop factored in, Intel stock is still down nearly 47% in 2022 -- and more than 65% from its all-time high reached in early 2020 before the start of the pandemic. As such, I believe it's still too early to call a bottom for Intel, let alone for a sustained rally to occur for this once-great tech manufacturing leader.
Understand how stocks are valued
Intel gets picked on a lot these days, and for good reason. The company missed the boat multiple times in the last couple decades. For example, it declined to work with Apple early on when it was first developing the iPhone. Then, in the 2010s, it got bogged down in its chip manufacturing upgrade cycles, and eventually lost its crown as the world's largest chipmaker. Intel first lost the title to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and then later to Samsung, as the world's largest chip company overall (as measured by annual revenue).
Once the pandemic struck and the global chip shortage started, it was boomtime for most semiconductor companies. But not for Intel, thanks to the aforementioned combination of factors that prevented it from taking advantage of unprecedented demand for PC, smartphone, and data center hardware. Shares have tanked in response as revenue first stagnated, and now Intel is in all-out retreat as a temporary oversupply in consumer electronics is bringing the industry back down to earth.

To be fair, what has happened to Intel this year isn't completely the company's fault. The U.S. Federal Reserve is also hiking interest rates at a record pace in an attempt to fight inflation. Higher interest rates lower the value of risky assets, such as stocks, which represent an ownership stake in a business. Those same interest rates are also used in assessing the future value of a business's cash-generating potential. And Intel's future profitability is anything but certain right now, which is a double whammy against the stock when paired with rising rates.
To illustrate where things are at right now, while Intel did report better-than-expected earnings for Q3, it still downgraded its full-year 2022 outlook. Earnings per share are now expected to be $2 (previously $2.57), and free cash flow is now expected to be negative $2 billion to negative $4 billion (previously negative $1 billion to negative $2 billion).
Intel's uphill battle is just getting started
Rising interest rates are another negative for Intel if you consider what the company is trying to accomplish right now. CEO Pat Gelsinger was brought in a couple of years ago to right the ship, but fixing a myriad of issues at a sprawling manufacturer takes a long time. Gelsinger calls it the IDM 2.0 strategy (integrated device manufacturing). It involves expanding the use of external foundries to manufacture some of Intel's own chip designs, but also opening up its own foundries for the manufacturing of its ""fabless"" chip design peers.
However, building a new fab, or even repurposing an existing one, takes years to complete. It also costs billions of dollars for each facility. Intel is no doubt going to get extensive help from the U.S. CHIPS Act (a $52 billion piece of legislation aimed at revitalizing U.S.-based chipmaking), but the company isn't the only one that will be applying for a slice of the pie. Even with a helping hand from Uncle Sam, Intel will have to shell out billions of dollars to pull off its IDM 2.0 reinvention of itself -- exactly at the moment financing is getting more expensive, thanks to those Fed rate hikes.
Additionally, Intel is not an agile organization anymore. Even hampered by its own issues, it still expects to haul in at least $63 billion in sales in 2022. And as of the end of September, Intel has cash and short-term investments of $22.6 billion, more than offset by total debt of $39.5 billion.
Gelsinger has boldly maintained that he foresees Intel retaking its technological crown by 2025. But even if it achieves that in a short two or three years, it's uncertain just how much of Intel will be left -- and how profitable that new Intel will be. After all, not only is the company losing ground on the sales front, but its profit margins are also being severely pressured as well.

I'm rooting for Intel. The world needs it and other chipmakers to strengthen global supply chains to secure the booming demand for semiconductors. But with Intel still slashing guidance and its future cash flows highly uncertain, it's still way too soon for me to feel comfortable making a purchase right now.

2022-11-02 00:00:00+00:00,AMD shares rise as chipmaker sees data center strength cushioning PC slowdown,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-shares-rise-as-chipmaker-sees-data-center-strength-cushioning-pc-slowdown,,,"Nov 2 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O snatched more share in the lucrative data center market from rival Intel Corp INTC.O in the third quarter, drawing praise from analysts and sparking a near 5% jump in its stock on Wednesday.
The company's continued expansion into server processors helped it cushion a deepening slump in the personal computer market, which makes up nearly a third of its revenue.
""(AMD) is delivering on their datacenter story, and Intel's rolling collapse has removed some of the constraints on the narrative,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note.
Santa Clara, California-based AMD's forecast for a 14% rise in fourth-quarter sales while below analysts' estimates also contrasted with expected declines at Intel and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O.
""We expect AMD's share gains to continue, as the company's upcoming, next-generation server CPUs are expected to outperform Intel’s lineup across price/performance metrics,"" YipitData analyst Nathaniel Harmon said.
But growth is slowing even in the data center business, echoing remarks from U.S. tech giants Amazon.com AMZN.O and Microsoft MSFT.O that decades-high inflation and weak consumer demand were taking a toll on cloud and datacenter spending.
The PC industry, reeling from a downturn after its pandemic boom, pressured AMD's earnings and the company also lost market share there to Intel.
A recovery in the business seems distant, with Chief Executive Lisa Su saying that AMD expects the PC market will decline by another 10% in 2023.
Some analysts, however, said the company was undershipping products even in a weak market and could see some upside next year.
""The team is significantly undershipping to PC consumption to help flush channel inventories, which should help client revenues to start to inflect to the upside,"" according to J.P. Morgan analysts.
AMD's shares were trading at $62.38 before the bell. They have lost more than half their market value this year.

2022-11-01 00:00:00+00:00,"AMD revenue forecast disappoints on PC, data center weakness",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-revenue-forecast-disappoints-on-pc-data-center-weakness,,,"adds shares, background, client segment revenue
Nov 1 (Reuters) - Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O on Tuesday forecast fourth-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates, saying a slowing PC market and data center business would weigh on its sales.
Shares of the company fell 3% in trading after the bell.
AMD, which makes CPUs and graphics processors for PCs, was hit hard when inflation roiled consumer demand for laptops and other gadgets, prompting electronics makers to cut orders for its chips.
That led AMD to lower its forecast for third-quarter revenue by about $1 billion last month.
According to Counterpoint Research, PC shipments will decline 13% this year. They fell 19.5% in the third quarter, according to research firm Gartner.
Moreover, weaker cloud spending signaled by a slowdown at tech companies including Amazon.com AMZN.O, Microsoft MSFT.O and Intel INTC.O have also raised concerns for the data center market.
More and more chip makers including Taiwan's TSMC 2330.TW, Micron Technology MU.O and Texas Instruments TXN.O have pointed to slowing demand, fanning fears of a deep semiconductor industry downturn next year.
The company expects current-quarter revenue to be $5.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Analysts on average expect revenue to be $5.85 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Revenue at its client segment, which includes chips for desktops, fell 40% to $1 billion during the third quarter.
