2022-09-07 00:00:00+00:00,Why AMD Stock Fell 10.2% in August,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amd-stock-fell-10.2-in-august,,,"What happened
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) fell 10.2% in August, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
August was a roller coaster of emotions for AMD investors as the company beat earnings and revenue expectations in its quarterly report but came up short in its third-quarter guidance. As a result, the company's stock began to fall from the first week of the month.
The chart below shows AMD's stock decline throughout August as investors prepared for a less-than-stellar third quarter.
AMD data by YCharts
So what
Technology stocks have been hit hard in 2022, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index down 34% year to date as rising inflation and fears of a recession have slowed consumer spending. AMD has been no different, with its stock down 47% in the same period. Multiple companies are grappling with similar losses as tech stocks fall out of favor with investors.
AMD shares fell 6% in after-hours trading on Aug. 2 after the company posted second-quarter results. The company reported 70% growth in revenue year over year, hitting $6.5 billion. However, its third-quarter forecasts fell below Wall Street estimates, with AMD forecasting around $6.7 billion and analysts expecting $6.81 billion. As for the whole year, AMD expects revenue to be around $26 billion.
The less-than-expected guidance overshadowed AMD's otherwise glowing quarter, as its stock continued to fall for the rest of the month. The company attributed its pessimistic forecasts to reduced PC demand. AMD CEO Lisa Su said in a conference call on Aug. 2 that the company expects PC business to decline in the ""mid-teen"" percentage range. Meanwhile, a week earlier, AMD's biggest competitor Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) downgraded its guidance for the market by 10%.
Now what
Despite losses in August, it's not all bad news for AMD. The company's market cap passed Intel's this year, with AMD's standing at $128.7 billion as of Sept. 7 and Intel's at $125.9 billion. Additionally, AMD said in a 2022 earnings call it had gained market share for nine consecutive quarters, having taken share from Intel.
Consequently, AMD's long-term outlook is more favorable than its stock price would have prospective investors think, especially considering how varied its business is. Despite weak PC demand, the company has seen promising growth in the gaming industry. AMD supplies semi-custom chips to Microsoft, Sony, and Valve, which allowed its gaming business to grow by 32% year over year in the second quarter to $1.7 billion. The chipmaker's data center business is also promising, with the company earning $1.05 a share on $6.55 billion in revenue for the period ending June 25, boosted by an 83% growth in data center sales.
AMD might have tumbled in August, but its stock looks like a great buy for investors in it for the long haul.

(NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are the two formidable names in the semiconductor industry. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, we placed these two semiconductor stocks against each other to discover which offers higher upside potential.
Making significant strides with its strong portfolio offerings in the highly lucrative server market, AMD, which boasts a market cap of $127.08 billion, recently surpassed Intel’s market cap, which is currently at $124.66 billion. Further, AMD is rapidly expanding its market share in the client and server central processing unit space, giving Intel fierce competition.
Positive Prospects in the Semiconductor Space
The latest Semiconductor Industry Association report sheds some insight into the sector. There was a 7.3% year-over-year rise to $49.0 billion in global semiconductor industry sales in July 2022. Geographically, semiconductor sales in the United States recorded the highest year-over-year rise of 20.9% compared to other regions. Further, the global semiconductor market is projected to surge by 13.9% over the prior year to $633 billion in 2022, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS).
The demand for semiconductor chips should continue to grow in several end-markets, thanks to the increasing popularity of hybrid work models and the growing dominance of artificial intelligence (AI).
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)
AMD delivered impressive second-quarter results on the back of persistent strength across all of the company’s business segments. Increasing sales of the data center and embedded products have been largely enhancing the top-line results.
The semiconductor company has shown its confidence in other markets by reiterating its 2022 revenue guidance amid the weakening personal computer (PC) market.
AMD has been seeing significant demand for its Ryzen and EPYC server processors. Boosting the Ryzen processor portfolio, the chip maker recently announced the launch of Ryzen 7000 Series desktop processors, powered by the new Zen 4 architecture, which will be available from September.
Is AMD a Good Stock to Buy?

Further, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers recently reiterated a Buy rating on the AMD stock. His price target of $130 for the AMD stock, represents 65.1% upside potential from current levels.
Similarly, financial bloggers opinions are 89% Bullish on AMD, above the sector average of 64%. TipRanks data shows that hedge funds are also bullish about the company, as they bought 1.3 million shares of AMD stock in the last quarter.
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)
Intel Corporation, on the other hand, posted disappointing earnings results for the second quarter, with both revenue and earnings declining from the year-ago period. The company has been grappling with higher costs, supply-chain disturbances, and cut-throat rivalry in the semiconductor space.
While AMD is busy expanding its market share, Intel has been struggling to launch its latest chips in the high-potential server market. Citing the sluggish PC market as a concern, Intel Corporation (INTC) also slashed its full-year guidance.
Meanwhile, Intel recently signed a $30 billion deal with Canada-based Brookfield Asset Management. Also, this one of the oldest technology companies is expected to enjoy additional benefits than its rival AMD, from the recently passed Chips and Science Act.
Is Intel a Buy, Sell or Hold?
Analysts have mixed feelings about the Intel stock. According to TipRanks, Street is neutral about INTC's stock, which carries a Hold consensus rating based on four Buys, 16 Holds, and nine Sells. Further, hedge funds look apprehensive about INTC stock, as they have sold 1.4 million shares of INTC stock in the last quarter.

The company’s new generations of chips are significantly used in PCs and servers, along with rising dominance in the data-center central-processing-unit market. Also, AMD’s Pensando and Xilinx acquisitions buoy optimism.
Further, the 47.6% decline in shares of AMD stock highlights a good long-term opportunity to buy the dip. Notably, Advanced Micro Device stock’s average price target of $120.17 signals 52.7% upside potential from current levels.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Among the group of chip stocks, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) all were in the red on Tuesday morning. It seems this comes alongside a drop in the major indices.
What’s Going on With Chip Stocks?
The aim of the legislation is to increase semiconductor production in the U.S. in the face of growing threats from China. Semiconductor manufacturing has been moving offshore for decades, attracted by lower labor costs and relaxed environmental standards.
Meanwhile, Taiwan has become a primary chip supplier, thanks to Taiwan Semiconductor’s success with EUV (extreme ultraviolet) technology that brings circuit lines within a few nanometers of one another. Geopolitical concerns now impact both the U.S. and Taiwan Semi, which is building a new plant in Arizona backed in part by CHIPS Act subsidies.
Skeptics, however, question whether the act can be effective if its aim is to reduce dependence on China. They cite China’s dominance in low-end silicon and its growing use of standards-based designs. China has criticized the law, saying it interferes with its efforts to become self-sufficient. The U.S. has also moved to restrict the export of artificial intelligence chips to China, although Nvidia will be allowed to continue development efforts there.
Intel has been pushing especially hard for the CHIPS Act and is now planning to break ground on five new plants in Ohio. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has focused on building Intel as a foundry for other designers, as its designs lose share  to those of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia.
What Happens Next?
Everyone understands Moore’s Law, the idea that chips get faster over time. What’s at stake here is what I call Moore’s Second Law, the idea that manufacturing costs also rise with chip complexity.
The result is that the hardware for making chips requires much more capital and brings less value than the software used for designing chips. As designs get more complex, they cost more to manufacture. That’s why AMD and Nvidia are both worth more than Intel.
It will take years before Intel’s foundry investments, and thus the CHIPS Act itself, can bear fruit. Many investors are looking beyond microprocessors for growth, to the communications chips of Qualcomm, the memory chips of Micron, and the digital signal processors of Texas Instruments.

2022-09-06 00:00:00+00:00,ANALYSIS-Banned U.S. AI chips in high demand at Chinese state institutes,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-banned-u.s.-ai-chips-in-high-demand-at-chinese-state-institutes,,,"By Eduardo Baptista
BEIJING, Sept 6 (Reuters) - High-profile universities and state-run research institutes in China have been relying on a U.S. computing chip to power their artificial intelligence (AI) technology but whose export to the country Washington has now restricted, a Reuters review showed.
U.S. chip designer Nvidia Corp NVDA.O last week said U.S. government officials have ordered it to stop exporting its A100 and H100 chips to China. Local peer Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) AMD.O also said new licence requirements now prevent export to China of its advanced AI chip MI250.
The development signalled a major escalation of a U.S. campaign to stymie China's technological capability as tension bubbles over the fate of Taiwan, where chips for Nvidia and almost every other major chip firm are manufactured.
China views Taiwan as a rogue province and has not ruled out force to bring the democratically governed island under its control. Responding to the restrictions, China branded them a futile attempt to impose a technology blockade on a rival.
A Reuters review of more than a dozen publicly available government tenders over the past two years indicated that among some of China's most strategically important research institutes, there is high demand - and need - for Nvidia's signature A100 chips.
Tsinghua University, China's highest-ranked higher education institution globally, spent over $400,000 last October on two Nvidia AI supercomputers, each powered by four A100 chips, one of the tenders showed.
In the same month, the Institute of Computing Technology, part of top research group, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), spent around $250,000 on A100 chips.
The school of artificial intelligence at a CAS university in July this year also spent about $200,000 on high-tech equipment including a server partly powered by A100 chips.
In November, the cybersecurity college of Guangdong-based Jinan University spent over $93,000 on an Nvidia AI supercomputer, while its school of intelligent systems science and engineering spent almost $100,000 on eight A100 chips just last month.
Less well-known institutes and universities supported by municipal and provincial governments, such as in Shandong, Henan and Chongqing, also bought A100 chips, the tenders showed.
None of the research departments responded to requests for comment on the effect on their projects of the A100 export curb.
Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment. Last Wednesday, it said it had booked $400 million in Chinese sales of the affected chips this quarter which could be lost if its customers decide not to buy alternative Nvidia products. It also said it planned to apply for exemptions to the new rules.
REPLACEMENTS
The lack of chips from the likes of Nvidia and AMD is likely to hamper efforts at Chinese organisations to cost-effectively carry out the kind of advanced computing used for tasks such as image and speech recognition.
Image recognition and natural language processing are common in consumer applications such as smartphones that can answer queries and tag photos. They also have military uses such as scouring satellite imagery for weapons or bases and filtering digital communications for intelligence-gathering purposes.
Experts said there are few Chinese chipmakers that could readily replace such advanced Nvidia and AMD chips, and buyers could instead use multiple lower-end chips to replicate the processing power.
Reuters could not locate any Chinese government tenders mentioning the other two restricted chips - Nvidia's H100 and AMD's MI250.
But some of the tenders showed, for instance, chip purchases from U.S. technology firm Intel Corp INTC.O and proposals for purchasing less-sophisticated Nvidia products, underscoring China's reliance on an array of U.S. chip technology.
One tender in May showed the Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping, a research institute of the Ministry of Natural Resources, considering an Nvidia AI supercomputer to improve its ability to create three-dimensional images from geographic data.
""The proposed NVIDIA DGX A100 server will be equipped with 8 A100 chips with 40GB memory, which will greatly improve the data-carrying capacity and computing speed, shorten the scientific research process, and get scientific research results faster and better,"" the tender read.
The National University of Defense and Technology (NUDT), which describes itself as a ""military university"" and ""under the direct leadership of the Central Military Commission"", China's top military body, is also among the buyers of A100 chips.
The NUDT, home of Tianhe-2, one of the world's most powerful supercomputers, has been on a U.S. blacklist since 2015 due to national security concerns, eliminating the university's access to the Intel processors it uses in its supercomputers.
One May tender showed the institute planned to buy 24 Nvidia graphics processing units with AI applications. The tender was published again last month, indicating NUDT had not yet found the right deal or supplier.
NUDT did not respond to a request for comment.

2022-09-05 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Corporation (INTC) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-corporation-intc-is-a-trending-stock%3A-facts-to-know-before-betting-on-it-0,,,"Intel (INTC) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Over the past month, shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -11.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Intel falls in, has lost 19.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.35 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -79.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $2.27 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -58.5%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.72 indicates a change of +20.2% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.4%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Intel.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
In the case of Intel, the consensus sales estimate of $15.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -18.8%. The $66.31 billion and $68.53 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -15% and +3.3%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $15.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22%. EPS of $0.29 for the same period compares with $1.28 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -14.51%. The EPS surprise was -57.97%.
Over the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

5 Stocks Set to Double
Each was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2021. Previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.
Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.

2022-09-05 00:00:00+00:00,Where Will AMD Be in 5 Years?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-will-amd-be-in-5-years,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has grown rapidly over the last five years, recording terrific growth in its revenue and earnings thanks to market share gains over Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in the client and server processor markets, as well as its presence in fast-growing niches such as gaming consoles.
AMD's impressive top- and bottom-line growth has translated into solid gains for investors as well. The stock has beaten the broader market handsomely over the past five years despite crashing over 40% in 2022. But does this massive pullback mean that investors should buy AMD stock and hope that the chipmaker replicates its fine form over the next five years as well?
AMD data by YCharts
Let's check where AMD may stand after five years and find out if buying this beaten-down semiconductor stock is a good idea.
AMD could become a bigger player in these markets
AMD's chips power personal computers (PCs) and data centers, and the company is enjoying outstanding growth in both these markets.
The client segment was AMD's largest source of revenue in the second quarter. It generated $2.2 billion in revenue, an increase of 25% over the prior-year period. The impressive thing to note here is that AMD saw strong growth in sales of processors that power notebooks and desktops at a time when the broader PC market is in terrible shape.
IDC reports that PC shipments fell 15.3% year over year in the second quarter as demand weakened. But the average selling prices (ASPs) of AMD's processors increased. Shipment volumes also increased thanks to another quarter of market share gains over Intel. AMD says that it has gained client processor market share for nine straight quarters, which is not surprising given its stronger product lineup.
Mercury Research estimates that AMD exited Q2 with a 20.6% share of the desktop PC market and a 24.8% share of the notebook market. Those numbers show a nice improvement over the year-ago period's desktop market share of 17.1% and notebook market share of 20%. The market share numbers also tell us that AMD still has a lot of room for growth in the PC market.
The PC processor market reportedly generated $88 billion in revenue in 2020, and the figure is expected to jump to $117 billion in 2027. AMD looks set to corner a bigger chunk of this massive opportunity thanks to the technology lead that it enjoys over Intel. The company has just announced its latest Ryzen 7000 processors based on the 5-nanometer (nm) Zen architecture. These new processors could widen the gulf between AMD and Intel, as the latter will remain stuck on a 10nm process node when it launches its Raptor Lake chips later this year.
AMD's smaller process node means that the transistors on its chips are packed more closely together compared to the transistors on Intel's. As a result, AMD's chips are likely to be more powerful and power-efficient, as packing more transistors into a smaller area allows a processor to carry out calculations faster and heat up less. So AMD looks set for more market share gains in client processors, and that should play a key role in the company's growth over the next five years.
A similar scenario is unfolding in the server processor market. AMD reportedly controlled a 13.9% share of server processors in Q2, up from 9.5% in the year-ago period. Intel is the dominant player in this space, but it has been losing ground to AMD. Chipzilla is likely to lose more ground in the server processor market, as it has repeatedly delayed the launch of its 4th-generation Sapphire Rapids data center processors.
Intel is expected to release its Sapphire Rapids chips in the first quarter of 2023, while some parts may only see the light of the day in the second half of the year. This gives AMD the opportunity to gain more share against Intel in the lucrative server processor market, especially considering that it will be based on a 10nm process. AMD's upcoming server processors, on the other hand, will be based on the 5nm manufacturing process.
More importantly, AMD is all set to push the envelope further in client and server processors with the launch of 4nm and 3nm chips by 2024. So it wouldn't be surprising to see AMD become a bigger player in these markets by 2027, paving the way for robust long-term growth in the company's top and bottom lines.
Gaming consoles will drive terrific growth
AMD supplies semi-custom chips to video game console manufacturers such as Microsoft, Sony, and Valve. This is the reason why the company's gaming business recorded 32% year-over-year growth in Q2 to $1.7 billion despite a decline in graphics card revenue.
AMD's relationship with game console manufacturers is going to be a long-term catalyst that could set it up for impressive growth over the next five years. For instance, sales of Sony's PlayStation 5 consoles are expected to hit 67.3 million units in 2024 from 17.9 million units in 2021. Similarly, sales of Xbox Series X consoles could jump to 37 million units in 2024 from 12 million last year.
Meanwhile, AMD's new gaming console client is also gaining solid traction in the market. Valve's Steam Deck console uses AMD's semi-custom processor, and the company is said to be increasing production of the same to meet the growing number of reservations for the device. As such, AMD's console business should remain in healthy shape over the next five years.
In all, there are signs that AMD could continue clocking terrific growth going forward. Not surprisingly, analysts expect 27% annual earnings growth from the company for the next five years, which is why it may be a good idea to take advantage of the slip in AMD's stock price since it could deliver healthy long-term upside.

2022-09-03 00:00:00+00:00,3 Utility Stocks You'll Be Happy You Own in 2032,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-utility-stocks-youll-be-happy-you-own-in-2032,,,"There's good reason investors fear the economy could slide further into a recession and drag stocks down with it. Persistent inflation, rising interest rates, and a stumbling housing market are all worrisome indicators that we might have further to fall before we reach bottom.
That's why finding a safe haven now might make sense, and utility stocks may be your best bet. They can be the ballast for a portfolio during troubled times, and perform well when the storm clouds finally break. There's good reason utilities have long been seen as the ultimate widows-and-orphans stocks.

Pulling your money out of the market is not really a viable option if you want to build generational wealth, because if you miss the rebound, your long-term returns will be severely harmed. Over the 20-year period between 2001 and 2021, the S&P 500 returned 9.5% annually on average, but if you had missed out on just the market's 10 best days, your returns would have been cut to 5.3%.
That's why buying now makes sense. The following three utility stocks are ones you'll be happy you own a decade into the future.
American States Water
American States Water (NYSE: AWR) is a utility that's seen it all. Founded in 1929, it's been through the Great Depression, two world wars, numerous market crashes and recessions, and a host of global geopolitical events that have turned the world upside down.
And through it all, it has steadfastly paid a dividend to its investors -- 86 straight years in all -- but more importantly has raised the payout each and every year for 68 consecutive years (it just raised it again by 8.9%). While that puts American States Water in that rarified group of stocks called Dividend Kings, it's all the more notable because no other stock on the market has as long a track record of raising its dividend than this water utility.
American States Water is primarily tasked with providing clean water and electricity to Southern California, which represents about 66% of its revenue, but it also has long-term contracts with the U.S. government to provide water to 11 military bases, which account for another quarter of total revenue. The rest it gets from generating electricity.
Shares of the utility are down 20% year-to-date as it has missed analyst earnings estimates several times over the past few quarters, but that is largely due to California utility regulators failing to approve its rate requests for 2022. That means American States Water is still operating under 2021 rates, so if and when the increases do go through, they should be retroactive to January.
The water utility is a solid, dependable business that has a long history of returning value to shareholders, a track record that will undoubtedly continue to 2032 and beyond.
Consolidated Edison
On the other side of the country is Consolidated Edison (NYSE: ED), commonly known as ConEd, which provides electricity, natural gas, and steam to customers in New York state. It has also heavily invested in the renewable energy market, and maintains it supports ""a reliable transition from fossil fuels to renewables to reduce carbon emissions"" while also maximizing returns for investors. It operates a network of utility-scale wind and solar energy projects across 20 states that can generate three gigawatts of power.
Yet even though ConEd's stock is up 15% in 2022, management believes that the market is undervaluing its business because of the differences inherent in the fossil fuel and clean energy businesses. It is conducting a strategic review of its clean energy assets, though it hasn't said whether a full sale, spinoff, or asset sale is the desired outcome. Analysts believe the utility will sell the unit as a whole to reduce its equity needs.
ConEd is another dependable dividend-paying stock to own for the long haul that has hiked its payout for 46 consecutive years, making it a Dividend Aristocrat, but one within reach of soon becoming a Dividend King.
Brookfield Infrastructure Partners
Yes, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE: BIP) owns traditional utility operations around the globe, with electricity transmission and distribution lines in Australia and Brazil and natural gas pipelines in North America, South America, and India. Yet it also owns and operates a number of ""utility-like"" infrastructure assets too, including railroads, toll roads, ports, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) export operations; oil and natural gas midstream assets; and data centers, cell towers, fiber-optic cables, and data transmission assets.
Now Brookfield is getting into computer chips too, as it just signed an agreement with semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) to jointly fund the chipmaker's new fabrication facility it's building in Arizona. Let's just say Brookfield Infrastructure is a unique play on the utility space.
What's especially distinctive about this infrastructure stock is that it's not especially beholden to any one asset, and is willing to sell any one of them off and either reinvest in existing operations or buy a new one. It has called that its ""buy, enhance, sell, repeat"" strategy. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.
While Brookfield doesn't have the same track record as American States or ConEd in dividend payments, it has raised its payout every year for 10 years. In another 10 years' time, investors will appreciate both its capital investments and its dividend.

2022-09-02 00:00:00+00:00,Why Advanced Micro Devices Stock Was Falling This Week,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-advanced-micro-devices-stock-was-falling-this-week-0,,,"What happened
Week to date, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) were down 8.9% as of 10:51 a.m. ET on Friday, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
There was a mixture of positive and negative news this week that affected trading in AMD stock. Toward the end of the week, the U.S. government issued a new licensing requirement to curtail sales of high-performance chips to China.
After a strong rally in July, a new round of earnings results sent the shares downhill again. Year to date, the stock is down 42%.
So what
In 2021, AMD generated $4 billion in sales to customers in China, or a quarter of its total sales. It's not clear how this licensing requirement will affect AMD's annual revenue, but The Wall Street Journal is reporting that AMD doesn't expect a material impact on its business.
The chance to drive more revenue growth from market share gains remains a huge opportunity. Earlier in the week, Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson expressed optimism about AMD's chances to take more market share from Intel with the launch of the Ryzen 7000 series (or ""Zen 4"" chips) for desktop PCs.
Now what
AMD's new Zen 4 chips will hit retailers on Sept. 27. These new desktop processors deliver a performance boost of up to 40% for certain video games over the previous generation.
Wedbush likes AMD's competitive position with this new lineup. While Intel previously said it planned to raise prices for its chips, AMD is going for higher market share by cutting the price of its new high-end Ryzen 7950X chip by $100 over the previous generation.
Given the declines in PC sales in the first half of the year, management is cautious about the near-term demand in the PC market through the fourth quarter. Still, AMD trades at a conservative valuation of 19 times analyst earnings estimates for 2022, which seems to already price in low sales expectations. The sell-off looks like a good buying opportunity.

2022-09-02 00:00:00+00:00,New Futures Contract Empowers Investors to Gain or Hedge Exposure to Semiconductor Subsector,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/new-futures-contract-empowers-investors-to-gain-or-hedge-exposure-to-semiconductor,,,"Download the Article
Semiconductors, or computer chips, have attracted much attention lately. Nowadays, they power a wide array of products and devices, which are becoming more interconnected through the internet of things. Further, the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic sparked a huge surge in demand for laptops and other electronic devices, causing a major shortage in the chip supply – a problem widely reported in the media and felt by consumers worldwide.
From an equities market perspective, Nasdaq’s PHLX Semiconductor Sector IndexSM (SOXSM) has become one of the best-known and most widely tracked subsector indexes in the technology sector. Market participants not only invest in the underlying stocks in this industry but also ETFs that track SOX. Now they are also empowered to manage their exposure using the new CME Group E-mini PHLX Semiconductor Sector futures contract (ticker: SOX).
“Our partnership with CME Group continues to provide more choice and versatility for investors looking to manage risk and meet their investment objectives,” says Sean Wasserman, Vice President, Global Head of Index & Advisor Solutions at Nasdaq. “As with our existing futures contracts, we’re excited for the launch of the SOX futures and value the important role CME Group plays in the investment community.”
Nasdaq’s SOX index comprises companies primarily involved in the design, distribution, manufacture and sale of semiconductors, including the top 30 securities by market capitalization in the semiconductor industry with U.S. listings. The top 10 holdings are Texas Instruments (TXN), Intel (INTC), Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), KLA Corporation (KLAC), Analog Devices (ADI), Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) and ASML (ASML). The index is modified market cap-weighted (8% capping for the top five constituents, with the rest capped at 4%) on a quarterly rebalancing schedule. Constituents must have a listing in the U.S. on either the Nasdaq, NYSE, or CBOE exchanges. They are also required to meet minimum thresholds for market cap ($100 million) and liquidity (1.5 million shares traded in each of the last six months).
According to Paul Woolman, Executive Director – Head of EMEA Equity and Alternative Index Products at CME Group, sector dispersion is a key use case for the SOX futures contract. At any given time, broad market indexes such as the S&P 500, Russell 2000 or Nasdaq-100 may be trending in one direction. However, some sectors within those indexes may be performing very differently from each other and can move in the opposite direction. This dynamic presents an opportunity to trade one sector against another sector, a sector against a broad index or a sector against one or more stocks in the sector.
“You’re expecting one sector to outperform or underperform the other exposure, depending on your view,” he explains. “In addition to this relative value trading opportunity, sector futures also provide the ability for clients to go long or short in order to express a directional view, to put on an overlay strategy or to risk manage a specific sector within their portfolio. These are all potential user cases for the new E-mini PHLX Semiconductor Sector futures.”
To this end, it is not surprising that sector-based futures volumes and the number of participants using the contracts have increased, with average daily volume up 56% since 2019. The main users are asset managers, pension funds, insurance companies and hedge funds who use the contracts typically for one of the use cases described above. Market makers and proprietary trading firms help to provide liquidity on the central limit order book whilst banks facilitate access to these contracts on behalf of their clients, and provide both block and on-screen liquidity.
As of Aug. 8, 2022, SOX futures may be traded on screen or as outright blocks. Block trades are privately negotiated transactions that meet certain quantity thresholds and are permitted to be executed apart from the public auction market.
However, sometimes the block quantity may be too large and require a longer reporting period to allow the counterparties to hedge their exposure. As such, SOX futures are eligible for derived block trading, like the other 18 sector-based Equity Index futures contracts listed at CME Group. A derived block is a block trade consummated by eligible contract participants in which the price and quantity of the trade depends on hedging transactions in an eligible related market. Parties agree to the predefined notional or number of contracts and the market in which the hedging transaction will take place. Additionally, a basis price is agreed to be added to the index price of the resultant hedge in the related market. Permitted hedging instruments include stock baskets and other eligible related market instruments such as ETFs.
“Derived blocks allow market participants to source liquidity in the underlying stocks in the index or in ETFs that track the index and then transfer the liquidity into the futures contracts,” says Woolman.
Additionally, SOX futures are eligible for Basis Trade at Index Close (BTIC) under the ticker SOT. These transactions enable market participants to trade futures contracts at a fixed spread, or basis, relative to the official index cash close. Market participants may also migrate their existing exposure into the futures contract through an Exchange of Futures for Physical (EFP). This is a private agreement between two parties to trade a futures position for the basket of underlying stocks or an ETF. EFPs can be used to open or close a futures position or switch a futures position for the underlying asset.
SOX futures are cost-, capital- and tax efficient. Market participants can get exposure to the semiconductor subsector by putting up a small percentage of the notional amount as margin, which can be offset against positions in other products at CME Group. Under section 1256 of the U.S. tax code, profit and loss on these transactions are entitled to be taxed at a rate equal to 60% long-term and 40% short-term capital gain or loss. Finally, SOX futures are UCITS eligible, which is beneficial for EMEA-based investors.
CME Group has had great success partnering with Nasdaq on futures products. Woolman points out that the E-mini Nasdaq-100® Index (NDX®) futures contract is an important part of the equity ecosystem because the technology sector is a driver of equity markets and market cap. This is evidenced by the liquidity of the contract continuing to grow strongly over the last few years. Further, technology tends to be one of the more volatile sectors.
“Clients who like trading tactically, like to trade the Nasdaq-100,” he says. “SOX will have its own unique risk profile, and it will give clients greater choice.”

2022-09-02 00:00:00+00:00,Should You Buy the Dow Jones' 4 Worst-Performing 2022 Stocks?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-the-dow-jones-4-worst-performing-2022-stocks,,,"Any investor can tell you that 2022 has been a rough year for the stock market. As of Aug. 31, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down by 13% for the year, and we still have four months to go.
While this is certainly poor performance, there are some Dow components in far worse shape. Here's a look at the four worst-performing stocks in the widely followed index, why each one is down, and whether they could be buying opportunities for patient long-term investors now.
The 4 worst-performing Dow Jones stocks in 2022
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down significantly through the first eight months of 2022, but some of the 30 component stocks have fared much worse. Here are the four worst performers on the index through Aug. 31.
COMPANY (SYMBOL)
INDUSTRY
YTD PERFORMANCE THROUGH 8/31/2022
Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA)
Retail
(30.1%)
Nike (NYSE: NKE)
Consumer Goods
(35.7%)
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)
Computer Hardware
(36.4%)
Salesforce (NYSE: CRM)
Software
(38.4%)
Data source: YCharts. Returns through 8/31/2022 midday and are total returns (dividends included). Parentheses indicate negative numbers.
Why have these stocks performed so poorly?
It's not hard to see why each of these stocks has earned a spot on the worst-performing list. Here's the short version of what's going on with them:
Walgreens' sales and net income both declined year over year, including a nearly 10% drop in pharmacy sales in the last quarter. And due to higher expenses, Walgreens' bottom-line profit declined by 80% from a year ago.
Nike investors are worried that consumer spending could continue to slow, and its recent results haven't exactly been encouraging. In the latest quarter, Nike's inventory increased significantly as sales declined slightly year over year. Plus, the company warned that it would need to pivot to a more promotional sales approach to control inventory, which could be a sign that profitability could come under pressure.
In its second-quarter earnings report, Intel reported a massive disappointment on both the top and bottom lines, and lowered its guidance for the second half. And as any experienced investor can tell you, there are few more sure ways to guarantee poor stock performance than lowering your future expectations.
Salesforce is part of one of the worst-performing industries in the stock market -- software -- and also reduced its guidance for the rest of the year. The company is expecting its customers to be a little more cautious when it comes to spending for the foreseeable future, which isn't exactly a positive catalyst.
So all four stocks are down for a reason. The question investors need to ask themselves is whether they are temporary reasons or not.
Is now the time to buy?
All four of these companies are time-tested businesses that have a lot to like. For example, Walgreens' core business is incredibly solid and profitable, and the company has tons of potential on the fast-growing healthcare side of the business. Salesforce provides products that businesses need to interact with customers, and Intel is the leader in its industry. And there's simply no sports apparel brand as recognizable as Nike -- this hasn't changed for decades.
It's never a great idea to buy a stock just because its price went down, and all four of these stocks are experiencing significant headwinds right now. But if you're a patient long-term investor, it could be a smart time to take a closer look at these beaten-down blue-chip stocks.

2022-09-01 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Time to Buy the Dow Jones' 4 Worst-Performing August Stocks?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-time-to-buy-the-dow-jones-4-worst-performing-august-stocks,,,"There are no two ways about it -- August was a rough month for the market. Not even blue chips were immune to the sweeping weakness. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) tumbled 4% last month, thanks to an 8% pullback from its mid-August peak. Of course, this setback means that around half of the Dow's 30 tickers fell by even more.
Veteran investors are looking at the most extreme of these sell-offs for potential bargains, as they should be. Before plowing into the Dow's worst performers from August simply because they were the worst performers, investors might want to take a step back and reconsider. This time around, the sharp pullbacks also hint at more serious problems than recent headlines suggest.
What went wrong
If you're wondering, last month's biggest losses among the Dow's stocks were suffered by Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), and 3M (NYSE: MMM). Walgreens fell a little more than 11% in August, while Intel and Salesforce lost 12% and 13%, respectively. 3M led the bearish charge, giving up 15% of its value. The bulk of those losses materialized late in the month when the Dow Jones Industrial Average started selling off in earnest.
^DJI data by YCharts.
For each of these four tickers, there's more to the story than marketwide malaise.
Take Walgreens Boots Alliance as an example. A federal judge recently ruled that the drugstore chain contributed to San Francisco's opioid abuse epidemic, adding to a growing financial liability linked to the matter.
A usually resilient Salesforce cautioned shareholders in conjunction with its second-quarter report that the remainder of the year wouldn't be quite as healthy as first expected. Namely, the company anticipates full-year revenue of right around $31.0 billion, down slightly from May's forecast for a top line closer to $31.7 billion. Per-share earnings guidance was dialed back by a similar degree.
Much of 3M's August weakness can be chalked up to a failed legal strategy meant to sidestep lawsuits related to defective earplugs. Despite the 3M subsidiary that made the earplugs filing for bankruptcy, a judge is allowing suits against the parent company to proceed.
It's Intel's setback; however, that's perhaps the most storied of the four. Already reeling from broken supply chains and a subsequent semiconductor shortage, rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) just introduced a new desktop processor that could cause even more trouble for Intel. AMD's new Ryzen 7000 CPU series is the world's first 5-nanometer chip and considerably faster than Intel's comparably priced processors.
You're investing in companies -- not just buying stocks
At first blush, the headlines look, sound, and feel like the usual fare that upends a stock. The market's knee-jerk responses, however, aren't necessarily built to last.
Take a step back and take a more critical look at the headlines and their underpinnings, though. Most of them point to problems that have been in place for some time and will remain in place for some time.
For instance, Intel's CPU manufacturing challenges began materializing back in 2020...problems that still aren't completely fixed. Rather than continuing to outsource its chip production, the company is now taking matters into its own hands and plans to build a manufacturing facility in Germany and another in Ohio. These are both long-term projects, though, and players like AMD could continue to chip away at Intel's existing market share before either of those production facilities is completed.
In the meantime, Salesforce and a long-beleaguered 3M are both contending with currency-related headwinds and sheer economic weakness. Ditto for Walgreens Boots Alliance, which is not only increasingly at risk of opioid lawsuits but also struggling to find key employees, including pharmacists. Solution? A $75,000 hiring bonus on top of their above-average pay.
^DJI data by YCharts.
These challenges aren't evidence of temporary stumbling blocks; they are clues of systemic challenges that have been in place for years and could linger for years.
So no, it's not time to buy the Dow's biggest losers from August.
That's not to say you should never buy good stocks while they're cheap; that's precisely when you should step into them. It's simply to say one month's weakness isn't enough of a reason to nibble. Beaten-down stocks must still be worth owning and offer adequate upside to justify the risk of more downside. On a risk-versus-reward basis, none of these tickers are as attractive as alternatives. Each has a great number of challenges -- too many challenges -- to resolve readily.
To this end, it's worth noting that while 3M, Intel, Salesforce, and Walgreens were the Dow's worst performers last month, all four are also among the Dow's biggest losers for the past several months. Anybody who bought them following any part of that weakness is now in the red. Take the hint.

2022-09-01 00:00:00+00:00,What's Going On With NVIDIA?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/whats-going-on-with-nvidia,,,"Semiconductor stocks have lost serious power in 2022 after providing supercharged returns over the last several years.
To put things into perspective, SOXX, the iShares Semiconductor ETF, is down more than 30% year-to-date, vastly underperforming the S&P 500.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
As we can see, it’s been anything but fun for chip stocks in 2022 amid a hawkish Fed and supply-chain disruptions.
An investor favorite, NVIDIA NVDA, has been no exception to the adverse price action, with shares losing more than half of their value YTD and coming nowhere near the general market’s performance.
In fact, the share performance even widely lags a few of its peers, including Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Intel INTC. This is shown in the chart below.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
It raises a valid question, what’s going on with NVIDIA shares to make them perform so poorly relative to other chip stocks? Let’s take a closer look.
Near-Term Outlook Appears Grim
Flipping the pages back a little, NVIDIA shocked the market in early August, providing disheartening guidance that they were forecasting Q2 sales of $6.7 billion vs. the previous $8.1 billion outlook.
This was when the tide started to shift, and the market didn’t react well to the guidance, to say the least – NVDA shares lost nearly 7% the day of.
NVDA reported quarterly sales of $6.7 billion, right at their guidance. The value reflected year-over-year growth of 3% but a sequential decrease of 19%. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Still, why did they initially guide lower? One primary reason included their gaming revenue, which was negatively impacted by macroeconomic headwinds that heavily affected demand.
Fast-forward to today, and the semiconductor titan is back in the headlines following news that the U.S. government will impose a new license requirement for future exports to China. 
It’s a significant development, with NVIDIA stating that it could lose up to $400 million in quarterly revenue as a result, which is obviously not a positive sign.
Is It Time To Buy?
As expected, analysts have substantially pulled back their earnings estimates over the last 60 days, pushing the stock into a Zack Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Investors should target Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks, as they provide much higher odds of investors reaping considerable gains. With NVDA carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), it tells us that its near-term earnings outlook is a bit cloudy and under pressure. 
The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate for the company’s current fiscal year (FY23) resides at $3.48, suggesting a Y/Y decrease of a steep 21%. NVDA’s bottom-line is projected to see some relief in FY24, with the $4.57 per share estimate reflecting year-over-year growth of 31%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
However, the company’s valuation levels have fallen extensively, suggesting that long-term investors could start becoming interested.
NVDA’s forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio has fallen to 12.3X, right at its median of 12.4X over the last five years. Further, the value is 55% off its high of a steep 27.5X in 2021.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Bottom Line
Once seemingly unstoppable investments, chip stocks have fallen from glory in 2022, leaving dents in many portfolios.
A poster-child for the industry, NVIDIA, has recently fallen on tough times, with its earnings outlook shifting negative for the near term amid new licensing requirements and a massive growth slowdown within its gaming segment.
Following the deep sell off, the company’s valuation levels have come down substantially, perhaps intriguing investors with a long-term horizon.
However, it’s vital to recognize that its unfavorable Zacks Rank indicates that more pain could be ahead.
A great strategy would be to wait until NVIDIA’s NVDA earnings outlook strengthens, especially amid the currently cloudy outlook.

2022-09-01 00:00:00+00:00,"With new China AI chip restrictions, U.S. takes aim at a critical niche",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/with-new-china-ai-chip-restrictions-u.s.-takes-aim-at-a-critical-niche,,,"By Stephen Nellis and Alexandra Alper
Sept 1 (Reuters) - The United States beefed up its effort to cut off the flow of advanced technology to China by instructing Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O to stop sending their flagship artificial intelligence chips there.
While the news shocked the chip sector by the time markets closed Thursday, sending the Philadelphia semiconductor index down 1.9% and Nvidia and AMD down 7.6% and 3% respectively, the letters from the U.S. officials appeared to target a narrow but critical part of China's computing industry.
The regulations appear to focus on chips called GPUs with the most powerful computing capabilities, a critical but niche market with only two meaningful players, Nvidia and AMD. Their only potential rival - Intel Corp INTC.O - is trying to break into the market but has not released competitive products.
Originally designed for video games, the usage of GPUs, or graphic processing units, have been expanded to a wider array of applications that include handling artificial intelligence work like image recognition, categorizing cat photos or scouring digital satellite imagery for military equipment. Because all the chip suppliers are American, the U.S. controls access to the technology.
Some national security experts saw the U.S. move as a long time coming.
GPUs ""have been totally uncontrolled to China and to Russia, so in a lot of ways I see this action as kind of catching up to where the controls probably should have been if we were really serious about trying to slow China’s AI growth,"" said Emily Kilcrease, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.
The U.S. Department of Commerce, which declined to comment on the specifics of whatever new rules it may be developing, appears to have targeted the effort narrowly.
The only products Nvidia said would be affected are its A100 and H100 chips. Those chips cost tens of thousands of dollars each, with full computers containing the chips costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Similarly, AMD said that only its most powerful MI250 chip - a version of which is being used at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, one of several U.S. supercomputing sites that supports nuclear weapons - is affected by the new requirement. Less powerful chips such as AMD's MI210 and below are not affected.
What the affected chips share is the ability to carry out calculations for artificial intelligence work quickly, at huge scale and with high precision. Less powerful AI chips can work quickly at lower levels of precision, which is sufficient for tagging photos of friends and where the cost of an occasional mistake is low - but are insufficient for designing fighter jets.
The only major market rival to AMD and Nvidia's chips is Intel's still-unreleased Ponte Vecchio chip, whose first customer is Argonne National Lab, another U.S. installation that supports nuclear weapons.
""While we understand the U.S. Government is continuing to look at new restrictions, no new export control rules have been published and there are currently no changes to our business,"" Intel told Reuters in a statement. ""We are closely monitoring the process.""

Semiconductors are the foundation of the modern world, and semiconductor stocks are vital to the economy. For the uninitiated, semiconductors power nearly all our favorite technology products we use today. This includes cell phones to computers to cars, and they enable some of the most important technologies we rely on. Additionally, semiconductor stocks are widely viewed as a bellwether for the health of the tech sector. Chip makers have been struggling so far this year, as a slowdown in the global economy has led to weaker demand for their products. This is evident, by taking a look at top semiconductor stocks like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM). Shares of both semiconductor firms are down 40.01%, and 28.7% so far in 2022, respectively.
However, with the CHIPS Act recently being passed, optimism grows that a rebound is on the horizon. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether this rally will continue. It wouldn’t surprise me if investors were paying close tabs on semiconductor stocks right now. Considering this, let’s take a look at three undervalued semiconductor stocks to check out in the stock market now.
Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks To Watch Now
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD)
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM)

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)
Next, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is an American technology company that designs and manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming, cryptocurrency, and professional markets. NVIDIA’s GPU products are the most popular NVIDIA brand. The company also sells chipsets that are used in mobile devices, automobiles, and gaming consoles. For a sense of scale, NVIDIA is the largest chip maker in the United States by market value.
Shares of NVDA stock are down over 49% so far in 2022. Meanwhile, during Wednesday’s after-hours trading session, NVDA stock fell another 6.56% to $141.04 per share. This comes after the company said in a regulatory filing that it was notified last week that it would be required to get a license from the United States government before being able to ship certain semiconductor chips to China and Russia. As a result of this, NVDA could lose as much as $400 million in quarterly sales due to these new licensing requirements.
Moving along, this month NVIDIA reported its second quarter 2023 fiscal results. Diving in, the semiconductor giant reported a beat for the quarter. In detail, the company posted earnings of $0.54 per share, on revenue of $6.7 billion. On the other hand, NVIDIA revised its outlook forecast lower for Q3 2023. Given all of this, could now be a good time for investors to be watching NVDA stock for the long-term?

2022-09-01 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Time to Buy the S&P 500's 5 Worst-Performing August Stocks?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-time-to-buy-the-sp-500s-5-worst-performing-august-stocks,,,"The S&P 500 benchmark index had a rough month in August. Through Aug. 30, the S&P 500 had declined by 4% for the month, with the worst of it coming in the latter half of the month following a stock market rebound in July and early August.
However, some stocks got hit much harder than the overall index. Five stocks in the index actually had double-digit declines in August, with three down by more than 20% for the month. Here's a rundown of the five worst performers in the S&P 500, the short version of why each one is down, and whether patient investors should consider buying these stocks now for the long term.
The worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 in August

Data source: yCharts. Performance through August 30. Parentheses indicate negative numbers.
Why have these stocks been such underperformers?
These companies all operate in different industries, and as a result, the reasons for their declines vary. Sure, some of their declines are due to conditions that are pressuring the entire market such as recession fears and rising interest rates. But some are company-specific, with four of the five declines coming as a result of weak earnings or guidance.
Intel's second-quarter earnings were a disappointment, and the company's outlook is rather uncertain, plus competitors like AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) are gaining market share. Mohawk hasn't had much company-specific news recently, but we're seeing signs of a major slowdown in spending on home renovations. Match Group's move was earnings related, as the online dating app company reported revenue that significantly missed expectations and issued revenue guidance for flat year-over-year growth in the third quarter.
Ball Corp (which makes jars and canning products) reported 20% year-over-year revenue growth, but the divesting of its Russian assets contributed to a larger-than-expected loss, and its North American beverage segment posted weak numbers. Finally, DXC Technology's revenue came in lighter than analysts had hoped to see, and bottom-line profitability was disappointing as well, on top of disappointing guidance for the third quarter.
Should investors buy these stocks now?
All five of these are strong and established businesses, but all are going through periods of general uncertainty. The question from a long-term investor's perspective is whether or not they'll rebound and continue their prior growth trajectories.
To be perfectly clear, it's not a great idea to hit the ""buy"" button just because a stock has declined. But if you like any of these five businesses and believe in its long-term potential, now could be an opportune time to take a closer look.

2022-09-01 00:00:00+00:00,3 Dow Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in September,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dow-stocks-that-are-screaming-buys-in-september,,,"This has been one of the most difficult years on record for Wall Street and the investing community. The U.S. economy has delivered back-to-back quarters of gross domestic product declines, the U.S. inflation rate is hitting a more than four-decade high, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine throws an even bigger monkey wrench into an already-damaged global energy supply chain. Perhaps it's no surprise that the benchmark S&P 500 and growth-driven Nasdaq Composite entered bear market territory.
However, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) has avoided this fate. The Dow Jones, which is comprised of 30 multinational companies, has likely outperformed the other major indexes because it's packed with profitable, time-tested businesses. In other words, sometimes it pays to invest in mature stocks that just keep winning over time.
Image source: Getty Images.
With the broader market taking it on the chin, now is as good a time as any for opportunistic investors to put their money to work. What follows are three Dow stocks that are nothing short of screaming buys in September.
1. Intel
The first Dow stock that's begging to be bought by long-term investors in September is semiconductor stock Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
Shares of Intel have been halved over the past 18 months. This looks to be due to a combination of the U.S. and global economy weakening, demand for personal computers declining as workers get back to the office, and supply chain concerns continuing to weigh on production. It also hasn't helped that rival Advanced Micro Devices has been chipping away at Intel's market share in its computing and data center segments.
Yet, in spite of these challenges, buying Intel at its current share price looks like an absolute steal for investors who can exercise patience -- and who want to receive a 4.4% annual dividend yield while they wait for Intel's catalysts to carry shares notably higher.
Before writing Intel's eulogy, skeptics should take a closer look at desktop, mobile, and server market share among central processing unit (CPU) developers and manufacturers. As of the end of the first quarter of 2022, Intel respectively controlled almost 82% of desktop CPUs, close to 78% of mobile CPU share, and just over 88% of server CPU share (excluding Internet of Things devices). It doesn't appear that Intel will be losing its high-margin, cash-rich crown anytime soon.
Another reason to be optimistic about Intel is the expected spinoff of autonomous vehicle company Mobileye, which Intel purchased for $15.3 billion in 2017. Mobileye generated record sales of $460 million during the June-ended quarter, which represents an increase of 41% from the prior-year period. With innovation being the name of the game in the auto industry, it's possible Intel's stake in Mobileye could create a nice windfall for the company.
The $52 billion CHIPS Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law less than a month ago, is an additional catalyst that favors Intel's growth prospects. With subsidies likely on the way to promote manufacturing expansion, Intel is a good bet to reignite its growth engine sooner than later.
Visa
The second Dow Jones Industrial Average stock that presents as a screaming buy in September is payment processor Visa (NYSE: V).
Virtually all financial stocks, including Visa, are cyclical. This is a fancy way of saying that they ebb and flow with the U.S. and/or global economy. If the economy is firing on all cylinders and growing, Visa's top line should expand as consumers and businesses increase their spending. Conversely, when economic contractions and recessions arise, spending tends to decline, which can adversely impact Visa's revenue and profits.
However, it's important to realize that this is a simple numbers game that strongly favors Visa and its patient shareholders. Even though recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle, periods of expansion last substantially longer. Simply buying and holding Visa stock should allow investors to take advantage of these disproportionately long periods of expansion.
On a more company-specific level, Visa finds itself as the leading payment processor in the No. 1 market for consumption in the world: the United States. As of 2020, based on filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission among the four biggest payment processors, Visa controlled a 54% share of credit card network payment volume in the United States. Further, no payment processor grew its share of credit card network payment volume more following the Great Recession (2007-2009) than Visa.
Then again, there's plenty of opportunity beyond domestic borders. Visa has demonstrated a willingness to grow inorganically (e.g., the company acquired Visa Europe in 2016) and has plenty of runway to push its payment infrastructure into chronically underbanked regions, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia.
Lastly, investors should note that Visa strictly acts as a payment processor and completely avoids lending. Though it wouldn't have any issue generating net-interest income and fees as a lender, Visa's management realizes that lending would expose the company to potential loan delinquencies and charge-offs during recessions. Not having to set aside capital to cover loan losses is a big advantage for Visa that allows it to maintain a profit margin above 50%, as well as bounce back from recessions faster than other financial stocks.

Verizon Communications
The third Dow Jones stock that's a screaming buy in September is telecom giant Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ). Whereas Intel is hitting fresh five-year lows, Verizon's share price is flirting with its lowest point over the trailing decade.
A number of factors are weighing on Verizon, including increased promotional activity from its peers, the aforementioned weakening U.S. economic outlook, and rapidly rising interest rates. Verizon, which is known to finance infrastructure upgrades and purchases with debt, will have to pay more to finance future deals and projects. Yet even with these plain-as-day headwinds, Verizon looks like an incredible bargain.
Following years without a true catalyst, Verizon should benefit nicely from the 5G revolution. Although the company will spend billions of dollars to upgrade its wireless infrastructure to support 5G download speeds, it'll be well worth it. Consumers and businesses are expected to upgrade their devices to take advantage of faster download speeds through at least the midpoint of the decade. Since data consumption is what fuels the juiciest margins for Verizon's wireless segment, 5G should steadily move its profit needle higher.
To add to the above, increased competition isn't having a notably adverse impact on the company's core operating segment. The June-ended quarter saw retail postpaid wireless churn hit 1.03%, which is historically low. What this figure tells investors is that Verizon's operating cash flow remains highly predictable, and the company's customers are generally loyal to the brand.
Investors would be wise not to overlook Verizon's 5G at-home broadband push, either. Verizon spared no expense to scoop up 5G mid-band spectrum that it plans to use to reach 50 million households and 14 million businesses with its broadband services by the end of 2025. While broadband isn't the growth story it once was, it can help Verizon boost its operating cash flow and lead to higher-margin media bundles at the consumer level.
With Verizon valued at just eight times Wall Street's forecast earnings for 2023 and doling out a nearly 6% yield, there looks to be a very favorable risk-versus-reward ratio for income-and-value-seeking investors.

2022-09-01 00:00:00+00:00,Stock Market Sell-Off: 2 Top Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-sell-off%3A-2-top-stocks-to-buy-hand-over-fist,,,"Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell sent the stock market packing on Friday, Aug. 26, following his comments that indicate the central bank may continue to increase interest rates in a bid to keep inflation in check.
The hawkish comments from the Fed chair caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average to tumble over a thousand points, while the S&P 500 shed 3.4% of its value. The Nasdaq Composite also slid 3.9% on Friday. Powell's comments delivered a blow to the stock market rally that has been in effect since the beginning of July. Tech stocks have been hit particularly hard by the rising interest rates as the 23% drop in the Nasdaq Composite indicates.
Richly valued tech stocks tend to underperform in a high interest rate environment as investors worry that high borrowing costs could stunt earnings growth. But savvy investors should note technology stocks have outperformed the broad market by a massive margin in recent years.
Data by YCharts.
That's not surprising, as companies in this sector tend to develop disruptive products that shape the future. This is the reason why investors looking to buy potential long-term winners may want to take advantage of the drop and buy solid tech stocks right now. Here are a few names to consider.
1. Tesla
Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock is trading at 100 times trailing earnings. While that's not remotely cheap when compared to the Nasdaq-100's multiple of 27, it is worth noting that Tesla is trading at a significant discount to its average 2021 price-to-earnings ratio of more than 600. The stock's 21% decline in 2022, along with the impressive growth in its earnings, are the reasons why it is significantly cheaper than last year.
Data by YCharts.
And that presents an opportunity investors may not want to miss, because analysts expect Tesla's bottom line to clock an annual growth rate of 45% for the next five years. The company's adjusted earnings shot up 57% year over year in the second quarter to $2.27 per share as revenue increased 42% to $16.9 billion.
Growing demand for electric vehicles, as well as the company's focus on enhancing its production capacity and deliveries, should continue to fuel Tesla's growth going forward. The company reported annual vehicle production capacity of close to two million vehicles in the second quarter, doubling from the same period last year.
The company aims to increase its annual vehicle deliveries by an average of 50% ""over a multi-year horizon"" and aspires to hit 20 million annual vehicle deliveries in 2030. That's an ambitious number, but the 24% annual growth expected in the EV market through the end of the decade should help Tesla get closer to its target. Investors should consider taking advantage of any pullbacks in Tesla stock to go long given its immense long-term potential.
2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC, is a steal right now as it trades for just 16 times earnings, a discount to the broader market's multiple. Buying TSMC at these levels looks like a no-brainer given its terrific growth.
The company supplies chips to the world's leading companies such as Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Sony, Broadcom, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices, among others. Some of its customers are struggling because of weak demand, but others are thriving. AMD, for instance, delivered an impressive report last quarter along with healthy guidance. Qualcomm was also in fine form thanks to its market share gains at premium smartphone companies and the growth in emerging areas such as automotive chips.
Revenue jumped 37% year over year in the second quarter to $18.2 billion. The company also reported an 8.3 percentage point increase in its net profit margin, which sent earnings soaring 67% to $1.55 per share. What's more, TSMC's solid outlook suggests the concerns of a slowdown in semiconductor demand may be unwarranted.
Management's guidance of $20.2 billion in revenue (at the midpoint) this quarter points to a 36% year-over-year jump. Operating margin is also forecast to increase 6.8 percentage points to 48% at the midpoint. For the full year, TSMC is anticipating revenue to increase in the mid-30% range.
Fueling that is solid demand from the high-performance computing, Internet of Things, and automotive segments. These areas have helped TSMC offset weakness in smartphones and personal computers. Even better, TSMC's long-term outlook suggests its diversification will help it grow at a nice clip in the long run.
The company expects to clock 15% to 20% annual revenue growth over the next several years. That's not surprising given global semiconductor industry revenue is expected to increase over 60% this decade to $1 trillion. That's also probably the reason why analysts are expecting 23% annual earnings growth from TSMC over the next five years.
All this makes TSMC a top semiconductor stock to buy right now following its 30% decline in 2022.
