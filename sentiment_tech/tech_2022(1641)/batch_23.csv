Aug 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were set to open lower on Tuesday on concerns that a planned visit by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan could worsen tensions between the United States and China.
The latest geopolitical uncertainty comes at a time when financial markets are already dealing with the fallout from a war in Ukraine, energy crisis in Europe, soaring inflation and tightening of financial conditions.
Shares of chipmakers, which have a large exposure to China, fell in premarket trading. Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O, Qualcomm QCOM.O, Intel Corp INTC.O, Micron Technology Inc MU.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O were down between 0.9% and 1.3%.
The CBOE volatility index .VIX, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, rose to 24.23 points, its highest level in nearly a week.
""Chip stocks are really exposed to Asia. Some of them have 70% of their sales, especially chip equipment companies, in that region so it's a big deal for them,"" said Jack DeGan, chief investment officer at Harbor Advisory.
Wall Street has kicked off August on a lackluster note following its best monthly performance since 2020 in July amid heightened fears of a global recession, after data showed factory activity weakened across the United States, Europe and Asia.
Against that backdrop, investors have turned increasingly jittery about the health of corporate America.
""Any kind of geopolitical concern can cause traders who gained quite a bit last week to take a little bit (profit) off the table,"" Degan said.
At 8:17 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were down 178 points, or 0.54%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 26.75 points, or 0.65%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 112.75 points, or 0.87%.
Caterpillar Inc CAT.N slipped 3.4% after its quarterly sales missed market expectations due to supply-chain issues and the suspension of its Russia operations.
DuPont de Nemours DD.N fell 2% after the industrial materials maker lowered its full-year outlook, while shares of credit-rating company S&P Global Inc SPGI.N dipped 2.5% on downbeat 2022 profit forecast.
Among others, Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N jumped 14% after the ride-hailing firm reported positive quarterly cash flow for the first time ever and forecast upbeat third-quarter operating profit.
Pinterest Inc PINS.N surged 17.8% as the activist investor Elliott Investment Management become the largest shareholder of the digital pin-board firm.
Arista Networks Inc ANET.N rose 5.4% after the cloud networking solutions company posted stronger second-quarter results.

2022-08-02 00:00:00+00:00,Why Intel's Recent Bad News Does Not Spell Doom for the Chipmaker,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intels-recent-bad-news-does-not-spell-doom-for-the-chipmaker,,,"Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) second-quarter earnings report issued July 28 was a disaster by any measure. The company reported dramatic misses on revenue and earnings and significantly lowered its outlook for the rest of 2022.
Not surprisingly, Intel stock plunged following this news. However, Intel is in the midst of a turnaround strategy with a plan to spend tens of billions on new foundries and attempt to retake the technical lead. Given these plans, the question for investors is whether they should try to take advantage of this lower stock price.
Intel's earnings
For the second quarter of 2022, revenue came in at $15.3 billion, a 22% drop from year-ago levels. This was far short of the $17.9 billion analysts estimated.
And to add insult to injury, the cost of both sales and operating expenses surged by double digits during this period. This led to a loss of $454 million, or $0.11 per share, well short of the $0.69 in profit forecast by analysts.
Such a dramatic miss has affected its outlook for 2022. Intel now believes it will earn between $65 billion and $68 billion in revenue for the year. Just three months ago, Intel had predicted $76 billion in revenue for 2022.
On the Q2 2022 earnings call, Intel blamed this performance on a variety of factors. This included supply chain challenges, COVID-19 lockdowns in China, and even its own execution. Investors did not respond well, and Intel stock dropped 8% following the announcement. Consequently, its stock has dropped by around 35% from its high in January.
That decline has taken its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to around 6, dramatically lower than the earnings multiples for Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, or Nvidia. Nonetheless, with this dramatic miss and the lack of growth, Intel struggles to gain investor interest despite this low multiple.

Why this might be good for Intel anyway
However, challenges like its falling revenue are why Intel hired a new CEO and changed its long-term strategy. With Pat Gelsinger now at the helm, Intel has set out on a path to regain its technical lead. It will apply its production capacity to build a foundry business that aims to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung and plans to spend tens of billions to build new foundries in both the U.S. and Europe. Furthermore, unlike his predecessor, Gelsinger is an engineer who understands the product and what it might take to help Intel regain its technical lead.
Moreover, chip development cycles take three to five years. Gelsinger has held the job for only 18 months, so the jury is still out on whether his strategy can succeed.
Additionally, both the House and Senate have passed the $52 billion CHIPS Act. Intel's foundry footprint and expansion plans will probably make it a major beneficiary of these subsidies. And given the push to bring chip manufacturing back to the U.S., Intel will likely benefit long-term once the planned foundries become operational.
Should I buy Intel?
As for whether investors should buy Intel, the answer is no, or, more precisely, not right now. Gelsinger started this process when he took over in early 2021, so the three-to-five-year chip cycle has not yet played out. Moreover, as this earnings miss shows, Intel's strategy has yet to show any signs of success.
However, due to subsidies and its massive foundry investments, Intel will likely succeed at least to some degree. At a P/E ratio of 6, the semiconductor stock could become a great buy once it has a proven catalyst.

China views the visit by Pelosi, second in the line of succession to the U.S. presidency and a long-time critic of China, as sending an encouraging signal to the pro-independence camp in Taiwan and has repeatedly warned against it.
Taiwan is home to the world's biggest manufacturer of semiconductors on contract, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW. Shares of the company closed down 2.4%, while peer United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) 2303.TW fell 3%.

""The outlook for trade in Asia is likely to weigh on semiconductors, given how much of the world's global production comes from Taiwan,"" said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets UK.
Semiconductor stocks globally felt the heat. Germany's Infineon IFXGn.DE declined 2.3%, while Dutch firms ASML ASML.AS, ASMI ASMI.AS and BESI BESI.AS fell between 3% and 4%.
U.S. chip stocks such as Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, Intel Corp INTC.O, Qualcomm QCOM.O and Micron Technology Inc MU.O dipped more than 1% each in trading before the bell.
""This market reaction is expected following the strong performance of equity markets in July,"" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard in London.
""The longer term impact is unlikely to be significant unless the situation escalates, which wouldn't be my expectation right now.""

2022-08-02 00:00:00+00:00,“Opportunity to Accumulate Shares” Keeps This Analyst Bullish on Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/opportunity-to-accumulate-shares-keeps-this-analyst-bullish-on-intel,,,"The disaster streak of the semiconductor industry continued with the disappointing Q2 results of Intel (INTC), garnished with dismal full-year guidance. Nonetheless, having faith in the phrase ‘max pain means BUY,’ Needham analyst Quinn Bolton decided to reinforce a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $40.
Last week, the world’s largest semiconductor company delivered what seems to be its “worst performing quarter for many years to come,” giving investors a great window of opportunity to accumulate INTC shares. Among a few things to celebrate in the Q2 results was the surge in Mobileye revenues, supported by higher uptake of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).
Granted, Bolton expects the debacle to continue in Q3 as well; however, it is the long-term view and the fundamental strength of Intel that is keeping the analyst bullish.
Some Strengths to Consider
One of the things that Bolton is hopeful about is the leadership qualities of Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who came into the office early in 2021. “With new CEO Pat Gelsinger coming onboard, we believe Intel will be able to identify weaknesses in its processor roadmap and re-establish its processor performance leadership,” said Bolton.
Notably, Intel intends to produce most of its 7nm products internally by 2023, which is expected to be an advantage for the company in terms of economies of scale and market share gain in the Data Center Group (DCG) segment. “We believe Intel will follow through with its plan to aggressively protect its DCG share from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) while regaining its technological leadership with 7nm,” observed Bolton.
Bolton sees Intel’s gross margin continuing to be affected in the near term by its consistent investments in CPU design and process technology. However, these investments are necessary to bolster Intel’s market leadership in the CPU area. Once that happens, it will give the company ample opportunity to recover its margins.
Meanwhile, Wall Street analyst consensus suggests investors wait on the sidelines for a better entry/exit point, giving Intel a Hold rating based on three Buys, 16 Holds, and eight Sells. The price target currently stands at $39.70, reflecting an upside of 6.63% from Monday morning’s price levels.
Parting Thoughts: It's a Matter of Time Before INTC Climbs Back to the Top
One should not forget that the semiconductor industry, in general, has been wading through troubled waters ever since the COVID-19-induced boom went bust. Moreover, inflation and supply shortages made things worse for the industry.
In any case, Intel has a plan in place to navigate the business through inflation. Moreover, it is pushing ahead strongly to regain its leadership position in the chip-making industry, and going by Bolton’s stance, the company should regain its lost value, and then much more, in the coming years.

2022-08-01 00:00:00+00:00,U.S. considers crackdown on memory chip makers in China,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-considers-crackdown-on-memory-chip-makers-in-china,,,"By Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - The United States is considering limiting shipments of American chipmaking equipment to memory chip makers in China including Yangtze Memory Technologies Co Ltd (YMTC), according to four people familiar with the matter, part of a bid to halt China's semiconductor sector advances and protect U.S. companies.
If President Joe Biden's administration proceeds with the move, it could also hurt South Korean memory chip juggernauts Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and SK Hynix Inc 000660.KS, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Samsung has two big factories in China while SK Hynix Inc is buying Intel Corp's INTC.O NAND flash memory chips manufacturing business in China.
The crackdown, if approved, would involve barring the shipment of U.S. chipmaking equipment to factories in China that manufacture advanced NAND chips.
It would mark the first U.S. bid through export controls to target Chinese production of memory chips without specialized military applications, representing a more expansive view of American national security, according to export control experts.
The move also would seek to protect the only U.S. memory chip producers, Western Digital Corp WDC.O and Micron Technology Inc MU.O, which together represent about a quarter of the NAND chips market.
NAND chips store data in devices such as smartphones and personal computers and at data centers for the likes of Amazon AMZN.O, Facebook FB.O and Google GOOGL.O. How many gigabytes of data a phone or laptop can hold is determined by how many NAND chips it includes and how advanced they are.
Under the action being considered, U.S. officials would ban the export of tools to China used to make NAND chips with more than 128 layers, according to two of the sources. LAM Research Corp LRCX.O and Applied Materials AMAT.O, both based in Silicon Valley, are the primary suppliers of such tools.
All the sources described the administration's consideration of the matter as in the early stages, with no proposed regulations yet drafted.
Asked to comment on the possible move, a spokesperson for the Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, did not discuss potential restrictions but noted that ""the Biden administration is focused on impairing (China's) efforts to manufacture advanced semiconductors to address significant national security risks to the United States.""
FAST-GROWING COMPANY
YMTC, founded in 2016, is a rising power in manufacturing NAND chips. Micron and Western Digital are under pressure from YMTC's low prices, as the White House wrote in a June 2021 report. YMTC's expansion and low-price offerings present ""a direct threat"" to Micron and Western Digital, that report said. The report described YMTC as China's ""national champion"" and the recipient of some $24 billion in Chinese subsidies.
YMTC, already under investigation by the Commerce Department over whether it violated U.S. export controls by selling chips to Chinese telecoms company Huawei, is in talks with Apple Inc AAPL.O to supply the top U.S. smartphone maker with flash memory chips, according to a Bloomberg report.
LAM Research Corp, SK Hynix and Micron declined comment on the U.S. policy. Samsung, Applied Materials Inc, YMTC and Western Digital Corp did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
CONGRESS ACTS
Tensions between China and the United States over the tech sector deepened under Biden's predecessor Donald Trump and have continued since. Reuters reported on July 8 that Biden's administration is also considering restrictions on shipments to China of tools to make advanced logic chips, seeking to hamstring China's largest chipmaker, SMIC 0981.HK.
The U.S. Congress last week approved legislation aimed at helping the United States compete with China by investing billions of dollars in domestic chip production.
Chipmakers that take money under the measure would be prohibited from building or expanding manufacturing for certain advanced chips, including advanced memory chips at a level to be determined by the administration, in countries including China.
According to Walt Coon of the consulting firm Yole Intelligence, YMTC accounts for about 5% of worldwide NAND flash memory chip production, almost double from a year ago. Western Digital stands at about 13% and Micron 11%. Coon said YMTC would be greatly hurt by restrictions like those that Biden's administration is contemplating.
""If they were stuck at 128, I don't know how they would really have a path forward,"" Coon said.
Production of NAND chips in China has grown to more than 23% of the worldwide total this year from under 14% in 2019, while production in the United States has decreased from 2.3% to 1.6% over the same period, Yole data showed. For the American companies, nearly all of their chip production is done overseas.
It was unclear what impact the potential restrictions might have on other players in China. Intel, which retains a contract to manage operations in the factory it is selling to SK Hynix in China, is already producing memory chips with 144 layers at the Chinese site, according to an Intel press release.

2022-08-01 00:00:00+00:00,Is Trending Stock Intel Corporation (INTC) a Buy Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-trending-stock-intel-corporation-intc-a-buy-now-0,,,"Intel (INTC) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -0.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +8.4% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Intel belongs, has gained 12.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -47.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -61.8%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $3.44 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -37.1%. This estimate has changed -34% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.56 indicates a change of +3.4% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Intel.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
In the case of Intel, the consensus sales estimate of $18.91 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.5%. The $68.5 billion and $72.34 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -12.2% and +5.6%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $15.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22%. EPS of $0.29 for the same period compares with $1.28 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -14.51%. The EPS surprise was -57.97%.
Over the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

2022-08-01 00:00:00+00:00,Is iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) a Strong ETF Right Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-ishares-semiconductor-etf-soxx-a-strong-etf-right-now-3,,,"The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) made its debut on 07/10/2001, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Technology ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.
Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.
There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.
Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance.
The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.
Fund Sponsor & Index
The fund is managed by Blackrock. SOXX has been able to amass assets over $7.19 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs in the Technology ETFs. SOXX seeks to match the performance of the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index before fees and expenses.
The ICE Semiconductor Index measures the performance of U.S. traded securities of companies engaged in the semiconductor business.
Cost & Other Expenses
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.
With one of the cheaper products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.43%.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.87%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
It is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
SOXX's heaviest allocation is in the Information Technology sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Nvidia Corp (NVDA) accounts for about 8.36% of total assets, followed by Broadcom Inc (AVGO) and Intel Corporation Corp (INTC).
Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 56.72% of SOXX's total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
So far this year, SOXX has lost about -26.08%, and is down about -9.31% in the last one year (as of 08/01/2022). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $337.24 and $555.63.
The fund has a beta of 1.25 and standard deviation of 38.13% for the trailing three-year period, which makes SOXX a high risk choice in this particular space. With about 35 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.
Alternatives
IShares Semiconductor ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Technology ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.
SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD) tracks S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index and the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) tracks MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF has $1.12 billion in assets, VanEck Semiconductor ETF has $7.43 billion. XSD has an expense ratio of 0.35% and SMH charges 0.35%.

2022-07-31 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Gives Up on Optane Memory,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-gives-up-on-optane-memory,,,"Within the semiconductor industry, manufacturing memory chips may be the toughest task. Not technically tough -- manufacturing an advanced CPU or GPU is a lot more complicated than churning out DRAM or NAND chips. Tough because memory chips are largely a commodity. Supply and demand drives pricing, and bad downturns can push the bottom line of memory chip manufacturers deep into the red.
Getting out of memory chips for good
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has been working its way out of the memory chip business over the past few years. The company announced the sale of its NAND memory operations to SK Hynix in late 2020, exchanging its NAND component and wafer business, its SSD business, and a NAND manufacturing facility in China for $9 billion. The sale process is complicated and won't be fully completed until 2025.
In an interview earlier this year with Ben Thompson of Stratechery, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger made it very clear how much he dislikes the memory business. ""I never want to be in memory, you see I'm doing everything I can to exit our memory businesses in that regard,"" Gelsinger said.
NAND was a big part of Intel's memory business, but it wasn't the only part. Intel launched its Optane product family in 2017 built around a new type of memory technology, 3D XPoint, co-developed with Micron. 3D XPoint is non-volatile like NAND, meaning it retains data when power is cut off, but it's much faster.
Intel's Optane memory targeted multiple use cases. In PCs, Optane-based SSDs could be used in place of standard SSDs, providing improved read and write performance. And in servers, expensive DRAM could be replaced with cheaper Optane memory. Optane isn't as fast as DRAM, but for applications where that performance difference isn't very important, Optane offered a strong value proposition.
Optane seemed to have a lot of potential back in 2017 when it first launched, but Intel hasn't been able to turn it into a business that really works. Along with its second-quarter report, Intel announced that it was winding down the Optane business. That effectively kills 3D XPoint as a technology, since Micron had abandoned it in 2021.
Winding down the Optane business involves a substantial write-down of inventory. It makes little sense for any customer to buy more Optane memory when the underlying technology is being abandoned, so Intel is effectively stuck with a bunch of chips it can't sell. Intel wrote down its Optane inventory by $559 million in the second quarter, knocking down the bottom line.
Optane is out, but Intel has plenty of new products
Intel's core products are CPUs aimed at PCs and servers, but the company has been working on building out a host of new businesses over the past few years. Intel will soon launch graphics cards aimed at PC gamers and creators, it's already shipping its Blockscale ASIC for mining , and the company is investing billions in an effort to become a major player in the foundry market. Intel has announced 10 new revenue-producing product lines this year, and it has plans for more.
We can be sure that none of those new products will be memory. Instead, Intel will focus on products where it can differentiate itself. The company's entry in the graphics card market is particularly notable. While it will take time to build that business up, graphics cards are a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Intel in the long run.
It's important for Intel to expand beyond its core CPU businesses, but it's also important to recognize when a product simply isn't working. Optane never found enough traction, and Intel is right to cut the cord as it goes after better opportunities.

I'll touch on what went wrong this quarter, and what is being done to get this great company back on track.
For the second quarter, Intel reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.29, a decrease of 79% year over year, missing its own guidance by $0.41.
Revenue came in at $15.3 billion, down 17% year over year (YOY) and missing estimates by $2.7 billion.
Gross margin was 44.8%, 6.2 percentage points below guidance, and down 15 percentage points YOY.
The company expects Q3 revenue to come in at $17 billion at the midpoint, down 15% YOY. It expects gross margin of 46.5%, down 11.8 percentage points YOY, and EPS of $0.35, down 76% YOY.
If this decline continues, dividends might be in danger. But for those that believe that Pat Gelsinger and his team can turn this around, this might turn out to be a great long-term bet.

2022-07-29 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why ASML Is a Great Investment During a Turbulent Market,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-asml-is-a-great-investment-during-a-turbulent-market,,,"While semiconductor manufacturing supplier ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) was not immune to the pandemic, supply chain challenges, inflation, and rising interest rates, it has held up better than many other technology companies. But now that many economic experts think a worldwide recession is likely, many investors wonder how well the company will fare in a slowing economic environment.
Here's why ASML is a safe harbor in the current economic storm.
Image source: Getty Images.
Strong demand for ASML products trumps recession concerns
In January 2022, research and consulting firm Gartner issued a press release stating that worldwide semiconductor revenue grew 25.1% in 2021 to reach $583.5 billion, crossing $500 billion for the first time. Yet despite rapid growth, semiconductor manufacturers can't build advanced chips fast enough to satisfy demand.
In response to the chip shortfall, top manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) plan to make massive investments to keep up with the rising demand for state-of-the-art chips. And since ASML's lithography systems are crucial in manufacturing modern chips, these chip manufacturing capacity expansions are already showing up in increased demand.
The company's second-quarter 2022 results showed new orders (bookings) rising to 8.5 billion euros, from pre-pandemic Q2 2019 bookings of 2.8 billion euros. This booking number indicates robust demand and is the highest quarterly level in company history.
In addition to solid demand, ASML has a very healthy backlog of 33 billion euros that it can count on if order demand slows. According to industry reports, the lead time on ASML's most advanced equipment is approximately 12 to 18 months. Since chipmakers need ASML machines to remain competitive, as they are the only solution available on the market to produce advanced chips, customers will be unlikely to consider losing their place in line, except under the direst conditions.
Moreover, ASML customers have already told the company that they will not cancel their orders even if demand slows down in their end markets. Consequently, management believes that a moderate recession would only have a limited effect on its results.
The supply chain and inflation are ASML's Achilles' heel
While ASML has plenty of demand, its main problem is that it cannot supply its customers with its machines fast enough. Since the third quarter of 2021, management has blamed its problems of delayed production starts on supply chain issues.
To cover up some of these supply chain challenges, ASML started utilizing fast shipments in 2021, a program that forgoes testing the lithography machines in its factories. Instead, ASML performs the formal testing and acceptance at the customer's site. Customers get to use the machines faster, but ASML must defer revenue to later quarters.
Some investors have a big issue with ASML's use of fast shipments because the deferred revenues hurt current results. For instance, ASML initially projected year-on-year revenue growth of 20% for 2022, but has since lowered expectations for revenue growth to around 10% in the Q2 earnings report.
In addition to supply chain woes, rising inflation has become a massive concern for the company. ASML is encountering inflation in two forms. First, rising labor costs result from the company's need to boost its headcount to meet market demand for its products, in a job market short of semiconductor engineers. The second inflation concern is rising component pricing because of higher material and transportation costs.
ASML reduced its full-year 2022 gross margin expectations from 53% to 52% in the first quarter because of inflation. In addition, the company lowered gross margins further in Q2, to between 49% to 50% for 2022, based on supply chain issues and the use of fast shipments.
ASML Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts
Is now the time to buy?
While the adverse effects of inflation and supply chain problems have hurt current results, both issues are only a short-term concern. ASML should be able to correct supply chain issues over the next several years by working with its partners to get production capacity up to speed. As for inflation, ASML will eventually raise pricing to counter inflation's effects. Higher interest rates should also dampen inflation over the next year or two.
And over the longer term, the company's results are driven more by global megatrends fueling demand for advanced and mature chips. Therefore, you can expect production to ramp higher over the next several years to meet demand, resulting in a reacceleration of revenue growth, with gross margins moving toward the company's goal of 54% to 56% in 2025.
If you are looking to buy a high-upside growth company resistant to a recession, ASML should be a solid bet in the current environment.

Apple sees continued strength in demand for iPhone
Amazon expects higher revenue in third quarter
Intel cuts annual forecasts, shares slide
Oil giants Exxon, Chevron jump after record revenue
Indexes: Dow up 1%, S&P 500 up 1.4%, Nasdaq up 1.9%
Updates close with volume, other details
By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks added to their recent rally on Friday after upbeat forecasts from Apple AAPL.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their biggest monthly percentage gains since 2020.
Most S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with energy .SPNY rising 4.5%, the most of any S&P sector. Chevron Corp CVX.N rose 8.9% and Exxon Mobil XOM.N shares jumped 4.6% after the companies reported record quarterly revenues.
Apple Inc shares gained 3.3% after the company said parts shortages were easing and that demand for iPhones was continuing. Amazon.com Inc shot up 10.4% after it forecast a jump in third-quarter revenue from bigger fees from its Prime loyalty subscriptions.
""In today's market, the Amazon and Apple numbers are giving the market support (on) the idea that two large companies that are a large part of the S&P seem so far to be able to navigate through these tougher times,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
Stocks have also rallied this week on investor speculation that the Federal Reserve may not need to be as aggressive with interest rate hikes as some had feared.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 315.5 points, or 0.97%, to 32,845.13; the S&P 500 .SPX gained 57.86 points, or 1.42%, to 4,130.29 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 228.10 points, or 1.88%, to 12,390.69.
All three major indexes gained for the month and for the week. The S&P 500 gained about 9.1% for July in its biggest monthly percentage gain since November 2020, while the Nasdaq jumped about 12.3% in July in its biggest monthly gain since April 2020.
In other earnings, Intel Corp INTC.O shares fell 8.6% after the company cut annual sales and profit forecasts and missed second-quarter estimates.
Second-quarter U.S. corporate results have mostly been stronger than expected.
Of the 279 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far, 77.8% have exceeded expectations. Earnings for S&P 500 companies now are expected to have increased 7.1% in the quarter versus an estimated 5.6% at the start of July, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The day's economic data showed U.S. labor costs increased strongly in the second quarter as a tight jobs market boosted wage growth.
But on Thursday, a government report showed the American economy unexpectedly contracted in the second quarter, suggesting to some investors that the economy was on the cusp of a recession. They said it might deter the Fed from continuing to aggressively increase rates as it battles high inflation.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.35 billion shares, compared with the 10.79 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.92-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and 33 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 63 new highs and 82 new lows.

NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks added to their recent rally on Friday after upbeat forecasts from Apple AAPL.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their biggest monthly percentage gains since 2020.
Most S&P 500 sectors ended higher. Energy .SPNY was up the most, with Chevron Corp CVX.N and Exxon Mobil XOM.N shares jumping after the companies reported record quarterly revenues.
Apple Inc shares rose after the company said parts shortages were easing and that demand for iPhones was continuing. Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O shot up after it forecast a jump in third-quarter revenue from bigger fees from its Prime loyalty subscriptions.
""In today's market, the Amazon and Apple numbers are giving the market support (on) the idea that two large companies that are a large part of the S&P seem so far to be able to navigate through these tougher times,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
Stocks have also rallied this week on investor speculation that the Federal Reserve may not need to be as aggressive with interest rate hikes as some had feared.
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 58.05 points, or 1.43%, to end at 4,130.48 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC gained 225.81 points, or 1.86%, to 12,388.40. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 323.51 points, or 0.99%, to 32,853.14.
In other earnings, Intel Corp INTC.O shares fell after the company cut annual sales and profit forecasts and missed second-quarter estimates.
Second-quarter U.S. corporate results have mostly been stronger than expected.
Of the 279 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far, 77.8% have exceeded expectations. Earnings for S&P 500 companies now are expected to have increased 7.1% in the quarter versus an estimated 5.6% at the start of July, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Data showed U.S. consumer spending increased more than expected in June as Americans paid more for goods and services, with monthly inflation surging by the most since 2005.

Indexes up: Dow 0.25%, S&P 0.70%, Nasdaq 0.92%
Adds comments, updates prices to early afternoon
By Aniruddha Ghosh and Shreyashi Sanyal
July 29 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 indexes rose on Friday and were on track for their biggest monthly gain in nearly 20 months, after upbeat earnings updates from Apple and Amazon and on hopes of a less aggressive monetary policy.
Mega-cap companies have largely fared better this reporting season and are predicting less impact from the current economic turmoil, allaying investor fears that a potential recession could dent their earnings power.
By early afternoon, Apple Inc AAPL.O shares gained 2.9% after the company said parts shortages were easing and that demand for iPhones was unceasing despite consumers tightening other spending.
Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O shot up 11.4% after it forecast a jump in third-quarter revenue from bigger fees from its Prime loyalty subscriptions.
The S&P 500 technology index .SPLRCT was up 0.7% and looked set to record a 12% gain for the month, its biggest since April 2020.
However, gains on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI were capped by Intel Corp INTC.O, which tumbled 8.9% after it cut annual sales and profit forecasts and missed second-quarter estimates.
Meanwhile, investor worries of bigger interest rate hikes eased a bit on Thursday after GDP data showed the American economy contracted for the second straight quarter.
""Within the context of a bear market phase, we haven't seen the low for 2022 just yet, because headwinds like inflationary pressures, and everything else are still very real,"" said David Keller, chief market strategist at StockCharts.com.
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX slipped 0.4%, while consumer discretionary stocks .SPLRCD jumped 3.4%.
Data showed U.S. consumer spending increased more than expected in June as Americans paid more for goods and services, with monthly inflation surging by the most since 2005.
At 12:09 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 81.34 points, or 0.25%, at 32,610.97, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 28.57 points, or 0.70%, at 4,101.00, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 112.19 points, or 0.92%, at 12,274.78.
The three indexes were also set for their second straight weekly gain.
The S&P 500 energy sector .SPNY jumped 3.9% on gains of 8.2% in Chevron Corp CVX.N and 4.3% in Exxon Mobil XOM.N, following their record quarterly revenue on the back of soaring crude prices.
Phillips 66 PSX.N rose 0.5% after the refiner reported a jump in second-quarter profit.
Procter & Gamble Co PG.N fell 5.5% after predicting full-year earnings below analysts' estimates.
Of the 279 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far, 77.8% have exceeded expectations.
Analysts now expect S&P 500 profits to grow 7.6% for the second quarter, up from their 6.8% projection at the start of the three-month period, according to Refinitiv data.
The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, also know as Wall Street's fear gauge, hit a 3-month low.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.93-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.05-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded two new 52-week highs and 33 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 42 new highs and 51 new lows.

The world’s largest chipmaker missed estimates for both earnings and revenues and slashed the outlook for the fiscal year, citing cooling demand for its chips used in personal computers.

As such, shares of INTC plunged more than 10% in after-market hours. Given this, ETFs like Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ, First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF FTXL, First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund TDIV, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX and iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor ETF VLUE, having the highest allocation to the world’s biggest semiconductor maker, will be in focus.
Q2 Earnings in Focus
Earnings of 29 cents per share came much below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents and four times lower than the year-ago earnings of $1.28. This marks the first miss in more than eight years.

Revenues declined 17% year over year to $15.3 billion and came in below the estimated $17.9 billion. This represents the seventh straight quarter of decline and the biggest in more than a decade. Both client computing, and data-center and AI revenues declined 25% and 16%, respectively. However, network and edge, accelerated computing systems and graphics, and Mobileye revenues were up 11%, 5% and 41%, respectively (see: all the Technology ETFs here).

Intel has been grappling with a chip shortage. It continues to face challenges linked to persistent global supply-chain problems and worries of demand weakness in its largest end market PCs, in the upcoming quarters.

Intel slashed its revenue guidance to $65-$68 billion from $76 billion for the full fiscal year, and earnings per share guidance to $2.30 from $3.60. For the third quarter, the company expects revenues of $15-$16 billion and earnings per share of 35 cents. Both revenue and earnings per share guidance are well below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.89 billion and $1.00 per share, respectively.

By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks added to their recent rally on Friday after upbeat forecasts from Apple AAPL.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O, putting the Nasdaq on course for its biggest monthly percentage gain since April 2020.
Most S&P 500 sectors were higher in afternoon trading, led by a more than 4% rise in energy .SPNY. Chevron Corp CVX.N and Exxon Mobil XOM.N shares jumped after they reported record quarterly revenue.
Apple Inc shares gained 3.5% after the company said parts shortages were easing and that demand for iPhones was continuing. Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O shot up 11.8% after it forecast a jump in third-quarter revenue from bigger fees from its Prime loyalty subscriptions.
