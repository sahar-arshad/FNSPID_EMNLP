Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-10-04 00:00:00+00:00,Micron to invest up to $100 bln in semiconductor factory in New York,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-to-invest-up-to-%24100-bln-in-semiconductor-factory-in-new-york,,,"Adds company response, Biden statement, background, shares
Oct 4 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Micron Technology MU.O said on Tuesday that it planned to invest up to $100 billion over the next 20-plus years to build a computer chip factory complex in upstate New York, in a bid to boost domestic chip manufacturing.
The project, which Micron claims will be the world's largest semiconductor fabrication facility, is expected to create nearly 50,000 jobs in New York, with the first phase investment of $20 billion planned by the end of this decade.
Micron in August announced its plans to invest $40 billion through the end of the decade to build memory manufacturing in multiple phases in the United States.
The spur in new chip investments comes after President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act in August, providing $52.7 billion in subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production and research to boost competitiveness with China.
Later that month, Intel Corp INTC.O and Canada's Brookfield Asset Management BAMa.TO agreed to jointly fund up to $30 billion for chip factories in Arizona.
Biden on Tuesday praised Micron for the investment in manufacturing as ""another win for America"" and would create ""tens of thousands of good paying jobs.""
Shares of Micron were up 3.1% in early trading, amid broader gains.
Micron Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra said last week that the company had made ""significant"" reductions to capex, which will be down more than 30% at about $8 billion for fiscal 2023 as demand for PCs and smartphones slows. [nL4N3103UN]

2022-10-04 00:00:00+00:00,TOGGLE Daily Brief: How Oversold Is the S&P 500?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/toggle-daily-brief%3A-how-oversold-is-the-sp-500,,,"A
fter a bleak weekend of scary news and fears of a Lehman-like bankruptcy, stocks opened on Monday and rocketed higher. A lot. The day-to-day gyrations have been enough to give even a veteran trader a case of motion sickness. What’s going on? 
“More buyers than sellers” is the kind of faux truism that is often trucked out when better - if equally banal - explanations are already taken. However, there is a grain of truth in the statement this time around. 
A market that doesn’t respond to bad news is always worth pondering. It can be a bullish sign but more often, it’s merely reflecting temporary exhaustion with the current trend. This seems to be the case here.  
To wit, positioning in S&P 500 futures (frequently used to hedge long portfolios, or by hedge funds to express a bearish view) was insanely short. As evident from the chart below, it hasn’t been matched by any time since 2011, and before that only during the global financial crisis.
Another way to look at it is the sheer force of the price action. Every piece from Michael Hartnett at BofA is worth perusing, and the latest is no exception. One chart (featured below) shows that the market has come down so swiftly it would have struggled to go down more in absence of rather apocalyptic news. Credit Suisse rumors didn’t rise to that standard (yet).
The reason this point - that price action was driven by absence of sellers rather than abundance of buyers - is worth highlighting is that it suggests the bear market is not finished. 
If you go back to a Daily Brief from a few weeks ago, you’ll see that one of the conditions for a major low is a successful retest of the prior (June) low. This is the battle that’s unfolding currently.

2022-10-04 00:00:00+00:00,The Bull Case for Intel: TSMC's Crazy Pricing Power,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-bull-case-for-intel%3A-tsmcs-crazy-pricing-power,,,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) sells hundreds of millions of devices each year. For those supplying parts or services necessary to get those devices into consumers' hands, winning Apple's business is a huge deal. Some suppliers depend on Apple so heavily that they have no choice but to bow down to Apple's demands, especially if competitors are gunning for the same business.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) may be the only Apple supplier where the script is flipped. Apple depends on TSMC to manufacture its custom chips, and TSMC generated around 26% of its total revenue last year from its largest customer, which is presumably Apple. In theory, Apple should have some leverage in pricing negotiations.
TSMC has all the power
The problem is that TSMC is pretty much the only game in town, at least when it comes to manufacturing the most advanced chips. More than half of semiconductors manufactured by third-party foundries come from TSMC, and the company has pulled away in terms of manufacturing technology. TSMC's manufacturing prowess is partly responsible for the incredible performance and efficiency of Apple's chips.
TSMC is reportedly seeking pricing increases for 2023, according to Chinese website The Economic Daily. Prices for 8-inch wafers will be boosted by 6%, while prices for 12-inch wafers will go up by between 3% and 5%. Apple is reportedly going to pay those higher prices after TSMC stood firm on its pricing demands.
This is a situation that's ripe for disruption. If a viable alternative were to emerge, Apple and other large TSMC customers would gain some leverage and no longer be entirely dependent on TSMC. This is where Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) comes in. The chip company is pouring tens of billions of dollars into its manufacturing arm as it builds out its own foundry business.
This effort will take years to bear significant fruit, and Intel will need to win the trust of foundry customers who looked on as the company struggled with manufacturing setbacks over the past few years. Intel will also need to catch up with TSMC on the technology front. The company had an undisputed manufacturing lead for many years, but that lead has slipped away.
Intel's enormous opportunity
Intel's core business is still making CPUs for PCs and servers, and that's not going to change anytime soon. But more than $80 billion is spent at third-party foundries annually, and that number will rise over time as semiconductors find their way into more devices and products. Over the long run, Intel's foundry business has the potential to become a significant portion of its total revenue.
This is the bull case for Intel. There are very few companies capable of building a foundry business that rivals TSMC's, both in terms of expertise and capital. The payoff will be enormous if Intel gets it right.
Intel also has one big advantage: It's a U.S.-based manufacturer. It's building a mega-fab in Ohio, and it's investing in new facilities in Europe. TSMC is working on a U.S. foundry, but the company is based in Taiwan, which is caught in the middle of increasingly contentious relations between the U.S. and China. There's a chance China will invade Taiwan at some point. It's in the best interests of large TSMC customers to seek alternatives, and Intel is looking to play that role.
Right now, as demand for semiconductors takes a hit as sales of PCs, graphics cards, and other products slump, spending billions on more manufacturing capacity may not look like the best idea. But Intel is playing the long game. If those investments pay off, Intel stock could be one of the biggest winners in the semiconductor industry over the next decade.

Oct 3 (Reuters) - Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc META.Osaid on Monday it has launched a new set of free software tools for artificial intelligence applications that could make it easier for developers to switch back and forth between different underlying chips.
Meta's new open-source AI platform is based on an open-source machine learning framework called PyTorch, and can help code run up to 12 times faster on Nvidia Corp's NVDA.O flagship A100 chip or up to four times faster on Advanced Micro Devices Inc's AMD.O MI250 chip, it said.
But just as important as the speed boost is the flexibility the sofware can provide, Meta said in a blog post.
Software has become a key battleground for chipmakers seeking to build up an ecosystem of developers to use their chips. Nvidia's CUDA platform has been the most popular so far for artificial intelligence work.
However, once developers tailor their code for Nvidia chips, it is difficult to run it on graphics processing units, or GPUs, from Nvidia competitors like AMD. Meta said the software is designed to easily swap between chips without being locked in.
""The unified GPU back-end support gives deep learning developers more hardware vendor choices with minimal migration costs,"" Meta said in its blog post.
Nvidia and AMD did not immediately return requests for comment.
Meta's software is made for AI work called inference, which is when machine learning algorithms that previously have been trained on huge amounts of data are called on to make quick judgments, such as deciding whether a photograph is of a cat or a dog.
""This is a software effort that is multi-platform. And it's a testament to the importance of software, particularly for deploying neural networks in machine learning for inference,"" said David Kanter, a founder of MLCommons, an independent group that measures AI speed.
Kanter added that this new Meta AI platform would be ""good for customer choice.""

2022-10-03 00:00:00+00:00,3 Reasons You Might Want to Buy Intel Stock Despite Its Challenges,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-you-might-want-to-buy-intel-stock-despite-its-challenges,,,"The semiconductor industry has experienced shortages and rapid increases in demand amid the explosion of new tech applications. However, one chip company that continues to struggle is industry pioneer Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
While it led the industry for decades, other chip designers and manufacturers eclipsed it due to its development struggles. Current CEO Pat Gelsinger seeks to get Intel back on top with initiatives to retake the technical lead and invest heavily in new foundries. While it is too early to know if or how well Gelsinger will succeed, patient investors may want to consider the semiconductor stock for three reasons.
1. It still generates massive revenues
Despite the focus on the likes of Nvidia and AMD, Intel remains an industry behemoth. While it has lost its designation as the ""world's largest chipmaker,"" it still outproduces most of its peers.
In the first six months of 2022, Intel generated just under $34 billion in revenue, a figure that declined 14% versus the same period in 2021.
In comparison, AMD reported just over $12 billion in revenue. Though Nvidia's fiscal second quarter ends one month after Intel's, it generated $15 billion in the first half of its fiscal year. Taiwan Semiconductor, which manufactures more than half of the world's semiconductors according to TrendForce, has just now eclipsed Intel with $36 billion in revenue over the same time frame.
Moreover, sub-sectors like PCs have seen sales drop amid a slowing economy, a factor that will probably make its drop in revenue temporary. Intel's pivot into the foundry business could also serve as a revenue driver once it builds its proposed foundries in the U.S. and Europe. For these reasons, it will likely remain a major industry player.
2. Intel's dividend
Another effect of the declining stock price is the increasing appeal of its payout. Currently, it pays shareholders $1.46 per share annually. That has taken its cash yield to 5.5%, the highest in its history.
Intel compares favorably to the S&P 500, which offers a dividend yield of around 1.8%. It also stands favorably against some of the highest dividend payers in the tech industry, such as Dividend Aristocrat IBM, which also offers a cash return of 5.5%.
Moreover, Intel has embraced its existence as a dividend payer. Despite its challenges, the payout has increased consistently since 2004. While that falls well short of the 25 years required to claim Dividend Aristocrat status, it is a long enough track record to negatively affect the stock price if the streak of payout hikes ends.
3. The low valuation
Additionally, Intel has fallen to what looks like an outlandishly low earnings multiple. It now sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of under six. This makes it a lower-cost stock compared with its major peers.
INTC PE Ratio data by YCharts
But despite that earnings multiple, no metric arguably describes Intel's situation better than its price-to-book value ratio. Currently, the stock sells at under 1.1 times the book value, a historic low.
Admittedly, the revenue declines and struggles to catch up to its peers have rightly put off investors. Still, at some point, valuation matters, and its book value may make Intel too inexpensive to ignore.
Making sense of Intel
Without a doubt, Intel is a troubled company. While it is investing heavily to become a player in the foundry business and regain its technical lead, it remains unknown whether it will succeed in either endeavor.
However, its current revenue levels still make it a major industry player. Since investors can earn a considerable dividend return and buy Intel near its book value, they may have a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity.

2022-10-03 00:00:00+00:00,Why Advanced Micro Devices Rallied Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-advanced-micro-devices-rallied-today,,,"What happened
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) were rallying on Monday, up 4.3% as of 2:09 p.m. EDT.
There wasn't too much company-specific news on AMD, although Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya did reiterate his buy rating on the chipmaker and several other cloud-related semiconductor stocks.
Today, the beaten-down semiconductor sector was rising across the board, as investors seem to be buying the very big dip in chipmakers and other technology names that have seen significant declines year to date.
So what
AMD has been one of the brightest stories in technology over the past few years, catching up to and surpassing Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) on technology, and rapidly taking market share in both the PC and data center processor market.
However, that success also caused AMD's P/E ratio to expand into a growth stock multiple, making it somewhat expensive heading into the year. As long-term interest rates have risen very sharply in 2022, high-multiple stocks have come under severe pressure, and AMD's had fallen by more than half to 28 times earnings, along with the stock's year-to-date decline of 56%.
Today, however, long-term yields are falling hard, with the 10-year Treasury bond yield slumping about 4%, from 3.8% to 3.65% as of this writing. This year, the movements in Treasury yields are almost the mirror image of tech stocks, which surged over the last few years amid rock-bottom rates. So as long-term yields fell today, virtually all of tech was seeing green -- especially semiconductors.
Yet it wasn't only a matter of the elevated multiple causing AMD's slump this year. After a pandemic-fueled boom, it looks as if the PC market is going bust. CEO Lisa Su had said previously the PC market will decline by a mid-teens percentage this year, which could hurt earnings growth this year and next.
However, the stock's 56% plunge bakes in an awful lot of this bad news. Even if we do have a recession next year, AMD's market share gains combined with its high-growth cloud computing chip business gives it good long-term prospects. In fact, BofA's reiteration of its buy rating has specifically to do with cloud computing growth. The analyst believes cloud spending should still continue in 2023, even in a macroeconomic slowdown.
Thus, it appears as though long-term investors are stepping into to buy beaten-down semiconductor stocks today. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) is up a whopping 4.2%, bouncing off this year's painful 40% decline.
Now what
Semiconductor stocks tend to move together, especially in times of macroeconomic stress, because the broader economy tends to heavily affect this cyclical sector.
However, AMD has done so much better than the index over the past five years -- up 423%, nearly quadrupling the returns of the iShares Semiconductor ETF -- due to its market-share gains against Intel.
With Intel investing in its technology under new CEO Pat Gelsinger in a bid to catch up in the years ahead, heightened competition is the main factor to watch for AMD specifically relative to other chip names. If Intel regains market share, it's possible AMD may be a relative underperformer in the years ahead. However, if AMD's foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), keeps its technology lead, it's possible AMD could continue to do well, even in relation to the broader sector.

2022-10-03 00:00:00+00:00,3 Dividend Growth Stocks With Yields Above 5%,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dividend-growth-stocks-with-yields-above-5,,,"Amid the bear market, the scramble for yield has become increasingly frantic among investors. While banks have increased their interest rates on deposits a bit, that interest income still significantly lags behind the current 8.3% inflation rate and is usually subject to taxation.
The severe slump in tech stocks has dragged established stocks down as well, with many high-yield dividend stocks now returning more than 5% on their payouts alone. As these stocks have a long track record of annual payout hikes, buying now will allow you to lock in these high-yield dividends so you are holding the stock down the road when their dividends eventually catch up to and exceed inflation.
Stocks such as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), and International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) offer this level of dividend growth. Let's find out a bit more about these three dividend growth stocks.
1. Intel
Intel is arguably the most unexpected high-yield dividend stock to appear in some time. Its current dividend of $1.46 per share currently yields about 5.5%. Moreover, it has risen consistently since 2004. While it is not a Dividend Aristocrat, Intel's current dividend streak likely places pressure on the company to maintain the payout hikes.
The one-time leader in the semiconductor industry has fallen behind several of its key competitors. With revenue falling and the company about to spend tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, many might question whether it can maintain the current dividend.
Nonetheless, the stock may have become oversold. It currently sells for less than 1.1 times book value, making it a possible once-in-a-generation opportunity. Also, despite Intel's issues, it generated $34 billion in revenue during the first half of 2022, more than AMD and Nvidia combined. It also stands to benefit significantly from newly passed legislation by Congress to puts nearly $53 billion toward boosting the U.S. semiconductor industry. Hence, it will probably remain a significant force in the chip industry, especially if it can stage a technical comeback.
2. Verizon
Unlike Intel, Verizon has long maintained a high-yield dividend. However, the bear market has dramatically helped boost its dividend yield. After its recent payout hike, it now pays investors $2.61 per share annually, a cash yield of 6.6%. Additionally, its payout has risen every year since 2007. Hence, it probably risks a mass sell-off should it miss a yearly dividend increase.
Admittedly, that streak still comes with some risks. Rival AT&T abandoned its Dividend Aristocrat status recently amid high debts, while T-Mobile has never offered a payout. With almost $151 billion in total debt and over $10 billion in capital expenditures in the first six months of 2022 alone, Verizon faces a heavy financial burden by any measure.
Still, Verizon can mitigate those risks. The telco has led its peers in overall network quality for 28 years in a row, according to J.D. Power. Moreover, its pivot into 5G has allowed for the creation of a network-as-a-service (NaaS) industry. This service has powered applications ranging from self-driving cars to immersive learning and could foster a potentially lucrative source of income for Verizon. With Verizon's P/E ratio of just eight, investors could see the stock as undervalued amid this offering. Such a perception could boost the stock price and fund continued dividend increases.
3. IBM
Like Verizon, IBM has maintained a healthy dividend yield. At a yearly rate of $6.60 per share, IBM offers a yield of around 5.4%. Additionally, with a 27-year streak of payout hikes, it is one of the newer Dividend Aristocrats.
However, that high yield was largely caused by the struggles of IBM stock. Over the last 10 years, it has lost nearly 40% of its value as the industry moved away from its core competencies.
But a long-awaited, cloud-driven comeback could make IBM a surprisingly strong buy. IBM appointed Arvind Krishna as its CEO in April 2020. Krishna previously served as IBM's head of cloud and cognitive software and played a key role in IBM's mammoth Red Hat acquisition. Since becoming CEO, Krishna has spun off Kyndryl and made numerous cloud-related acquisitions to drive its shift.
Image source: Synergy Research Group
As a result, IBM has become the world's fifth-largest cloud company, according to Synergy Research. Additionally, Grand View Research forecasts the cloud will become a $1.55 trillion industry by 2030. Such growth should bode well for both IBM's stock price and dividend.

2022-09-30 00:00:00+00:00,Telecoms industry eager for Mexican regulator to adopt speedy Wi-Fi 6,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/telecoms-industry-eager-for-mexican-regulator-to-adopt-speedy-wi-fi-6,,,"By Aida Pelaez-Fernandez
MEXICO CITY, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The Mexican telecommunications regulator's delayed approval of Wi-Fi 6, a new wireless technology already operating in Brazil, is depriving Mexican homes and businesses of a ""historic"" increase in internet speeds, sector experts say.
Wi-Fi 6 is part of a new generation of innovations, like 5G technology, offering faster connection speeds and greater bandwidth. It operates on the radio frequency between 5925 and 7125 megahertz (MHz), generally called the 6 gigahertz (GHz) spectrum.
While other regional countries, like Brazil, Chile and Guatemala, have already granted concessions for the 6 GHz spectrum, Mexico's Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) is still in the midst of awarding the licences for the 6 GHz spectrum.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged to expand internet access across Mexico since his campaign for office in 2018, but only about 60% of households in the country are connected, according to the latest data from the IFT.
Internet access is a challenge for most countries in Latin America, where large portions of the population live in rural areas.
Utilizing the 6 GHz segment would make more frequencies available, providing a speed boost to devices connected to Wi-Fi networks.
Regulators, however, are still catching up with advances in technology, said Carlos Rebellon, an executive at U.S. chipmaker Intel INTC.O.
""Wi-Fi 6 is a disruptive change that is interesting for startups or innovators, who are ready to implement it, but regulators are not ready,"" said Rebellon, adding that the technology would bring the biggest leap in speed in Wi-Fi's 20-year history.
Wi-Fi 6 is only available for phones and devices that support this connection. The latest releases from Apple, Samsung and Huawei are already compatible with the technology, in addition to new Asus, Dell and HP laptops.
Pursuing a digital transformation through 5G and Wi-Fi is challenging and demands steps to anchor the technology and make it available throughout the population, said Jose Luis Solleiro of Mexico's Institute of Applied Sciences and Technological Development (ICAT).
""It is necessary to invest in research and innovation, not only in towers,"" Solleiro added.
The IFT can approve the new frequency band for Wi-Fi 6 entirely or use part of it to expand 5G services.
The United States allocated its 6 GHz band spectrum solely for Wi-Fi services, while Chile decided the band will be shared between free internet use Wi-Fi and licensed use, which leaves room for 5G.

2022-09-30 00:00:00+00:00,"Trouble Mounts for Chipmakers, More Pain Ahead",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trouble-mounts-for-chipmakers-more-pain-ahead,,,"Shares of chipmakers that went through the roof amid the pandemic have erased most of their gains. A moderation in consumer demand took a toll on their financials and stock price. For instance, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are down about 58%, 55%, and 48%, year-to-date.
While shares of these chipmakers have declined quite a lot, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland sees more pain ahead and lowered his price target on these stocks. 
Rolland stated that his channel checks indicate that “PC market weakness may be extending beyond consumer and into enterprise as we now forecast ODM [original design manufacturer] builds to decline -20% YOY and PC shipments to decline -17% YOY (287M units and perhaps lower).”
The analyst added, “Retail GPU [graphics processing unit], pricing has fallen below MSRPs [manufacturer’s suggested retail price], high-end GPU retail prices as much as -30% below MSRP, and eBay sales more than -40% below MSRP.”
The slower demand and lower average selling prices will hurt the revenue and margins of these chipmakers. Further, the U.S. government’s strict license requirement for exports to China remains a drag. Amid challenges, let’s see what’s in store for NVDA, AMD, and INTC.
Is Nvidia a Good Stock to Buy?
Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about Nvidia stock as near-term headwinds act as a dampener. It has received 24 Buy and nine Hold recommendations for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Meanwhile, NVDA’s average price target of $206.81 implies 69.2% upside potential.
NVDA stock has a negative signal from hedge fund managers, who sold 415.8K shares last quarter. Meanwhile, NVDA stock has a Neutral Smart Score of six out of 10. 
What is AMD Stock Prediction?
AMD’s fundamentals remain strong. However, weakening consumer GPU trends and macro challenges keep analysts cautiously optimistic about Advanced Micro Devices stock. It commands a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TipRanks based on 19 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell. 
Further, these analysts’ average price target of $118.13 implies 84.2% upside potential.
AMD stock has a positive signal from hedge fund managers, who bought 1.3M shares last quarter. However, insiders sold AMD stock worth $4.1M. Overall, AMD stock has a Neutral Smart Score of seven out of 10 on TipRanks.
Is Intel a Buy, Sell, or Hold?
The new ARC A770 GPU and 13th-generation desktop processor launch will support Intel stock. However, the weakness across the industry poses challenges. INTC stock has a Hold consensus rating on TipRanks based on four Buy, 16 Hold, and eight Sell recommendations. Meanwhile, INTC’s average price target of $38.05 implies 44.2% upside potential.
INTC stock has a negative indicator from hedge fund managers, who sold 1.3M INTC shares last quarter. However, insiders acquired Intel stock worth $501.1K. Overall, INTC has a Neutral Smart Score of six out of 10.

Reuters


HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - No product has played such an outsized role in shaping the global economy and the balance of military power as semiconductors. Yet for years the $556 billion industry attracted scant attention from governments in Washington, Tokyo and other capitals in the developed world. Recently chips have become a battleground in the competition between the United States and China. Big companies and other countries will suffer from the fight.
Few other parts of the economy are so dependent on so few companies, historian Chris Miller asserts in ""Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology"". Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) makes nearly all of the world's most advanced microprocessors. ASML in the Netherlands has a de facto monopoly on the ultraviolet lithography machines required to make the most sophisticated circuits. Two South Korean giants dominate the market for memory chips; three U.S.-based firms control semiconductor software.
These so-called choke points are a feature of a hyper-efficient industry that can churn out over a trillion units a year. According to Miller, a professor of U.S. and Russian foreign policy, it’s no accident that the United States and its allies control most of them. After the Second World War, pioneering companies like Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel and others in Silicon Valley cemented America's technological supremacy.
A subsequent push to outsource U.S. manufacturing abroad coincided with American efforts to deepen trade and investment links with Japan and the rest of Asia. Cheap and plentiful labour allowed companies to lower their costs; Asian leaders touted better-paying jobs and economic growth; and Washington integrated its allies deeper into the U.S. economy. By the late 1970s, companies like Intel and Texas Instruments employed tens of thousands of workers in South Korea, Taiwan and Southeast Asia.
Over time, though, some Asian manufacturers amassed enough expertise and scale across the supply chain to challenge America’s dominance. Japan first overtook the U.S. in memory chip production in the 1980s, only to be toppled by South Korea; Taiwan today boasts not only the world’s top contract chipmaker, but also the top companies that assemble, test and package chips. 
Andy Grove, Intel's former boss, presciently warned that abandoning “commodity” manufacturing could lock manufacturers out of future emerging industries. Now the erstwhile U.S. pioneer is struggling to catch up with the $356 billion TSMC and South Korea's Samsung Electronics in chip fabrication. Meanwhile, natural disasters and the Covid-19 pandemic have exposed a fragile global supply chain which Miller describes as ""a perfect image of globalization gone wrong"".
The combination of weakening chip leadership and a heightened awareness of supply chain vulnerabilities underpins American tech policies. The recent CHIPS and Science Act provides $53 billion to bring semiconductor development and manufacturing back to the United States. The People’s Republic, meanwhile, has long identified America’s chokehold on supply chains as a national security threat and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars to wean itself off foreign technology. U.S. sanctions against telecoms-equipment maker Huawei have accelerated these efforts in a reminder, Miller writes, that choke points are ""not infinitely durable"". In response, Washington has ramped up trade and investment restrictions: earlier this month it banned AMD and Nvidia from exporting some advanced artificial intelligence chips to China.
This intensifying rivalry puts Taiwan, South Korea and Japan in an awkward position. All three depend on China as their largest trading partner. But if the United States is successful in reshoring advanced chipmaking, one or all of its allies' market shares must decrease, Miller argues. Multinational giants with exposure to China will be caught in the middle too. Nvidia estimates some $400 million of sales are at risk. Apple's mooted plans to use Chinese-made chips have attracted scrutiny from Washington.
For South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix, the dilemma is even starker. Both are hoping to expand in the United States, but a provision in the CHIPS Act states that to receive U.S. subsidies, they will be banned from expanding or upgrading chip capacity in China for 10 years. The two companies currently produce 20% and 40%, respectively, of their memory chips in the People's Republic, according to Nikkei.
Miller lays out even more aggressive tools that Washington and Beijing have yet to deploy. The former might pressure TSMC to roll out its newest technologies simultaneously in the United States and Taiwan, or force it to invest more stateside. China might pressure foreign companies to transfer technologies to local peers, or require companies like Apple to buy local components.
The biggest escalation, of course, would be military conflict between China and Taiwan, which Beijing claims sovereignty over. Incapacitating the island’s semiconductor production facilities would be ""catastrophic"" for the global economy, Miller writes, as the world would produce 37% less computing power as a result and it would take at least half a decade to rebuild the capacity.
Though this is still an extreme scenario, investors and tech bosses are betting the high stakes will deter Washington and Beijing from ratcheting up tensions. That looks like wishful thinking.

2022-09-29 00:00:00+00:00,7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Before the Bull Market Returns,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-before-the-bull-market-returns,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
While listing semiconductor stocks to buy typically generates a positive response, this year provides a contrasting case. Though the major indices all printed red ink since the start of 2022, technology-centric market ideas suffered disproportionately. Nevertheless, bold contrarians may enjoy an upside opportunity in the long run.
Firstly, semiconductor stocks to buy trade cyclically. With the Federal Reserve committed to raising the benchmark interest rate, risk-on sentiment faded due to higher borrowing costs. However, it’s unlikely that this circumstance will stay like this forever.
Secondly, the companies undergirding semiconductor stocks to buy align with several relevant sectors, such as data centers, blockchain functionality, or even video games. Unless these market segments become obsolete, having a long-term framework for the semis is probably a reasonable wager.
Finally, on the domestic front, the passage of the CHIPS Act for America should help bolster manufacturing activities. While not everyone benefits directly from the legislation, increased activities should spark positive spillover effects. Therefore, below are the semiconductor stocks to buy for contrarian investors.
ASML ASML Holding NV $422.25
AMD Advanced Micro Devices $64.39
INTC Intel $26.36
GFS GlobalFoundries $49.60
MU Micron Technology $49.83
SWKS Skyworks Solutions $89.61
MRVL Marvell Technology $42.78
ASML Holding NV (ASML)

While the category of semiconductor stocks to buy features plenty of the usual suspects, a growing number of investors identified ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) as a significant long-term opportunity. 
As per CNBC, the Netherlands-based ASML “is the only firm in the world capable of making the highly complex machines needed to manufacture the most advanced chips.”
Unfortunately, geopolitical flashpoints and supply chain disruptions prevent ASML from acquiring essential commodities. Therefore, it received no exemption from the pain associated with buying formerly popular semiconductor stocks. Since the start of the year through the Sept. 28 session, ASML slipped nearly 45%.
At the same time, the long-term implications for the underlying company make it an attractive bet. While it’s difficult to see now, peace will probably return to eastern Europe at some point.
Per Gurufocus.com, ASML features a modestly undervalued financial profile. Its main highlights include a longer-term robust growth trajectory and excellent profitability metrics.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

One of the most popular manufacturers of graphics processing units (or GPUs) for advanced video game systems and cryptocurrency mining, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) long represented one of the semiconductor stocks to buy. 
However, some might argue that AMD features meme-ish qualities and often receives hype on investing forums. Of course, 2022 has been a bit of a culture shock for Advanced Micro Devices. Rather than leading the charge, it represents the technology sector’s laggards. 
For instance, AMD stock fell more than 54% since the start of the year. During the same period, the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 30%. It’s weird to say the index “performs better” than AMD, but it’s mathematically appropriate.
Still, the video gaming sector should come back in the years ahead. Per data cited by the World Economic Forum, global gaming revenue should hit $321 billion by 2026. 
On top of that, cryptos tend to gyrate in the extreme. Once a bullish cycle enters the space, AMD could be a massive beneficiary due to the aforementioned crypto mining relevancies.
Intel (INTC)

Once the undisputed king of semiconductor stocks to buy, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has presented a rough profile in recent years. Controversies and competitive pressures have put the chipmaker on the backfoot several times. 
For example, INTC sank nearly 29% in the trailing five-year period. During the same period, rival AMD gained a whopping 436%. So far this year, the performance for Intel is better but only on a relative basis, down 49%. Still, investors have had a tough time trusting INTC as one of the semiconductor stocks to buy. In late July this year, CNBC reported that Intel’s poor earnings reflected diminishing demand for PCs.
Nevertheless, Intel may generate some positive momentum in the data center market. Based on recent data, Intel commands a 69.5% share of the data center market. In addition, according to Allied Market Research, the global data center market could grow from $187.35 billion in 2020 to $517.17 billion by 2030.
GlobalFoundries (GFS)

A multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company, GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS), benefits from geopolitical dynamics. 
As Investor’s Business Daily bluntly put it:
For the U.S. and a growing number of countries, the fact that many chipmakers operate in Taiwan remains a problem. Growing military tension between the U.S. and China over Taiwan is one reason.
The solution? It might seem obvious, and finally, politicians took notice.
GlobalFoundries makes most of its semiconductors in upstate New York, Dresden, Germany, and Singapore. In addition, the outlook for GlobalFoundries stock has brightened as more customers sign long-term deals to ensure chipmaking capacity is there when they need it. The company has also told analysts that it has more than $20 billion in long-term agreements that can’t be canceled.
However, despite long-term positive implications, GFS stock remains down 21% year-to-date. Still, investors committed to a patient outlook should regard GFS as one of the semiconductor stocks to buy.
Micron Technology (MU)

An American chip manufacturer, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), specializes in computer memory and data storage, including dynamic random-access memory, flash memory, and USB flash drives. Currently, the company represents one of the essential cogs in the political narrative to bring back critical manufacturing to the U.S. 
Earlier this month, Micron broke ground for a manufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho. More significantly, management has stated that the investment was possible via the CHIPS and Science Act. 
Still, the news hasn’t helped MU stock in the open market. Since the January opener, Micron shares are nearly 47% below parity. At the same time, the red ink may represent a bold contrarian opportunity for semiconductor stocks to buy.
According to Gurufocus.com, MU features a significantly undervalued financial profile. Notably, MU commands a forward price-earnings ratio of just under 6x. That’s well below the industry median of 14x.
Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)

A wireless semiconductor company, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), “designs and manufactures radio frequency and complete semiconductor system solutions for mobile communications applications,” per a Bloomberg description.
Per Skyworks’ website, the company seeks to “launch the true potential of 5G.” Specifically, Skyworks brings the registered trademark SKY5 unifying platform to its 5G small cell and multiple-input, multiple-output (or MIMO) technology.
Although compelling on paper, investors ran from SWKS stock throughout this year. Since the start of 2022, SWKS has fallen nearly 42%. In the trailing month, it’s down almost 8%. However, a patient approach could yield significant gains, making Skyworks one of the semiconductor stocks to buy.
Per Gurufocus.com, the tech firm features a significantly undervalued financial profile. The company enjoys a solid balance sheet and vigorous growth and profitability metrics. Specifically, Skyworks features a net margin of 24.1%, much higher than the underlying industry’s median of 10.2%.
Marvell Technology (MRVL)

Based in Santa Clara, California, Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) presents a well-balanced profile among semiconductor stocks to buy. Primarily, the company specializes in advanced connectivity protocols, offering computational, security, and networking platform solutions. 
On a related note, Marvell also features a vast data center portfolio, enabling its enterprise-level clients to scale up quickly and securely.
In addition, the tech firm’s automotive innovations, particularly in safety mechanisms and autonomous driving solutions, give Marvell significant upside potential. Currently, though, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way. MRVL is down over 50% YTD. In the trailing month, the stock declined by 9%.
However, for the contrarian investor, Marvell presents an attractive profile. Per Gurufocus.com, MRVL is significantly undervalued based on its proprietary valuation metrics. Notably, in the quarter that ended July 2022, Marvell posted revenue of $1.52 billion, up 41% year-over-year. Moreover, net income came in at $4 million, much more favorable than the net loss of $276 million in the same quarter last year.

2022-09-29 00:00:00+00:00,November 11th Options Now Available For Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/november-11th-options-now-available-for-intel,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options begin trading today, for the November 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new November 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $24.00 strike price has a current bid of 90 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $24.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $23.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $26.34/share today.
Because the $24.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.75% return on the cash commitment, or 31.80% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $24.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $27.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.34. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $26.34/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $27.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.59% if the stock gets called away at the November 11th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $27.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $27.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.09% boost of extra return to the investor, or 43.14% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the call contract example above is 48%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $26.34) to be 36%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-09-29 00:00:00+00:00,Could Intel Stock Help You Retire a Millionaire?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/could-intel-stock-help-you-retire-a-millionaire-0,,,"Once a darling among microprocessor manufacturers, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has lost considerable market share in recent years to the likes of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Alas, the idea of retiring with seven figures from a buy-and-hold position in Intel shares has become little more than a pleasant pipe dream.
Or has it? Intel stock lost over half of its value in 2022, making it look deeply oversold compared to its rivals. But then, buying a stock just because it seems cheap is an easy way to lose millions, not make them.
A comfortable retirement, unfortunately, isn't as simple as loading up on one stock and turning off the screen for a few decades. That said, it's worth investigating whether a long-term position in Intel stock can turn apparently dead money into a multibagger.
Traders have priced in a plethora of problems
Just a year ago, getting Intel down to a $110 billion market cap was unthinkable. Yet, here we are, and Intel's trailing-12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 5.76 ought to get any dyed-in-the-wool contrarian's senses tingling.
After all, Intel's $110 billion market cap looks unreasonably low for a company that expects to rake in revenue of $65 billion to $68 billion in just one year -- and an unusually challenging chip-market year, at that. Meanwhile, Intel's Mobileye segment reported record revenue during the second quarter. On top of all that, Intel continues to pay a 5%+ annual dividend yield, and dividend reinvestment is among the smartest ways to achieve millionaire status in retirement.
So, why have financial traders been so pessimistic lately? Surely, they're not particularly fond of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes or Intel's loss of domestic-chip-leader status. They probably also didn't much care for Intel's 22% year-over-year second-quarter 2022 revenue decline or the company's stated expectation that the total addressable market for PCs would decline 10% this year.
Getting back on the front foot
Just maybe, though, intrepid investors can see the glass as half full. Could Intel's downbeat PC market forecast and the company's revenue miss provide a setup for a current-quarter Street beat?
Maybe yes, maybe no -- but then, this is about the long trade and building toward retirement, not flipping shares for a quick buck. The future might still belong to Intel, then, if the company can regain its footing as a top-tier tech titan.
Easier said than done, right? Yet, Intel might actually be up to the task as CEO Pat Gelsinger and company came out swinging at the company's recent Intel Innovation event. Then and there, Intel unveiled a spate of fresh products, some of which could literally and figuratively be game changers.
In what may be construed as a single-handed attempt to revive the PC chip market, Intel revealed its 13th Gen Intel Core i9-13900K, billed as the ""world's fastest desktop processor."" With this, gamers, streamers, and others can enjoy ""blazing clock speeds"" of up to 5.8 gigahertz. Without a doubt, this is a direct salvo against Advanced Micro Devices' Ryzen 9 7950X chip, which tops out at 5.7 megahertz.
Intel also took aim at Nvidia with its new Arc A770 GPU, which will launch on Oct. 12 with a wallet-friendly list price of $329. For comparison, Nvidia's RTX 4090 card retails for an eye-watering $1,599. It appears, then, that Intel will attempt to compete with Nvidia on price rather than sheer speed and power; Gelsinger made this refocus crystal-clear when he said about graphics chips generally, ""They've just gotten super expensive, and we don't think they need to be. We're about to fix that.""
Learning to love Intel again
So, will Intel stock be a millionaire-maker for future retirees? There are no guarantees, but low expectations for the PC market -- and for the company itself -- could propel Intel back into investors' good graces.
At the very least, there's a deeply discounted, established giant with high-demand products, ambitious leadership, and budget-conscious customer appeal to be considered here. Besides, you can collect those generous dividend distributions along the way while waiting for the market to remember why it loved Intel in the first place: It's all about the dazzling tech products, forever driven by relentless innovation.

Looking ahead, investors have S&P 500 stocks to buy as share prices fall.
In the summer of 2022, the absence of negative news propelled the S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) to erase some earlier losses.
On Sept. 13 the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics posted a consumer price index of 8.3%. The energy index fell by 5% over the month. However, core inflation increased. Last week, the Fed announced it would raise rates by 75 basis points. It is steadfast in triggering a recession and job loss. The economy may withstand increased unemployment.
Investors sold off the S&P 500. Still, amid the bear market is a bull market for stock pickers. Within the index, there are still S&P 500 stocks to buy. They are entering a hidden bull market.
After working through short-term challenges, they have strong prospects ahead. Markets are discounting them now for fear those companies will not deliver on their turnaround plan.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fell into a downtrend ahead of its desktop processor refresh announcement. After it announced the fastest core in gaming with the Ryzen 7000 series, AMD stock fell further.
Alongside its Zen 4 generation refresh is the update in its server portfolio. AMD’s Genoa has 96 cores in power for the data center. Cloud computing applications will benefit from this power. Bergamo has even more computing power. It has up to 128 cores and supports high-demand workloads in the cloud computing space.
The total addressable market for 128-core server systems is growing. Unlike desktop computers, where consumers want 4 GHz or 5 GHz in power, servers are power constrained. AMD has highly efficient solutions that the market needs. Corporate customers may scale their hardware as cloud workload rises.
AMD profits more by selling Genoa, which has bigger caches. This design gives systems more bursting capacity for each core. The economy is slowing but the demand for higher computing power is not making AMD one of the best chip S&P 500 stocks to buy.
Broadcom (AVGO)

Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology firm that designs semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, posted strong third-quarter results.
It earned $4.424 billion and paid a stock dividend of $4.10 a share. It expects to pay out $16.40 a share in dividends for the fiscal year making it one of the hot S&P 500 stocks to buy.
Broadcom issued a strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA forecast for the fourth quarter. It is thriving amid strong demand across all end markets. Customers are upgrading their data centers and broadband. They are getting ready for higher network usage from the iPhone and Google Pixel smartphone refresh.
Broadcom’s positive prospects contradict the macro headwinds other sectors face. Customers are committed to technology projects.
In addition, Broadcom has 50 weeks in lead time in its backlog. Furthermore, Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said that its products faced no disruptions from China’s Covid restrictions. CEO Tan predicts that semiconductor demand will continue in the 5% range for the long term.
Alphabet (GOOGL)

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has several growth catalysts. YouTube will add advertising to Shorts videos and share revenue with content creators.
It needs to reward its creator entrepreneurs or risk losing them to ByteDance’s TikTok. Before it took this initiative, creators had only the horizontal video format. They depended on ads as the main source of revenue.
Within Shorts, which is as short as 15 seconds, YouTube content creators have a chance to make more money. This would increase the site’s ad revenue.
Google has high near-term costs to address. It added too many workers before the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates. Shortly thereafter, the economy slowed. The search engine giant is bracing for customers to slash advertising spending.
Further cost cuts will improve Alphabet’s profit margins. On September 14, 202, the company cut half of its internal research and development spending in “Area 120.” The cuts are necessary. The company needs to focus on growing markets first. This includes artificial intelligence projects.
Intel (INTC)

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is struggling to grow its personal computer chip market. Investors may bet that INTC stock’s low ~6 times price-to-earnings priced-in its hard times ahead. In addition, the company declared its quarterly dividend recently. Income investors get a dividend that yields moret han 5% just for waiting.
In the CPU market, Intel’s 13th-generation Raptor Lake will offer consumers more power.
Intel spent two years hyping its graphics card, called Intel Arc Alchemist. It enters the GPU product at a turbulent transition. Ethereum decommissioned crypto mining. By adopting proof-of-stake, miners with expensive GPUs cannot profit.
If it ever releases a GPU in mass volumes, Intel becomes the third supplier after AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Intel only needs to grow its market share in the mainstream segment. It does not need to offer high-end performance products that Nvidia and AMD sell. It simply cannot afford more delays trying to capture that level of the market.
Once Intel gains the consumer’s trust in the graphics card market, its revenue will expand again.
Meta Platforms (META)

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is taking a huge bet on the metaverse. It is spending billions annually over the next decade to invest in the augmented and virtual world.
On Oct.11 it might give its audience hints on its AR/VR headset offering. The headset is code-named Project Cambria.
The product is the successor to Meta Quest 2. The media speculates this headset is a high-end machine. It will have a higher price tag, which should lower Meta’s loss per unit sold. In addition, it will have advanced sensors. Meta hopes to convince potential buyers that the exclusive mixed-reality offering justifies the higher price.
Meta Quest 3 is still under development. At a higher price, the company likely needs more time to develop the hardware. Investors may assume it releases this high-end product with no bugs or fanfare. As a result, it pivots Meta Platforms away from Facebook and into the metaverse.
NVIDIA (NVDA)

Nvidia announced the RTX 40 Series, which introduced Ada Lovelace architecture.
The company promises to deliver AI-powered graphics. Gamers will experience lifelike virtual worlds. They will enjoy higher frames per second (FPS) gaming. In addition, ray tracing increases the graphics quality in games.
Nvidia priced the RTX 4090 for $1,599. It will be available on October 12, 2022. The RTX 4080 16GB and 12GB will cost $1,199 and $899, respectively.
Nvidia’s centralized omniverse platform scales easily. Currently, omniverse is running on Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services EC2 G5 instances. As it adds more customers to it, the company will give early access to them if they apply.
Investors are not buying Nvidia stock despite the product announcements and cloud development news. They are worried that gamers are sensitive to the four-figure price tag.
Furthermore, GPU demand during the pandemic benefited from cryptocurrency mining. Although those miners are selling GPUs on auction sites, it should not hurt Nvidia’s sales. Gamers are unlikely to buy those used cards.
Raytheon Technologies (RTX)

Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) is a military defense contractor. While the rest of the economy struggles, the War Economy is thriving.
The company won a ~ $770 million modification contract. Raytheon’s work in the award is with the propulsion system spare parts and the related handling of the F-135 propulsion system.
On Sept. 22 the company won a $985 million contract. It will supply the U.S. Department of Defense with Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missiles. On Sept. 21 Raytheon won a $160.2 million contract for a Dual Band Radar. The contract includes options that increase the total value to $440.64 million.
The contracts mentioned add up. While companies outside of the military defense sector struggle to grow contract deals, Raytheon is adding new ones regularly.
RTX stock is trading below its $90 – $95 trading range. The stock pays a dividend of $2.20 per share. Investors get paid to wait while the firm wins more contracts from the U.S. government.

2022-09-29 00:00:00+00:00,Dow Jones Bear Market: 2 Dividend Stocks That Haven't Been This Cheap in Years,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dow-jones-bear-market%3A-2-dividend-stocks-that-havent-been-this-cheap-in-years,,,"The Dow Jones industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) officially entered a bear market earlier this week, as it closed more than 20% below the record levels it hit early in January 2022. Other major benchmarks had seen even larger losses, but it took the most recent downturn in the stock market to pull the venerable Dow along with them.
As you'd expect from a downturn, some of the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones Industrials have taken harder hits than others. Indeed, there are still a handful of stocks that are up on the year. However, there are many more Dow stocks that are down 30% or more -- and two, in particular, are trading at multiyear lows, despite having extremely attractive dividend yields. Below, we'll look at that pair of companies to see whether they're poised to rebound or likely to keep struggling.
1. 3M
Industrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE: MMM) has seen its stock fall 37% so far in 2022. That has boosted its dividend yield by 2 full percentage points since the beginning of the year, with its current yield weighing in at 5.3%.
3M has had to deal with the same macroeconomic headwinds that other Dow stocks have faced, with sales falling 3% in its most recent quarter, compared to year-earlier levels, and adjusted earnings declining nearly 10%. Yet the risk that stands out more than any other stems from potential legal liability on multiple fronts.
Users of military-grade earplugs have argued that products from a company that 3M acquired failed to prevent hearing problems, affecting hundreds of thousands of people. Meanwhile, controversy over the effectiveness of 3M's respirators could also result in costly litigation.
Those issues are affecting 3M's efforts to make strategic business shifts. The conglomerate wants to spin off its healthcare business, leaving its legacy business to keep serving consumers, the electronics and transportation industries, and the safety needs of manufacturing clients worldwide. Yet plaintiffs want to ensure they can make claims against all of 3M's current assets.
The last time 3M shares were this low was in 2013. While revenue has grown incrementally in the ensuing nine years, 3M's net income is actually lower. That doesn't bode well for the conglomerate's future efforts, although it does justify why it's working so hard to unlock value from its highest-performing business segments.
2. Intel
Semiconductor-pioneer Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has dealt with tough times for a while. It's the poorest performer in the entire Dow so far in 2022, losing nearly half of its value. That has doubled the tech-stock's dividend yield to more than 5.4%.
Intel's recent financial performance explains why its stock has done so poorly. Revenue fell 17% year over year in the second quarter of 2022, sending earnings per share down nearly 80%. Weakness in PC demand and reduced client spending on data centers offset higher sales of network and edge-computing products.
More broadly, Intel has lost its first-mover edge in semiconductors, with Nvidia having usurped its place as industry leader. Even Advanced Micro Devices has found viable niche advantages.
Yet Intel's also fighting back, tapping capital from Brookfield Infrastructure to help it build new fabrication facilities. If that's successful, then Intel might finally start to win back market share and get back on the cutting edge of chip technology.
Intel shares haven't been this low since 2014, but both revenue and earnings have made sizable gains since then, including a near-doubling on the bottom line. That suggests that between these two stocks, Intel has the better chance of eventually rebounding once the Dow's bear market gives way to more favorable business conditions.

2022-09-28 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel (INTC) Launches 13th-Gen Chip, Expands Developer Cloud",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-launches-13th-gen-chip-expands-developer-cloud,,,"Intel Corporation INTC recently unveiled the 13th-Generation Intel Core Processor in a concerted effort to arrest the dwindling PC sales and raise the standards of PC performance. Codenamed Raptor Lake, the new chip is widely expected to bring the company to the forefront of the processor market amid intense competitive pressure and strengthen its leading market position.

The top-of-the-line version of the chip, the Core i9-13900K, is reportedly the fastest desktop processor (with a top speed of 5.8Ghz) with 24 processing cores that are broken down into eight performance cores and 16 efficiency cores. Leveraging Intel 7 process and x86 performance hybrid architecture, the chip enables up to 15% better single-threaded performance and up to 41% better multi-threaded performance per company standards.

While the performance cores for the new chip handle heavy-duty tasks like gaming, coding, photo and video editing, the efficiency cores handle less intensive basic tasks like web browsing and emailing. Although the company is yet to divulge the pricing details, experts believe that the flagship chip could be priced at around $700.

Intel further intends to expand the horizon of the Intel Developer Cloud to enable developers try out the new range of chips before they hit the market. This will facilitate the early testing of several applications in the cloud, offering a healthy software developer ecosystem for highly competitive semiconductor hardware manufacturers. This can help accelerate the time to market for solutions built on Intel platforms.

Intel is betting big on the IoT business and is investing heavily to gain a higher market presence. While the focus was earlier on making the best computing chips and generating industry-leading margins from them, the company now prefers to focus on a product range targeting different market segments. Management believes that the higher-end business in more developed economies continues to look up, but the new strategy should help it get into many more device categories, where Intel products will continue to enjoy a premium based on performance and cost of ownership.

However, the imposition of tariffs owing to the trade war between the United States and China, and the coronavirus outbreak is anticipated to negatively impact growth prospects. The uncertainty over the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis has affected investors’ confidence and is likely to remain an overhang on the company’s performance. Impending global recession is anticipated to weigh on IOTG end markets, especially retail and industrial. Moreover, lower automotive production due to lockdowns is a concern for Mobileye. Additionally, sluggish data center demand across enterprise and government end-markets remains a woe.

The stock has lost 49.7% over the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 37.7%. Intel carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
