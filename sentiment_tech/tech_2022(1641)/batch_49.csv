NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The party is over for technology start-ups rushing to go public at ever-higher valuations, as volatile U.S. stock markets have dampened investor appetite for high-growth stocks.
A 6% drop in the S&P 500 index and a 75% rise in Wall Street's fear gauge, as the Cboe Volatility Index .VIX is known, since the beginning of the year have led many companies to push the pause button on listing plans.
Software startups WeTransfer and Justworks and bitcoin miner Rhodium Enterprise are among the half-dozen companies that canceled initial public offerings (IPOs) in January, citing adverse market conditions. Other postponed listings include apparel chain operator Authentic Brands Group, insurance technology start-up TypTap, and real estate investment trust Four Springs Capital Trust.
""You're going to continue to see probably fewer deals launched than you otherwise would have if the market hadn't gotten a lot choppier here,"" said Eddie Molloy, co-head of equity capital markets for the Americas at Morgan Stanley.
Most shares of 396 companies that went public in 2021, excluding special purpose acquisition companies, were already trading well below their flotation price as investors worried about frothy valuations -- down 28% on average, according to Dealogic.
January's sell-off of technology stocks, driven by the prospect that higher interest rates will make investors more risk-averse, further spooked investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended January nearly 9% lower than it started the month.
IPOs raised a total of about $6.9 billion in January, down 83% from the same period last year, according to Dealogic
Companies with plenty of growth but little or no profit to show were snubbed first by IPO investors.
""The recent and anticipated moves in interest rates is forcing investors to re-value cash flows, growth and risk, translating to a rotation away from the highest growth, riskiest assets across sectors,"" said Andrew Wetenhall, co-head of equity capital markets in the Americas at Morgan Stanley.
This raises questions about the timing of major technology offerings expected this year, including Intel Corp's INTC.O autonomous vehicle unit Mobileye, social media platform Reddit and delivery startup Gopuff.
Should market volatility continue, it could benefit direct listings at the expense of traditional IPOs, investment bankers say. In a direct listing a company goes public without selling shares though underwriters, and its stock market debut is less vulnerable to market jitters.
HEALTHY PIPELINE
To be sure, IPO bankers and lawyers have said the pipeline for companies looking to go public in 2022 remains healthy. Several technology unicorns are still planning to go public in the second half of the year.
""Markets loathe uncertainty, so any alleviation of it should improve the market backdrop, especially for IPOs,"" said Michael Ventura, managing director at RBC Capital Markets.
Tech stocks and the broader market rebounded this week, recovering close to half of their losses in January and giving dealmakers hope the IPO environment will become favorable again soon.
Jimmy Baker, president of B. Riley Securities, said the IPO market recovery may start with companies that generate strong cash flows going public, as investors with little risk tolerance for loss-making unicorns are attracted to offerings that promise to deliver yield.
""There's not a lot of receptivity to IPOs. (However), we expect in the near future, there will be receptivity to yield-oriented opportunities,"" said Baker.

2022-02-03 00:00:00+00:00,"With Intel’s Higher Dividend, Expect INTC Stock to Rise at Least 35% to $67",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/with-intels-higher-dividend-expect-intc-stock-to-rise-at-least-35-to-%2467,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) stock just reported excellent fourth-quarter 2021 earnings on Jan. 27 and its 2021 full-year earnings. In addition, the company also reported a huge amount of free cash flow (FCF) — $11.3 billion — for the full year. As a result, INTC stock is likely to rebound significantly from where it is presently trading.
Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.com
For example, in the last month Intel stock has dropped out of bed. It peaked on Jan. 11, 2022, at $55.91. But then suddenly through the month of January, it dropped down to a low of $47.73 as of Jan. 28.
But now INTC stock is starting to rebound — at $49.51 as of Feb. 3, 2022. One reason is that investors will adjust the stock to its historical average valuation metrics.
Intel Stock’s Value Using Its Historical Dividend Yield
For example, Intel increased its annual dividend by 5% to $1.46 per share. I had predicted that it could do this in my previous article on Dec. 17.
For example, this Intel dividend of $1.46, divided by its price today of $49.51, gives INTC stock a dividend yield of 2.95%. But this is well above its average dividend yield. That implies that it is too cheap. For example, if the price rises, that will lower its dividend yield.
7 REITs With Major Upside Potential in 2022
And that is the point. The average dividend yield Intel has had in the last four years has been 2.42%, according to Seeking Alpha. This is lower than its present 2.95% yield, so it implies that for INTC stock to reach this average yield it will have to rise. But by how much?
Here is how we can determine that. If we divide the new $1.46 dividend per share (DPS) by its average yield of 2.42%, the resulting figure is $60.33 (i.e., $1.46/0.242=$60.33).
So this implies that INTC could rise at least by 21.85% (i.e., $60.33 target/$49.51-1=0.2185) from today. And remember, the 2.42% dividend yield is just an average metric.
For example, if the stock reaches a 2.0% dividend yield, this implies that it could rise to $73.00. This is seen by dividing the $1.46 DPS by 2.0%. The $73 price target is 47.4% over today’s price.
What Analysts Think INTC Stock Is Worth
So, we can expect that there is a good chance that Intel will rise to between $60.33 and $73 over the next year, based on the new dividend hike. That puts its average price target at $66.67 per share or 35% over today’s price.
S0me analysts tend to agree with me. For example, Yahoo! Finance indicates that the average price target of 42 analysts is $55.94 per share or 12% over the price of $49.51.
Moreover, Seeking Alpha reports that the average of 42 analysts is $55.94, although it also shows that the upper end of the range is up to $70 per share.
Even Morningstar has an implied higher price target. For example, the Morningstar dividend tab for Intel shows that the average 5-year dividend yield has been 2.48%.
So, if we divide the $1.46 DPS by 2.48%, the price will have to rise to $58.87 (i.e.,$1.46/0.0248=$58.87). That is 18.9% higher than today’s price. It means that Morningstar’s historical dividend yield metric leads to a 19% higher price target.
Can Intel Afford the Dividend?
Keep in mind that this is no guarantee that Intel will rise to $60, as my analysis implies. For example, it could keep on falling from its present price.
But in the end, we know that the dividends help keep a stock price tethered to its underlying value. For example, the 2.42% average yield over 4 years and the 2% yield I think it could rise to are based on historical price patterns.
What is important is whether Intel can keep paying these dividends. That is where its powerful free cash flow (FCF) comes in. For example, in the last 12 months, Intel paid out $5.644 billion in dividends, according to its cash flow statement for 2021.
But it’s clear that Intel can afford this since its cash flow operations (CFFO) was $29.991 billion and capex spending was $18.733 billion. Therefore, subtracting its capex spending from CFFO produces FCF of $11.258 billion.
That $11.3 billion in FCF is well more than enough to pay out the $5.6 billion in dividends every year. Even with a 5% increase the dividend cost will be no more than $5.93 billion — still well below the FCF. In other words, Intel has almost twice as much FCF to pay for its dividends.
What To Do
It seems pretty clear that Intel can not only afford its dividend payments but also the INTC stock will rise to a higher price. This is because the stock price will tend to fall to a lower dividend yield, as per its average yield of 2.42%.
Bottom line — expect to see INTC stock rise to around $66.67 or 35% over today’s price — based on its average dividend yield.

2022-02-02 00:00:00+00:00,Top Dividend Stocks To Watch This Week,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-dividend-stocks-to-watch-this-week,,,"Are These The Best Dividend Stocks To Buy In February 2022?
With the recent volatility in the stock market, dividend stocks are worth serious consideration. With the upcoming interest rate hikes and soaring inflation to bond yields holding above 2-year highs, investors may be reassessing their risk appetite. Thus, investing in top dividend stocks could be something on their minds. After all, investors can expect periodic cash flows and a possibility of decent gains over time with this group of stocks.
Broadly speaking, dividend stocks offer a more consistent means of generating gains in the form of, well, dividends. You could say that these are among the more defensive stocks that serve as an anchor for a portfolio. The likes of which would appeal to investors looking to take a more cautious approach to deploy their capital right now. As such, it would not surprise me to see high dividend stocks being among the most active stocks around now. 
Now, when it comes to picking dividend stocks, investors would ideally want to look at firms whose businesses are rock solid. That’s because these companies are often the ones that can afford to pay and increase their dividends consistently. Admittedly, you’re not likely to see explosive growths. But steady gains over the longer term is nothing to scoff at. And that’s something we need during a highly volatile environment we are seeing in the stock market today. With all that in mind, let’s take a look at some of the top dividend stocks right now.
Top Dividend Stocks To Consider Investing In Right Now
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)
Coca-Cola Inc. (NYSE: KO)
Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG)
Intel
Intel is an industry-leading semiconductor company that continues to create life-changing technologies. In essence, it advances the design and manufacturing of semiconductors to help address its customers’ greatest challenges. Furthermore, the company embeds intelligence in the cloud, network, and edge to unleash the potential of data to transform businesses and society for the better. INTC stock currently has a dividend yield of 2.9%.
Last week, the company posted better-than-expected figures in its latest earnings report. Diving in, the semiconductor maker raked in a total revenue of $19.5 billion for the quarter. This exceeded consensus forecasts of $18.31 billion. Moreover, Intel recorded an earnings per share (EPS) of $1.09, beating expectations of $0.91. Earlier this year, Intel also announced plans for an initial investment of over $20 billion in the construction of two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio. This will help boost production to meet the surging demand for semiconductors and power a new generation of products. Given these developments, would INTC stock make your list of top dividend stocks to buy?

Apple
When it comes to top dividend stocks to buy, Apple would not be the first name to come to mind for many investors. From innovative apps to premium products and transformative experiences, the company’s world-class portfolio of services proved essential in 2021. This comes as more people all over the world are seeking new ways to stay connected, informed, and entertained. With over 745 million paid subscriptions, Apple continues to connect the world’s developers, artists, and storytellers with more than 1 billion devices. The tech giant currently has an annual dividend yield of 0.5%.
Similar to Intel, the company posted its quarterly earnings last week. For the quarter, Apple’s revenue came in 11% higher year-over-year to a whopping $123.9 billion. Notably, this is the largest quarterly revenue for the iPhone maker on this front. To put things into perspective, this is well above analyst forecasts of $118.66 billion. Separately, the company is reportedly planning to turn its iPhones into payment terminals, challenging Block’s (NYSE: SQ) Square. Should this plan materialize, it could potentially shake up the payment terminals market. All things considered, is AAPL stock a top dividend stock to watch?

It also includes hydration, sports, coffee and tea brands. It employs more than 700,000 people across the globe and continues to positively impact the lives of its consumers. Currently, Coca-Cola currently has an annual dividend yield of 2.8%. For those unfamiliar, Coca-Cola has raised its dividend payout to shareholders for 59 consecutive years. And you could count on the company to continue doing so considering its healthy growth rate. 
In late October, the company reported its third-quarter financials which topped analysts’ estimates. It sees continued momentum and strong results with revenues growing by 16% year-over-year to $10 billion. Impressively, this is already ahead of its pre-pandemic levels. Coca-Cola also reported an EPS of $0.57 for the quarter, growing by 41% compared to a year earlier. In January, the company also announced a partnership with Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ) to launch FRESCA™ Mixed. This is a new line of spirit-based, ready-to-drink cocktails, offering a distinctive flavor for consumers.

2022-02-02 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Stock Jumped More Than 5% Today -- Is It a Buy?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-stock-jumped-more-than-5-today-is-it-a-buy,,,"What happened
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) were up 5.6% today as of 2:45 p.m. ET. Investors can thank the company for yet another quarter of incredible performance. AMD posted 49% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 2021 and 68% growth for the full-year period. With management expecting $21.5 billion in sales in 2022, AMD is now one of the largest chip designers out there.
So what
A decade ago, AMD's future looked tenuous at best. Fraught with financial trouble during the Great Recession of 2008-2009, it had parted ways with its chip manufacturing division (the company we now know as Globalfoundries) so it could double down on semiconductor development -- a monumental task given Intel's dominance in this department.
Image source: Getty Images.
But the AMD of today is no underdog. It's now eating Intel's lunch as it makes headway in personal computing and data centers (the computing units that enable the cloud). Shares are now up an incredible 1,670% over the last 10-year stretch, and given it expects sales to grow another 31% and for profit margins to expand in 2022, this incredible run looks far from over.
AMD stock trades for 44 times trailing-12-month earnings per share and 46 times trailing-12-month free cash flow as of this writing.
Now what
AMD trades for a premium price tag, and given that the semiconductor industry is a historically cyclical one (periods of booming sales are often followed by a sales drought, rinse, and repeat), many investors shy away from stocks like AMD. That's fair. Even though we're in the midst of a chip shortage, eventually supply and demand will balance out. When that happens (maybe 2023, maybe later, no one really knows), moderating sales growth could cause AMD some serious turbulence.
However, the best chip stocks to own for the long haul are those that can post both higher highs as well as higher lows as the industry overall goes through its ups and downs. The new AMD focused on chip research and development is beginning to exhibit that quality you want to look for in a long-term semiconductor investment after its business model overhaul.
Data by YCharts.
Plus, AMD is getting ready to disrupt Intel on a brand new front with its acquisition of Xilinx, which just got approval from regulators and should be complete by the end of March 2022. By the way, AMD's growth outlook for the new year doesn't include Xilinx, a business also growing by a double-digit percentage. Adding Xilinx into the mix will launch AMD's foray into new markets like industrial equipment, networking infrastructure, and automotive technology.
If you are looking for a solid bet on the continued advance of computing technology for the next decade, AMD still looks like a great buy today.

2022-02-02 00:00:00+00:00,Micron Is a Great Bargain at Current Prices,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-is-a-great-bargain-at-current-prices,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Like most of the tech industry, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) had a positive stock performance in 2021. MU stock mirrored the performance of the S&P 500 Index as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust  (NYSEARCA:SPY), gaining 26.1% in 2021 to $93.15 per share, whereas the index advanced slightly more, up 27% over the year.
Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com
The first month of 2022 was less exciting for the semiconductor’s stock price though. The company has dropped by 11.7% to $82.27 per share, significantly underperforming the broader market that has managed to limit its decline to 7.4%, year-to-date.
And therein lies the opportunity.
MU Stock Offers Attractive Growth, High Net Margins
In the past four quarters, Micron has beaten earnings per share and revenue analyst estimates. The company benefitted from long-term investments in its memory and storage output options and a tight chip market, enabling it to raise prices.
Despite beating the consensus of analysts in the first quarter of 2022, MU’s net sales decreased 7% quarter-over-quarter to $7.68 billion but surged 33.1% year-over-year. Besides, in the second quarter of 2022, revenues are forecasted to continue to decline, down 2.2% QoQ to $7.52 billion.
7 Best Robinhood Stocks to Buy on the Dip
As expected, the deceleration of MU’s quarterly top line will hurt net income and margins. Indeed, while net profit decreased 15.2% in Q1 2022 to $2.3 billion, it is forecasted to reach $2.08 billion in Q2 2022, corresponding to net margins of respectively 30% and 27.8% per year.
It’s also worth noting the company boasts low debt levels.
Disruptions Continue, But Valuation Remains Cheap
On Dec. 29, 2021, MU announced that one of its main dynamic random access memory (DRAM) manufacturing facilities would incur operating delays, following the coronavirus outbreak in the city of Xi’an, China.
The lockdown, which has led to a reduction in the workforce at its manufacturing site and lasted for nearly a month (Dec. 23 – Jan. 21), will most probably weigh on MU’s short-term profitability and hence on its Q2 2022 financials.   
However, with the 15% price correction, Micron’s trades at 2022 P/E of 9.58x and EV/EBITDA of 4.71x. These valuation metrics remain cheap for a company with a net margin of nearly 30% per year.
In 2021, Micron reinstated its dividend, declaring a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, representing a yield of 0.52% per year, which is not enormous but indicates the management’s strong confidence in future operating activities. 
In the meantime, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) provides a yield of 3% per year, but it is currently exchanging at 2022 P/E of 16.8x and EV/EBITDA of 7.16x and offers a net margin that’s roughly half of Micron’s, expected at only 16.3% in 2022.
On the other hand, the valuation metrics of Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), the leading player in the semiconductor space, are the most stretched, with a 2022 P/E of 27.9x and an EV/EBITDA of 15.1x.
Micron’s Buybacks and Growth Markets Make it a Buy
The storage chipmaker is poised for secular growth. The development and adoption of long-term trends such as 5G, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and electric vehicle are powerful catalysts, that will drive higher demand for memory and storage chips.
Apart from the broad range of applications of Micron’s chips, the global markets of the company’s two main products, the DRAM and NAND flash memory, are forecasted to grow healthily until 2026, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate of respectively 8.5% and 22%.
In addition, the company’s share buyback program continues to provide support for MU stock, even if Micron announced the repurchase of nearly 3.6 million shares for $259 million in the 1Q 2022. That’s nearly four times less than the $1.05 billion or 13.9 million shares repurchased in the 4Q 2021. 
Nevertheless, the continued buybacks are a constructive signal for investors who seek to enter a leader in storage and chip technology.
With that being said, MU stock looks like a bargain at its current valuation. Nevertheless, the share might continue to witness selling pressure in the short term, due to surging equity market volatility. But Micron is a well-managed company with a low level of debt that is currently a bargain in terms of valuation multiples. Therefore, I have a long outlook on Micron and I believe that in the long run, the company will outperform most of the semiconductor industry.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock is the Rodney Dangerfield of chip stocks. It gets no respect in spite of it bring the behemoth in the field.
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
Intel is larger than its two main competitors Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) put together and about twice over.
However, the INTC stock value has accumulated to extremes. That’s not a compliment since it means it is now dirt cheap in absolute and relative terms.
Moreover, the stock markets just corrected as harshly as they have in a long time. The small-caps led the freak out, but the Nasdaq finally almost caught up to it. From high to low, the QQQ lost almost 19% of its value. Intel stock, on the other hand, started its slide in January of 2020. Well, that’s an unfair statement because it did recover the whole thing last year. Then it restarted a replica correction in April last year. From high to low, it lost more than 30% of its value.
At least this last bit was not through any fault of its own. Nvidia and AMD stocks lost even more through Jan. 24 and 28, respectively.
7 Best Robinhood Stocks to Buy on the Dip
What’s working for Intel fans is a simple truth about support levels. Since October 2017, every time it fell below $48 per share it found buyers. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this correction presented opportunities to engage on the bullish side.
INTC Stock Value Is Reason Enough for Now
Source: Charts by TradingView
Nvidia and AMD have hogged the headlines because consensus is that they are out-innovating Intel. That may have truth behind it but that doesn’t mean that INTC stock is garbage.
In fact, under $48 per share, the downside risk is finite. As for the intangible opinions, they are fickle. I bet this year INTC could come back in style. They have the money, the customer base and the know-how to recapture investor attention. Meanwhile, AMD is up 12% on its earnings report. NVDA is up 5% in sympathy, while INTC is down a little at the open.
Demand for technology is rising at an exponential rate. This is not a fad and the trend will last for years. Therefore, all three of them have room to grow without restrictions.
For the next few weeks, I still worry about the overall market conditions. Wall Street has lost its sharp bullish edge, and I attribute that to the stupor of 2020. There is a chance the indices pull through this, but we need to see more confidence on headlines.
The rally back out of the pandemic crash was silly, and the correction was necessary to correct that. True to form, investors swung the pendulum too far in one direction. Now they are swinging it too far in the other. While we have already seen almost a 20% correction in the Nasdaq, that doesn’t mean it cannot extend another 10%. This is a scenario triggers if we lose the lows from late January.
Headline Risks Still Loom
This week we will find out more about the job situation in the U.S. If the report comes out too hot, it may rattle investors a bit. The worry is that the Federal Reserve will be too aggressive raising rates. In reality this is an unrealistic fear, because they are not likely to break the economy that they just fixed. Nevertheless, engaging all in INTC stock is a mistake.
The proper course when uncertainty is this high is to take positions in tranches. Investors should not have absolute conviction in their thesis regardless of how good they are.
I am confident that INTC stock presents a good value. But I am less sure that the market is not willing to take another tumble. I can mitigate some risk by using options to build a buffer. But alternatively investors should just take smaller bites and leave room to average in, not average down.

In this video from ""The Virtual Opportunities Show,"" recorded on Jan. 25, Fool analyst Asit Sharma and Fool contributors Rachel Warren, Demitri Kalogeropoulos, and Jose Najarro discuss the latest U.S. government report that shows just how little cushion is left in that vital part of the world's supply chain, and consider what the impact of that could be during the next year.
10 stocks we like better than Intel

See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of January 10, 2022
Demitri Kalogeropoulos: The article I saw today in The Wall Street Journal -- the headline is about semiconductor chips, and it says: ""Chip Shortage Leaves U.S. Companies Dangerously Low on Semiconductors."" We've been talking about this for a little while. It's not a surprise. But we've got some hard numbers and some updated numbers now. We know that there's been an uptick in demand, obviously, for everything related to technology. Also, at the same time, we've had a supply challenge with the pandemic and stuff like that. So that's created this historic shortage in chips. But, we got some updated figures from the government. The Department of Commerce does a survey every now and then in different manufacturing worlds, and this one was in the semiconductor space, asking U.S. companies to estimate what their inventory is in these important, critical things. The companies came back and they said five days. Basically, the result of this survey was that most U.S. companies have about five days of inventory of these chips, which -- if it sounds low, it really is a very low number. That's basically no stockpiles of these things in inventory.
The article describes [that] in a normal year -- in 2019, let's say -- companies would have something like 40 days of this inventory in stock, so very tiny. The article quotes Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo (hope I'm saying that right) saying the semiconductor supply chain is ""very fragile"" right now.
You might've heard there's a big move politically to get spending in this arena, to bring more semiconductor manufacturing into the U.S. from Asia and China and Taiwan. Just this week, Intel made a big splashy release, talking about the $20 billion that they plan to spend adding new factories, I think it's in a couple of cities in Ohio, just to bring that manufacturing there. But we know that that kind of thing, that's going to take years to build up domestic production. So that's interesting.
I just think now that we're getting into the heat of earnings season, I'm sure we're going to hear a lot of companies... It might surprise you in terms of what impact this can have all been down in different industries. We know the automobile industry is the obvious one that shows up, but there's everything -- all kinds of consumer technology. So I think we're going to hear a lot of companies describe shortages.
The other thing is that it's an interesting risk to just be aware of in the tech world, because according to this, if one factory closes in Taiwan for a week or two, that could have huge ramifications. We're going to be operating under that wafer-thin inventory for probably at least until the second half of the year. Just interesting to keep an eye on that.
Rachel Warren: When I heard the whole ""five days store of chips,"" I was like, ""Wait, five days, is that correct? This can't be real."" And, is this a combination of not being able to replenish that minimum store that they would always keep on hand, in addition to maybe having to dip into that store to deal with the ongoing demands that there are? I feel like this is something that's going to be staying with us for a while.
We know that companies are able to deal with this various ways. Some have more control over their supply chain than others. Some companies have been making major acquisitions and partnerships to try to close the gap on their supply chain, so to speak.
Yeah, I think this is something to be aware of, and we know that we've seen a lot of volatility in stocks that operate in this space. It's not just one singular factor that is the solution to ending these problems. I think it's something we're going to be dealing with, at least for many months. That example of ""one place shuts down and the whole world is impacted"" -- I remember, many months ago, there was a key port, I believe, in China, that handles something like 70% of the world's commerce, and it shut down because of one COVID case. So that brought all these different elements to a screeching halt. I think when you think about how interconnected we are in this global economy, it definitely breaks it down and makes it easier to understand why this is happening. But I'm curious to see what some of these companies, on their earnings calls, how they're going to address this, because it's like the elephant in the room. [laughs] It's not going anywhere. Yeah, just my initial thoughts.
Jose Najarro: There was a company -- ASML Holdings -- that reported earnings last week. For those not familiar with ASML, this is a company that creates equipment that is used during the manufacturing process of semiconductors. One thing that they mentioned in theirearnings callmight be a little bit scary. They said that normally, since they create equipment to make sure quality assurance and everything goes well, after the equipment is created, they spend an extra four to eight weeks testing the equipment, making sure it works properly before sending it out to their customers. Their customers being the manufacturers like TSM, like Intel, Samsung, some of the biggest manufacturers. And they're saying, ""Hey, right now, we're willing to risk not doing these quality assurance tests because we want this equipment four to six weeks earlier."" Obviously, they probably still have some small tests that they're doing in the back end, but it's no longer to the depth it's usually done. It's scary how it shows how much the semiconductor industry is in high demand right now. It's also scary: If one of these equipments ends up going bad, that itself can cause some further defects across the line.
Asit Sharma: By the way, Rachel, Jose gave the signal when you started talking because he had his mic on before you.
Warren: I'm so sorry.
Sharma: I hope I followed his protocol. But the thing that came to my mind was the vulnerability of some consumer-facing companies in the coming year if these shortages persist, which they will. We already saw this hit Best Buy's earnings. Really fun company to follow: well run, high return on capital. They figured out the retail game, as hard as that is. But I see maybe some further rough waters for them ahead. They, in particular, and companies like them, could be vulnerable to these chip shortages, because these chips aren't just going in automobiles and big, heavy electronic equipment. They're going into small consumer goods as well. That's something to watch. I would be a buyer of Best Buy at some point this year -- I think Demitri may still own some shares, if I'm not mistaken. You still have your shares, Demitri?
Kalogeropoulos: I've never bought Best Buy. I talk about that a lot, there -- I am impressed with their business, for sure.
Sharma: For some reason, I thought you were a shareholder at some point, but yeah, that's something that I would be looking for this year if they got hit by the chip shortage, maybe to go in and scoop up some shares. The other thing -- something that Rachel said triggered a memory of an article I read this morning that the World Bank is revising downward slightly its growth estimates for the world next year, including the U.S. and China.
The U.S. in part, this is one of the factors -- the chip shortage affecting us as it is the rest of the world. China, in particular, because of their zero-tolerance policy for COVID. That port that you talked about that was shut down with one COVID case -- that is taking a toll on their economic growth.

Feb 2 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq was set to open higher on Wednesday, extending a rebound after a turbulent start to the year, as Google-parent Alphabet and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices' shares surged following strong quarterly results.
Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O rose about 10% in premarket trading after reporting record quarterly sales on Tuesday, and said it plans to undertake a 20-to-one stock split.
The stock split should make it more appealing to retail investors, said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, adding that Alphabet earnings will underpin a return in confidence in beaten down technology names.
""After all the tumult of January, solid earnings can be a catalyst for gains.""
Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc FB.O, which is set to report results on Wednesday, rose 3.4%, and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O slated to report on Thursday firmed 2.5%.
Last month the tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC fell as much as 19% from its all-time high in November as investors dumped highly valued growth stocks on prospects of faster-than-expected rate hikes.
Traders are betting on five rate hikes this year after hawkish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve last month.
Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O climbed 12.1% after the company on Tuesday forecast 2022 revenue above expectations, following strong quarterly demand for its semiconductors, despite global supply snags.
Rival Intel Corp INTC.O slipped 0.7%, but other chipmakers including Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Micron Technology Inc MU.O rose between 2.1% and 5.6%.
At 8:24 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 36 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 33.75 points, or 0.74%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 214 points, or 1.43%.
U.S. private payrolls unexpectedly fell in January as a resurgence in COVID-19 infections disrupted business activity, the ADP National Employment Report showed. Private payrolls dropped by 301,000 jobs last month, according to the report.
The more comprehensive jobs report is due on Friday.
Of the companies that have reported results so far during this earnings season, 78.8% of them have beaten analysts' earnings estimates, compared with an average of 84% over the past four quarters, according to Refinitiv data.
""It comes down to this earnings season and how well companies can prove they operated during the heat of Omicron,"" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta.
""The guidance will indicate how the companies hope to perform now as the pandemic dies away and the resilience of their business models.""
PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL.O slumped 18% after it forecast first-quarter revenue and profit well below expectations.
Starbucks Corp SBUX.O fell 3% as the coffee chain lowered its estimates for profits this year and said it will raise menu prices in 2022 and reduce some spending to offset soaring costs for labor and goods.

Much of the decline can be attributed to an imminent tightening in monetary policy, as the U.S. Federal Reserve struggles to control inflation that is much higher and stickier than anticipated.
While the correction is well-justified for speculative tech stocks, some fundamentally strong and financially stable stocks such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) are also being unduly punished. Hence, this period of broader market decline can prove to be a reasonable entry opportunity for long-term retail investors to get their hands on these stocks.
Let's see why they can prove to be attractive picks during the current tech sell-off.

1. Nvidia
Nvidia's market-leading graphics cards and artificial intelligence (AI) processors enjoy solid demand in several lucrative markets such as gaming, autonomous driving, data centers, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
Nvidia's GeForce RTX-powered high-performance laptops have been in huge demand since the start of the pandemic. More and more people have been using these laptops not only for competitive gaming but also for content creation, remote work, and online education activities. Nvidia currently accounts for an 80% share of the global gaming laptop market (estimated to grow from $10.96 billion in 2020 to $17.82 billion in 2026). Since 85% of the GeForce gaming installed base is currently operating on older GTX cards, Nvidia also continues to benefit dramatically from gamers upgrading to the new and faster RTX-powered laptops.
Nvidia's high-performance GPUs are also used extensively in major cloud computing operations that require high-performance computing and run artificial intelligence algorithms. The company's hardware and software offerings also have multiple applications in areas such as virtual reality and augmented reality as well as in the emerging metaverse opportunity.
Analysts are estimating Nvidia's sales to grow by 60% year over year in fiscal 2022. The company is also profitable. Although Nvidia is currently trading at a price-to-earnings multiple close to 72 (which is not cheap), it is still reasonable compared to the level at which the company has traded for most of 2021. Hence, now may be just the right time to buy shares of this graphics card specialist.
2. Microsoft
Microsoft has been all over the news recently after it announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard in a $68.7 billion all-cash transaction. Recently, the company also posted impressive second-quarter results (ending Dec. 31, 2021) with revenue and adjusted earnings per share surpassing consensus estimates. The company continues to benefit from several secular tailwinds such as ongoing enterprise digital transformation, shifting of on-premise enterprise workloads to hybrid and cloud IT architectures, enterprise security, artificial intelligence, automation initiatives, and gaming.
Azure and other cloud services reported 46% year-over-year growth in revenue in the second quarter. While this seems to be a deceleration from 50% year-over-year revenue growth reported in the first quarter, the strength of commercial bookings (driven by large, long-term Azure contracts) implies the possibility of stronger Azure performance in the coming quarters. Thanks mainly to its dominant position in hybrid cloud computing, the Azure cloud computing service accounted for 21% share of the global cloud infrastructure services market at the end of September 2021, a significant jump from 13.7% share at the end of 2017.
The metaverse is another major upcoming growth opportunity for Microsoft. After Activision's acquisition, the company will become a key provider for several building blocks (cloud and gaming infrastructure, content, captive customer base, augmented and virtual reality hardware, and collaboration software) required for developing metaverse platforms.
These are only a few of the lucrative trends that Microsoft is targeting for future growth. Yet, despite the many pros, Microsoft is still trading at only 31.6 times earnings, close to its lowest valuation multiple in the last year. Hence, considering its solid near-term and long-term growth prospects, it seems to be a good idea to purchase this stock on the current dip.
3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Being the largest pure-play semiconductor foundry in the world, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) is a big beneficiary of the ongoing global supply and demand mismatch in semiconductors. The company is well-poised to leverage the rapidly rising semiconductor demand in areas such as 5G, Internet of Things, autonomous driving, data centers, and gaming. TSMC recently released stellar fourth-quarter results (ending Dec. 31, 2021), which included record profits and much higher than expected guidance for the first quarter (ending Mar. 31, 2022).
TSMC has announced plans to invest $40 billion to $44 billion in capacity expansions in 2022, which is almost 40% higher at the midpoint on a year-over-year basis. The company aims to use 70% to 80% of its capex budget to increase the manufacturing capacity of advanced nodes. These investments can prove highly lucrative for TSMC, considering that 7-nanometer and below nodes accounted for almost half of the company's wafer revenue in the fourth quarter. Thanks to the chip shortage and increasing adoption of smaller (advanced/leading-edge) nodes, the company has also increased its chip prices for 2022.
TSMC enjoys a solid moat since it manufactures almost half of all semiconductor chips and 90% of the advanced chips in the world. The company is also a partner to several fabless tech giants, such as Apple, Qualcomm, and Advanced Micro Devices. While competition from Samsung and Intel cannot be ignored, TSMC's huge annual capex ensures that the company remains ahead of its rivals in the race to manufacture advanced chips. At the end of September 2021, TSMC accounted for 53.1% of the global foundry market share, well ahead of the 17.1% share held by second-leading foundry player Samsung.
Against this backdrop, the current pullback in TSMC's share prices offers a good entry opportunity to retail investors for multi-year growth prospects.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger is using “tech sovereignty” to fuel the stock’s comeback, with hefty government aid. INTC stock has some big changes on the horizon.
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Intel’s decision to put its new $20 billion chip plant outside Columbus, Ohio was fueled by over $2 billion in state government “incentives.” This also brought Ohio Republicans on-side for passage of the “CHIPS For America Act,” which would bring billions more in government aid.
The chipmaker had $28 billion in cash and short-term securities on its books at the end of 2021. But Gelsinger is pushing governments in both North America and Europe to help secure a steady flow of chips outside China’s influence.
This is a pretty big change of pace for this until recently floundering chipmaking giant.
Intel’s Fall
Intel’s fall was fueled by two decades of neglect. It missed the turn to mobile, emphasized marketing over production, and let former CEO Brian Krzanich push out talented executives like Gelsinger, who spent a decade running VMWare (NYSE:VMW) instead.
7 Lesser-Known Retail Stocks to Check Out Now
By the time Gelsinger returned as CEO a year ago, the company had been passed in chip design by Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), in advanced applications by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and in fabrication by Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM).
TSMC pioneered the Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) technology needed to bring circuit lines within a few nanometers of each other. Intel now has just one-third the market cap of Nvidia or Taiwan Semiconductor. It’s also less than one-half as valuable as Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), which is now a bigger chipmaker.
Intel stock has evolved into a winning play only for conservative, income-focused investors. The yield on the 36.5 cent/share dividend is now almost 3%, and its price to earnings multiple is just 10. It’s literally as cheap as chips.
Before Gelsinger returned, many analysts, including me, were suggesting Intel should sell its foundry and concentrate on design. Hardware has become software, we argued. Moore’s Second Law, which holds that manufacturing costs increase with chip complexity, was keeping profits at bay. Moore’s Third Law, the idea that chip complexity accelerates change, was making it ever-harder for the company to catch up.
Gelsinger’s Grand Design
Gelsinger’s plan is to focus on a dramatic increase in chip production and rebuild the foundry business. If Intel’s production is competitive, he reasons, the best chip designers will give it production contracts. The company’s research budget was over $15 billion in 2021 and should rise further this year.
Gelsinger is placing a $100 billion bet, too big for Intel to execute alone. That’s why he has been seeking help from western governments. They’re concerned not just about the current chip shortage, but fear China might invade Taiwan and wreck the market entirely.
This means foregoing short-term profits in favor of long-term goals.
Intel’s net income for 2021 was 21% lower than in 2020. Its revenue was up just 4%.  Analysts have downgraded the stock, which is down 14% just since Jan. 11. Five of the 20 still covering Intel at Tipranks rate it a sell. The average price target is just $55/share.
The Bottom Line on INTC Stock
Intel is selling America, which can work if it can maintain the dividend and keep income investors in the stock.
INTC stock is unlikely to make a big splash in 2022. For now, it’s an income stock, the best in technology. But if you can afford to wait, and I can, then Intel is preparing big improvements for America’s competitive position, for the global economy, and in its general competitiveness.
Intel is finally an entrepreneurial company again, for the first time since Andy Grove retired in 1998. Win or lose, Gelsinger is determined Intel will go down fighting. Even if you don’t like INTC stock, you must root for him.

Gains for the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC), Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), and S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) were all roughly in sync, reflecting overall optimism about Wall Street's ability to rebound from the worst start to a year in a long time.

After the closing bell, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) released its latest earnings report, and investors were pleased with the news it gave. Yet they seemed even happier about another announcement from the Google parent -- an announcement that, while meaningless in itself, could have ramifications for whether the tech giant ever becomes part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Alphabet gets an A+
Shares of Alphabet were up almost 2% in the regular session before the quarterly financial report came out. They vaulted higher by another 8% in after-hours trading after its release.
Alphabet's financial results were even better than most had expected. In the fourth quarter, revenue jumped 32% year over year to $75.3 billion. Net income of $20.6 billion was 36% higher than in the year-earlier period, translating to earnings of $30.69 per share. That closed a strong 2021 for Alphabet, with revenue up 41% and net income soaring 89% from 2020 levels.
Alphabet saw strength across its product line. Google search revenue rose 39% and still represents the majority of the company's sales, but YouTube and the Google Network both contributed with roughly 25% year-over-year gains. Google Cloud sales jumped 45% from year-ago levels.
Moreover, Alphabet continued to improve its financial condition. The company has almost $140 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, up by $3 billion from three months ago. That stands against just $15 billion in long-term debt, most of which it raised at infinitesimal interest rates when the bond market offered capital at terms too good to refuse.
A split to a price the Dow Jones Industrials could live with
Alphabet also announced that it would do a 20-for-1 stock split. The move requires shareholder approval, which means that it will take months to implement. However, based on the company's prediction, investors could see the split take effect in July if shareholders give their assent to the proposal.
With the stock rising to around $3,000 per share after the earnings announcement, the 20-for-1 split would potentially bring Alphabet's price down to $150 per share. It wouldn't have any effect on the intrinsic value of the entire company, because shareholders would simply have 20 times as many shares that would be worth roughly one-twentieth of their previous value.
However, a stock price around $150 would open the door for the managers of the Dow Jones Industrials to consider inviting Alphabet into the Dow 30. The price-weighted index couldn't have handled Alphabet's $3,000 stock price, as it would give the tech giant disproportionate influence in calculating the Dow.
It's premature to assume that Alphabet will eventually get a Dow invitation. However, current Dow components Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) have seen their share prices languish by comparison, giving them only minimal influence in the average.
With a market capitalization of nearly $2 trillion, Alphabet's omission from the Dow is fairly noteworthy. The company's move today would potentially give the Dow a chance to remedy the situation later in 2022.

2022-02-01 00:00:00+00:00,Earnings beats underwhelm as Wall Street looks for good news,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-beats-underwhelm-as-wall-street-looks-for-good-news,,,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - U.S. earnings news has been less impressive this reporting season than in recent quarters, giving some investors another reason to worry after Wall Street's tumultuous start to the year.
Downbeat forecasts so far this reporting period from companies like Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Intel Corp INTC.O have added to recent pressure on stocks, while reports from a number of heavyweights are still expected. Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O was due to post results after market close on Tuesday, and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Meta Platforms Inc FB.O are also slated to release earnings this week.
S&P 500 companies are still beating analysts' earnings expectations for the fourth quarter of 2021, but they are beating by a much lower margin than they had been over the past year when companies were just bouncing back from the depths of the pandemic.
With results in from more than 180 companies as of Tuesday, S&P 500 companies in aggregate are reporting earnings 4.3% above expectations, well below the average of 16% for the past four full quarters but in line with the 4.1% average going back to 1994, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Estimated year-over-year profit growth for S&P 500 companies for the fourth quarter has gone up slightly since the start of the reporting period. Growth was forecast at 25.6% as of Tuesday versus 22.3% at the start of January, based on Refinitiv data.
""It was huge beats last year and that's shrunk,"" said Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. ""It's partially reverting back to normal, but it's also the supply-chain pressures and inflationary pressures taking a toll.""
Wall Street is trying to find its footing after the recent sharp selloff. The S&P 500 .SPX had its worst January since 2009, while the Nasdaq .IXIC posted its biggest January percentage drop since 2008 following increasing worries about rising interest rates.
Growth stocks like large-cap technology have been among the hardest hit, and investors are focused on whether earnings this year will be able to support the market.
While down from about 22 at the start of the year, the forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is at 20.1, still well above its long-term average of 15.5, according to Refinitiv DataStream.
Companies have been facing higher prices and labor costs, and some companies may be struggling to pass on those costs at this point, said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
Among them, Oreo cookie maker Mondelez International Inc MDLZ.O last week said it expects to face a larger impact from supply-chain problems in its key North American segment in the current quarter.
To be sure, profit growth is seen as a positive overall for the market.
""The tug-of-war between earnings and rising interest rates continues. Earnings are trending higher, while rising interest rates are compressing valuation multiples and increasing price volatility,"" Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, wrote in a recent note.
Yet just 78.8% of the reports so far this season have beaten analysts' earnings estimates, compared with an average of 84% of companies beating over the past four quarters, Refinitiv's data showed.
S&P 500 earnings are expected to gain by about 8.5% this year after growth of roughly 50% in 2021, based on Refinitiv data.

Tech stocks haven’t had a good start to the year with most stocks dropping from their all-time highs. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock is usually a solid growth name, but it’s down 20% in 2022.

As the market worries about inflation, and interest rates, the volatility will continue to impact most tech stocks. AMD stock is down 33% in the past six months and went from $153 last month to $102 today. The stock hit the 52-week high of $164 in November, but trades now near $115.
The recent approval of the Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) deal will help the company significantly and improve its position in the industry. AMD is a solid company that is consistently growing and has reported stellar revenue in the past.
I believe the current dip in AMD stock is nothing but a chance to add it to your portfolio. As the company gears up to report the fourth-quarter results, there is a chance for the stock to rebound.
Xilinx Deal Will Be a Game Changer
AMD announced its intention to buy Xilinx in October 2020 and it has been a much-anticipated deal. Xilinx is a large manufacturer of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The deal was expected to be closed by the end of 2021 but it went into several hurdles and was further delayed.
Chinese regulators finally gave their approval last week. When the deal closes, AMD will only be stronger in its competition against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
7 Lesser-Known Retail Stocks to Check Out Now
Xilinx is a dominant maker of FPGA, which can be reprogrammed after they are made. Most often, FPGA is used in radar systems, 5G telecommunications infrastructure and military communications. The merged entity will sell to Chinese customers on reasonable, fair terms and these conditions will apply for a minimum period of six years.
FPGAs allow a high level of customization for a large range of devices. This will allow the company to meet the demands of the clients efficiently. The deal will have a huge impact on the bottom line and will strengthen AMD’s position in the industry.
Revenue Could Be Higher Than Expected
With the earnings season right here, it is time to brace yourself for a stock rebound whenever the company beats analyst estimates. Advanced Micro Devices has projected a revenue of $4.5 billion for the quarter, which is a 39% rise from a year ago. If it manages to beat this number, it is nothing but impressive.
The company projected a gross margin of 49.5% for the quarter. Interestingly, the company has successfully managed to beat analyst projections in the last three quarters and has raised guidance. A company will only raise guidance when it is confident of meeting the same and it has impressed investors with solid revenue and growth numbers in the past.
It is not surprising to see AMD beat expectations again and I am certain it will be able to deliver solid numbers in 2022. The demand for graphic cards and server processors is only going to grow in the coming years and this is where AMD will be able to benefit.
The Bottom Line on AMD Stock
AMD stock is down from the all-time highs and this does not say anything about the fundamentals of the company. If you look at the bigger picture, Advanced Micro Devices stands strong amidst the competition. It has become a huge name in the industry in the past few years and shows massive growth potential.
The chipmaker will be able to expand its market share in the coming year with GPUs and data center and will impress investors with strong revenue numbers. If you are looking for a solid tech stock to own this year, AMD is the one.
Buy and hold AMD stock for the long term.

2022-02-01 00:00:00+00:00,3 Anticipated 2022 IPOs Investors Should Watch,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-anticipated-2022-ipos-investors-should-watch,,,"An initial public offering (IPO) is an exciting event. A business becomes a freshly minted, public company trading on a stock exchange, raising its profile that much higher and becoming the subject of much break room talk and internet speculation.
2021 was a good year for the IPO (plus its Johnny-come-lately cousin, the SPAC merger), and so far 2022 looks set to at least equal its predecessor. Here's a brief look at three notable companies set to top the class of 2022 IPOs -- Flipkart, Mobileye, and VinFast.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Flipkart
It isn't every day that one of the dominant e-commerce companies in a nation packed with more than 1.3 billion people goes on the market. But that's what looks to be happening this year with Flipkart, one of the two sector giants in the giant nation (No. 1 is Amazon India).
Flipkart is majority-owned by Walmart, which for some time now has been talking up either an IPO or SPAC merger for its big Indian subsidiary. The American retailer now seems to be slanting toward a traditional IPO, possibly because this traditional method of going public is seen as more transparent for investors.
From the company's latest talk, a 2022 IPO seems to be the best bet. If that happens, Flipkart should hit a valuation of around $50 billion.
While that's modest compared to its majority owner's market cap of $376 billion (or, while we're at it, Amazon's $1.4 trillion), it tops that of other notable retail sector mainstays such as Kroger, Walgreens Boots Alliance, and Dollar General. That means if Walmart's dream of spinning off Flipkart as a separate company is realized, it'll be a big-time retail stock right from the start.
2. Mobileye
Speaking of potentially well-capitalized spinoffs, we've got tech giant Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) assisted/autonomous driving unit Mobileye. Less than five years after purchasing the formerly stand-alone company in a $15.3 billion deal, Intel aims to return it to that status with an IPO that could (like Flipkart) reap as much as $50 billion, according to recent estimates.
In certain ways, Intel and Mobileye seem to be a good fit for each other.
The latter concentrates on providing ""sight"" for assisted and autonomous driving systems (hence the name) with advanced computer processors. Mirroring its parent's impressive client list, Mobileye's chips have been installed in the systems of some of the world's top auto brands, including Nissan, BMW, and Chinese electric vehicle (EV) up-and-comer Nio.
But unlike Intel, which has struggled with its classic PC chip business, Mobileye continues to grow at an admirable clip. In 2021 its revenue rose a steep 43% year-over-year -- by far the best rate of its parent's six business units and sub-units.
That still-scorching growth, plus Mobileye's position as a top vision processor specialist inside the next-generation automobile sector, virtually guarantees that it will attract gobs of interest from investors if it hits the stock market this year.
3. VinFast
Interest should also be keen in another company involved with EVs, VinFast. This Vietnam-based carmaker, a division of that country's largest conglomerate Vingroup JSC, looks to be coming to the market through either a SPAC merger or an IPO in the second half of this year.
Not at all coincidentally, that's around the time VinFast aims to launch its first models on the Vietnamese, North American, and selected European markets. A reservation system for the vehicles, two SUVs the company slots into the category of ""affordable luxury"", has already been set up on the company's website.
True to its name, VinFast likes to move speedily. It launched in 2017, began selling traditional gasoline-powered autos in 2019, and has lately been talking about a full transition to EV production at the end of this year.
The company also plans to establish manufacturing capacity in the U.S., all the better to start supplying product to a massive, car-loving market that has enthusiastically embraced EV technology.
As for its market debut, the company is probably pushing on the gas for that too. The sooner the better, as the current craze for EV stocks might not last with more players on the market. Either way, VinFast might be able to raise around $3 billion in coming to the exchange, according to a recent report from Bloomberg citing ""people familiar with the matter.""
A word of caution
Everyone likes shiny new things, and that's particularly true of stock investors. IPOs tend to be accompanied by a lot of hype from issuers and their underwriters, not to mention the many Reddit-loving investors eager to post about new stocks.
We should also bear in mind that fresh stock exchange arrivals tend to be wobbly and volatile in price at first. This is because investors finding the value of a company that usually hasn't existed before as a stock.
That's why it's important to ignore the noise around IPOs. Many smart investors advise waiting some time (six months seems to be a good term) to see how a new stock performs. This also provides us a chance to get a better sense of a company's business trajectory with its latest quarterly earnings report(s).
That said, all three of these companies are definitely worth a look for anyone interested in upcoming stock market arrivals. Watch this space for more on each as their listing plans firm up.

Jose Najarro: One of the things ASML mentions is the megatrends for semiconductors continues to drive this industry. This is a very innovative market. A few years ago, a huge product for TSM [Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM)], for example, was the 7 nanometers, now it's the 7 nanometers and the 5 nanometers. Just that innovation again pushes ASML to continue to innovate as well and continue to have a reason for them to sell their products.
I want to break down a little bit their sales breakdown and want to get some of your opinions. Here we can take a quick look at 2020 sales and 2021. The first thing we notice, the biggest markets for these are the EUV, extreme ultraviolet machines. These are pretty much used to, I want to say paints to some extent, the wafers. I don't know if there's someone else might explain it better, but this is the EUV markets, and then they have their R5 market. These are the two main markets for ASML. They are pretty much, I want to say over 80% of the overall revenue for the company.
I do want to say region grows shipping, Taiwan and South Korea are the biggest places that take their orders. This is well-known. Like TSM, a lot of factories obviously in Taiwan, South Korea, I believe that's where we have a lot of Samsung Foundries if I'm correct, and then we have USA very small.
Overall in the news, I feel like we're hearing a lot of news about United States, a lot of companies building new factories here in the United States. We have Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), for example, focusing in Arizona, I think we have TSM also somewhere in Arizona, we have a few others in Texas. But at the end of the day, we look at that just difference between market share around for USA compared to Taiwan and South Korea.

*Stock Advisor returns as of January 10, 2022
Asit Sharma: Do you happen to know, Jose, are any of the other companies that develop -- I won't call them supercomputers, but these really big conglomeration of processing units -- are they big customers of Nvidia? Or is this better news for Nvidia? Facebook says, ""We want to make one of these computers in 2023."" Because we've discussed on the show, they've got the cash. [laughs] They want to do this.
Jose Najarro: I think this is pretty much just good news for the overall tech market. To some extent it's showing that, big players are still focusing on investing a lot of money on these big players. I personally think it's better news for Nvidia. It shows that their product is in high demand. At the moment, there's only really two main companies that focus in high-performance accelerators, which are these graphics cards, and that's Nvidia and AMD. Intel is entering the race in the future, but at the moment it does seem like we're seeing a lot bigger companies using Nvidia, but who knows, the overall semiconductor market is very innovative market.
This year could be Nvidia, but next year or two years from now, engineers can develop something impressive that it might be some other player. They did mention though, one thing that Meta Platforms is also using this supercomputer to accelerate its augmented reality tools. That's a new process that they're going to be using this supercomputer, opposed to the other one that they have. We've known that Facebook, Meta Platforms is focusing in that metaverse, so these supercomputers is one that's going to help them accelerate into whatever that means for them.
Demitri Kalogeropoulos: That's cool. I'll just add, ever since we've been talking with Asit the last couple of weeks about this war for talent for engineers, these big different companies are trying to steal away the best engineers for the next round of all this investment that we're seeing. I can't help but hearing when I see articles like this filtered through that prism a little bit, because I think Meta is trying to attract some great engineers there, and of course you're going to say, we're going to build the world's fastest supercomputer, and if you want to work on that stuff, you might want to come to work here. I see it like that and that's just another little twist there. Just interesting that a lot of the other companies, Microsoft and Amazon making similar announcements, but that's a game that Apple really doesn't play either. You almost think they're almost too quiet in that way.
Rachel Warren: Yeah, it's interesting. There were a couple of things that stuck out to me from this story. One I was just thinking about, no matter what the naysayers may have to say about Meta, and I count myself [laughs] among one of them, looking at the business and people wondering, ""Could Meta survive the most recent PR crisis?"" This is a company that's just not going anywhere, and its ability to constantly innovate, and grow, and surprise both consumers and investors, I think it's really a testament to whatever the criticisms there are of management, which I have made and believe are valid, there are so much innovation and so much vision there, and I think that's one of the things that keeps investors coming back for more.
Another thing that I thought was really interesting when I was reading a little bit about this is obviously, the supercomputer is such an integral part of Meta's vision to expand within the metaverse. But another thing I thought was interesting, they said in a blog post that they're hoping that it will,
""Help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together."" There's obviously this very metaverse aspect, but there's also a very real-world utilitarian aspect to this technology that could be really meaningful in a lot of spaces outside of the metaverse.
I actually thought this was pretty exciting. I haven't seen a lot of things come from Meta Platforms over the recent months that I've been too thrilled about, but this I found actually really quite fascinating, so I'm excited to see what more they tell us about it in the coming months.

Jose Najarro: What are suitable valuation metrics for this industry is it price-of-sales, price-to-earnings, EV to EBITDA, or price to free cash flow. Billy, well, would you guys want to, I'm pretty sure it's different depending on where the stage of the company. But if you guys want to share your thoughts, Will, I'll let you go first here. Do you have any preferred method or when to choose what kind of valuation metric you look at?
Will Healy: I look at the PEG ratio because different companies have different growth rates and you don't want to just go on P/E. I'm about to discuss Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Intel has a 10 P/E ratio, but there's a very good reason that's a 10 P/E too. Whereas Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) I think is like in the 80s, at least the last time I checked it was and that's because the growth is phenomenal. I look at the PEG ratio.
Billy Duberstein: That's price-earnings to growth.
Healy: Yes.
Duberstein: That might be a little bit difficult with a company like this just because the growth rate moves around so much. Since it's a cyclical company, but it's a growth cyclical, so it might be helpful to go back through the last cycle and maybe take the average earnings, maybe like the past five years and see how that's trending. I think P/E ratio works for a stock like this too. It's premature, generates positive earnings, and you just got to figure out if there's over-earning or under-earning and what's the normalized level of earnings and the long-term growth rate.

2022-01-31 00:00:00+00:00,7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for February,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-blue-chip-stocks-to-buy-for-february,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Irrespective of market conditions, it is important to hold blue-chip stocks in your portfolio. Typically, these are stocks of companies with an established business and stable cash flows. Blue-chip stocks provide a portfolio with some stability and lower the overall portfolio beta.
On the other hand, high-growth stocks have more risk and volatility. These stocks tend to be out-performers in a bull-market. With escalating geo-political tensions and the prospects of a rate-hike, the markets have been on the edge.
In such market conditions, growth stocks tend to under-perform. Just like flow of money from risky to risk-free asset classes, market corrections trigger flow of money to blue-chip stocks.
7 IT Stocks to Buy No Matter What Earnings Season Brings
My focus in this column is on seven blue-chip stocks to buy for February. It goes without saying that these stocks are worth holding for the long-term. Here are my top 7 picks for blue-chip stocks:
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)
Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST)
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM)
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
Equinor (NYSE:EQNR)
Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)
Blue-Chip Stocks: Apple (AAPL)
Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com
I see AAPL stock among the high-quality blue-chip stocks to hold for the next few years. At a forward price-to-earnings-ratio of 28.3, valuations are not stretched. Further, the stock has visibility for sustained growth in dividends.
For 2021’s fourth quarter (Q4), Apple reported revenue growth of 29% to $83.4 billion. Further, for 2021, the company reported earnings per share growth of 71% on a year-on-year basis. With a price-earnings-to-growth ratio of less than one, the stock is likely to trend higher.
In terms of business developments, iPhone remains the cash flow driver. With 5G phones, growth is likely to sustain in this segment. At the same time, Apple has witnessed healthy growth in the wearable and services segment. The revenue stream is likely to be more diversified in the coming years.
It is worth noting that for 2021, the company reported operating cash flow of $104 billion. With strong cash flows and a healthy balance sheet, the company is positioned for aggressive organic and inorganic growth. With a likely entry into the electric vehicle (EV) segment, Apple has catalysts for sustained growth in revenue.
Overall, AAPL stock is worth considering for a core portfolio. It is also a good stock to hold in relatively uncertain times for the markets.
Intel Corporation (INTC)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
At a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 10, INTC stock is among the top blue-chip stocks to consider. Besides the potential for trending higher from current valuations, INTC stock also offers investors a healthy dividend yield of 2.91%.
In terms of catalysts, Intel has plans to take Mobileye public. The initial public offering is likely to happen in mid-2022 with a valuation of $50 billion. This will unlock value for Intel shareholders.
Intel also has some big investment plans for the next few years. For the current year, the planned capital expenditure is in the range of $25 to $28 billion. The company has also indicated that there is potential for further growth in investments in the coming years. These investments are likely to address the chip-shortage headwind globally.
The company is also focused on accelerating the innovation pipeline. It will be unveiling a Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) mining chip next month. Additionally, the company’s partnership with ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML), will support high-end manufacturing. Intel also has a pipeline of new products that includes a next generation discrete GPU for gaming and the company’s first AISC-based Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU), among others.
10 Stocks to Buy That Could Make You a Millionaire in 2022
Overall, Intel is focused on gaining the lost market share through investments in innovation. The stock looks undervalued and the dividends add to the attractiveness.
Blue-Chip Stocks: Costco Wholesale (COST)
Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com
COST stock has been a value creator in the last few years through stock upside and dividends. After touching recent highs of $571.49, COST stock has corrected to current levels of $496. This looks like a good accumulation opportunity.
For 2022’s first quarter (Q1), Costco reported sales growth of 16.7% to $49.4 billion. Besides the traditional sales channel, the company has also ramped-up online sales after the pandemic. With improving omni-channel presence, Costco seems well-positioned to deliver healthy numbers.
It is worth noting that as of November 2021, Costco reported 62.5 million in member households and 113.1 million cardholders. This has translated into a membership fee total of $4.0 billion in the last 12 months. As recurring revenue continues to swell, the impact on cash flows will be meaningful. Costco has just two warehouses in China. Growth in emerging markets is likely to boost membership revenue.
Currently, Costco has an annual dividend pay-out of $3.16. Since initiating dividends in 2004, the company’s dividend has increased at a CAGR of 13%. COST stock is therefore attractive for income investors.
JPMorgan Chase (JPM)

I believe that the banking sector is likely an attractive investment in 2022. With the possibility of four rate hikes in the current year, I believe JPM stock is poised for a break-out.
An important point to note is that deposit rates respond relatively slowly to the rate hike. As a result, JPMorgan Chase is likely to witness growth in net interest income margin for 2022. Once there is growth traction in core banking activities, the stock is likely to trend higher.
The banking sector is also witnessing some major transformations. In 2021, the sector reported merger and acquisition deals worth $77 billion. As digital banking accelerates, a record number of branches were also closed in 2021.
Recently, JPMorgan agreed to acquire 49% ownership stake in Viva Wallet Holdings. The latter is a European cloud-based payments fintech company. It’s likely that JPMorgan will continue to accelerate investment towards payment innovations.
7 Hot Stocks Poised to Get Even Hotter in Q1 
Overall, the bank has seen healthy growth in wealth management activities in the last few years. Core banking acceleration is likely to be a catalyst for JPM stock’s upside in 2022.
Blue-Chip Stocks: Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
The technology giant continues to deliver positive surprises for investors. A correction from recent highs is therefore a good opportunity to accumulate MSFT stock.
Recently, Microsoft announced strong numbers for 2022’s second quarter (Q2). The company reported revenue of $51.7 billion, which was higher by 20% on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. The strong revenue momentum was driven by the cloud business, which delivered 32% YOY growth to $22.1 billion. Additionally, Microsoft has also guided for a strong Q3 2022. This is likely to help the stock maintain a bullish momentum.
In another big news, Microsoft announced the acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI). This is not the first acquisition by the company in the gaming segment. With a impending growth in metaverse, Microsoft is likely to compete with Meta (NASDAQ:FB) through these acquisitions.
Therefore, there are ample growth opportunities for Microsoft in the next few years. Importantly, the company has a robust balance sheet to pursue acquisitions with a focus on innovation. This will keep earnings growth robust in the next few years.
MSFT stock also offers an annualized dividend of $2.48. Dividend growth also seems likely considering the company’s earnings expectations and cash flow upside potential.
Equinor (EQNR)
Source: II.studio / Shutterstock.com
With Brent oil sustaining above $80 per barrel, it makes sense to have oil and gas stocks in your portfolio. Further, with escalation in geo-political tensions, crude oil might continue to trend higher.
Equinor is a quality name to consider. Over the last 12-months, EQNR stock has trended higher by about 54%. The stock also offers a healthy dividend yield of 2.62%.
One reason to like the company is low break-even assets. Even at $60 per barrel oil, Equinor expects to deliver free cash flow of $45 billion between 2021 and 2026. With Brent above $80, the free cash flow visibility seems to be significantly higher.
With strong cash flows, Equinor is also pursuing aggressive investments in the non-renewable energy sector. Over the next five-years, the investment in renewable energy is guided at $23 billion.
Therefore, Equinor is positioned for healthy growth from the core portfolio and shareholder value creation. From the current year, the company is targeting an annual buy-back target of $1.2 billion.
7 Dividend Stocks to Profit off the Hot Real Estate Market
As earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margins expand further on higher oil price, the stock seems to be positioned for further rally.
Blue-Chip Stocks: Pfizer (PFE)
Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com
There is a possibility that the pandemic will shift to an endemic in 2022. However, this factor does not make PFE stock any less attractive.
The covid-19 vaccine was a cash flow machine for the company in 2021. This positive trend is likely to sustain through 2022 with booster doses and vaccinations for younger age groups becoming available. As a matter of fact, the company has a high production capacity for 2022 as compared to 2021.
With a strong cash flow and balance sheet, I see the following positives:
First, Pfizer has a deep pipeline of drug candidates in Phase two and three. The cash buffer will help in accelerating clinical trials. This will support organic revenue growth in the next few years.
Further, Pfizer has robust financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions. The company has made two acquisitions in the last six months. These will help in boosting the company’s drug pipeline further.
From a valuation perspective, PFE stock trades at an attractive forward P/E of 9.28. A low-beta and a dividend yield of 2.94% are additional factors that make the stock worth considering.

2022-01-31 00:00:00+00:00,Microsoft Stock Is Set to Power Up With Earnings Beat Momentum,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsoft-stock-is-set-to-power-up-with-earnings-beat-momentum,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
After getting caught up in the tech stock slump that has battered the sector so far in 2022, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is rallying.
Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com
Until the closing bell on Tuesday, MSFT stock was down 14% since the start of the year. However, Microsoft reported its Q2 fiscal 2022 results Tuesday evening. After an earnings and revenue beat plus better-than-expected guidance, shares began to rally. In the two days post-earnings, MSFT shares popped by nearly 4%.
That’s not a spectacular number, but for a tech stock in 2022? Not bad at all.
Does this short rally mean that Microsoft shares have momentum? After five years of strong growth, MFST stock had been sputtering but the company’s strength was on full display on Tuesday. Multiple strategies are paying off for the company — led by strong growth in its cloud business — and they have plenty of room for growth.
In addition, the company has shown with its $68.7 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) that it’s not afraid to spend big to keep the momentum going. Here’s why I think MSFT is a strong contender for inclusion in your portfolio.
Microsoft Delivers a Q2 Earnings Beat
On Jan. 24, Microsoft reported its Q2 fiscal 2022 results. Wall Street had been looking for revenue of $50.88 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.31 per share. Instead, Microsoft reported revenue of $51.7 billion. That was up 20% year-over-year and headed up by Microsoft Cloud revenue that increased 32% YoY to hit $22.1 billion. Earnings-per-share of $2.48 also handily beat projections.
Microsoft doesn’t see its business slowing any time soon. The company’s CFO noted that demand remains strong and said MSFT is expecting revenue for Q3 in the $48.5 billion to $49.3 billion range. Once again, that topped Wall Street expectations, which were for revenue of $48.23 billion.

While MSFT stock initially dropped sharply the day after the earnings report, it quickly rallied to finish the day on a positive note.
Microsoft’s Huge Cloud Business Has Plenty of Room to Grow
Microsoft’s cloud business is becoming a driving growth engine for the company. The good news is it has plenty of potential growth runway remaining — although the landscape is competitive. 
The global cloud computing market has been projected to grow from $445.3 billion in 2021 to $947.3 billion in 2026. That’s a CAGR of 16.3%. In addition, Microsoft’s share of the global cloud computing market has been growing. While market leader AWS has been holding steady at 32% of the market since the end of 2017, in that same time Microsoft Azure has increased its share from 13.7% to 21%.  
Gaming Growth, the Metaverse Awaits
Adding to the Microsoft growth story is the company’s Xbox gaming division. The Xbox Series X/S has been handily outsold by the PlayStation 5 so far in this generation. However Microsoft continues to dominate in online and subscription gaming with services like Xbox Live and Xbox Game Pass. 
In addition, the company continues to grow its stable of game development studios. In 2021 it finalized the $7.5 billion acquisition of ZeniMax Media, which brought Bethesda Softworks under the Xbox umbrella. This month’s announcement that Microsoft is buying Activision Blizzard in a $68.7 billion deal would make Microsoft the world’s third-largest gaming company.
These purchases allow Microsoft to add popular games like Bethesda’s Fallout series to Xbox Game Pass. It will likely do the same with ATVI titles like Call of Duty. Doing so increases subscription revenue. Microsoft could also choose to make new titles Xbox-exclusives. Both strategies help to boost the case for gamers to buy an Xbox instead of a PlayStation. MSFT is playing the long game here.
Microsoft also sees the purchase of Activision Blizzard as a key component to the metaverse. ATVI games like World of Warcraft have huge communities of online players who interact in what is arguably a metaverse platform. Gaming and the metaverse are both long-term growth opportunities for Microsoft and for MSFT stock.
Don’t Forget Hardware
Let’s not overlook Microsoft’s Surface hardware. MSFT’s slowest growing division, Surface hardware still managed 8% YoY revenue growth for the quarter.
Microsoft has been dabbling with using its own custom-designed chips in several Surface devices. Doing so offers big advantages in feature optimization — something that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has done to great effect with its M1 series MacBooks. Microsoft is rumored to be looking at ditching Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in favor of custom chips for its next generation of Surface devices.
Doing so would give Surface laptops a distinct advantage over other Windows PCs. Combined with a global PC market that has shifted into growth mode over the past two years, such a move could let Microsoft boost that Surface revenue performance. 
Bottom Line on MSFT Stock 
MSFT stock currently earns a “B” grade in Portfolio Grader. It’s a pretty solid pick for investors who are focused on long-term growth stocks — as the company’s latest earnings showed. Among the analysts polled by the Wall Street Journal, the optimism for MSFT is near-universal. Three of 44 analysts current have MSFT stock rated as a “hold” versus 35 “buy” and six “overweight.” Their average 12-month price target is $369.58, offering nearly 25% upside. 
If you already have Microsoft shares in your portfolio, hold onto them. If you are looking to add MSFT stock, there’s no time like the present.

2022-01-31 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Popped 3.5% Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-popped-3.5-today,,,"What happened
Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) jumped out of the gate Monday and were up 3.5% as of 9:55 a.m. ET.
The popular semiconductor stock appears to be responding to a positive prognosis for the global semiconductor industry published by the research firm Gartner. As Livemint.com reported this morning, preliminary results from Gartner show that ""worldwide semiconductor revenue increased 25.1% in 2021 to total $583.5 billion, crossing the $500 billion threshold for the first time.""
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Gartner noted that the rising price of semiconductors comes primarily from two factors -- one positive and one negative for chipmakers' stocks.
On the plus side, there's the ongoing global semiconductor shortage that could last into 2024, and that's causing prices to rise as demand grows in the absence of adequate supply. On the minus side, though, Gartner notes that price increases for logistics and raw materials are raising semiconductor companies' cost of doing business, and that they're passing these costs along to their customers.
As both these trends run their course, Gartner projects that global chip sales will grow another 9% to $636 billion this year, then grow to $692.5 billion by 2025, and eventually top $1 trillion in 2030. According to The Wall Street Journal, Samsung Electronics agrees with this prognosis that ""the good times would continue,"" as does Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), where CEO Pat Gelsinger says ""2022 will only be better"" than 2021.
Now what
Gartner noted that Samsung Electronics is now the No. 1 semiconductor company in terms of revenue, followed by Intel.
With a market capitalization higher than either of those two companies (Nvidia is nearly three times the size of Intel in terms of market cap ), you might think that Nvidia would be at least No. 3 in this revenue race, but that's not so. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Nvidia's $24.3 billion in trailing-12-month revenue is less than a third of the $79 billion that Intel raked in last year.
This disconnect between sales strength and stock valuation suggests Nvidia stock could be vulnerable to a downfall if -- as the Journal points out has happened in the past -- ""customers sometimes overorder and then pause buying, leading to an oversupply of chips,"" causing prices to crash. If that happens, Intel stock at 10 times earnings will look like a much safer bet than Nvidia stock at 70 times earnings.

2022-01-31 00:00:00+00:00,A Monster Metaverse Stock to Buy Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-monster-metaverse-stock-to-buy-right-now,,,"The metaverse is one of the hottest trends in technology right now, and it has Wall Street excited -- which isn't surprising, as major tech names such as Meta Platforms, Nvidia, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Microsoft, and many others are invested in this concept.
Goldman Sachs analysts say they think that the metaverse is the next paradigm shift in the way people use the internet. The investment bank forecasts that this technology could see investments between $135 billion and $1.35 trillion over the next three years. As a result, there are several investment opportunities for investors looking to benefit from the growth of the metaverse.
ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) could be one of the biggest winners of the metaverse. Let's see why.
Image source: Getty Images.
The metaverse will be powered by advanced chips
Firing up the metaverse will require a lot of semiconductors. Be it gaming consoles, smartphones, virtual reality devices, computers, or data centers, every metaverse component will rely on chips to function efficiently. Intel executive Raja Koduri, for instance, points out that powering the metaverse would require a ""1,000-times increase in computational efficiency.""
Meanwhile, analysts at financial services firm Morningstar say that the metaverse will require a lot of chips made using advanced processing nodes. That's because many of the metaverse tasks will require real-time processing of large amounts of data that will have to be delivered to users at scale. The firm adds that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (TSMC), Intel, and Samsung are the three foundries that can produce these chips.
All three semiconductor foundries mentioned above rely on ASML's machines to produce chips, and they seem to be placing more and more orders from the Dutch chip-making giant. That's because ASML is the only company that makes the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines that are used to make chips based on advanced process nodes.
Not surprisingly, chipmakers are in a race to place orders for advanced ASML machinery that will help them make smaller, more powerful, and power-efficient chips. Intel recently placed an order for an ASML prototype machine that's not even in commercial production and is likely to cost upwards of $300 million for a single unit. ASML says that it has already scored five orders for its next-generation machine, and Intel has gone a step ahead by placing an order for a product that's still in the design phase.
TSMC, on the other hand, has ramped up its 2022 capital spending forecast to a range of $40 billion to $44 billion -- a 40% increase over 2021's outlay of $30 billion at the midpoint. The semiconductor giant is expected to spend 70% to 80% of its 2022 capex on building advanced process nodes that will help it manufacture 3-nanometer (nm) and 2nm chips.
ASML is benefiting big time from the aggressive spending by semiconductor foundries already.
ASML is built for terrific growth
ASML's order book has been expanding at a terrific pace. The company released its results for the fourth quarter of 2021 on Jan. 19, and it revealed that it was sitting on 26.2 billion euros worth of net bookings at the end of the year -- a huge jump over 11.3 billion euros worth of bookings it had at the end of the year-ago period.
It is worth noting that ASML's net bookings, which represent ""all system sales orders for which written authorizations have been accepted,"" are significantly higher than the company's 2021 revenue of 18.6 billion euros. So it wouldn't be surprising to see ASML's revenue grow at a faster pace in 2022 compared to its guidance of 20% growth, which would put its annual revenue at 22.3 billion euros.
Analysts have raised ASML's revenue growth forecast given its robust pipeline and the expected growth in chip demand, which will encourage its clients to buy more of its machines.

What's more, the company's earnings are expected to increase at an annual rate of 30% for the next five years. So investors looking to buy a growth stock to take advantage of the metaverse should take a closer look at ASML Holding, as it would play a key role in powering this hot tech trend. And with the stock down 19% in 2022 and trading at 40 times trailing earnings compared to last year's average earnings multiple of 53, now may be a good time to buy this potential metaverse winner.

2022-01-31 00:00:00+00:00,China Approves the AMD and Xilinx Merger -- What Investors Need to Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/china-approves-the-amd-and-xilinx-merger-what-investors-need-to-know,,,"Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) planned acquisition of Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX), originally announced back in October 2020, is finally getting the green light from the last regulatory agency (approval was already granted in the U.S. and Europe). China's State Administration for Market Regulation gave the go-ahead late last week, paving the way for the two companies to merge, which the two semiconductor designers said should be complete by the end of March 2022.
China's regulatory division basically stipulated AMD could proceed on the condition that AMD and Xilinx chips will continue to be made available to China as they have been in the past. In other words, AMD can't require that a Xilinx hardware purchase be bundled with AMD hardware or vice versa.

This merger is a big deal for AMD, and not just in terms of size (Xilinx currently has an enterprise value of nearly $41 billion as of this writing, compared to AMD's nearly $121 billion enterprise value). Once the acquisition is complete, AMD will enter brand new markets and open up a new front against longtime rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Here's what shareholders of both AMD and Xilinx need to know.
What happens if you own Xilinx stock?
Here's the skinny if you own Xilinx. You are going to become an AMD shareholder unless you sell before the merger happens. According to the original announcement in October 2020, each share of Xilinx will convert to 1.7234 shares of AMD.
Additionally, Xilinx said on its last earnings release that shareholders of record on Feb. 7 will receive a dividend of $0.37 per share, payable on Feb. 14. This is conditional on the merger not being finished by then (if it is, no dice -- but I don't think everything will be finalized that quickly). This dividend represents a partial return of excess cash to shareholders and will be a roughly $93 million payout based on the last reported share count.
What happens if you own AMD stock?
If you own AMD -- or you plan on owning AMD by holding your Xilinx position and allowing it to convert to AMD stock -- here's what you're getting: the pioneer and leader in FPGA chips (field-programmable gate arrays). Xilinx's hardware designs are a new frontier for AMD, and will launch AMD into end markets where it has little to no presence right now, places like aerospace and defense, automotive, and wired and wireless network infrastructure. Xilinx also has a fast-growing data center business (11% of Xilinx's revenue last quarter, with sales growing a sizzling 81% year over year), which will be highly complementary to AMD's own CPU and GPU data center segment.
Xilinx's chips compete with Intel's PSG (programmable solutions group), which Intel created through the acquisition of a couple of other FPGA companies in recent years. For reference, Intel PSG hauled in $1.9 billion in sales in 2021, up 4% from 2020. Xilinx's last 12-month revenue was nearly $3.7 billion, an increase of 20%. With Intel doubling down on manufacturing right now, AMD could move in further on the chip design front here.
Besides adding in Xilinx's sales, AMD is also getting a highly profitable business. Xilinx's free cash flow margin was 29% over the last year, compared to just 20% for AMD (not including AMD's upcoming Q4 earnings report on Tuesday, Feb. 1). Xilinx also comes into this mega-merger with $2.2 billion in cash and short-term investments net of long-term debt -- complementary to AMD's own $3.3 billion in net cash and short-term investments.
One other important metric is that Xilinx spent just over $1 billion in research and development in the last year. That works out to about 28% of revenue, far higher than AMD's own 14.9% spent on R&D in the trailing 12 months. AMD had said in October 2020 that it foresaw saving $300 million in expenses within 18 months of the merger by combining forces with Xilinx. Perhaps some of that will come from extra efficiency in this research department, but management said most of the savings will come via the cost of goods sold. In other words, AMD and Xilinx will remain highly profitable together without sacrificing on innovation in semiconductor designs.
I liked AMD and Xilinx as stand-alone businesses (full disclosure, I own shares of both), but I like them even more as a team. With China giving the two companies the nod of approval to join forces, we'll get to see soon enough how they chart a course going forward to win over new business in the semiconductor industry.

Jan 31 (Reuters) - Tech stocks led a rebound in European shares on Monday, even as worries lingered over policy tightening, soaring inflation and geopolitical tensions ahead of key UK and European central bank decisions due later this week.
The pan-European STOXX 600 .STOXX climbed 1.1%, rebounding from their worst week in more than two months, with tech stocks .SX8P up 2.9% after losing 13% this month.
Concerns over gas supplies to western Europe persisted as Britain warned it was ""highly likely"" that Russia was looking to invade Ukraine and the head of NATO said the continent needed to diversify its energy supplies.
""Investors will continue to grapple with higher rate expectations and geopolitical risks on one side, set against robust macroeconomic and corporate fundamentals on the other - as a result, volatile trading looks set to continue,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
However, ""the sharp fall in many high-quality tech firms is already creating opportunities for longer-term investors to add exposure,"" Haefele said.
The STOXX 600 was set to end January about 3.5% lower, raising questions about the longer-term outlook for equities in 2022 as fourth-quarter earnings, the West-Russia standoff over Ukraine, and potentially tighter monetary policies weigh on markets.
Focus is now on the European Central Bank and the Bank of England meetings on Thursday, which are expected to offer clues to their policy paths after the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish tone last week led to wild gyrations across markets.
No immediate policy action is expected since the ECB in December laid out plans to wind up its 1.85 trillion euro ($2.09 trillion) pandemic stimulus scheme by end-March, but price pressures remain strong and markets want a sense of whether the ECB is getting closer to a more hawkish stance.
Meanwhile, markets expect a 50 basis-point rate increase from the Bank of England, its second hike in a row. BOEWATCH.L
Vodafone VOD.L gained 4.2% after saying it would work with Intel INTC.O and other silicon vendors on designing its own chip architecture to drive innovation and efficiency in nascent OpenRAN network technology.
KPN KPN.AS, the largest telecom provider in the Netherlands, added 1.7% after announcing a new share buyback programme and a higher dividend over 2022, as its core profit rose on the back of growing mobile revenues.
Italian energy services group Saipem SPMI.MI plunged 27.2% after issuing a profit warning and withdrawing an outlook given in October, citing a deterioration in margins due to the pandemic and higher raw material costs.
