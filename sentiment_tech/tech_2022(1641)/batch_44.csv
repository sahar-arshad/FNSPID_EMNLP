2022-03-09 00:00:00+00:00,Is IBM Still a Great Dividend Stock?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-ibm-still-a-great-dividend-stock,,,"Many investors have found it hard to love IBM (NYSE: IBM) in recent years. The stock has fallen more than 32% over the last 10 years, depriving shareholders of a 216% gain in the S&P 500 market index over the same period. In the same period, IBM's annual dividend payout has nearly doubled while the effective yield more than tripled.
Is IBM still a great dividend stock after all these years of disappointing top-line sales and stock returns? Let's have a look.
What does IBM do nowadays?
The technology giant used to be a universally admired and often copied one-stop-shop for every computing need a business might face. Shedding low-margin operations along the way, Big Blue has refocused on high-growth ideas for the long haul such as cloud computing, data security, artificial intelligence, and blockchain networks.
The shift was effectively completed last November when the company spun off its managed infrastructure services into a new company called Kyndryl. Kyndryl shares have fallen 60% since the split while IBM's stock traded modestly higher. I always thought Kyndryl would be a less interesting investment than IBM, because it consists of some of the least profitable business lines in Big Blue's former portfolio. It looks like market makers agree with my analysis so far:

OK, so what's up with the dividend?
IBM's dividend has increased every year without interruption since 1996. The payout boosts haven't always been impressive, with a slow ramp-up in the first decade and a brake-pumping slowdown during the coronavirus pandemic. But when you put it all together, you'll see a 2,520% total increase. The quarterly payout soared from a split-adjusted $0.0625 per share in 1995 to $1.64 per share today:

We already talked about IBM's unimpressive stock performance over the last decade. Pair that trend with relentless payout boosts, and you get a soaring dividend yield:
IBM Dividend Yield data by YCharts
Thanks to this robust dividend policy, Big Blue holds a special place in the market. With an annual yield of 5.2%, IBM is the eighth most generous dividend payer in the S&P 500 index. The rest of the top-ten list consists of the usual suspects, ranging from tobacco brands and telecom stocks to real estate giants and oil producers.
But that's not all. You won't find another pure-play technology company on that list until you see semiconductor titan Intel in spot number 84, sporting a yield of 3.1%. The combination of stellar, dependable payouts and the growth opportunities of a laser-focused technology company sets IBM apart from the rest.

Remember the sagging stock chart you saw earlier? If you reinvested your dividends in more IBM stock along the way, the dividend payouts balanced out the lower share prices over the last decade. That's the orange line in the chart below, while the purple line shows the sadder returns you'd get if you didn't put the dividends to work:

What it all comes down to
Yes, IBM is still a great dividend stock. And even if it wasn't, I wouldn't mind buying IBM shares at the affordable valuation ratio of 12 times forward earnings just because I expect impressive stock returns over the next couple of decades. You're getting the best of both worlds here, and at a very reasonable price.

2022-03-09 00:00:00+00:00,These 2 Nasdaq Stocks Could Carry Your Portfolio for Years,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-2-nasdaq-stocks-could-carry-your-portfolio-for-years-1,,,"Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) are two stocks listed on the Nasdaq that have pulled back substantially this year on account of several factors, such as potential interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve, the crisis in Europe, and surging inflation.
However, the pullback in their stock prices is an opportunity for investors to add long-term winners to their portfolios. That's because the products and solutions that Microsoft and ASML provide are going to remain in robust demand for years to come, enabling both companies to clock impressive revenue and earnings growth.
Let's look at the reasons these Nasdaq stocks are built for long-term upside.
1. Microsoft
Microsoft has come a long way from being a purveyor of operating systems that power millions of computers around the globe. The tech giant now has interests in several fast-growing areas ranging from cloud computing and video gaming to customer relationship management and social networking.
The multiple growth drivers that Microsoft now enjoys have led to impressive growth in the company's top and bottom lines over the past five years, culminating in solid upside on the stock market.
MSFT data by YCharts
In the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as well, for the three months that ended on Dec. 31, Microsoft's revenue increased 20% year over year to $51.7 billion, and adjusted earnings increased 22% to $2.48 per share. Analysts expect Microsoft's revenue to increase 18% this fiscal year to $199 billion, while earnings are expected to jump 16% to $9.35 per share.
It won't be surprising to see Microsoft sustain such growth in the long run, or even grow at a higher pace given the moves the company has made of late or the markets it's operating in. The cloud computing market, for instance, is going to be a major catalyst for Microsoft in the coming years thanks to the secular growth opportunity it offers and the company's solid market share.
The cloud business produced 35% of Microsoft's top line in the previous quarter, with revenue growing 25% year over year to $18.3 billion. Synergy Research Group estimates that Microsoft's Azure cloud service controlled 21% of the $180 billion cloud computing market at the end of 2021. Market leader Amazon was the top cloud infrastructure service provider last year, with a 33% market share.
However, Microsoft has been gaining ground in the cloud computing market at an impressive pace over the years. The company had a 10% share of this market at the beginning of 2017, while Amazon's share of the cloud computing market has ranged between 32% and 34% during the same period. Microsoft's gains in the cloud computing space bode well for its future, as the global cloud computing market is expected to exceed $1.5 trillion in revenue by 2030, according to third-party estimates.

The cloud business, however, is just one of the many megatrends Microsoft is on track to take advantage of. The metaverse, for example, is going to unlock another big opportunity for the company. After all, the metaverse is expected to create a $1 trillion annual revenue opportunity for its participants in the long run, according to J.P. Morgan.
Microsoft is already making moves to take advantage of the metaverse. The company's Mesh for Teams offering allows remote employees to collaborate within the metaverse, paving the way for stronger growth in Microsoft Teams userbase that currently stands at 250 million. Videogaming is another way Microsoft can benefit from the metaverse, given its recent moves.
The company announced in January that it will be spending $68.7 billion to acquire Activision Blizzard in a move that's not just expected to accelerate the growth of its gaming business but also help it build the metaverse. The acquisition will bolster Microsoft's videogaming business that generated just over $15 billion in revenue in fiscal 2021. The company also now has a stronger library of games to offer, which should allow it to sell more of its Xbox consoles and attract more members to the Xbox Game Pass videogame subscription service.
With videogaming expected to become a $314 billion market by 2027 thanks to catalysts such as the metaverse, Microsoft can benefit from several multibillion-dollar markets in the long run.
Finally, Microsoft is trading at 30 times trailing earnings right now, which is a discount to its five-year average earnings multiple of 37. So investors are getting a good deal on this beaten-down Nasdaq stock right now.
2. ASML Holding
The global chip shortage shows no signs of easing, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine is expected to cripple the semiconductor supply chain further by limiting the availability of key raw materials. As a result, chipmakers that haven't been able to make enough chips will be further constrained to meet the end-market demand. This situation could trigger an increase in investments in new manufacturing capacity, which in turn would bode well for ASML Holding.
ASML is a Dutch company that manufactures photolithography systems, which semiconductor foundries use to make chips. ASML is the leading supplier of photolithography machines, as it controls over 60% of this market. Meanwhile, ASML is the only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines that the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor, Samsung, and Intel use to make advanced chips.
As a result, ASML is in a nice position to take advantage of the world's booming demand for chips. The EUV market, for instance, is reportedly clocking an annual growth rate of 25%, says TechNavio, and it could hit $19 billion in revenue by 2026. EUV machines accounted for 46% of ASML's 2021 revenue of $18.6 billion, which would translate into just over $8.5 billion in EUV sales. So the EUV business could more than double in revenue in the next five years, given ASML's hold over this space.
Not surprisingly, ASML expects its annual revenue to hit a range of 24 billion to 30 billion euros by 2025. That would translate into 45% revenue growth over 2021's top line of 18.6 billion euros over a four-year period.
What's more, ASML expects to clock annual revenue growth of 11% through 2030 as its customers ramp up investments in semiconductor manufacturing capacity to meet the growing demand for chips. Annual semiconductor revenue is expected to hit $1 trillion by 2030, compared with $425 billion in 2020, which explains ASML's robust long-term forecast.
Analysts also expect impressive growth in the company's earnings, with its bottom line expected to grow at an annual pace of nearly 30% for the next five years. All of this makes ASML Holding an enticing tech stock to buy following its 25% pullback in 2022, which has brought its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio down to 37 , from last year's average earnings multiple of 53.

2022-03-08 00:00:00+00:00,Could This Be a Game Changer for Intel?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/could-this-be-a-game-changer-for-intel,,,"Today's video focuses on Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), an update on its agreement to acquire Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ: TSEM), and how Tower can benefit Intel in its plan to be a leading chip manufacturer. Here are some highlights from the video.
Tower Semiconductor is a leading foundry for analog semiconductor solutions. Intel has entered a definitive agreement to acquire Tower Semiconductor at $54 per share. It's expected to be an all-cash deal funded by Intel's balance sheet and should close in approximately 12 months.
Intel will gain additional foundries, as Tower Semiconductor currently operates seven foundries globally -- two in Israel, two in the USA, and three in Japan. Intel will also add new technology and engineers and potentially new customers.
The acquisition makes perfect sense for Intel's current plan to become a leading semiconductor manufacturer. Intel has recently invested in numerous new foundries in the USA and Europe.

The answer: It all depends on your investing style.

Jose Najarro: ""Both TSM and Intel Corporation are making big expansion bets. Does anybody have a preference over the other?"" Will, I think you definitely have a preference over the other. I'll pass it over to you first.
Will Healy: In this case, I like Intel better. This is basically a valuation call because TSM has a valuation I think it was 30 the last time I checked it. While I said that Taiwan will not likely get invaded, there's still a possibility. I think it deserves a little bit of a discount for that reason. Whereas with Intel it is speculative, at 10 times earnings I think it's undervalued. I don't know how far they'll succeed. I don't know if I'll make that goal of catching up to TSMC in the next few years. But I think they could make some progress in it, and I think that progress will take the valuation a little bit higher over time.
Billy Duberstein: Well, do you want to go with the established leader whose dominating today? Or do you want to buy the much cheaper stock is trading about a third of the valuation, but they're going to spend tens of billions of dollars over the next few years to build up a new business that they haven't been in before. It depends on how much risk you want to take. Intel's a bit risky, I got to say, it could pay off, but you have to have faith in Pat Gelsinger and what he is doing. The stock is cheap and you're going to get that dividend, but they're going to spend all of their free cash flow building massive new fabs over the next few years. If I had to bet, I would guess it would probably work and it would probably be pretty successful, but it's going to be a more capital-intensive business than their traditional business, which was dominant in processors. I think they are doing this because their core chip business is under pressure, it's not going to go away, but obviously, AMD and all the competitors are catching up and leaping ahead and then you have the big, really huge companies like Microsoft and Amazon are designing their own chips, so it's a tricky road, but the stock is very cheap, so it depends on how much risk you want to take.
Najarro: Agree, and Billy, I think you mentioned a great point that both investments, in theory, could be good, it all depends on whatever type of risk you want to take. Hey, I feel more comfortable holding the leader right now, so I'd rather go with TSM, maybe I might pay a little bit of a premium for it, but that's my tolerance. Or maybe I enjoy that, ""Hey, Intel right now is into the chip process market, and now they have the optionality of maybe growing this manufacturing business as well, so I would rather put a little bit more risk for that kind of company."" For me, something like that, if I had to pick between both, I wouldn't, I would just pick both. Just for those same reasons. Maybe some part of me wants to hold the leader, but at the same time, I also wouldn't mind holding one that could potentially enter that market, so I cheated with that question there.

Chicago, IL – March 8, 2022 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT and Intel INTC.
Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:
More Big Tech Companies Exit Russia on U.S. Sanctions
Over the past week, several big tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft and Intel, announced exiting the Russian market. Their move is in the wake of the U.S. government’s Mar 24 announcement of cutting off the direct technological export to Russia as part of a series of economic and financial sanctions imposed on the country for initiating a military attack on Ukraine.
Ukraine, which was part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, got independence in 1991. However, its continuously growing ties with Western Europe and the United States have not been going well with Russia. After months of growing tensions and military buildup across the border, Kremlin forces invaded Ukraine on Feb 21.
The ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia has resulted in market turmoil. The Dow Jones, the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 indexes have declined 1.4%, 1.7% and 0.5%, respectively, in the past two weeks
This unprovoked and unwarranted attack on Ukraine has led to extreme criticism worldwide against Russia. Though the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union have restrained themselves from taking any military actions, they have imposed economic and financial sanctions on Russia so that the Kremlin pays a hefty price for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine.
U.S.-based tech companies have also expressed support for Ukraine and have stopped selling products as well as abandoned their ongoing and future projects in Russia. The iPhone and MacBook maker, Apple, was among the early tech companies that announced ceasing their operations in the country.
On Mar 1, AAPL announced that it will suspend its product sales in Russia. The company also said that it is halting all online transactions and exports to its partners in Russia. This also includes limiting Apple Pay transactions in the country. The stock is down 2.5% in the past two weeks.
On Mar 3, the world’s leading chip maker, Intel, announced that it condemns Russian troops’ invasion of Ukraine and has suspended all shipments to customers in Russia and Belarus. The company stated that it will continue to support all its employees, who have close ties in the region during this difficult situation.
The company has launched an employee donation and matching campaign through its Intel Foundation. The foundation has already raised more than $1.2 million for relief efforts and is working across Poland, Germany and Romania to aid refugees. Shares of Intel have increased 6.7% in the last two weeks.
The maker of the Windows operating system, Microsoft, has also joined the chorus of U.S.-based tech companies that will temporarily stop business in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. The company, on Mar 4, announced suspending sales of its products and services in Russia, in compliance with the U.S., European Union and U.K. sanctions.
Additionally, Microsoft pledged to beef up its cybersecurity in Ukraine and work proactively to help government officials in the country to defend against Russian attacks. The company is also working with the International Committee of the Red Cross and multiple UN agencies to provide technological and financial support to refugees. MSFT stock has gained 0.7% over the past two weeks.
While Apple currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Intel and Microsoft each carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

2022-03-08 00:00:00+00:00,3 Things About Lucid Group That Smart Investors Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-things-about-lucid-group-that-smart-investors-know,,,"Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) has been a divisive stock since its public debut last July. The bulls will point out that the electric vehicle (EV) maker is led by Peter Rawlinson, a former Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) engineer who worked on the Model S, and that its debut vehicle, the Lucid Air, can travel much farther on a single charge than Tesla's Model S Long Range. Lucid also believes it can eventually ship half a million vehicles annually by 2030.
The bears will note that Lucid recently recalled most of its delivered vehicles over a suspension issue, broadly missed analysts' sales expectations in its fourth quarter, slashed its full-year shipment forecast for 2022 by 30% to 40%, and postponed the upcoming launch of its Gravity SUV. Its losses are still widening, its debt levels are climbing, and the stock definitely isn't cheap at more than 20 times its projected sales for the current year.
Image source: Lucid.
These issues have been discussed before, and I believe Lucid's bears will likely outnumber its bulls in the near term in this challenging market. But today, I'll focus on three lesser-known facts about Lucid -- and how they might differentiate it from Tesla and other higher-end EV makers.
1. A ""post-luxury"" brand
The Lucid Air starts at $77,400, while its higher-end Grand Touring and Dream Air models start at $139,000 and $169,000, respectively. Tesla's Model S starts at $89,900, and a fully loaded Plaid S model costs about $150,000. Tesla also sells the cheaper Model 3, which starts at $39,940.
Lucid's prices are somewhat comparable to Tesla's, but it claims that it targets a higher-end ""post-luxury"" market.
During an investor presentation last February, Lucid said BMW, Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen's Audi were ""established luxury"" brands. It called BMW a ""sport luxury"" brand, Audi a ""tech luxury"" brand, and Mercedes-Benz a ""classic luxury"" brand. But then it said Tesla was ""innovative but not luxury"" -- a surprising statement since Kelley Blue Book (and many consumers) still consistently classify Tesla as a luxury brand.
Lucid claims this ""post-luxury"" niche, which it plans to carve out with its vehicles, will be defined by ""increased expectations"" from consumers. That's a vague statement, but it suggests that Lucid will continue to prioritize six-figure vehicles as Tesla launches more lower-end vehicles like the Model 3.
2. It goes all-in on Alexa
Lucid natively integrates Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) voice assistant Alexa into its in-vehicle lighting, climate control, entertainment, and navigation systems. It can even remotely access smart home devices.
Tesla also supports voice-activated commands, but they run on its own proprietary Linux-based operating system. Some developers have created unofficial Alexa apps for Tesla's vehicles, but they require paid subscriptions and aren't as smoothly integrated as Lucid's built-in Alexa services.
A growing number of automakers, including Ford, BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz, have also integrated Alexa into their newer vehicles. By tethering itself to that broader ecosystem, Lucid might become a more appealing choice than Tesla for Alexa users.
3. It's likely using Mobileye's chips
In 2016, Lucid partnered with the Israeli chipmaker Mobileye -- the world's leading maker of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and computer vision chips -- to develop its autonomous driving platform.
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) acquired Mobileye the following year, but neither Intel nor Lucid have provided any updates regarding that partnership since then. However, Mobileye's chips, which account for 70% of the ADAS market, probably still power Lucid's DreamDrive semi-autonomous driving platform along with components and services from Continental, Bosch, Here, and other companies.
Intel plans to spin off Mobileye again in an IPO later this year, so we might hear a lot more about its work with Lucid and other automakers once it starts disclosing its numbers separately again.
Mobileye also previously supplied ADAS chips to Tesla, but it discontinued that partnership in 2016 after expressing safety concerns regarding Tesla's usage of its chips for its Autopilot feature. Therefore, sticking with Mobileye might enable Lucid to launch safer autonomous vehicles in the near future.
It's still a speculative stock
Lucid has stirred up a lot of excitement among investors and auto enthusiasts, but it remains a highly speculative investment. It's only delivered 300 vehicles between last October and the end of this February, and it will face a lot of supply chain challenges as it tries to achieve its reduced forecast for 12,000 to 14,000 deliveries this year.
It's making some smart moves by aiming higher than Tesla, tethering itself to Alexa, and (probably) using Mobileye's industry-leading chips, but those decisions probably won't resolve its biggest challenge -- scaling up its operations to meet its rising reservations -- anytime soon.

2022-03-06 00:00:00+00:00,Worried About the Market Correction? 2 Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/worried-about-the-market-correction-2-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-forever,,,"The U.S. equity market has become highly volatile in the past few weeks, as investors have been increasingly worried about the rising interest rates and skyrocketing crude oil prices amid escalating geopolitical tensions due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a 30-day forward estimate of market volatility, is 30.74 (as of March 2). Values above 30 are generally associated with increased market uncertainty and rising investor fears.
^VIX data by YCharts
Many growth stocks, once considered safe havens, have taken a severe beating in this uncertain environment. While the correction has been justified for several speculative plays, many high-quality gems have also gotten unduly battered. The pullbacks in these stocks are mostly temporary, presenting an attractive buying opportunity for long-term investors.
For investors worried about a steep market correction, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) can prove to be smart buys in the long run. Here's why.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Advanced Micro Devices
AMD has successfully positioned itself as one of the ""must-have"" stocks in any serious long-term tech investor's portfolio, thanks to its now-dominant position in the semiconductor industry (CPUs, and now it's making its presence felt in GPUs). According to Mercury Research, the company recorded a 25.6% share of the x86 CPU market in the fourth quarter (ending Dec. 31, 2021), its highest ever despite ongoing semiconductor supply shortages.
AMD has been making rapid gains in the high-margin server CPU market, thanks to the robust adoption of EPYC server processors across the cloud, high-performance computing (HPC), and enterprise customers in the data center segment. The company accounted for 10.7% of the global server CPU market at the end of the fourth quarter, a year-over-year improvement of 3.6 percentage points. Intel's server CPU share dropped by the same percentage points to 89.3% in the same time frame.
The pace of AMD's market share growth may accelerate even more after the scheduled launch of its fourth-generation EPYC processors (Genoa) in late 2022. The recently completed $35 billion acquisition of Xilinx is expected to strengthen the combined company's position in HPC and add new opportunities in industries such as data center, automotive, and communications.
On the client side, AMD's Ryzen 5000 processors have been witnessing solid demand from the gaming community, especially in higher-end desktops and notebooks. The company is also well positioned to benefit from the ongoing gaming console upgrade cycle, since it is a major supplier of semi-custom chips for Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation consoles.
AMD's revenues have grown annually at a compounded average growth rate (CAGR) of over 36%, from $6.5 billion in 2018 to $16.4 billion in 2021. Operating margins have also expanded from 6.97% to 22.2% in the same time frame. The company is profitable, free cash flow positive, and had $3.6 billion cash on its balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2021.
Given the many secular tailwinds driving demand for AMD's products and its solid financial position, the stock seems well poised for a robust growth trajectory in the coming years.
2. Shopify
Shopify has suffered a significant share price decline in the recent tech sell-off. The company's fourth-quarter results (ending Dec. 31, 2021), although not horrible, have certainly failed to impress investors. While the company reported an adjusted net income of $2.91 billion in fiscal 2021, it was mostly attributed to an unrealized gain on equity investments. This also seems to have hit the investors in the wrong way.
Despite these shortcomings, this e-commerce company, which offers tools to mom-and-pop retailers to set up their online presence, is on the right side of the ongoing global digitization trend. The company accounted for a 10.3% share of the U.S. retail e-commerce sales (based on gross merchandise value or GMV) as of October 2021, second only to Amazon's 41% share and ahead of Walmart's 6.6% share.
However, Shopify is more of a technology company than an e-commerce player. The company earns its revenues by selling customized solutions and monthly subscriptions to merchants. Shopify's growth is aligned with those of the merchants using its tools. It is difficult for merchants to shift to alternate platforms, resulting in a sticky customer base for Shopify.
Shopify is well poised to benefit from the flywheel effect in coming years, since an increasing number of merchants on its platform translates into higher GMV, which again, attracts even more merchants. The company has also been successful in cross-selling its newer products to existing customers. In the fourth quarter, Shopify payments were used to process 51% of the total GMV, a jump from 46% GMV penetration in the fourth quarter of the previous year. Cash advances and loans to merchants (Shopify Capital) were also up 43% year over year to $323.7 million in the fourth quarter.
In fiscal 2021, Shopify's revenues soared by 57% year over year to $4.6 billion. The company is guiding for a lower fiscal 2022 revenue growth guidance as compared to the growth rate seen in the previous year (although it has not given actual numbers). This is attributed to headwinds such as the absence of COVID-triggered e-commerce acceleration as seen in the first half of fiscal 2021, changing revenue-sharing terms with third-party developers, and the time it will take to see the impact of new marketing initiatives.
But none of these challenges negatively affect the long-term growth story of Shopify. Against this backdrop, I believe this may be an opportune time to pick this fundamentally strong stock as a long-term investment.

2022-03-06 00:00:00+00:00,Will Intel's Latest $5.4 Billion Acquisition Go Through?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-intels-latest-%245.4-billion-acquisition-go-through,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) says that its acquisition of Tower Semiconductor will create a globally diverse end-to-end foundry that will help it meet growing semiconductor demand. In this Fool Live segment from ""Semiconductor Revolution,"" recorded on Feb. 17, Motley Fool contributors Danny Vena, Jose Najarro, and Nicholas Rossolillo discuss the risks that regulators could block this move.
{% sfr %}
Danny Vena: One of the things that came up for Foolish investors earlier this week was that we saw a company called Tower Semiconductor. Its stock exploded higher during the week. The reasons that that happened was that first there were reports overnight, primarily in publications like The Wall Street Journal that said that Intel was looking to acquire Tower Semiconductor. Then we found out first thing in the morning on the 15th, so day before yesterday, on Tuesday, that Intel had actually agreed to acquire the company. Just a couple of the highlights.
This is a company that creates specialized chips. These are processors that are used in a variety of things, things like automotive and consumer products, but also in industrial equipment and medical equipment. It includes a variety of different types of chips, including image sensors, power management chips, and other things. This is a big deal. Tower Semiconductor shareholders are going to receive about $53 in cash for any stock that they hold. It looks like that this is going to be a deal that is going to cost Intel about $5.4 billion. But the company said that this will create a globally diverse end-to-end foundry that will help it meet growing semiconductor demand. That's a big acquisition, certainly not as big as Mobileye was a few years ago. But certainly not the change that you find in the couch.
Jose Najarro: But, Danny, when I first heard about this, the first thing that came in my mind is will this deal get stuck? I know we've seen a lot of semiconductor industry sales, the most popular one was the Arm acquisition that just got terminated. It's been a pretty crazy market for acquisitions. Any thoughts on that, Danny? Would you be worried if this deal doesn't go through or do you see any reasons for this not to go through?
Danny Vena: To be honest, I'm of two minds of this. First of all, we know that the Biden administration has signaled on technology in general, that it's really leaning away from approving a lot of these big mergers, big acquisitions in the technology industry. Many of us suspected from early that Nvidia was going to run into trouble not just here in the United States but across the globe, in the UK, in China, that this was a deal that was going to be looked at very heavily. They're probably going to be very strict in how they apply the rules to this deal. Now, I don't think that this Tower Semiconductor deal is going to meet that type of regulatory scrutiny. But I do think that we should not make the mistake of thinking that just because they say they're doing this acquisition, it's a done deal. It by no means is a done deal. I would sit back and wait on this, honestly. I know there are some investors who like to go in and play the arbitrage game but this is by no means a done deal. We're going to have to wait and see, honestly. There's no way to know for sure that this deal is going to go through or not go through. What are your thoughts, Nick?
Jose Najarro: I was just going to say that, I think one thing that they have on them is the ability to say that this can help with national security, because, hey, we'll be able to have a new form of foundry, bring more chips here to the United States. That could be, I guess, some form of way they can talk around it if there's any pushback. But I do want to say this is the strength of being such a strong company. They're saying that they're going to pay for this in all cash from their balance sheet. I think that's the strength that comes with Intel, that they're a powerhouse machine cash flow operations, so they are able to make some of these acquisitions like this. Any thoughts, Nick?
Nicholas Rossolillo: Yes, I do think this is an interesting move because Tower's a chip fab, they manufacture chips, a lot of them sensors that are getting put in cars. Intel is simultaneously doing the partial spin-off of Mobileye, which designs those chips. Again, Intel's a serial acquirer. I don't think a year goes by where Intel doesn't acquire someone in the chip industry. You see more of that plan to integrate the design with the manufacturing together. Depending on whose desk this deal comes across, I'm with Danny. I could see, especially in Europe because Tower is an Israeli company. They have fabs in Israel, they have one in Italy, and a couple of here in the US. But in the interest of localization of manufacturing, I could see some regulators in Europe saying, ""Not so fast Intel."" But we'll have to see.

2022-03-06 00:00:00+00:00,This Manufacturing Company Is a Cash-Generating Machine,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-manufacturing-company-is-a-cash-generating-machine,,,"If you're worried about cyclicality or want some exposure to chip manufacturing, Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) may be a great stock to buy right now. In this Fool Live segment from ""Semiconductor Revolution,"" recorded on Feb. 17, Motley Fool contributors Nicholas Rossolillo and Danny Vena share why investors should consider this highly profitable company.
{% sfr %}
Nicholas Rossolillo: Yeah, Applied Materials. This is an interesting one because we think about the semiconductor industry, we've got several pieces of it. You have the design of the semiconductor. You have the actual manufacturing of it. But in-between, you have to have those companies that manufacture the equipment to manufacture semiconductors. So Applied Materials is measured by market cap. They're one of the biggest in the space. They make all sorts of machines and equipment to help chip fabs make semiconductors. Obviously, we can expect they're going to put up some pretty strong growth numbers right now because of the chip shortage. That's absolutely what we saw yesterday on their earnings update. Revenue up 21 percent from a year-ago. Adjusted earnings per share up 36 percent, almost double the free cash flow. That's my favorite go-to metric for profitability. This is just a cash-generating machine. The space has really consolidated down to just a few players like Lam Research is another one. Applied Materials gets mentioned alongside. A few weeks ago, I think we had touched on a company called Axcelis Technologies. They're very, very tiny, they only do like one thing. Applied Materials does lots of stuff. It's a really good proxy for the chip industry overall.
If you're worried about cyclicality or you want a little bit of exposure to chip manufacturing, like what Intel is trying to double-down on right now with the Tower acquisition that Danny talked about earlier, I like Applied Materials a lot more because you're going to get all that exposure in a company that is going to be less cyclical and is really, really highly profitable. Again, going back to that long-term outlook for a decade or more, the CEO on theearnings callyesterday said, ""Our outlook for the next decade is very positive. We expect semiconductor in wafer fab equipment to grow significantly faster than the economy with outsized opportunities for Applied Materials."" Just again going back to that long-term trend, there's going to be cycles along the way. But the chip industry is a long-term secular growth trend. Applied Materials is a great way to bet on the whole industry, I think, because you don't have to try to pick the winner, they supply all sorts of companies with equipment. So this is a cool company.
Jose Najarro: Danny, any thoughts on Applied? Is it a company you keep an eye out or follow?
Danny Vena: This is not a company that I have followed, but I certainly agree with the sentiment. This is kind of a picks and shovels play. While you're not necessarily investing in the fabricator themselves, you are investing in the supplier to the fabricator. I think that can certainly be a way to hedge your bets rather than having to buy a whole entire basket of semiconductor stocks. Maybe you buy something like Applied Materials where you get exposure to all of the companies that they supply to.

2022-03-06 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Nvidia vs. Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-nvidia-vs.-intel,,,"Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) have slipped in 2022 thanks to the broader stock market weakness caused by factors including a potential hike in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, surging inflation, and the ongoing crisis in Europe.
Chipmaker Nvidia has been the bigger loser of the two, with the stock down close to 18% this year. This is despite positive results in February, driven by strong demand for its graphics cards which have many uses including by personal computers, data centers, and workstations.
Meanwhile, Intel stock has been more resilient, losing 7% of its value compared to the NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector index's decline of 14% in 2022. The semiconductor giant, whose processors are used in computers, data centers, and even cars, held its ground amid mixed earnings results at the end of January.
But can Nvidia stock regain its mojo and grow in lockstep with its terrific growth? Or will Intel continue to hold an upper hand on account of its potential turnaround? Let's find out.
The case for Intel
Intel's cheap valuation has been a boon for investors in 2022. The stock is trading at 9.8 times trailing earnings and 2.5 times sales, which is lower than the five-year average earnings multiple of 13.8 and sales multiple of 3.2.
So, Intel stock is not overvalued as compared with other tech stocks. It is way cheaper than the NASDAQ-100's price-to-earnings ratio of 32. This explains why shares of Chipzilla haven't shed a lot of value amid the ongoing stock market correction that has led investors to shun richly valued tech companies.
Intel's cheap valuation and the fact that it sports a dividend yield of 3% seem to have played in the company's favor on the stock market. Intel raised its quarterly dividend by 5% in January this year. That may have attracted more investors toward Intel stock at a time when an increase in U.S. Treasury yields has made the latter more appealing from an investment perspective.
The valuation and the dividend, however, are not the only reasons why Intel has shown resilience this year. Chipzilla is gunning for a turnaround, and it recently revealed plans to accelerate growth in the long run. Intel expects its revenue to increase in the mid- to high-single digits in 2023 and 2024. By 2026, the company sees year-over-year growth increasing to a pace of 10% to 12%.
It won't be surprising to see Intel's revenue growth accelerate in the next few years as the company is looking to gain ground in the markets it dominates, while also entering new markets. Its 2021 launch of Alder Lake processors has allowed the company to gain share in the desktop processor market. According to Mercury Research, Intel controlled 83.8% of the desktop processor space at the end of 2021 as compared to 80.7% in the prior-year period.
Intel could keep grabbing mor market share as it upgrades its product lineup with the launch of the Raptor Lake chips this year that are expected to be 40% more powerful than the current processors. Meanwhile, the launch of the Meteor Lake processors in 2023, which will be based on a 7-nanometer manufacturing node, should help the chipmaker maintain its process advantage over rival AMD.
Intel also plans to ship 4 million discrete graphics cards this year, which would allow the company to cut its teeth in a new lucrative space that it expects to generate $10 billion in revenue by 2026 (compared to $1 billion this year.)
Intel is pulling the right strings to get its growth back on track, and that should translate to long-term growth. Intel has a lot going for it while the broader stock market is under pressure.
The case for Nvidia
Nvidia's rich valuation has led to a sharp decline in the company's stock price. Its stock is currently trading at 63 times trailing earnings and 23 times sales, which explains why investors have pressed the sell button despite solid growth in the company's revenue and earnings.
Image source: Getty Images.
However, the pace of Nvidia's growth justifies its rich valuation. The graphics specialist reported a 61% increase in revenue in fiscal 2022 to $26.9 billion, while adjusted net income shot up 79% over the prior year to $11.2 billion. This impressive pace of growth is here to stay as the gaming and data center businesses, which Nvidia dominates, have a lot of room for growth in the coming years.
At the same time, Nvidia is taking advantage of emerging tech trends such as the metaverse, which could unlock a massive growth opportunity for the chipmaker. Additionally, Nvidia's automotive business is set to step on the gas thanks to a solid pipeline of design wins and the growing adoption of its Drive platform.
Tata Motors Limited subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover has signed a multi-year partnership to use Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled Drive platform in its cars starting in 2025. All Land Rovers will be built using Nvidia's platform, which will enable several features such as automated driving and parking systems, and driver and occupant monitoring.
These growth drivers explain why analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to grow at an annual rate of 30% for the next five years. Its revenue is expected to increase nearly 50% from fiscal 2022 levels to more than $40 billion by next fiscal year, and such impressive growth could mean solid upside for investors.
The verdict
Nvidia is already growing at an impressive pace, while Intel is working on a turnaround. So, Nvidia is a proven performer that's recording impressive earnings and revenue growth quarter after quarter thanks to its dominant position in the lucrative graphics card market. But the problem for Nvidia is that it is still expensive despite pulling back in 2022.
Nvidia's earnings and sales multiples are way higher than the S&P 500's P/E ratio of 24 and the price-to-sales ratio of 2.9. This makes the stock susceptible to a broader market sell-off, as has been the case so far this year.
Intel, on the other hand, is way cheaper, pays a nice dividend, and is on track to regain its mojo. As such, Intel looks like the safer bet of these two tech giants right now even though Nvidia is growing at a much faster pace.

2022-03-04 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) Gains As Market Dips: What You Should Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-gains-as-market-dips%3A-what-you-should-know,,,"In the latest trading session, Intel (INTC) closed at $48.07, marking a +0.29% move from the previous day. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.79%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.53%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.48%.
Coming into today, shares of the world's largest chipmaker had lost 0.72% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 4.07%, while the S&P 500 lost 2.43%.
Investors will be hoping for strength from Intel as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Intel to post earnings of $0.79 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 43.17%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $18.32 billion, down 6.88% from the year-ago period.
For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $3.48 per share and revenue of $75.49 billion, which would represent changes of -36.38% and -3.25%, respectively, from the prior year.
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Intel. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.79% lower. Intel is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.
In terms of valuation, Intel is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 13.76. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 15.03, so we one might conclude that Intel is trading at a discount comparatively.
Investors should also note that INTC has a PEG ratio of 1.83 right now. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Semiconductor - General industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.26 as of yesterday's close.
The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 40, which puts it in the top 16% of all 250+ industries.
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

 The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Intel Corp. (INTC), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

  Intel shares have declined -21.1% over the past year against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry’s gain of +31.9%. However, Intel reported fourth-quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings of $1.09 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 21.1%.
The Zacks analyst believes that the company is riding on strong prospects of the Internet of Things and Mobileye businesses. Recovery in the enterprise business of the data center segment is a positive. Intel is likely to benefit from higher demand for its 10 nanometer (nm) SuperFin process-based 11th Gen core processors.
 Intel announced partnerships with ZEEKR and Sixt SE, and plans to unveil Mobileye’s robotaxi equipped with the Mobileye Drive system. However, the Client Computing Group is expected to suffer due to component shortage. Production delays pertaining to 7 nm ramp up remain a concern.

 Shares of Lockheed Martin have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+31.5% vs. -28.2%). It is the largest U.S. defense contractor that has a steady inflow of orders from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. The Zacks analyst believes that expansionary U.S. budgets will also boost its business. The F-35 program continues to be a key growth program for its Aeronautics business unit. In the past year, the stock has outperformed its industry.
  However, America and Turkey's tiff on the latter accepting Russian products may hurt its component supply from Turkey. The company is facing performance issues concerning some of its products, which, in turn, may hurt its results. Also, an uncertainty revolving around the possible Chinese sanction on Lockheed might impact the latter.
 (You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here >>>)
 Shares of IBM have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+2.5% vs. +0.1%). IBM reported relatively healthy fourth-quarter 2021 results with solid hybrid cloud adoption backed by a resilient business model and robust cash flow position driven by a diligent execution of operational plans. Despite year-over-year growth, both adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
 The Zacks analyst believes that synergies from the Red Hat buyout are boosting the company’s competitive position in the hybrid cloud market. IBM is poised to gain from the spin-off of the legacy infrastructure services business as it focuses on its hybrid cloud strategy. However, stiff competition in the cloud computing market from the likes of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure remains an overhang. Higher debt levels amid extensive restructuring activities pose a concern.

2022-03-04 00:00:00+00:00,Intel’s New Dividend and Its High Dividend Yield Imply Good Value for INTC Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-new-dividend-and-its-high-dividend-yield-imply-good-value-for-intc-stock,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
On Jan. 26, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) raised its dividend per share (DPS) by 5% when it announced fourth-quarter (Q4) and 2021 earnings. As a result, I wrote on Feb. 3, a month ago, that INTC stock was undervalued by at least 19%. This was because it was trading at $49.51 on Feb. 3.
Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.com
However, as of Mar. 3, a month later, INTC stock was actually lower at $47.93 per share. Obviously, this was likely due to the market downturn from the Russia invasion of Ukraine.
Nevertheless, now that the annual dividend is set at $1.46 per share, its dividend yield is now higher at 3.04%. This can be seen by dividing $47.93 by $1.464.
Intel Stock Should Have a Lower Yield and Higher Price
This is a significantly higher yield than Intel has had in the past. For example, Morningstar reports that the average dividend yield for the past 5 years has been 2.48%.
This implies that INTC stock is worth at least $58.87 per share, or 22.8% over the price on March 3. This is the result of dividing $1.46 by 2.48%. The result is $58.87 per share.
7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever
Similarly, Seeking Alpha reports that Intel’s average dividend yield over the last 4 years has been 2.43%. That is similar to Morningstar’s (NASDAQ:MORN) 2.48% level over 5 years. It implies a similar price target of $60.08, or 25.3% higher. This is slightly higher than Morningstar’s implied price since the dividend yield is lower.
The average between these two price targets is $59.48, or 24% over today’s price.
Therefore, the question is: when will INTC stock start to move towards this higher price? After all, it is always possible that the stock could end up falling further. This would give it an even higher dividend yield, but also take it further away from the price target.
Catalysts For a Turnaround for INTC Stock
There is no way to predict this. Unless we can identify a clear catalyst in the short-term, most value investors have resigned themselves to do one thing. That is: take advantage of cheap stock prices by averaging down as the stock price falls. This implies that the investor should not put all their investing money in any stock at one position price.
Moreover, Barron’s magazine reported on Feb. 23 that a major bearish analyst has recently changed his mind on Intel. The Raymond James analyst, Chris Caso, changed his recommendation to Market Perform from Market Underperform.
That is practically the same as saying, “Buy,” in analyst speak. Barron’s wrote that he is not necessarily bullish on the stock. He just feels that the bearish thesis on the stock has largely played out.
For example, he pointed out that the company guided analysts to expect negative free cash flow for the next three years. That is not normally a very good sign for a stock.
But the market already has discounted this into the huge drop in the last year. INTC peaked at $68.49 on Apr. 12, but dropped by 30% since then to $47.93 as of Mar. 3.
Where This Leaves Investors In INTC Stock
Analysts have generally higher price targets for INTC stock. For example, Yahoo! Finance indicates that the average price target of 41 analysts is $54.08 per share, or about 13% over the price of $47.93. Yahoo! Finance uses Refinitiv’s analyst survey to set its price targets.
Moreover, Seeking Alpha reports that the average of 41 analysts is $54.26, very close to the Refiniv price target average. However, it also shows that the upper end of the range is up to $72.20 per share.
These recommendations are slightly lower than my price target of $59.48. I used its dividend yield as the main criteria.
However, so far, I have not been able to identify any kind of catalyst that could push the stock higher towards this price target. Over time, say several years, the stock should be tethered to this price target. But without a clear catalyst pushing it there, it may take time.

The leader of cryptocurrency mining, omniverse (as opposed to metaverse), high-end PC gaming and artificial intelligence will post stronger growth as the year unfolds.
In the fourth quarter, Nvidia posted an impressive 53% growth in revenue Y/Y, to $7.64 billion. Its multiple tailwinds are in Gaming, Data Center, and Professional Visualization market platforms.
Earnings per share rose by 103% Y/Y to $1.18 or $1.32 on a non-GAAP basis. Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said Nvidia is advancing such fields as AI, digital biology and climate sciences. This year, its new software business model with AI, Omniverse, and Drive will accelerate demand.
Bears, who are in the minority with a 1.04% short float, may cite Nvidia’s flat gross margin as a fault.
At 65.4% gross margin, up 230 basis points, Nvidia’s business shows no sign of slowing down. The company forecasted a Q1/2023 revenue of $8.1 billion. GAAP gross margin will be 65.2% and 67% on a non-GAAP measure.
Arm Acquisition and NVDA Stock
Nvidia’s expenses of $3.55 billion in Q1 will include writing off Arm. It announced the termination of the acquisition on Feb. 7.
This is “because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction, despite good faith efforts by the parties.” Nvidia does not need to rely on mobile computing and AI-related developments in that space to grow. Investors may buy Arm stock when Softbank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) lists the firm on the public markets.
7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever
Nvidia spent more than a year seeking approval of the Arm acquisition, but the breakup fee is a small expense. The company likely has a favorable licensing deal that will more than make up for the cost. Furthermore, Nvidia is on track to launch its Arm-based CPU. It will target big AI and High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads starting in the first half of 2023.
Nvidia has a 20-year architectural license on Arm’s intellectual property. It will have three chips based on the IP: CPU, GPU (graphics), and DPU (dedicated data chips).
NVDA by the Numbers
Nvidia has a strong opportunity to build its data center business. As it moves into the current quarter (Q1), it has hyper-scale, enterprise core, enterprise edge, and public cloud markets.
In practical terms, it will have AI models that power conversational AI used by clients for providing customer service. In addition, it has chatbots to power customer service applications.
Nvidia, like other semiconductor firms, faces some supply constraints. Nvidia managed supply shortage issues for its networking unit in the data center business. Still, the situation is improving daily. For fiscal year 2023, investors should model revenue growing by at least 50% annually through the fiscal year 2027.
In a five-year discounted cash flow revenue exit model, assume a multiple of six times:
Metrics Range Conclusion
Discount Rate 8.5% – 7.5% 8.00%
Terminal Revenue Multiple 5.7x – 6.3x 6.0x
Fair Value $371.41 – $421.92 $396.17

The above metrics suggest that NVDA stock is worth almost $400. Below is my revenue forecast for Nvidia:
(USD in millions) Input Projections
Fiscal Years Ending 22-Jan 23-Jan 24-Jan 25-Jan 26-Jan 27-Jan
Revenue 26,914 40,371 60,557 90,835 136,252 204,378
% Growth 61.40% 50.00% 50.00% 50.00% 50.00% 50.00%
EBITDA 11,215 16,148 24,223 36,334 54,501 81,751
% of Revenue 41.70% 40.00% 40.00% 40.00% 40.00% 40.00%
Model courtesy of finbox
On Wall Street, analysts have an average price target of $362 (per Tipranks). The optimism is justifiable. Nvidia’s profits face no meaningful competition.
Nvidia’s gaming cards are superior to that of its competitor offered by Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Both firms released budget GPUs recently. Nvidia’s RTX 3050 offers RTX ray tracing and DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling). This increases chip performance using a dedicated tensor core AI.
AMD’s RX 6500 XT GPU is a less impressive budget release. Not only is it not available but third-party sellers are asking for more than double the retail price.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) relies on the CPU market for growth. It is on the cusp of expanding its market by entering the GPU segment. Fortunately for Nvidia, Intel delayed its Arc gaming GPUs until the spring (or in Q2).
Risks and Your Takeaway
Supply constraints will limit Nvidia’s growth. Still, Q4 results did not weaken despite headwinds. In addition, Nvidia faced demand constraints across its entire range of products.
Investors should treat the constraints as temporary. Nvidia has complicated products in high demand. It is expanding its supply base. Expect Nvidia’s supply to increase throughout the year as a result.
Nvidia’s billion-dollar costs from the Arm acquisition falling through is a one-time cost. Still, it has the Grace CPU that supplies enhanced deep recommendation systems for customers.
Nvidia stock pulled back sharply from Nasdaq’s peak set on Nov. 2021. Markets will continue to sell off weak companies that have no hope of profits. Conversely, Nvidia has consistently strong profitability and accelerated growth. Investors should consider adding small positions whenever the stock dips.

2022-03-03 00:00:00+00:00,4 Semiconductor Stocks For Your March 2022 Watchlist,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-semiconductor-stocks-for-your-march-2022-watchlist,,,"Are These The Best Semiconductor Stocks To Buy Right Now?
Semiconductor stocks are back in focus in the stock market today. This is in light of President Joe Biden’s recent call for a big cash infusion into the country’s semiconductor industry. During Biden’s State of the Union speech on Tuesday, he pushed Congress to send bipartisan legislation to his desk that would include more than $50 billion in subsidies to aid chip makers. This would help support the increase in U.S. chip manufacturing capacity. Certainly, this is partly due to the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage. However, the U.S. is also trying to reduce its dependence on foreign companies like Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM).
With that being said, semiconductor companies are constantly working around the clock to advance their crafts. For instance, Microchip Technology (NASDAQ: MCHP) recently announced the NVMe 4016 SSD controller to address the market demand for high-performance solid-state drives. The company claims that it can deliver greater than 14 GB per second throughput and over 3 million IOPS. Besides, the technology would enable efficient utilization of resources in ever-growing data center and cloud computing infrastructures.
Elsewhere, Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) introduced the industry’s first 800 Gbps multimode platform solution. This would enable data center infrastructure to achieve higher speeds for short-reach optical modules and Active Optical Cable applications. This would allow the company to deliver the required bandwidth to support the data centers of tomorrow. With the continuous progress of the industry, it is no surprise that many investors pay attention to semiconductor companies. Thus, let’s take a look at some of the top semiconductor stocks worth considering in thestock market today 
Semiconductor Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] Right Now
Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO)
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ: AMD)
Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ: MU)
Broadcom
Starting off the list, we have the semiconductor giant, Broadcom. In detail, the company specializes in a range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Its semiconductor solutions segment is responsible for its semiconductor product lines and Internet protocol licensing. On the other hand, its infrastructure software segment includes its mainframe, BizOps, and cybersecurity software solutions. Basically, its field of expertise is in the movement of data in data centers, telecom, enterprise, and embedded networking applications. Despite a lackluster start to the year, AVGO stock has still risen by about 26% over the past year.
Last Thursday, Broadcom announced its industry-leading PCle Gen 5.0 portfolio as it sets the foundation for the ecosystem to build high-performance, next-generation servers. This would give the company the ability to seamlessly unify data centers where high-speed computing, data processing, and low latency is of utmost importance. In addition, new applications such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing will have a better platform for improvements moving forward. Now, investors should note that the company will be announcing its fiscal first-quarter earnings report after the market closes today. So, would you consider adding AVGO stock to your portfolio ahead of its earnings?

Intel
Following that, we will be looking at one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world, Intel. Essentially, the company engages in the design, manufacture, and sale of computer products and technologies worldwide. Intel supplies microprocessors to some of the top computer manufacturers which include the likes of Dell (NYSE: DELL) and HP (NYSE: HPQ). That said, INTC stock has been going through some rough patches over the past year. Could things be turning around this year? Well, the company seems to believe so.
In February, Intel hosted its 2022 Investor Meeting and provided key elements in its strategy for long-term growth. The company believes that the continued proliferation of technology would be a catalyst for sustained demand for semiconductors. This could potentially create a $1 trillion market opportunity by 2030. “With that opportunity in mind, today we outlined our strategy and roadmap for accelerating to 10%-12% year-over-year revenue growth by 2026,” said Pat Gelsinger, Intel’s CEO.
What’s more, the company announced earlier this year a new $1 billion fund to support companies building disruptive technologies for the foundry ecosystem. The fund will prioritize investments in capabilities that accelerate foundry customers’ time to market. Given these considerations, do you believe INTC stock will make a comeback soon?

Advanced Micro Devices
Similar to Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is a semiconductor company that primarily caters to high-performance computing, graphics, and visualization technologies. Its products include x86 microprocessors, discrete graphics processing units (GPUs), chipsets for personal computers, data centers, and many more. Over the past year, AMD stock has climbed more than 45% despite the volatility in the stock market.
Not to mention, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services announced last month that it will be expanding the use of the 3rd Gen AMD EPYC™ processors for its Amazon EC2 C6a instances. It appears that the C6a instances can offer up to 15% better compute price performance over previous generation C5a instances for various compute-focused workloads. So, it would be perfect to support compute-intensive workloads such as batch processing, distributed analytics, ad serving, and video encoding. Safe to say, this continued adoption is a testament to AMD’s advancement of technology in the cloud. With that in mind, would you consider buying AMD stock?

Micron
Micron is a company that offers memory and storage solutions. Its portfolio of memory and storage technologies includes dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), negative-AND (NAND), three-dimensional (3D) XPoint memory, and NOR. For over 40 years, the company has played a significant role in the world’s most innovative technological advancements. These range from disruptive breakthroughs such as artificial intelligence to emerging autonomous vehicles. Factoring these thoughts, it is understandable why investors are often on the lookout for MU stock. 
Furthermore, Micron recently announced it is delivering the world’s most advanced 176-layer NAND data center SSD. This would include Micron’s industry-leading NAND, which contains 176 layers of storage cells and proven CMOS-under-the-array technology. When integrated with its own DRAM, internally developed SoC and associated firmware, this vertically integrated SSD would allow the company to rapidly respond to customer needs in the market and support strengthened device security. Given these exciting developments, would you consider MU stock a top semiconductor stock to buy?

2022-03-03 00:00:00+00:00,2 Stocks Under $120 You Can Buy and Hold Forever,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-stocks-under-%24120-you-can-buy-and-hold-forever,,,"It is no secret that the U.S. equity market has been very jittery in 2022. With the market remaining highly volatile due to sticky inflation and expectations of rising interest rates in the U.S., and increasing geopolitical tensions associated with the Russia and Ukraine crisis, the technology sector has taken a severe beating. Some big tech names are now suffering after enjoying months of overstretched and overly optimistic valuations.
Yet, this sell-off can also prove to be a buying opportunity, especially for retail investors on a budget. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Cloudflare (NYSE: NET) are two fundamentally strong stocks trading for well under $120 per share. Here's why investors stand a chance to benefit significantly by picking up these reasonably priced investments and holding on to them forever.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Intel
The year 2022 has been quite challenging for Intel since investors are disappointed with the company's recent earnings performance as well as its ""2022 and long-term growth strategy."" Although the company widely surpassed consensus fourth-quarter revenue and earnings estimates, the market remained unimpressed as it expected even better performance in current times of ongoing semiconductor shortage. The analyst and investor community has expressed significant skepticism toward CEO Pat Gelsinger's plans to opt for short-term pain (revenue and earnings decline in 2022) in exchange for long-term growth by ramping up investments.
Yet, there is still much to like in Chipzilla's fundamental story. According to Mercury Research, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) accounted for 25.6% of the overall x86 CPU market in fiscal Q4 2021, a year-over-year improvement of 3.9 percentage points. Intel's share dropped by the same percentage points to 74.4% in the same time frame.
However, while AMD has been growing rapidly in the server CPU market, Intel has been making its mark in the client CPU market. Thanks to its Alder Lake chips, Intel is rapidly capturing market share in the gaming segment. With AMD's Ryzen 5000 series not including budget-friendly options for the low end of the gaming market, Intel's i3-12100 CPU chip (from the Alder Lake series) seems to have this niche all to itself -- at least for now (or at least until AMD comes out with the Ryzen 7000 series). Additionally, Intel is gearing up for the launch of more memory-intensive and power-efficient Raptor Lake client CPUs in 2022.
Intel is also investing aggressively to become a major foundry player for third-party customers. To that effect, the company is spending $20 billion for building two new ""fabs"" (semiconductor fabrication plants) in Arizona and has announced plans to build a manufacturing plant in Ohio. The company has strengthened relationships with foundry partners as well as substrate and equipment suppliers to ensure a smooth supply chain. The recently announced $5.4 billion acquisition of Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ: TSEM) will enable Intel to create an end-to-end foundry business, which will now also include the production of chips catering to specialty areas, such as radio frequency controllers, industrial sensors, and power management.
Intel is currently priced at only 9.8 times current-year earnings, much lower than the median valuation in the semiconductor industry of 12.7. The company is rapidly gaining strength in the client CPU market and is revitalizing its foundry business. With Intel paying a handsome dividend yield of 3.06% and currently trading at discounted valuations, this stock can prove to be an attractive long-term buy for retail investors.
2. Cloudflare
Another solid tech stock that has been caught up in the market's shifting preference from growth to value stocks is Cloudflare, a prominent edge-based, content-delivery network (CDN) operator. The company operates 250 data centers across 100 countries, enabling 95% of the global population access to its network within 50 milliseconds. Edge-computing technology allows data and applications to be placed closer to the user's computer, resulting in improved data reliability, lower lag time, and higher speed on the network.
Additionally, Cloudflare provides cybersecurity services to enterprises, such as web application firewall (WAF) and protection from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The company also offers a Zero Trust platform (involving continuous and real-time access management of networks, applications, and data). On Feb. 10, Cloudflare announced the acquisition of cloud-access security broker (CASB) player Vectrix. This move has further strengthened Cloudflare's Zero Trust platform by adding a cybersecurity service enabling enterprises visibility and control over the data stored in their software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications.
Recently, the company has announced plans to acquire a security start-up, Area 1 Security, to add a strong email security product to its Zero Trust offerings.
Cloudflare has been quite successful in attracting new customers as well as retaining and cross-selling new services to existing ones. In fiscal 2021 (ending Dec. 31, 2021), the company added 588 large customers earning annualized revenue over $100,000. Cloudflare also ended Q4 with a dollar-based net retention rate of 125%, implying that businesses that were the company's customers in fiscal 2020 spent 25% more in fiscal 2021, even after adjusting for churn. The company's revenues surpassed consensus estimates, while non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share met analysts' estimates in Q4. The company has also issued fiscal 2022 revenue guidance of $927 million to $931 million, widely surpassing consensus analyst estimates of $891 million.
NET PS Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.
Cloudflare is currently trading at just over 38 times forward sales. Although the valuation is not cheap, it is still quite low compared to the levels at which the company traded for most of the past six months.
Against the backdrop of solid business fundamentals and improving financials, Cloudflare's stock seems well poised for a solid runway in the coming years.

Chris Hill: If you've got a special someone in your life, listening to today's episode is going to help. If you don't have a special someone, listening sure can't hurt. Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Chris Hill, joined by Motley Fool senior analyst John Rotonti. Thanks for being here.
John Rotonti: Thanks, Chris, glad to be back on the show.
Chris Hill: Today is the one-year anniversary of Pat Gelsinger becoming the CEO at Intel and he celebrated in the usual way. He spent $5.5 billion to buy Tower Semiconductor. It's a great day for Tower Semiconductor shareholders with that stock up more than 40%. I'm assuming this is a good price since shares of Intel are up slightly as well. To the broader point though, what does this acquisition tell you about Intel and their plans for the future?
John Rotonti: Pat Gelsinger has a plan to turn Intel into a leading third-party semiconductor manufacturing company, or foundry, as they're called. He's announced plans to build two massive facilities in Arizona and another two in Ohio. Now he's buying Tower, which is based out of Israel, and gives them an international footprint. All together Intel is going to spend about $50 billion in capital, either building or buying manufacturing facilities that they have so far announced. I don't think it's over. I think they're going to continue to build and buy new manufacturing facilities. Intel stock is up about 1%. Intel is paying all cash for the deal. Interestingly, when a company pays all cash for an acquisition, it shows that they have a high degree of confidence that the deal is going to work out because they're not giving away any ownership, they're not giving away any stock. They want to keep all of the spoils for themselves. That's another reason Intel stock is up today because they're paying with all cash coming right off their balance sheet.
Chris Hill: Obviously, when a deal like this is announced, it's not just the immediate shareholders who are paying attention. It is the competitors as well. If you're Taiwan Semiconductor and you see this news, what are you thinking?
John Rotonti: I don't think Taiwan Semiconductor is that worried at this point. The truth is that Intel still is in a very strong financial position, but they underinvested in innovation and technology for the last 7-10 years. Taiwan Semiconductor during that time was able to surpass them to become the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing company in the world. They have a head start and they are investing between $40 and $44 billion in capex, just in 2022 in building their own facilities. They are going to invest over $100 billion in building facilities over the next three years combined. Yes, it sounds like Intel is investing a ton of capital, but Taiwan Semiconductor is as well.
Chris Hill: Let me zoom out a little bit here. You talked about the amount of money that Taiwan Semiconductor is investing. Gelsinger and his team have this $50 billion plan to build factories. Obviously, the acquisition of Tower Semiconductor is part of that as well. Is this land grab going on, for lack of a better term, is this an investing opportunity for people like you and me? Because it really seems like it is.
John Rotonti: I think it is, the portfolio that I run at The Motley Fool for Showdown would suggest that I think it is. I'm invested in semiconductor companies. The fact of the matter is right now we have massive demand and supply imbalance in semiconductors in the world, demand is very strong, and supply is very short because of a variety of reasons. The truth is, sovereign governments around the world also want to build semiconductor manufacturing facilities on their own soil because of the supply chain disruptions we've seen. Semiconductors run our modern digital societies. Everything that we do from cloud computing to electronic medical devices. Everything we do, every electronic device a semiconductor is in it. These are really important products, they power our modern world. Countries are falling over themselves trying to get more semiconductor manufacturing facility close to home.
Chris Hill: Let's move on to Arista Networks. Their fourth-quarter results surprised Wall Street in a good way. Their revenue guidance for 2022 was pretty modest, although I have said before, I don't know why any company in the current environment would decide to be bold with their guidance for 2022 and beyond. It just seems like conservative guidance is the way to go for now. Nice to see that Arista Networks is getting some respect in the market, both for the results and for their guidance for 2022.
John Rotonti: I think you're spot on Chris. Arista had a fantastic 2021. Their full-year 2021 revenue and earnings per share both grew about 27%. This is a company that is still growing at a very attractive rate. Their fourth quarter 2021, they finished with revenue growing 27%. So at the same rate that they grew for the full year. Their fourth-quarter was also 10% sequentially higher growth from their third quarter 2021. Really strong results from Arista. The growth rate for 2022 is 30%. They could have gone higher, but its supply chain disruptions are actually holding them back. Thirty percent growth, I will take it.
Chris Hill: What is the right way to think about Arista Networks as a business? Obviously, it's a networking company. It's right there in the name. I see some people talking about the software part of the business. How do you think about Arista Networks as a stand-alone business but also relative to its main competitors?
John Rotonti: Eighty percent of their business, about 78% of their business comes from hardware, and about 20%-22% of their business does come from software. The software component's growing faster, I believe, but even their hardware is infused with their proprietary EOS software. It's a combination. They're vertically integrated. A combination hardware-software but they sold the switches and routers that basically run the cloud. That's why they have Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) as a 15% client. About 15% of their revenue comes from Microsoft, one of the largest hyperscale cloud companies in the world. Meta, formerly Facebook, is roughly a 10% client and they're going to be more than a 10% client soon. This is the hardware and software that powers the cloud. Arista is taking share from their largest competitor, which is Cisco. Cisco is still a really good business, it's just growing slower. Arista's growing a lot faster. They have what industry insiders would suggest is superior technology and superior customer service because Cisco is doing so many things these days. Cisco is now a technology conglomerate, but Arista is laser-focused on switches and routers and the software to run those things. Rightly so, they're a younger company earlier in their growth cycle and so they are taking some share from Cisco.
Chris Hill: Cisco Systems is probably the go-to reference point when people start talking about networking but in a weird way, Arista has quietly become a $40 billion company. To the extent that they were ever under the radar, they probably aren't anymore. What do you think the next two to three years looks like for this business? Is it similar to what they've been doing the last few years?
John Rotonti: Growth will probably slow down. If I'm modeling out a risk, I don't model them growing 27% for the next five years. In fact, management has guided. Most companies don't provide long-term guidance. Arista does. They've guided for mid-teens revenue growth through 2025. Mid-teens revenue compounded annual growth rate through 2025. However, you interpret that 13-16 or 17%, let's say. Somewhere in that band is probably where Arista will grow over the next five years but it's also highly profitable, 63, 64% gross margins, operating margins well above 30%. It's growing, but also growing very profitably.
Chris Hill: Do you think it's at the point where it's no longer a takeover candidate? It's too big at this point.
John Rotonti: Yeah, it's pretty big at this point. There's maybe one or two companies that would roll the dice and try to spend that much but yeah, I think they're just going to keep compounding on their own. That's my guess.
Chris Hill: John Rotonti, great talking to you. Thanks for being here.
John Rotonti: Thank you, Chris.

Now that Valentine's Day is over, Robert Brokamp and Alison Southwick are tackling the top money arguments that couples face and discuss some ways to create more financial harmony in your relationship.
Alison Southwick: Last week we covered how to talk to your honey about money by playing the Foolywed game. Hopefully you took some time to have a real heart-to-heart discussion about your hopes and dreams and money schemes but it's Feb. 15th and Valentine's Day is over. What if all that fancy dining and wining and money-ing means you're waking up with a financial hangover? No worries, Fools, everyone disagrees about money now and then with their partner. Today we're going to talk about five common money problems couples face, and some steps you can take to overcome them together. Bro, does that sound like a plan?
Robert Brokamp: Sounds like a great plan, Alison.
Alison Southwick: Here we go. The first money struggle we're going to talk about is disagreements about spending. A recent survey conducted by The Ascent, they're a Motley Fool website that reviews financial products like credit cards and discount brokers. Anyway, they found that 82% of couples have argued over spending. It's not surprising. After all, one of the easiest traps in the world is to judge someone else for how they spend their money while giving yourself a free pass for buying stupid stuff that you value. Value really is the key word here, because what we spend money on represents what we personally value. One partner might say, I don't think we really need to buy a jet ski but there's probably a somewhat deeper psychological reason behind why their partner values a jet ski. Maybe they spend their summers on a lake and those are fun experiences they want to relive, or maybe people who ride jet skis just look really bitching. Maybe that's reason enough. Quick question. Who do you think spends more? Men or women? Bro, do you want to answer this question because I know you already know the answer.
Robert Brokamp: I know that there are stereotypes that probably would say that women spend more, but I know that the truth is not so clear.
Alison Southwick: [laughs] That's right. While women tend to have the reputation of being frivolous spenders, oh my God, shoes, the answer is that men are actually the bigger spenders. Yes, women spend more money on clothes, but men actually spend way more money on cars, takeout food, and alcohol. What this shows is that men and women have a tendency to place higher value on different things. By the way, men and women actually spend about the same money on shoes but of course, same-sex couples also might have very different ideas about how much money to spend and what to spend it on, because much of our relationship of money goes back all the way to our childhoods, and is highly influenced by the adults in our lives and how they manage money. Bro, what can you do when you and your partner disagree on spending money?
Robert Brokamp: Well, I would say, like most things in marriage, it's a mixture of compromise and giving each other some space. Regarding the latter, it could be a good idea for each partner have an amount that they could just spend however they want, no judgment or anything. I know of couples who handle this even with separate accounts, so when they get paid, the bulk of the paycheck gets deposited in a joint account, but some money gets deposited in separate accounts for each spouse. This does two things, it gives each partner a certain amount of freedom and autonomy to do whatever they want, but also keeps it to a limit. Where to compromise, I think it's important to figure out the pain points. I would say that for most couples really they're not arguing about every single expense. It's just a few key categories. Find a common ground, but then find ways to meet in the middle of the categories that are the most contentious.
You could literally meet in the middle on some expenses. You can determine, for example, how much each spouse feels should be spent on holiday and birthday gifts, and you split the difference. You could also decided that one partner gets his or her way in one category, and the other gets his or her way in another category, or you could alternate who gets the final say. For example, this year you set the vacation budget and then next year, I do. I think it's also really important to keep in mind that the more you spend, the less you can save, and that means the longer it will take to accomplish your financial goals. Back in 2000 when my wife and I were first married, we wrote what we called our financial manifesto, which laid out five principles we'd follow when it came to managing money as a couple.
We were actually both working at The Motley Fool at the time, we published it on fool.com. You can actually go still find it and read it if you want. I was looking back on it, I would say the more important principles of our manifest was that we would try to frame our spending in terms of what's more important, buying this thing now, or saving more money for the things that are really important to us, like a house, our retirement, our kids' college educations. We actually even kept a little list of our goals in our wallets, so we'd see them before we spent money on anything. The bottom line here, I think, is deciding on your joint financial goals can be a big part of getting on the same page when it comes to spending, and we're going to talk about goals later on in the show.
Alison Southwick: If you are having disagreements about spending, that could easily lead to keeping financial secrets, or the next money struggle, financial infidelity, such a big term. The previously mentioned survey from The Ascent also showed that 67% of men and 73% of women have committed financial infidelity, or being dishonest with their partner about money matters. The most common lies were hiding a purchase price, hiding a purchase that was made, and lying about either a price or a purchase. If you've done any of these things, it's because you feel judged and ashamed perhaps, and shame takes up a lot of space between you and your partner.
Robert Brokamp: Yeah, financial infidelity is surprisingly common but that doesn't mean it's OK. A recent survey from creditcards.com found that 42% of respondents feel that financial and physical infidelity are equally bad, and 11% said that financial infidelity was worse. According to the National Endowment for Financial Education, 76% of people report that financial infidelity has harmed their relationship and 10% said it led to divorce. It could be a serious issue. As you said Alison, shame could be a big part of it. According to that creditcards.com survey, 26% of respondents said they hid aspects of their finance because they were embarrassed about the way they handled money. But another issue is that many spouses want just a certain measure of independence; 36% chose to cheat, so to speak, in order to maintain privacy and control. Besides hidden purchases, financial infidelity can conclude hidden debt or secret accounts. Author Valerie Ryan wrote about how she married a man who said he owned the condo that they shared, that it turns out he was just renting it. She didn't find out until he started being cagey about it.
Her dad suggested that she check the public property records. If you suspect something fishy is going on besides property records, places to look are credit reports for you and your spouse and your tax returns, see if their dividends, gains, interest, other sources of income that are being reported that you didn't know about. A couple of other signs are large and frequent withdrawals from the ATM that aren't easily explained, or if someone makes a lot of effort to be the first person to get the mail. That said, most financial fidelity is really not that drastic. It's often comes down to just a misunderstanding. Here's how to be more up front with your finances. You start by setting the rules and deciding how much each partner can spend without the other partner's knowledge. This is also where each spouse having a small mad money account can help.
Research suggests it also helps to have a money management routine, according to a study on financial infidelity published in the Journal of Financial Therapy, ""Couples who pay their bills in a less structured manner are more likely than those who had a more established budget and plan to keep a financial secret from their partner."" I would say finally, it's just crucial to dig into why you or your spouse feels the need to hide things. As we said last week, issues with money are often really not about money, they're about other things like trust, resentment, shame, maybe a past trauma, maybe even an addiction. If it's a big problem, it's a good idea to get professional help from a therapist who specializes in couples counseling to get to the heart of the matter.
Alison Southwick: Our next money struggle is something, probably every couple will go through at some point. That is disagreements about financial goals and priorities. According to Fidelity, 34% of couples disagree on their family's next big savings goal. Any financial planner will tell you that there are some general rules of thumb when it comes to financial goals. For example, you should probably pay off your credit card debt before you set money aside for that jet ski. That's an easy one but how do you manage the goals of investing for retirement versus buying a house, going on a family vacation versus saving for your kids' college fund. That's a tricky one. You can't send your kids to college without them knowing how to ride a jet ski. All the other kids are going to laugh at them. How do you get allied not just based on both of your values, but also with what is the smart money moves to make.
Robert Brokamp: You're right, Alison. This is an area where there are some generally right answers, but also some wiggle room. Here's what I would say, just about every financial professional would say, are the non-negotiable priorities: pay off high interest credit card debt; don't accumulate any more high-interest debt; build an emergency fund; get life insurance and estate plan, especially if you have kids; and save for retirement. But the other things really will depend on what's more important to you as an individual and as a couple. What size of house do you buy? Are you going to pay for your kid's college or do you expect them to at least partially foot the bill, which probably means that they have to take out loans? Do buy a new car every five years or every 15 years?
As with spending, this is a situation where you could choose to be in the middle or have some give and take. You could say, well, ""We'll save this much for this goal that's important to you, and we'll save this much for a goal that's important to me."" Just like you could have separate spending accounts, you can have separate savings accounts as long as you're up front about it. Also, I think this is a situation where a fee-only financial planner could really help. You can pay one by the hour to act as an objective third party. She or he will give their expert opinion on how you should order your goals. They're also going to use their professional software to crunch the numbers so you can see how much you need to save for each goal. That brings some reality to the situation, it takes some emotion out of the process and the planner might even come up with solutions you haven't thought about.
Alison Southwick: Our fourth common point of money contention for couples is disagreement about retirement plans such us, when are you going to do it and how much money do you need? Retirement can often seem so far away, but failing to plan for it is a fantastic way to being forced to postpone it. There are so many different things to ponder and get aligned on, like, when do you want to retire. According to Fidelity, 48% of couples disagree on this topic. What about where you want to retire or how cushy of a retirement you want? Do you envision drinking Dom on the waterfront in West Palm or Coors in a condo in Cleveland, because one of those is going to take more money. It turns out 51% of couple disagree on how much they need to save for retirement but I think you can have a jet ski in both locations. How do you get aligned on the when and what of retirement, Bro?
Robert Brokamp: When it comes to retirement, you actually don't have to be on the same page, though it does help to be in the same chapter. Research from the early 2000s indicated that about half of couples retire together. The more recent research suggests that the current figure is lower. You don't have to retire at the same time. In fact, when both spouses have retirement, that can have a potentially negative impact on the wife in a heterosexual couple. Because on average, wives are three years younger than their husbands, but also live three years longer. Retiring sooner means that they will have fewer resources that have to be stretched over a longer retirement. Then there's just the relationship dynamics of both spouses being home with nothing to do. Which gave rise to the saying, I married you for life, but not for lunch. If you can't agree on retirement plans, start breaking it down to see what you can agree on and what you disagree about.
For example, one item of agreement could be, and I'd say should be, that you save at least enough to take full advantage of the employer managing a 401(k) if that's available to you. Then, depending on the situation, spouses can chart their own retirement courses, at least to some degree. Yes, it's certainly better to coordinate resources, so security, joint assets, things like that but retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs are by law individual accounts, not joint accounts. Spouses do have some rights to retirement accounts in the case of divorce or death but before then, the account owner pretty much has full control. If you can't agree on retirement goals, each spouse can save at least somewhat according to their own retirement aspirations. This is also a situation where a good fee-only financial planner could help. I think everyone should consult once every 5-10 years just to make sure their retirement plans are on track but it would be especially important if the couple can't agree on how much to save.
Alison Southwick: The fifth and final common source of money conflict that we're going to talk about today for couples is disagreements about investments, particularly how much risk to take. Again, going back to Fidelity, 40% of couples disagree on how much risk they are comfortable taking in their investments. I remember a Motley Fool Wealth Management planner who once told us that more than once, they had a client who kept secret brokerage accounts from their partners because they think their partner would be uncomfortable with the amount of risks they were taking with their investments. It's like they're sneaking off to Vegas, but instead of going full tilt at the poker table, they're doubling down on shares of Peloton. I swear one day I'll stop bringing up Peloton but it's killing me right now.
Robert Brokamp: Well, totally understandable with a stock that's down almost 80 percent. This is also a situation where it might help to get objective expert opinion. That could be from a financial advisor, but it doesn't have to be because there are already ways to see how big-name financial services firms think you should invest your money. That is by looking at the allocations of target date retirement funds. As we said in our Feb. 1st episode, these are funds that have an allocation to cash, bonds, and stocks according to a certain year of retirement. It gets gradually more conservative as that year approaches reaching around 50% in stocks on average by the actual retirement date. You could also look at the age-based funds found in most 529 college savings plans.
For example, Utah's plan is regularly rated as among the best in the country. The funds for kids who are younger than seven who are invested 80% in stocks, gradually drops to 50% in stocks for kids who are ages 10-12, and then continues to glide down to 0% by the time the kids is 18 and ready to go to college. These are reasonable, moderate risk allocations. For couples who can't agree on how much risk to take, I think looking to these funds for guidance for the foundation of your portfolio is a pretty good first step but then you do have to adjust for your individual risk tolerances. If they're significantly different, then perhaps you could have a good portion of your money invest along the lines of the target retirement or target college funds but then you each have your separate investment accounts for some of your money.
Alison Southwick: We've covered a lot of contentious ground here. Bro, what's your parting advice to bring couples together when it comes to co-managing money?
Robert Brokamp: Well, I actually would like to start by adding a couple of caveats to what we've covered. First, many of the recommendations such as each person having their own spending and savings accounts, it really works best for partners who are both working and earning somewhat similar amounts but if there's a big disparity in income, or if one spouse is staying home to raise the kids, it can get more complicated, and ""what's mine is mine"" mentality is just not going to work. You have to consider how much each partner is contributing to the relationship, to the household and not just in terms of a paycheck and make sure that everyone feels like they are sharing in the benefits of the work of the person who's working.
Secondly, these solutions are for people who have basically reasonable run-of-the-mill disagreements but for some couples the troubles are caused by one or both having a disorder frankly, like compulsive spending, compulsive gambling, maybe drugs or alcohol addiction. In those cases, you really do need to get professional help. I will just say finally that, it's just important to accept that you won't agree on everything. Because no couple does and you'll never be perfectly equal or perfectly fair and you just have to accept that. According to Fidelity, 24% of people say they are often frustrated by their partner's money habits, but let it go for the sake of keeping the pace. In my opinion, that's perfectly fine. As long as the couple has arrived at a consensus on the most important things and then built in some allowances for individual choices.
Alison Southwick: Listeners there you have it, go forth. Make money love, not money war.
Chris Hill: All we're saying is give money love a chance. That's all for today, but coming up tomorrow, America's best-selling drug is about to face new competition. We'll talk about how investors can look at the new wave of biosimilar drugs entering the market and find opportunities. As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. Don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. I'm Chris Hill. Thanks for listening. We'll see you tomorrow.

2022-03-02 00:00:00+00:00,3 Smartest Tech Stocks To Buy in 2022 and Beyond,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-smartest-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-2022-and-beyond-0,,,"Many tech stocks tumbled over the past several months as inflation, rising interest rates, and other macro headwinds sparked a rotation toward more conservative investments. But over the long term, selling top tech stocks too early can be far more costly than withstanding a few temporary drawdowns.
Investors should definitely reduce their exposure to unprofitable tech companies that are trading at sky-high valuations. However, they should still buy profitable, evergreen tech companies that trade at reasonable valuations. Let's take a closer look at three stocks that check those boxes: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Microsoft
Microsoft's ecosystem is practically inescapable. Windows is the leading operating system for PCs, Office 365 is the dominant office productivity software platform, and Azure is the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform after Amazon Web Services (AWS). Microsoft also sells Surface devices and Xbox video game consoles, and it's gradually evolving into one of the world's top video game publishers through big acquisitions.
Under Satya Nadella, who became Microsoft's third CEO in 2014, the aging tech giant expanded its cloud ecosystem, transformed Windows and Office into cloud-based services, and launched mobile apps for iOS and Android. Those changes initially squeezed Microsoft's margins but eventually ushered in a new era of ""mobile-first, cloud-first"" growth.
That momentum should continue for the foreseeable future. Analysts expect Microsoft's revenue and earnings to grow 18% and 16%, respectively, in fiscal 2022 (which ends this June). Next year, they expect its revenue and earnings to increase 14% and 15%, respectively.
Microsoft's robust growth rates, which should be supported by the ongoing expansion of its cloud services, indicate its stock deserves to trade with a slight premium at 31 times forward earnings. The company's predictable profitability and rising cash flows should also insulate its investors from the macro concerns about inflation and rising interest rates.
2. TSMC
TSMC is the world's largest and most advanced contract chipmaker. It manufactures chips for fabless chipmakers like Apple, AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm, and it remains well ahead of its closest competing foundries -- Samsung and Intel -- in terms of node sizes and transistor density.
TSMC is a linchpin of the global semiconductor market, but it faces three near-term challenges:
The ongoing chip shortage, which has been exacerbated by supply chain headwinds.
Aggressive spending plans (a planned 33% to 47% capex increase this year) to maintain its technological lead.
And potential competition from Intel, which aims to regain the lead in the ""process race"" from TSMC by 2025 through significant investments.
However, TSMC can easily afford its planned capex boost. It also remains far ahead of Intel because it adopted ASML's expensive extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology -- which is used to etch circuit patterns onto the tiniest wafers -- long before its American counterpart. Its spending should gradually ease as it ramps up its production of 5nm and 7nm chips and rolls out its next-generation 2nm and 3nm nodes.
Analysts expect TSMC's revenue and earnings to grow 29% and 36%, respectively, in 2022. Next year, they expect its revenue and earnings to increase by 15% and 13%, respectively. Those are rock-solid growth rates for a blue-chip tech stock that trades at 20 times forward earnings.
3. Nvidia
Nvidia is the world's largest producer of discrete GPUs. GPUs are usually associated with high-end video games, but they're also used to process complex machine learning and AI tasks in data centers. They're also widely used by the professional visualization and cryptocurrency mining markets.
Nvidia's gaming and data center GPUs have driven most of its growth in recent years. More graphically advanced video games are boosting sales of its gaming GPUs, while a flood of online data is driving demand for its data center GPUs. Cryptocurrency miners have also been using its high-end gaming GPUs and dedicated mining cards to mine Ether and other cryptocurrencies.
Those secular tailwinds boosted Nvidia's revenue 61% in fiscal 2022 (which ended this January) as its adjusted earnings surged 78%. For fiscal 2023, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to grow another 29% and 20%, respectively.
Nvidia's growth is decelerating against some tough year-over-year comparisons, and the stock might not initially seem like a bargain at just over 40 times forward earnings. However, the chipmaker should continue to profit from the expansion of the gaming, data center, and AI markets for the foreseeable future. Those core strengths, along with its ongoing dominance of the GPU market, should support its current valuations.

ROME, March 1 (Reuters) - Italy plans to set aside more than 4 billion euros ($4.6 billion) until 2030 to boost domestic chip manufacturing as it seeks to attract more investment from tech companies such as IntelINTC.O, a draft decree seen by Reuters showed on Tuesday.
The government is trying to persuade the U.S. group to spend billions of euros on an advanced chipmaking plant in Italy that uses innovative technologies to weave full chips.
Rome is ready to offer Intel public money and other favourable terms to fund part of the overall investment, which is expected to be worth around 8 billion euros ($9 billion) over 10 years, Reuters reported in December.
To boost domestic chipmaking, Italy is also in talks with French-Italian STMicroelectronics STM.PA, Taiwanese-controlled MEMC Electronic Materials Inc WFR.N and Israeli Tower Semiconductor TSEM.TA, which is set to be bought by Intel.
Negotiations with Intel are complex as the U.S. group has tabled very tough demands, a government source involved in the talks told Reuters.
To clinch a deal with Intel, Rome is also relying on new funding rules for innovative semiconductor facilities announced last month by the European Commission under so-called Chips Act.
Brussels has made available 15 billion euros in additional public and private investment by 2030, on top of 30 billion euros of public investments already planned from NextGenerationEU, Horizon Europe and national budgets.
Intel said in September it could invest as much as $95 billion in Europe over the next decade.
Under the plan, the U.S. group has chosen the east German city of Magdeburg as the site for a new multibillion-euro European chip factory, a person familiar with matter told Reuters on Feb. 26.
As part of an 8 billion euro package to support the economy and curb surging energy bills, Italy plans to allocate 150 million euros in 2022 and 500 million euros per year from 2023 until 2030, the decree showed.
The Italian government will promote ""research and development of microprocessor technology and investments in new industrial applications of innovative technologies,"" the legislation added.
Rome aims to use the funding also to convert existing industrial sites and favour the construction of new plants in Italy.
Chipmakers are scrambling to boost output after explosive demand for consumer electronics such as smartphones and computers resulting from the work-from-home trend during the COVID-19 pandemic led.
Meanwhile EU countries are eager to reduce their dependence on semiconductor supplies from China and the United States after recent supply chain problems.

2022-02-28 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Should Remain on Investors’ Radars,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-should-remain-on-investors-radars,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has some of the most sought-after gaming graphics processing units (GPUs) globally and is a leading player for visual computing across many fields. However, with the recent decrease in growth stocks, NVDA stock has fallen off a bit lately.

Nonetheless, Nvidia is a success story because it has continuously evolved and improved — not just in its products but also in its business practices. Therefore, the blip in NVDA stock is a short-term issue for investors.
Of course, there are several external factors affecting NVDA stock. One of the latest examples is the cyberattack against Nvidia. Additionally, concerns regarding interest rate hikes are an additional factor leading to the selloff in growth stocks.
However, NVIDIA is the clear leader in GPU technology, with an unassailable record of success. And with the potential of the metaverse and strong industry trends, investors should consider the semiconductor company as an excellent stock pick.
Also, you should always see valuations relative to what interest rates are expected to do. Under these circumstances, it is important to treat each investment on its merits.
Furthermore, there is another element weighing down sentiment for NVDA stock. Nvidia is abandoning plans to buy Arm Holdings. Following months of troubled speculation, the graphics giant’s proposed $40 billion acquisition of the company from Softbank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) is now not going through. In turn, SoftBank is reportedly preparing an initial public offering (IPO) of their Arm subsidiary as a plan B due to the deal falling apart.
Overall, on its own, NVDA stock is an excellent stock. Its recent quarterly earnings confirm everything is going in the right direction. Therefore, the sluggish price momentum is frustrating. But considering the solid fundamentals, a comeback is around the corner.
External Factors Affecting NVDA Stock
Nvidia is currently investigating a potential cyberattack following reports that the company may have been offline for two days. There was a network intrusion on Nvidia’s email system and developer tools, which caused outages over the last two days.
“We’re investigating an incident,” the company revealed. “We don’t have any additional information to share at this time.” The Nvidia spokesperson refused to provide further comment.
The outages from Nvidia have not been linked to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. However, the U.S. government has advised U.S. companies to be prepared for potential cyberattacks.
7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Recession
On a side note, Nvidia and other growth stocks are feeling the pressure of inflation. There is the potential of interest rates going up at some point, and this fear is causing the stocks to fall.
In fact, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) now thinks the Federal Reserve will raise rates seven times, up from a previous estimate of five increases. Also, the bank has revised its forecast of a 25 basis-point hike in interest rates this year, according to Jan Hatzius and other economists.
The move comes after the recent news that U.S. consumer prices jumped by the largest amount since 1982. That view is gaining momentum among investors, and they are expecting a similar timeline of hikes.
Nvidia’s Stellar Fourth-Quarter Earnings Report
Prior to its report on Feb. 16, Wall Street was expecting Nvidia to report a big quarter. And the company more than delivered when it released its earnings.
Nvidia reported a 69% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.32 on total sales of $7.64 billion, beating Wall Street expectations by a wide margin. The company also delivered impressive guidance to its shareholders.
Based on its estimates, NVIDIA is targeting around $8 billion in revenue for Q1 2023. Meanwhile, Wall Street forecasts revenue of $8.11 billion for the period, so they are in line with expectations.
Collectively, the company has a dominant force in the chip space by focusing on gaming, data centers and emerging metaverse business. Nvidia continues to lead in its data center and AI leadership as well, with an impressive positioning well into 2022. That said, metaverse and autonomous driving platforms are expected to provide new growth opportunities.
With Nvidia’s guidance for this quarter being strong, it seems that their products are doing well. They also beat expectations by a large margin and have several catalysts to ignite growth going forward.
However, despite the positive result, Nvidia’s share price has not traded well since their earnings release — down about 10% over that period. Part of the reason is the overall weak sentiment in the markets these days due to potential interest rate hikes. But, apart from these broader factors, less gross margin and higher operating expenses are likely factors the stock is under pressure.
However, on the fundamentals side, NVDA stock continues to deliver.
What the Failed ARM Deal Means for NVDA Stock
After Nvidia made little progress on approval of the ARM deal, a decision was taken to abandon it quietly. The purchase of Arm drew a lot of criticism from regulators and foundations in the semiconductor industry, and detractors included their customers. Furthermore, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued Nvidia over the Arm acquisition, as there were major concerns surrounding the company becoming too powerful.
Arm’s business model is built on the foundation of its technology being neutral. This means that it doesn’t have any proprietary rights to itself, allowing for greater flexibility and control in how you use these chips across different industries. In turn, this has made them an integral part of not just of phones but also cars or factory equipment alike.
Therefore, tech giants were extremely worried about Nvidia’s proposed ARM purchase in their industry.
This deal would be a huge victory for CEO Jensen Huang, who has built up his business into something that can potentially take down Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Thus, despite the acquisition falling through, Nvidia will continue to do well. It has always been an innovator in AI computing, which shows that its products constantly improve with time.
So, with or without the Arm purchase, Nvidia is a great investment.
NVIDIA’s Omniverse Platform
At Nvidia’s virtual GTC conference, Jensen Huang announced the release of their new software called Nvidia Omniverse. The creators say they hope this will be a collaboration tool that is highly scalable and used to create 3D works of art. They also introduced the much-anticipated Omniverse Avatar that allows developers to animate avatars easily on different operating systems, like Windows or Linux.
Moreover, on Jan. 4 at CES, Nvidia launched its recent software for creators who use their GPU. They also refreshed the GeForce RTX graphics card to encourage gamers to upgrade and use ray-tracing technology. Now, anyone can build and manage a virtual universe from the software’s built-in tools. It also creates simulated environments that help with disaster management.
Of course, Nvidia is primarily known for its graphics cards and GPU partnerships. But it’s also changing the way companies access data.
The company has just announced plans to create a digital twin of planet Earth with its Omniverse platform to try and predict how climate change will impact us in the next few decades. Other companies like IBM (NYSE:IBM) plan to use it for similar purposes like creating digital twins of environments.
Bottom Line on NVDA Stock
Collectively, the demand for Nvidia chips is sky-high with a shortage of supply. This opens up a gap in the market and will likely lead to the public getting more creative about where they buy their computers, video games and data centers. Right now, businesses are suffering another round of shortages; thus, Nvidia is also suffering.
Nevertheless, the firm is expanding its business with cloud gaming and data centers. Als, the adoption of metaverses could further boost demand for Nvidia chips because they will allow users more immersion into their virtual worlds than ever before.
The emerging metaverse is a digital representation of our world. But it’s only as good as the computing power and graphics chips that run on its surface. Therefore, Nvidia is a vital part of this new world, thanks to their cutting-edge GPUs that can render realistic visuals on-demand. The kind you see in VR games or holograms for avatars you might use.
Overall, NVDA stock is a stellar investment with excellent growth prospects and a bright outlook. It is a great long-term investment, so don’t let the sluggish price momentum stop you from investing.

Investors weren't happy with Intel's 2022 forecast, which explains the 5% drop in the company's share price following its investor meeting. The company has guided for $3.50 per share in earnings for this year on revenue of $76 billion. For comparison, Intel had generated $5.47 per share in adjusted earnings on $74.7 billion in revenue last year.
The company's gross margin is expected to shrink to 52% this year from last year's level of 57.7%. Additionally, Intel estimates a negative free cash flow of $1 billion to $2 billion this year. Not surprisingly, investors pressed the panic button looking at the 2022 forecast as its earnings are on track to drop big time this year.
However, investors shouldn't forget that Intel has set aside $27 billion as its net capital spending budget for 2022. That would be a huge increase over Intel's 2021 capital expenditure of $18.7 billion and nearly double the $14.3 billion capital spending figure in 2020. Intel is doing the right thing by bumping up its capital expenditure significantly this year given the developments at rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC.
The Taiwanese foundry giant has raised its 2022 capital expenditure forecast to a range of $40 billion to $44 billion, a jump of 40% at the midpoint of the guidance. So, it was important for Intel to come up with an aggressive spending plan to accelerate its product roadmap. That's exactly what Intel management believes that it is on track to do.
Intel's Alder Lake processors have already made an impression in the market by taking the gaming crown away from AMD, and Intel plans to keep up the pressure on its rival with the Raptor Lake processors this year. Intel estimates that the Raptor Lake processors could deliver a double-digit performance gain over the current Alder Lake processors as they will be packing more performance and energy cores.
The Raptor Lake processors will be followed by the Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake processors in 2023 and 2024. Based on the Intel 4 process, Meteor Lake is expected to start shipping in 2023 and help the chip giant go toe to toe with AMD's Zen 4 architecture that's expected to land later this year. It is worth noting that Zen 4 is based on a 5-nanometer (nm) manufacturing process, while the Intel 4 process is based on a 7nm manufacturing node.
However, Intel's chips have superior processor density, which would make its 7nm chips superior to AMD's 5nm offerings on paper. So, Intel's aggressive spending plan is likely to aid its turnaround and crush AMD's resurgence in the CPU market from 2023. This explains why Intel is confident of an improvement in its financial performance from next year.
Things are about to get better
Intel management estimates that its revenue could increase in the mid- to high-single digits in 2023 and 2024, while gross margin is expected to remain between 51% and 53%. The company expects operating expenses to range between 28% and 30% during this period as it tries to regain its process lead.
Intel forecasts that its growth will kick into a higher gear in 2025 and 2026, with revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12% and a gross margin level of 54% to 58%. Operating expenses are also expected to come down to a range of 25% to 27%. So, Intel could reward patient investors with solid upside in the long run.
As it turns out, Intel carries an analyst-averaged price target of $70, which would translate into a 55% upside from current levels. The semiconductor giant could hit that target if it can execute on its roadmap, which is why the stock looks like a good bet right now as it is trading at just 9.2 times trailing earnings -- a multiple that may seem very attractive once it steps on the gas.
