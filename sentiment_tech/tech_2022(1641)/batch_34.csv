On Monday, May 9, some popular names were down over 9%. Today's video focuses on recent news affecting Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). Here are some highlights.
Intel has recently entered the discrete graphics card market with its Arc Alchemist gaming cards. In the first quarter of 2022, it released Arc to various laptops, and in the second quarter of 2022, it was supposed to release graphics cards for the desktop market. Unfortunately, the desktop graphics cards have been pushed to the summer of 2022, and laptops with Arc are very hard to find as it seems there is a very low supply.
Intel is also entering the high-performance computing market with its Ponte Vecchio graphics card. During Intel'searnings call management confirmed that it had started testing the product with customers. Intel has not shown much revenue growth in the past, but maybe this new market could be the catalyst that triggers growth for the company.
On May 6, the SEC charged Nvidia with a $5.5 million fine due to Nvidia providing inadequate disclosures about the impact of crypto mining on its revenue. The penalties were for two 10-Q forms for its fiscal year 2018, where Nvidia did not disclose that its gaming business sales were driven significantly by crypto mining.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-05-10 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel launches new AI chips, challenging Nvidia's market",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-launches-new-ai-chips-challenging-nvidias-market,,,"By Steven Scheer and Jane Lanhee Lee
JERUSALEM/SAN FRANCISCO, May 10 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O on Tuesday launched a new chip called Gaudi2 focused on artificial intelligence computing, as the chip manufacturer makes a bigger push into the AI chip market currently dominated by Nvidia Corp NVDA.O.
Gaudi2 is the second generation processor by Habana Labs, an Israeli AI chip startup Intel bought in late 2019 for about $2 billion. AI chip startups have been getting huge investments in recent years as AI computing is one of the fastest growing areas for data centers.
Prying market share away from Nvidia has been a challenge as many AI researchers and companies have been accustomed to using Nvidia’s software platform CUDA. So in addition to new chips for AI computing, Intel told Reuters it has been focusing on its software development.
“CUDA is not a moat that Nvidia can really stand on for long,” said chief business officer at Habana Labs Eitan Medina, adding that Intel’s software platform is open standard, free to download and use from GitHub, the software development site. “Now the question is who can do the work efficiently?”
Medina said the Gaudi2 was twice as fast as Habana's previous AI chip and manufactured at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s 2330.TW 7-nanometer transistor technology from 16-nanometers previously. Generally the smaller the transistor size, the faster and more powerful the chip is.
Intel also launched a new chip called Greco for inferencing work: taking an AI algorithm and making a prediction or identifying an object.
Sandra Rivera, who heads Intel's data center and AI, said the AI chip market is estimated to grow some 25% a year in the next five years to reach around $50 billion. ""We intend to invest and innovate to lead this market,” she said, adding that increasingly the investments will be in software, both for expanding Intel's team and buying other companies.

2022-05-10 00:00:00+00:00,Is Trending Stock Intel Corporation (INTC) a Buy Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-trending-stock-intel-corporation-intc-a-buy-now,,,"Intel (INTC) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -7.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -11% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Intel falls in, has lost 19.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.69 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -46.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -18.7%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $3.53 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -35.5%. This estimate has changed +1.1% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.69 indicates a change of +4.6% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +139.3%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intel is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
In the case of Intel, the consensus sales estimate of $18.02 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -8.2%. The $75.55 billion and $78.72 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -3.2% and +4.2%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $18.35 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.7%. EPS of $0.87 for the same period compares with $1.39 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.18%. The EPS surprise was +8.75%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

2022-05-09 00:00:00+00:00,Which Battered Blue-Chip Stocks Are Most Oversold?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/which-battered-blue-chip-stocks-are-most-oversold,,,"Big rallies and massive sell-offs have been the theme going into May 2022. With technology stocks — once again — leading us lower, thanks in part to the 10-year note eclipsing 3%, many of the damaged blue chips are looking beyond oversold.
In this piece, we'll use TipRanks' Comparison Tool to check out three of them to see which holds the most bounce-back potential for the year ahead. Each firm may have lost its way, but valuations are starting to become absurd.
Boeing (BA)
Boeing has done nothing but nosedive over the past year. Shares collapsed from around $250 per share to $150 and change per share. The list of problems continues to grow for Boeing, with the abysmal quarterly earnings and an Air Force One deal that has CEO David Calhoun sounding regretful.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump's Air Force One deal is haunting Boeing to this day. With operational hiccups delaying deliveries for select aircraft, it seems like nothing can go right for the aircraft maker.
Though Calhoun doesn't yet plan to retire, a major shift at the upper level may be required to get Boeing back on the right track.
Although Boeing can't seem to get any wind beneath its wings, demand is likely to remain, given the duopolistic market it operates in.
With a potential recession underway, Boeing seems like a lost cause. Still, the valuation is severely depressed, and being a member of a duopoly has its perks.
Wall Street analysts are standing by Boeing amid its freefall, with a Strong Buy rating and an average BA stock price target of $228, implying 71% upside from current levels. (See BA stock forecast on TipRanks)
Intel (INTC)
Intel is another company that's lost its way. The once-cherished semi company fell behind in the chip race, and it could struggle to catch up. Though Intel has a new CEO Patrick Gelsinger, and a strategic multi-year plan to regain the lead in chips, questions linger as to whether the firm can execute.
The firm could face an uphill battle as it looks to keep pace with Apple, and its M-series line of chips.
Intel's 14th-generation Meteor Lake chip is slated to launch in 2023. By then, Apple may have already raised the performance bar.
The stakes are high, and investors don't seem to be giving Intel the benefit of the doubt. Why should they? The chip space is fiercely competitive, and the global chip shortage complicates things greatly.
Though long-term global chip demand is a positive for chip makers as a whole, one can't help but worry that Intel may have to resort to discounting, given rivals could raise the bar to heights that could prove difficult to reach.
Wall Street analysts aren't so convinced with Intel, even after its drop. It has a Hold rating, and an average INTC stock price target of $51.10, implying ~19% upside from current levels. (See INTC stock forecast on TipRanks)
AT&T (T)
AT&T is an old-time telecom titan that's on the right side of 5G tailwinds. After spinning off its media businesses, management now has the opportunity to revamp growth in wireless.
For the first quarter, wireless growth was remarkable. The company is starting to do a lot of things right, and narrowing its focus is an effort that could allow T stock to break out of its funk.
Though wireless numbers are gaining traction, the implications of a recession on such growth are less clear. In any case, the company seems like it's ready to continue swimming forward.
With media out of the equation, the new AT&T is arguably the best version of itself we've seen in decades. Its investments in next-gen telecom infrastructure will slowly pay meaningful dividends with time.
Still, the major question mark with AT&T is its considerable debt load. Even after spinning off the media assets, the company's debt-to-equity ratio is on the high end at over one. As rates rise, so too will AT&T's costs of borrowing, making the telecom scene somewhat less attractive than it used to be.
In any case, management continues to execute.
Wall Street analysts are mildly optimistic, with a Moderate Buy rating and an average T stock price target of $22.50, implying 15% upside from current levels. (See AT&T stock forecast on TipRanks)
Conclusion
Blue-chip stocks are feeling the selling pressure these days. The following blue chips may have lost their way, but with plans to regain dominance, the risk/reward may be getting too good to ignore.
Of the three, Wall Street analysts are most bullish on Boeing, and the least bullish on Intel. I'm inclined to agree with analysts. Boeing stock seems to be the best of the batch.

2022-05-09 00:00:00+00:00,Advanced Micro Devices Stock Has a Positive Upside After its Latest Earnings Release,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/advanced-micro-devices-stock-has-a-positive-upside-after-its-latest-earnings-release,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) just released a stellar first-quarter (Q1) earnings report on May 3. Revenue was up 71% year-over-year with higher gross and operating margins. Moreover, the company raised its guidance for 2022. This includes higher organic growth and the addition of its recently acquired Xilinx business. As a result, investors can expect to see a higher AMD stock price by the end of the year.
Analysts now have an average price target of $133.63 per share, representing a potential gain of 40.1% for AMD stock. Similarly, TipRanks reports that the average price target of 23 analysts who have written on the stock in the last 3 months is $132.40. That represents 42.17% more than today’s price of $95.34.
AMD showed strong results from its server processor line of products, as well as its new Xilinx business. This is despite the softness in the general PC business. According to Barron’s, its stellar results show that it is taking market share from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
7 Defensive Dividend Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now
On the other hand, Barron’s says that a research firm reported that Q1 PC demand was down 5% and analysts are lowering their target prices for chipmakers like AMD. The weakening economy is lowering consumer demand along with supply shortages for PC parts.
This leaves investors in AMD stock in a tricky situation. The company says that the outlook for its revenue in Q2 will be 69% higher than last year and 10% quarter-over-quarter. For the full year of 2022, AMD now expects revenue will rise 60% over 2021.
AMD stock trades at 22 times 2022 forecast earnings and 19.4 times 2023 earnings, according to Yahoo! Finance, using Refinitiv analyst survey data. This is higher than Intel at 12.6 times and 12.3 times earnings, respectively. However, AMD stock is still well below its average historical forward price-to-earnings ratio of 51.6 times over the last five years, according to Morningstar. So, if AMD can still outperform analyst expectations of a general slowdown in the chip market, AMD stock might move higher by the end of the year.

2022-05-09 00:00:00+00:00,3 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy in May,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dividend-paying-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-may,,,"Dividends are underrated by technology investors. If you buy into a stock that consistently raises its dividend per share, it can provide a growing stream of cash that you can take home as income or reinvest to buy more shares. A lot of the most popular technology stocks these days are unprofitable and don't pay out a dividend to shareholders, however, if you look at some older companies that are already profitable, there are plenty of technology stocks that pay out a dividend each year. These profitable businesses can be safer stocks to own in volatile market environments like the one facing investors today.
Here are three top dividend-paying technology stocks to buy this month.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Microsoft: 0.86% yield
Everyone knows Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), the technology giant that has been a leader in enterprise and consumer software for many decades. The company owns and operates multiple business lines, including Microsoft Office, Xbox video game consoles, LinkedIn, and Microsoft Azure.
Microsoft is one of the largest stocks in the world, with a market cap of $2.2 trillion, and for good reason. The company generated $49.4 billion in revenue just last quarter, up 19% year over year, and $20.4 billion in operating income, up 18% year over year. Steady growth is coming from Microsoft Office and the Xbox division, but the highlight of this business right now is Intelligent Cloud and Microsoft Azure. The Intelligent Cloud segment grew revenue 26% year over year to $19.1 billion in the quarter, with Microsoft Azure growing revenue 46% year over year (management doesn't disclose a specific revenue number). With the overall cloud computing market expected to grow at a double-digit rate through 2030, Azure should continue to benefit as one of the key infrastructure providers to the industry.
As of this writing, Microsoft has a 0.86% dividend yield and trades at a trailing price-to-operating income (P/OI) of 27. That P/OI is not cheap, and the dividend yield is not very high, but with consistent growth and a dominant position within its key operating segments, Microsoft looks like a safe technology stock you can own for many years.
2. Texas Instruments: 2.61% yield
If Microsoft Azure is one of the backbones of the cloud computing industry, then semiconductors are the backbone for computing in general. More simply, none of our digital or internet-connected devices would work without semiconductor-based computer chips in them. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) is one of the leading manufacturers of semiconductors worldwide, specifically focusing on the industrial and automotive markets. It has over 80,000 products for numerous different industries, serving different niches that customers around the world need.
In the first quarter of this year, TI's revenue grew 14% year over year to $4.9 billion, and operating income grew 32% year over year to $2.56 billion. There is a durable tailwind for semiconductor products across both the industrial and automotive industries as more and more companies decide to digitize their products. The growth of electric vehicle manufacturing is a great example of this. This tailwind should benefit TI's demand over the next decade.
TI has a market cap of $162 billion. Free cash flow, management's preferred metric to measure profitability, was $6.45 billion over the last 12 months. That gives the stock a price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) of 25. The dividend yield sits at 2.61%, giving investors a healthy stream of income each year just for owning shares. With the growing demand for semiconductors around the world, TI's free cash flow and dividend payouts should consistently grow over the next 10 years and beyond, benefiting shareholders who hold for the long term.
3. Taiwan Semiconductor: 1.57% yield
There is one more semiconductor company to look at: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (NYSE: TSM), or just TSMC. The Taiwanese manufacturer is the market leader in the semiconductor foundry industry. It has a unique business model compared to an integrated manufacturer like Intel. Instead of designing and building the chips themselves, TSMC lets other companies like Apple design chips for their electronic devices and solely focuses on the manufacturing process. This focus and decades of expertise has led TSMC to become the most technologically advanced semiconductor manufacturer in the world, with over 50% market share.
In the last 12 months, TSMC generated $59 billion in revenue and $25 billion in operating income. Management expects revenue to grow at a 15% to 20% compound growth rate through 2026 as the company rides the growing demand for semiconductors around the globe. This will give the company plenty of cash flow to support and likely grow its current 1.57% dividend yield. At a market cap of $468 billion, the stock trades at a P/OI of 18.7, which seems cheap given TSMC's dominance in the industry and a clear path to growing its financials over the next decade.
MSFT Dividend Per Share (TTM) data by YCharts
Over the last 10 years, the dividend per share for all three of these stocks has gone up by over 200%, making them some of the top large-cap dividend growers in the world. If their financials continue to grow over the next 10 years, it is highly likely this dividend-per-share growth will continue. This will build a growing stream of income for you if you buy and hold these stocks for the long haul.

2022-05-08 00:00:00+00:00,These 3 Tech Stocks Are Building the Future,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-3-tech-stocks-are-building-the-future-1,,,"Companies don't earn profits just by magic. First, they have to invest in products, services, and infrastructure to provide useful goods and/or services for customers. The more useful the product or service, and the more difficult that product or service is to replicate, the more a company and its shareholders stand to benefit.
Today, there are three household-name tech giants investing billions of dollars in massive projects that could pay off hugely in the future. However, with the market concerned about interest rates and the economy, these stocks are getting punished for that very spending today.
But for long-term investors, a beaten-down stock with a big potential future revenue stream spells ""opportunity.""
Amazon is building a massive e-commerce infrastructure
Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) sold off after its recent earnings report. Revenue was in line with guidance, but operating income declined year over year, as Amazon's costs soared in its e-commerce business.
Before the pandemic hit, Amazon had been investing in its logistics infrastructure to provide free one-day delivery, down from its previous two-delivery promise for Prime customers. That was a huge undertaking.
Then, when the pandemic hit, Amazon had to turbocharge its spending on infrastructure to satisfy all the demand for its regular two-day service. Given rising labor and fuel costs, Amazon's costs and capital expenditures soared. Over the next two years, Amazon doubled the size of the fulfillment network that it had taken nearly 30 years to build prior to COVID-19.
On the Q1 conference call with analysts, Amazon said it had gone from undercapacity during the pandemic to overcapacity today, as e-commerce demand corrected back to its prior course. While that's pressuring margins in the near term, it also means that Amazon's logistics platform is ready to shine. Management said the company was only now just getting delivery speeds back to pre-COVID levels.
Now that Amazon has built out this massive logistics network, it should have a huge advantage over rivals. If you can get free shipping to your door in one day, or even the same day, you'll have even less of an impulse to visit a store -- especially if fuel prices stay this high. That could lead to increased sales in the second half of the year.
Moreover, Amazon just opened up ""Buy with Prime"" to online merchants off the Amazon platform, giving independent e-commerce companies access to its fast, free shipping, payments infrastructure, and free returns. Amazon's delivery network now rivals those of a FedEx or UPS -- and it can probably undercut their prices, since it will be using spare capacity from shipping its own goods.
Since revenue is decelerating in the first half of the year over difficult comparisons, Amazon's margins are down. However, profits should inflect upwards when revenue grows again, since Amazon won't be spending as much. That could happen as soon as Prime Day in Q3 or the holiday shopping season in Q4.
Meta Platforms: What's in a name?
The market has also punished Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: FB), formerly known as Facebook, for a massive project into which it's plowing billions of dollars every quarter. Late last year, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the company would be changing its name to Meta Platforms, while investing billions to build out the metaverse, a catchall term for a new digital world that feels like reality.
In combination with the name change, Meta Platforms began to break out results from the metaverse-focused ""Reality Labs"" segment. This exposure showed that Reality Labs is burning about $3 billion every quarter.
Today, investors really don't want to see companies spending billions of dollars on a futuristic vision with an uncertain payoff. On the recent conference call, Zuckerberg said: ""[T]his is laying the groundwork for what I expect to be a very exciting 2030s when this is like -- when this is sort of more established as the primary computing platform at that point. I think that there will be results along the way for that, too. But I do think that this is going to be a longer cycle.""
Meta Platforms will be releasing a version of its Horizon metaverse operating system this year, and it will likely monetize more opportunities along the way. Last quarter, sales of Oculus headsets were $695 million, up 30% over the past year. Meta is also likely to realize platform fees from sales of digital goods in its metaverse over the next few years.
The company's ambitions leave me torn. While I think the metaverse may be an enormous opportunity, of these three stocks, Meta Platforms is the most likely to cause disappointment. Will the metaverse be widely adopted as the ""next major computing platform,"" as Zuckerberg says? Or will it just be a niche application for gamers and tech enthusiasts? At this point, it's hard to say.

Intel is attempting the ""biggest comeback in semiconductor history""
Meanwhile, the market has really soured on Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in recent years. That's because Intel used to make the best and fastest chips in the world, but a few years ago, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) passed it at the leading edge. That gave Intel's rivals a chance to leapfrog ""Chipzilla"" to produce the most advanced, power-efficient chips on the market.
TSMC doesn't produce its own chips, but rather acts as a third-party manufacturer for most of the world's leading chip designers. Under new CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel is now embarking on an ambitious quest. Not only does the company hope to catch up to TSMC on leading-edge technology for its own chips, but Gelsinger also wants Intel to become an outsourced foundry to other designers too, rivaling TSMC. Given that more and more large tech companies are now designing their own custom chips for specific applications, that makes a lot of sense.
Can Intel pull it off? Again, it's uncertain what the payoff will be, but as of last quarter, it already had a $1 billion revenue run rate producing chips for third parties. Gelsinger also said on the recent earnings call that the company had engaged 10 qualified ""anchor clients"" to produce chips once it has built out its foundries. Intel is beginning construction on multibillion-dollar fabrication plants in Arizona and Ohio, and across Europe. And it jump-started its foundry ambitions recently, announcing the purchase of third-party foundry Tower Semiconductor for $5.4 billion.
Intel will be spending $27 billion in capital expenditures this year, and will likely ramp those investments over the next few years as it builds out a large manufacturing ecosystem outside of Asia, where most of chip production occurs today. The company will have to raise subsidies from governments to do so, but it seems momentum for legislation will lead it to pass, both in Europe and the U.S.
If I had to bet, I would say Intel pulls it off, but this will be a very expensive undertaking, and the payoff won't be for years. Still, it appears Gelsinger and new chief financial officer David Zinsner are believers: Each bought around $250,000 worth of stock on the open market last week after the market swooned. Intel now trades at just 7.4 times earnings, so if its investments pay off, that could be a huge boon for investors two to three years from now.

2022-05-08 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia Currently Has a Huge Lead on AMD,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-currently-has-a-huge-lead-on-amd,,,"The semiconductor market continues to get hammered regardless of the strong growth the industry has reported during earnings. Today's video focuses on recent news affecting Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Here are some highlights.
Nvidia is the only out of the three that has yet to report earnings. The wait is almost over as earnings are scheduled for Wednesday, May 25 after the market closes. I look at NewEgg's website in the video, a store used to purchase computer components. At the moment of recording, 29 out of the top 30 best-selling desktop graphics cards belong to Nvidia.
AMD recently announced a fantastic earnings quarter with double-digit growth in all of its markets. CEO Lisa Su mentioned that this is the third straight quarter of over 100% revenue growth for its server processors. AMD investors should put June 9 on their calendars, as AMD will host its financial analyst day and will inform investors on how Xilinx's technology will integrate with AMD's core products.
Intel has recently acquired Siru Innovations, a company with decades of experience in the graphics market. The acquisition will accelerate Intel's push into the discrete graphics market. Intel's consumer graphics cards are expected to hit shelves later this year, but this market has heavy competition from Nvidia and AMD.

When will the Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) free fall end?
AMD stock is down 37% already, so it should find suitors.
This should be an opportunity to accumulate AMD stock for the long term.
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock fell 6% yesterday. But I’ll argue today that it’s not through any specific fault of its own. My long-term prognosis for AMD stock is still optimal. Short term, we can remain on guard, but there aren’t any internal issues that need fixing. Firs, Thursday was a painful day for all of Wall Street not just AMD. Wednesday’s jubilation after the FOMC meeting, turned into a bull funeral. The bears came back with a vengeance and completely demolished investors the next day.
Secondly, the chip sector is already reeling from shortages and backlogs. The effects of locking down the world for Covid-19 still linger. The 2020 disruption has caught up with the manufacturers and is creating serious bottlenecks. The tech sector is feeling this more than most other industries. Regardless, AMD has managed to compensate and adapt judging by the reports so far.
Ticker Company Current Price
AMD Advanced Micro Devices $93.87
Supply Chain Issues Are Partly to Blame
Despite the abysmal sourcing conditions, AMD has continued to deliver strong results. Management reported earnings this week and the stock rallied for good reason. AMD grew sales 71% and earnings 117%, leaving no doubt over the quality of the team. The drop yesterday merely brings AMD back to its pre-earnings base.
With such blowout numbers, the opinions are almost unanimously positive. I found one price target downgrade, but it was from $165 to $150, so it’s not an issue. According to Yahoo Finance, AMD needs to rally more than 40% before it reaches its average price target.
7 Transportation Stocks to Avoid During These Trying Times
This month there are challenges from the Federal Reserve fears. There is also the matter of the old Wall Street adage of sell in May and go away. But, in the long term, these are mere temporary hiccups. There are technical challenges as long as it’s under $102 per share. But there are support zones below and would find footing with the markets.
Meanwhile, the downside now creates opportunities for new investors. Under the leadership of Lisa Su AMD stock continues to shine. The financial metrics are beyond reproach from all aspects. Although Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is still larger and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) much flashier, AMD is a star.
Management more than tripled revenues and net income in just five years. Regardless, AMD managed to hold its valuation at a reasonable level. In fact, it is 30% cheaper than its rival NVDA. Even from an absolute basis it’s on par with similar fast growing companies.
AMD Stock Belongs On All Stock Shopping Lists

The company’s earnings report should give investors confidence in AMD. The company beat expectations and forecast a strong outlook despite the current challenges it faces. The team is executing well on plans and not hiding behind excuses. The field is competitive, but they are a top contender with plenty of room to prosper.
All aspects of their businesses are growing, and the trend is not about to fade. Demand will remain strong for a decade as we digitize the world. There are new applications coming up constantly, so AMD will be busy. The move to the metaverse alone could fuel a new kind of tech application. It doesn’t take a wild imagination to see AMD prosper under such scenarios.
Retail investors would do well to form their own opinions of AMD stock. When the bullish thesis is this obvious we don’t need the experts. Wall Street tends to complicate things with cryptic ratings. Here is a clear main street statement: If the markets are higher in the future, then so is AMD!

2022-05-06 00:00:00+00:00,2 Reddit Stocks to Buy and Hold for Years,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-reddit-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-for-years-1,,,"There was a time when stock-picking was left up to your advisor rather than the crowd. The advent of the internet and online access to stock research put some of that power in investors' hands, but they were still ultimately steered by professionals. The web'sinvestment advicebulletin boards, conversely, were the proverbial wild west.
The amateur crowd has gotten rather savvy in recent years, though, collectively identifying quality names with plans to hold onto them for the long haul. Here's a closer look at two of the Reddit crowd's favorite stocks right now that make good sense as long-term picks.
1. Advanced Micro Devices
In an arena that includes powerhouses like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) as competitors, it's easy to look past Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). But that would be a mistake. See, AMD has found its niche as a computer tech manufacturer.
That niche is value, by the way. While Intel's processors are still the preferred brand among consumers as well as corporations operating data centers, the company's CPUs aren't cheap. Advanced Micro Devices offers solid processing performance at a more affordable price. Certainly, there are exceptions to this generalization, but not many. And, AMD does particularly well with individual video gamers, who are generally far more budget-minded than an enterprise customer might be.
Advanced Micro Devices' graphics cards also fit the bill for cost-conscious consumers. Although Nvidia's overall portfolio of graphics processing tech may be superior -- particularly for artificial intelligence applications -- AMD's lower prices makes its wares far more accessible to most consumers. In fact, four of the top five picks on Techspot's current list of cost-effective GPUs are AMD cards.

The company's hold on its sliver of the computer hardware market is at least partially evident in last quarter's results. Revenue of $5.9 billion was not only record-breaking and 71% better than year-ago levels, but topped analyst expectations of just over $5.0 billion. Operating earnings of $1.13 per share also beat the consensus of $0.91, more than doubling the bottom line of $0.52 per share booked during the first quarter of last year.
It was the reason for the beat, however, that makes AMD such a compelling name to step into here. While it's a hit with consumers, the company is clearly upping its enterprise game. Sales of computer processors used in servers more than doubled for the third quarter in a row thanks to last year's acquisition of Xilinx, data centers are a key reason Advanced Micro Devices is modeling 69% top-line growth for the quarter now underway.
Simply put, AMD is working its way deeper into the institutional market without losing sight of the consumer market. It's a shift that could have a multi-year impact, particularly in light of Intel's 7-nanometer foundry woes.
2. Airbnb
The other surprisingly favorite stock among Reddit's users worth pointing out here is the home-rental platform Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB).
It's difficult to say to what degree the pandemic altered the leisure travel landscape. It's not exactly a stretch to say, however, that hotels were fighting a significant cultural shift -- as well as affordability issues -- even before COVID-19 rattled the world. As it turns out, a great number of leisure travelers are OK with staying at an individual's rental house as a lower-cost alternative to a hotel stay, and more people are embracing the idea every day.
AirDNA (not to be confused with AirBNB itself) says short-term rental demand grew 22.4% in 2021, and despite the unofficial, effective end to the pandemic, the market research company estimates demand for such rentals will grow another 14.1% this year. That growth isn't expected to cool anytime soon either. Precedence Research estimates the annual vacation rental market will swell from 2020's $22.7 billion to $111.2 billion per year by 2030 as more individuals convert homes into travel-lodging spots and more consumers gain comfort with the idea.
This outlook puts Airbnb in an enviable position. It's already one of the industry's biggest players, boasting a portfolio of more than 6 million rental homes. As the business matures, though, look for people with homes to rent to gravitate to the listing sites attracting the biggest crowd of would-be vacationers. That again makes Airbnb a compelling prospect, as it's arguably the most recognized brand name in the business.
The proof of its growing reach is evident in the numbers. Last quarter's total booking of 102.1 million nights was not only record-breaking but 26% better than pre-COVID bookings from three years back. Revenue of $1.5 billion was 80% better than it was three years ago, indicating its 4 million home-owning hosts' pricing power is firming up. That's pricing power that helps Airbnb's top and bottom lines as well.
The company isn't yet profitable, for the record. But, this year's projected 31% increase in revenue should carry Airbnb out of the red and into the black, with full-year earnings of $1.26 per share in the cards. That swing to a profit could be a game-changer for the stock's performance.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares jumped 9% on better-than-expected earnings and a less hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve.
The outsized gains have spectators wondering if the worst is over and if it’s time to bottom fish the fallen angel.
Directional trades remain tricky, but cash flow strategies on AMD stock could be worth a shot.
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
It may not seem like it based on the 9% advance, but Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) actually took investors on a wild ride Wednesday. AMD stock leaped out of the gate on the back of an earnings hat trick. The company beat on the top and bottom lines while raising forward guidance.
The upbeat forecast set AMD apart from the likes of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which offered disappointing forecasts during its report. Despite the strong open, AMD stock quickly reversed, nearly filling its 8% gap ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting.
But what could have been an ominous bearish reversal was rescued by Fed Chair Jerome Powell in its post-meeting presser. As widely expected, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by half a percent. More importantly, Powell laid to rest concerns of an even larger rate hike next month.
With that, a market bracing for the worst went wild. AMD stock capitalized on the buying bonanza, reclaimed early-morning losses and finished up over 9%.
Let’s take a closer look at the earnings report. Then I’ll break down the AMD stock price chart and explain why bulls still face an uphill battle.
AMD Advanced Micro Devices $94.53
Advanced Micro Devices Smashed Earnings
AMD released its first-quarter numbers on Tuesday and gave shareholders something to cheer about. Earnings per share came in at $1.13 versus 91 cents expected, marking a 117% year-over-year increase.
7 Restaurant Stocks Ready for a 'Revenge Travel' Rally
Revenue ballooned to $5.89 billion, topping the $5.52 billion expected. This marked a 71% increase compared to the year ago quarter. The company anticipates $6.5 billion in sales for the second quarter, which is well above analyst forecasts of $6.38 billion.
Advanced Micro Devices hit all the right notes, giving plenty of evidence to support buying shares. Unfortunately, the solid fundamental backdrop is competing with souring sentiment and troublesome technicals on AMD’s price chart.
AMD Stock Needs Time

Despite earnings and sales growth continuing to dazzle, AMD’s share price has fallen nearly 50% from last year’s peak. Red-hot inflation and the accompanying upward pressure placed on interest rates have investors re-pricing growth stocks.
The negative sentiment surrounding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine isn’t helping matters, either. Given the drubbing suffered over the past six months, it will take more than a single thrust to reverse the trend.
In fairness to the bulls, yesterday was impressive. Returning to close at the high of the day after falling so far in the morning was an intraday reversal for the history books. Moreover, volume ballooned past 225 million shares to show significant buying pressure. AMD stock closed above the 20-day moving average and a short-term resistance zone.
Unfortunately, many bearish arguments remain in play. First, the downswing preceding this week’s rally carried the downtrend to a new low on increasing momentum. Second, the 20-day and 50-day moving averages are still gliding lower.
Third, we’ve seen three previous bounce attempts fail in recent months. And finally, we didn’t see any immediate follow-through Thursday morning. Therefore, we need time and more bullish price action to signal that a sustained trend reversal is forming. I’m not a fan of aggressive directional plays here for these reasons.
How to Trade AMD Stock Now
The higher probability and smarter way to wade in is with a cash flow-based options strategy that will still profit if AMD doesn’t see substantial upside. Selling puts is my favorite play here. Because of this morning’s weakness, I would wait for an up day before pulling the trigger.
The Trade: Sell the June 10 $80 naked put for $2.
Consider this a bet that AMD stock stays above $80 for the next month. If it does, you’ll pocket the premium received. If it doesn’t, you’re on the hook for buying shares at $78.

The main topics will be Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) and its push into the metaverse, positive news affecting Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM) recent earnings report. Here are some highlights.
Spotify has recently entered the metaverse by creating an experience inside Roblox's (NYSE: RBLX) platform. The long-term plan for the metaverse is for it to be a digital concert hall where Spotify can host digital concerts or other experiences for selected artists. The Spotify experience will transform into a theme park focused on K-Pop music and K-Pop artists in the upcoming weeks.
Intel has not been a popular stock to own, mainly due to its low growth. Intel recently reported its first-quarter earnings, and revenue was down 1% year over year (YoY), unlike many other semiconductor companies reporting solid double-digit growth. The ship might be turning around for Intel. In the video, I discuss how one of Intel's consumer products has become a bestseller.
Qualcomm is a stock that is also not popular even though it is seeing strong growth as its considered a company that provides solutions for phones. Still, Qualcomm has started expanding into other emerging markets like automotive and high-performance computing. Qualcomm recently reported 61% YoY revenue growth driven by strength in all its segments.

2022-05-04 00:00:00+00:00,Why Advanced Micro Devices Stock Fell 21.8% in April,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-advanced-micro-devices-stock-fell-21.8-in-april,,,"What happened
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) fell 21.8% in a rough April, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The semiconductor company was hit hard in a bad market for technology stocks, especially those that cater to consumer PCs.
Semiconductors tend to be sensitive to market movements, both to the upside and the downside. In addition, higher-valued growth stocks were hit especially hard last month, as the market became increasingly worried about inflation and higher interest rates. As a high-growth semiconductor stock, AMD found itself on the wrong end of the general market mood.
Yet as Tuesday night's earnings report showed, there's certainly nothing wrong with AMD's operational performance at the business level.
So what
There wasn't too much company-specific news during April, aside from the announcement early in the month that AMD would be purchasing data center platform company Pensando for $1.9 billion. Pensando makes a customized processor and software stack that allows customers to optimize data workloads across multiple types of computing chips and architectures. It should go a long way toward bolstering AMD's data center offerings, which consist of its EPYC processors, graphics chips (GPUs), Xilinx field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and other system-on-chips (SOCs).
Still, the Pensando acquisition was not the reason for AMD's decline last month. More likely, investors took note of high inflation and the need for the Fed to raise interest rates quickly. Again, higher rates mean future earnings are discounted more, which hurts growth stocks. Hiking rates too far could cause a recession, which wouldn't be good for chip stocks, either.
Moreover, in the middle of the month, analysts at Baird downgraded AMD's prominent GPU competitor Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). That followed a big downgrade from Truist for AMD, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), as well as Nvidia. These downgrades came as channel checks from both analysts revealed slowing demand for consumer devices, such as personal computers. Obviously, PCs boomed during the pandemic due to people working from home more, so there could be a bit of a hangover as people go back to the office.
At the end of the month, Intel released an earnings report that beat expectations but disappointed in terms of second-quarter guidance, compounding fears about the PC sector. AMD is currently taking market share from Intel in both personal computing as well as data centers, but the tepid Intel forecast was extrapolated to the whole sector.

Now what
As it turns out, the market might have been a bit too pessimistic in April -- on AMD as well as other chip stocks. Tuesday night, AMD delivered impressive first-quarter results that blew away expectations for revenue and earnings per share (EPS). Overall revenue grew 71%, with enterprise, custom, and embedded chips skyrocketing 88%, reflecting the strong growth of the cloud. Even the computing and graphics segment, which is exposed to PCs, grew 33%, as market share gains were able to overcome some softness in the industry. EPS was up 117% to $1.13, beating expectations for $0.91.
On the conference call, CEO Lisa Su addressed the PC market concern, saying, ""Although the PC market is experiencing some softness coming off multiple quarters of near-record unit shipments, our focus remains on the premium, gaming, and commercial portions of the market, where we see strong growth opportunities and expect to continue gaining overall client revenue share.""
So while the market appeared to sell AMD ahead of potential bad news and recession in April, it looks like the selling might have been overdone, given AMD's strong ongoing results and market share gains.

The Mesa, Arizona-based company is developing an electric truck that it says can match the towing and payload capabilities of diesel-powered vehicles and will be optimal for use in the agriculture, utility and construction industries.
The company intends to list on the Nasdaq this summer under the ticker symbol ""AMV"" and will use the IPO proceeds to scale up operations, it said on Wednesday. Atlis declined to disclose how much it expected to raise through its offering.
While there is strong investor interest in the EV sector due to the success of Tesla Inc TSLA.O and concerns over climate change, Atlis' listing plans come at a time when aglobal marketrout has stalled IPO activity in the United States.
Jitters over the Ukraine conflict and aggressive policy tightening by the Federal Reserve have in recent months forced several companies such as file-sharing firm WeTransfer and bitcoin miner Rhodium Enterprise to shelve their listing plans.

While investors look ahead to the central bank’s monetary policy meeting later today, consumer tech stocks could be worth noting. By and large, this area of the stock market has been and still is a viable play now. As most would know, consumers turned to some of the biggest names in the industry amidst the pandemic. Whether it is streaming firms, gaming companies, or even social media platforms, this is apparent. Also, some of the top fintech names like PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Block (NYSE: SQ) also received plenty of attention from investors and consumers alike.
Fast forward to today where pandemic conditions are considerably better, and consumer tech stocks are in an interesting position. The likes of semiconductor manufacturer Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) to productivity software titan Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) remain as crucial as ever. Even as the world learns to live with the pandemic, it is doing so with the help of tech. At the same time, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), one of the biggest players in the consumer tech space, continues to thrive. Just last week, the company topped earnings estimates across the board and authorized a $90 billion share buyback program. Furthermore, even Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) picked up an additional $600 million worth of Apple’s shares last quarter as well.
Not to mention, travel firms are also seeing an uptick in their core operations as well. With companies like Hilton Hotels (NYSE: HLT) seeing sales return to pre-pandemic levels, travel aggregators such as Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE) would gain traction too. All in all, consumer tech firms continue to draw attention during this earnings season. On that note, here are three more to watch in the stock market today.
Consumer Tech Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] This Week
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD)
Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB)
Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C)
Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
To begin with, we have Advanced Micro Devices or AMD for short. Overall, the company specializes in developing computer processors, semiconductors, and related tech. All of which serve a wide variety of consumer and enterprise clients. Among its core end markets include the gaming, high-performance computing, data center, and professional design industries. Following AMD’s latest quarterlyearnings call AMD stock appears to be in focus in the stock market now.
Getting straight to it, AMD posted stellar results in its first-fiscal quarter report yesterday. The company is looking at revenue of $5.89 billion for the quarter. Notably, this translates to a 71% year-over-year increase and a record-high for AMD in terms of quarterly revenue. Furthermore, the company is boasting earnings of $1.13 per share, crushing consensus analyst projections of $0.91. With results like this, it seems that AMD continues to go from strength to strength.
In detail, the company’s two core business divisions are seeing solid momentum. On one hand, AMD’s total sales from its Computing and Graphics arm is up by 33% year-over-year, totaling $2.8 billion. On the other hand, its Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom sales skyrocketed by 88% over the same period. With all this alongside the recent completion of the company’s acquisition of fellow semiconductor giant Xilinx, we could be looking at exciting times ahead for AMD stock. Would you agree?

Airbnb Inc.
Following that, we have Airbnb, a consumer tech company that uses its platform to connect hosts to guests. In fact, the company has grown to over 4 million hosts that have welcomed over 1 billion guests across the globe. The company has had one of the biggest IPOs in 2020 during the pandemic and continues to strive today as the countries around the world continue to reopen their borders. This comes as two years since the pandemic began, a new world of travel has emerged. Millions of people are now more flexible about where they live and work after all.
On Tuesday, the company had reported stellar earnings and beaten estimates. Notably, it had a 70% revenue growth at $1.5 billion as travel continues to rebound across the globe. Impressively, this quarter’s revenue was also 80% higher than Q1 2019, pre-pandemic levels. The company also exceeded expectations for its nights and experiences booked, also surpassing pre-pandemic levels at 102.1 million. Gross booking value was also up by 67% year-over-year at $17.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $229 million, being its first positive Q1 adjusted EBITDA since its IPO.
The company will also be announcing big changes on May 11 as it seeks to introduce ‘a new Airbnb for a new world of travel’. Some hints that the company has offered are a new way to search and guests will be able to discover millions of unique homes. The company also says that, despite global headwinds in the quarter, it continues to beat expectations and this would demonstrate strong global demand for travel. Furthermore, Airbnb also says that long-term stays of 28 days or more also continue to be its fastest-growing category by trip length. Given the solid quarter, is ABNB stock a buy?

Should investors take a chance on chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) after its latest earnings results? The recently reported first quarter (Q1) was largely positive, with the company beating on both the top and bottom lines. However, looking ahead, Intel lowered its guidance for the current second quarter, which caused concern among some analysts and investors.
Yet, INTC stock is managing to hold its own in a tough market. Year-to-date (YTD), Intel’s shares are down 11.9% at $45.42 a share. That compares to a 21% decline for the tech-laden Nasdaq Index on which Intel trades. The Nasdaq has officially entered bear market territory for the year. While Intel’s stock performance hasn’t been great, it has been better than its microchip rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is down 33% YTD, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which is down 36% YTD.
INTC Intel Corporation $45.42
Strong Q1 Results
For the first quarter, Intel reported earnings per share (EPS) of 87 cents compared to 81 cents expected by Wall Street, according to Refinitiv data. The company’s revenue came in at $18.4 billion, which also beat the $18.31 billion expected by analysts. While overall positive, Intel noted that revenue for its Client Computing Group, which includes personal computer chips, fell 13% in the quarter from a year ago to $9.29 billion. That decline was blamed on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) adopting its own chips and processors and ceasing to buy them from Intel. Still, the Q1 results can be viewed as a success.
7 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in May and Hold for Years
The forward guidance provided by Intel was more problematic. The Santa Clara, California-based company forecast second quarter EPS of 70 cents and $18 billion in revenue. Analysts had expected EPS of 83 cents and revenue of $18.38 billion. For the full year, Intel lifted its earnings guidance by 10 cents to $3.60 per share on $76 billion in revenue. That was ahead of the $3.50 EPS and $75.78 billion in revenue that Wall Street had been looking for. Unfortunately, the Q2 guidance grabbed the headlines and INTC stock immediately slumped 4% after the results were made public.
Growth And Expansion
Earnings aside, Intel has some very big and ambitious plans underway. The company is in the process of acquiring foundry company Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) for $5.4 billion in a deal that will help Intel manufacture more of its own chips. Additionally, Intel is spending $20 billion to construct two new plants in Ohio that will make advanced microchips. The company has called the Ohio plants its first step toward development of a mega-site that will eventually house eight separate chip factories at a cost of $100 billion. The company also recently increased its quarterly dividend to 36 cents, bringing the yield to 3.25%.
Plus, Intel is planning to spend $19 billion to construct a chip plant in Germany, helping to expand its European reach and market share. All in all, Intel has committed to spend $88 billion to bolster its operations in Europe over the next decade. It is part of Intel’s plan to retain its title as the world’s biggest semiconductor chip manufacturer and hold rivals Nvidia and AMD at bay. However, despite its big growth plans, Intel has pushed back the release of several highly anticipated chips. The company announced a few months back that its new server chip will now come out in 2024 rather than 2023. There have also been other delays announced by the company.
Treat INTC Stock as a Long-Term Investment
Intel is doing a lot of things right and its financial position is improving. The company clearly has a long-term growth strategy in place and plans to recover from Apple making its own microchips for devices such as the iPhone and Mac computer. That said, Intel is not a high growth tech start-up. This is an established company that is finding new ways to remain competitive in a technologically advanced world. Investors should keep this in mind and plan to buy and hold Intel stock for the long haul. As it undertakes its growth strategy, INTC stock is a buy.

The company reported 71% sales growth in the first quarter with a beat on both the top and bottom lines. AMD's earnings per share were $1.13 adjusted versus $0.91 expected, which is a staggering increase of 117% year over year. Revenue came in at $5.89 billion versus $5.52 billion, which popped 71% year over year.
With supply chain issues and inflationary macroeconomic conditions, many analysts expected AMD to lower guidance. Perhaps the most impressive earnings announcement is that AMD expects $6.5 billion in sales in the current quarter, which outpaces analyst expectations of $6.38 billion. Raising guidance in the current economic environment certainly raised a few eyebrows, so let's dig deeper.
AMD also announced that it repurchased $1.9 billion of its own stock in the quarter, which leaves $8.3 billion in remaining stock repurchase authorizations. AMD is involved in many secular growth trends, including gaming, the metaverse, crypto, data centers, the cloud, and more, but can the company continue to impress at its current valuation?

Shares of the company slipped nearly 7% afterthe report as investors were worried about a slowdown in PC (personal computer) demand, especially from the consumer and education segments on account of surging inflation. Coronavirus-related shutdowns in China and the Russia-Ukraine war, meanwhile, are throttling Intel's supply chain and its ability to source components.
Let's take a closer look at Intel's numbers and see why it is too early to write off the company's turnaround.
Intel runs into a weak PC market, but investors shouldn't miss the bigger picture
Intel's first-quarter revenue of $18.4 billion was down 1% over the prior-year period, but the company's bottom line saw a sharper drop as adjusted earnings fell 35% to $0.87 per share. The massive earnings drop was the result of weakness in Intel's client computing group (CCG) segment, where revenue was down 13% to $9.3 billion and operating income crashed 34%.
Intel attributed this decline to weak demand, inventory adjustments by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and other factors such as higher investments in product development. The tepid performance of CCG, which is Intel's biggest business as it accounted for half of the company's top line last quarter, wasn't surprising given the conditions prevailing in the PC market.

Market research firm IDC estimates that PC shipments, which include desktops, notebooks, and workstations, declined 5.1% in the first quarter of 2022. The PC market has enjoyed two years of solid growth in the wake of the pandemic, and it looks like demand saturation may have finally caught up. Additionally, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are hampering the PC market's growth.
The bad news for Intel is that the PC market may not be witnessing the impressive growth rates of 2020 and 2021 again anytime soon, so Intel's volumes are likely to take a hit. Intel, however, plans to overcome the end-market weakness by winning more share and increasing the average selling price (ASP) of its processors.
Intel Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner said on the company's latest earnings conference call, ""CPU ASPs were up greater than 25% year over year on richer mix and strong demand for our high-end mobile and desktop products across both our commercial and consumer segments."" That's not surprising given that Intel has been pulling the right strings to stifle Advanced Micro Devices' growth in the processor market. What's more, Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger now believes that the company can regain its manufacturing lead from rivals by the end of 2024 as compared to its original expectation of 2025.
As such, Intel's biggest business could eventually get better, and the good part is that the company is witnessing growth in other areas that could help it mitigate the near-term weakness in the CCG business.
Don't miss these silver linings
Intel's second-quarter projection of $0.70 per share in adjusted earnings on revenue of $18 billion is weaker than what analysts were looking for. Wall Street anticipated $0.83 per share in earnings from Intel on $18.4 billion in revenue. But what's worth noting is that Intel has reiterated its full-year forecast despite the challenges it is facing right now.
The company has reaffirmed its $76 billion revenue estimate for 2022, pointing out that the strength in the data center and networking markets will help it hit its targets this year despite the weakness in PCs. Intel generated $6 billion in revenue from the data center and artificial intelligence (DCAI) business last quarter, up 22% year over year.
Intel expects this segment to improve as the year progresses thanks to the ramp-up of the Sapphire Rapids server processors. The chip giant has started shipping its Sapphire Rapids chips to select customers and says that more models of the same will hit the market throughout the year.
It is also worth noting that the DCAI segment serves a fast-growing market and is on track to take advantage of an increase in chip demand from hyperscale and enterprise customers. The hyperscale data center market, for instance, is expected to clock nearly 26% annual growth through the end of the decade, according to a third-party estimate. So, there are ways for Intel to overcome the PC market's softness and hit its 2022 targets.
That's why it would be too early to write off a potential turnaround at Intel, especially considering that its emerging businesses such as accelerated computing systems and graphics (AXG) are showing signs of stepping on the gas. Intel's AXG revenue was up 21% year over year in the first quarter to $219 million. Though this is a small part of Intel right now, the AXG business can turn out to be a key growth driver in the long run.
So, savvy investors should look past Intel's short-term troubles as the silver linings indicate that this semiconductor giant can regain its mojo in the long run.

2022-05-03 00:00:00+00:00,"Samsung signs deal with Dish for 5G radios, phones",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/samsung-signs-deal-with-dish-for-5g-radios-phones,,,"By Supantha Mukherjee
May 3 (Reuters) - Samsung 005930.KS has signed a multi-year deal to sell equipment to Dish DISH.O for its upcoming 5G network in the United States, one of the largest radio deals for the South Korean company since its major Verizon contract in 2020.
Samsung set itself up as a challenger to top telecoms equipment suppliers Nokia NOKIA.HE and Ericsson ERICb.ST in the United States by winning a $6.6 billion deal with Verizon VZ.N, and the contract with Dish further cements its position.
""This is a greater than a billion dollar agreement for Samsung Networks,"" Alok Shah, vice president at Samsung, told Reuters. ""We will be delivering our first products to Dish later this year.""
Dish already has Taiwan's Microelectronics Technology Inc 2314.TW (MTI) and Japan's Fujitsu 6702.T as suppliers for 5G radios.
Dish is building a 5G network using latest technologies that promises to lower costs and bring in new services, and has tied up with companies ranging from Amazon AMZN.O and Intel INTC.O to smaller ones such as Altiostar and Mavenir.
While Dish has not launched a commercial network yet, it has committed to regulators to cover 20% of the U.S. population by June, and at least 70% of the population by mid-2023.
""We have an objective to achieve 20% of population coverage by June and we are well on track to achieve that,"" Dish Chief Commercial Officer Stephen Bye said in an interview.
""We have beta users on our network for some time, testing our network ... we just have not declared commercial launch and you will see that in the coming weeks,"" he said.
Dish, which has been setting up network infrastructure in dozens of cities, has also faced supply chain issues that have hurt companies globally, including in the telecom industry.
Bye said supply chains had been tough for 12-18 months and the challenges were not going to go away in the next couple of months. But Dish has all the components to reach its June coverage target.
Dish is also testing its 5G network using Samsung Galaxy S22 phones and plans to continue using the phones throughout the network deployment process.
""We are working with other device vendors and you can look at the Boost website and you will see clearly we have relationships with a lot of device vendors,"" Bye said.
Boost Mobile, a prepaid wireless phone brand owned by Dish, lists phones from Samsung, Motorola and Apple on its website.

Markets rewarded investors who bet that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) would beat expectations in its quarterly report. Still, MSFT stock backed down from its 50-day moving average when the Nasdaq Composite Index sold off. What did markets like about Microsoft’s quarter? At today’s prices, is MSFT stock worth buying now?
7 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in May and Hold for Years
On April 27, Microsoft posted third-quarter generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings a share of $2.22. Revenue rose by 18.5% year-on-year (YOY) to $49.4 billion. The company’s impressive growth in the Intelligent Cloud segment failed to stop speculators from taking profits. This is the nature of a bear market. No matter how strong Microsoft shared in its earnings report, the stock has limited short-term upside. Patient investors will treat the market’s volatility as an opportunity.
Microsoft shares are a buy on weakness. The macroeconomic climate is worsening. The Federal Reserve will likely force a recession to slow inflation rates. Despite that bleak economic backdrop, Microsoft has seen, and should continue to see, durable growth. For example, it has Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications in the commercial cloud. Its competitive products face minimal competition. Corporate customers still need a hybrid work environment. They will continue to buy Microsoft’s Azure and Office 365 products. This lowers their technology infrastructure costs and increases efficiency. In addition, Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella said that the total addressable market (TAM) would double by the end of the decade.
In April, IDC reported that PC shipments started slowing, following two years of strong growth. This scared investors. It led to a sell-off in shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). I am confident that the markets are overreacting. The near-term slowdown is temporary. Yes, China has shut down Shanghai, a major port city, for over a month. So, for now at least, customers cannot buy many PCs in volume due to the supply disruption. But China will eventually ease restrictions once it believes that it has Covid-19 infection rates under control. The supply shortage will end. Customers will not have to wait too long to refresh their PC hardware. Thus, a rejuvenated PC market is another catalyst that will lift Microsoft’s profits and its share price.
