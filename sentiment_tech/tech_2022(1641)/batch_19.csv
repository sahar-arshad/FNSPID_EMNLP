2022-08-31 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Has Nothing New for Gamers On a Budget,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-has-nothing-new-for-gamers-on-a-budget,,,"When Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) launched its Ryzen 5000 desktop CPUs in late 2020, there were good reasons why the company had nothing to offer below $299. The semiconductor industry was hamstrung by component shortages, so it made sense for AMD to focus on higher-end products.
This time around, that same strategy makes a little less sense. There are still pockets of shortages across the semiconductor industry, but the great semiconductor shortage is quickly coming to an end. Chip companies, including Micron and Nvidia, are dealing with an oversupply of chips as consumer demand for PCs has plunged.
Image source: AMD.
Nothing new below $299
While AMD has brought prices down for its Ryzen 7000 launch compared to the Ryzen 5000 series, there's still nothing new for anyone looking to build a budget gaming PC. The lowest-end product AMD is launching is the Ryzen 5 7600X, priced at $299.
At lower price points, AMD is leaning on its older products. The 5600X, for example, can be bought for $199 today. This is a nearly two-year-old chip, and the big problem for AMD is that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has much newer options available.
Intel launched its Alder Lake chips late last year, and it did not ignore lower price points. AMD's 5600X is competing with Intel's i5-12400F, and even with the lowered price for AMD's chip, Intel still comes out on top. Tom's Hardware found that the i5-12400F, which can be had for $180, clearly beats the 5600X in both gaming and application performance.
Intel also has plenty of new Alder Lake chips at even lower price points, which were launched a few months after the top-tier chips. Suggested prices start at just $42 for the lowest-end dual-core option, and there are four other chips that sit below the i5-12400F in pricing. If you want an AMD chip at these lower price points, you're stuck with last-gen products.
Of course, AMD could fill in its lineup with lower-priced chips in the coming months. It didn't do that with the Ryzen 5000 series until earlier this year with a couple of new chips, but they were quite late to the party. That tardiness may have just been a function of the state of the semiconductor supply chain. This time around, the supply situation should be better.
One problem, though, is that AMD is moving to a new platform with its Ryzen launch. AMD made the choice to only support DDR5 memory, which is still substantially more expensive than older DDR4 memory. In contrast, Intel supports both DDR4 and DDR5 for its Alder Lake chips, and its upcoming Raptor Lake chips will maintain that dual compatibility.
So even if AMD does roll out budget Ryzen 7000 processors, building a system around them may end up being pricier than an Intel-based alternative. For reference, the top-selling 32GB DDR4 memory kit on Newegg sells for $90 today, compared to $170 for the best-selling DDR5 memory kit with the same capacity. When we're talking about CPUs below $200, that difference is meaningful.
The timing might work out
While DDR5 memory is expensive today, AMD's timing could turn out to be spot on. The memory chip market appears to now be entering oversupply, and prices are in decline. Memory chip manufacturer Micron lowered its expectations for demand growth this year, and it's pulling back on expanding its capacity to cope with weaker demand.
Memory chip prices can decline rapidly when the market is flooded with chips and manufacturers are desperate to unload them. AMD's choice to hitch its wagon to expensive DDR5 memory is certainly risky, but there's a decent chance that the newer type of memory will become far more affordable in the months ahead. If AMD does launch lower-end chips down the road, the cost to build a system around them may end up being much more reasonable than it would be today.
For now, though, AMD is largely ceding the low end of the market to Intel. We'll have to wait and see if the company has anything up its sleeve to win back gamers on a budget.

2022-08-31 00:00:00+00:00,Intel: Will Fortune Favor the Bold?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel%3A-will-fortune-favor-the-bold,,,"Shareholders of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are going through a stressful time; shares have fallen to a five-year low despite the company's role as one of the world's leading semiconductor companies. The stock's plunge stems from Wall Street's concerns over Intel's aggressive manufacturing plans at a time when the economy is shaky and the industry could hit a downturn.
Leaning into uncertainty with hefty spending plans is a bold strategy, but success could bring a new age of growth to the semiconductor giant. However, investors might need patience to see this through; here is what you need to know.
A bold bet on manufacturing
Intel is just getting underway with a massive plan to invest billions of dollars over the next several years to revamp its fabrication (semiconductor manufacturing) operations. The company could spend more than $100 billion when it's all said and done, including expansion projects in Arizona, new facilities in Ohio, and various projects throughout Europe.
Capital expenditures are ramping up, wiping out the company's free cash flow. In other words, Intel has no cash profits because it's spending them on these new facilities. These projects won't be operational until later this decade, so Intel is investing significant money without immediate return.
INTC Free Cash Flow data by YCharts.
Understandably, the big question is: What happens if a downturn in business causes Intel's revenue to drop, forcing it to either slow its spending or borrow to maintain its plan? Investors are taking a leap of faith that Intel's investments will reward them over the long term and that the business remains in good financial shape while it builds out these projects.
A big partnership struck
Intel recently struck a deal with Brookfield Infrastructure Partners on a co-funding partnership. The deal is worth up to $30 billion and will help fund two of Intel's new fabrication facilities. Brookfield's investment buys it a 49% stake in the facilities; Intel will exclude Brookfield's share of the factories' profits from its earnings but maintains majority ownership of the factories, intellectual property, and operational control.
Ultimately, Intel is trading a piece of its long-term profits in exchange for taking some of the financial burdens of construction off its shoulders. This deal and subsidies from the recently signed CHIPS bill could offset as much as 30% of Intel's capital investments over the next five years.
It's a hybrid approach; the new facilities will help Intel compete with foreign semiconductor manufacturing powerhouses like Taiwan Semiconductor. The potential offsets from subsidies and the funding partnership help Intel do it in a way that might not break the bank, though the investments are still tremendous by any measuring stick. Management has said that it may strike other funding deals on its global projects.
Keeping the balance sheet intact
Semiconductors are a cyclical business that can have sharp declines when the economy suffers; recent struggles by industry peers suggest that the industry could be facing a downturn. Intel's balance sheet is vital to keeping the business healthy while balancing these large projects.
Intel has built up a healthy cash balance of more than $27 billion, leaving the company with just $8 billion in net debt. Investors should watch the company over future quarters to track how much it depletes that cash pile. Still, the company is on solid footing right now, even if the semiconductor industry stalls out.
INTC Cash and Short Term Investments (Quarterly) data by YCharts.
It's unclear whether Intel can build up its manufacturing operations without sacrificing existing obligations like its dividend, which cost the company $5.8 billion over the past year. Remember that dividends are a cash expense, so if free cash flow falls below that, the payment comes from Intel's balance sheet. Management seems intent on keeping the payout intact, so investors should perk up and look for trouble if Intel reverses course and cuts the payout in the future.
Wall Street doesn't like uncertainty, and Intel's massive investments create what could be several years of mystery about whether its large bets will pay off or not. An economic downturn could mean more pain for Intel and other semiconductor companies, so investors should probably remain cautious and build a position slowly.

2022-08-31 00:00:00+00:00,Proceed With Caution When Considering These 5 Ultra-Popular Stocks,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/proceed-with-caution-when-considering-these-5-ultra-popular-stocks-1,,,"Popular stocks are usually popular for a reason, but sometimes, the very popularity of a stock can lure investors into complacency. Remember, Kodak was once one of the biggest, most popular stocks in the world, yet it still managed to go bankrupt in 2012 after failing to anticipate or adapt to digital photography.
That's not to say these five stocks will go bankrupt (although one may need to raise more money soon). Still, investors in these widely owned stocks should be aware of some difficult competitive and macroeconomic challenges facing each.
AT&T and Verizon
Both AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) are very popular with dividend investors. In fact, many ""conservative"" equity portfolios built for retirees contain these two names. But should they?
In the 4G era, AT&T and Verizon enjoyed the two best networks, leading to a duopoly in the wireless industry. That led to high profit margins and dividends. Today, AT&T and Verizon yield 6.2% and 6%, respectively.
But things are much harder now. While wireless services are generally recession proof, that doesn't mean they are competition proof. In the wake of T-Mobile's 2020 acquisition of Sprint, the combined T-Mobile-Sprint has suddenly caught up to and actually surpassed both Verizon and AT&T in 5G coverage and capability, upending the status quo.
T-Mobile had the foresight to go all-in on mid-band spectrum, which offers the best trade-off between speed and coverage for 5G phones. But Verizon and AT&T pursued millimeter wave buildouts at first, which is faster but often inaccessible. To plug their mid-band holes, AT&T and Verizon spent big in 2020's C-band auction, shelling out tens of billions of dollars to acquire mid-band spectrum, but greatly increased their respective debt loads in the process. Moreover, even with the C-band rollout, each are still playing catch-up to T-Mobile.
That has left both Verizon and AT&T in a tough position. They can either raise prices in order to cover the costly 5G buildout, but that would risk losing customers to T-Mobile, which generally offers affordable plans.
In the second quarter, T-Mobile added 1.7 million postpaid customers, with 723,000 postpaid phone net additions. AT&T added 1.05 million postpaid customers. While its postpaid phone net additions exceeded T-Mobile's at 813,000, keep in mind T-Mobile is still losing some churn from its Sprint base as it shuts down Sprint's legacy network. Furthermore, AT&T appeared to lean heavily on phone subsidies, as its free cash flow fell well below expectations.
Verizon only grew postpaid phone net adds by a mere 12,000, with losses at the consumer segment offset by gains in enterprise mobility.
AT&T and Verizon's dividend payments mean money is coming out of their businesses every quarter, further depleting their firepower to catch up to T-Mobile, which claims it has a durable two-year lead in 5G. T-Mobile doesn't pay out dividends but is planning a sizable buyback next year. Still, those shareholder returns are more flexible and can be ramped up and down as needed.
Between their high shareholder payouts, high debt loads, and need to catch up to T-Mobile in 5G, something will have to give for these stocks -- perhaps even a dividend cut at some point.
Intel
Another high-dividend stock popular with investors is Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). At first glance, Intel looks quite cheap, at just 7 times trailing earnings, with a 4.4% dividend yield.
However, that cheap valuation may be warranted. Ever since former management lost the lead in leading-edge chip manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel has been losing market share to Advanced Micro Devices and other tech giants that are creating their own processors using TSM's foundries.
The struggles have become plainly clear now that the PC industry is experiencing a severe downturn. Last quarter, Intel saw a nasty 25% revenue decline in its PC-related segment. Perhaps more concerning was an additional 16% decline in its data center and AI group. That's because even though consumer-related goods like PCs were known to be weak, the data center market has still been strong, so to see weakness there was particularly concerning.
Declining profits really aren't good for Intel, since it's embarking on a massive, expensive turnaround plan. That plan entails not only getting its technology back on par with the industry leaders but also becoming a foundry to produce chips designed by third parties.
Building out that manufacturing capacity will require a lot of money. Like Verizon and AT&T, Intel also has hefty dividend payments to worry about, which could come into question if Intel's execution doesn't improve in the near term.
Intel did just ink a deal with Brookfield Asset Management to provide up to $30 billion in financing to that end, which will likely enable Intel to keep paying its dividend while completing its foundry build-out. However, Intel will have to give up its share of future profits that come from those new factories, splitting them with Brookfield.
I'm a bit more optimistic on Intel than Verizon and AT&T because if the turnaround works, the upside is there; however, it's an open question as to whether this expensive, multiyear turnaround will bear fruit, and we won't know the answer for years.
Snowflake
Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) is one of the more exciting stocks out there, and it's hard to caution against a stock owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.
Unlike the other four stocks on this list, Snowflake is performing well on the business level. Snowflake surprised to the upside last quarter, growing revenue 83% year over year while expanding its gross margins. That's in contrast with several other enterprise software companies, which have expressed slowing deals amid customer caution. Snowflake's competitive advantages seem strong, and the growth of data-based artificial intelligence applications within enterprises is still in their relatively early stages.
The problem comes down to valuation and interest rates. While we have enjoyed a low interest rate environment since the Great Recession of 2008, the current inflation scare is raising questions about the interest rate environment going forward after the pandemic. It's possible we could be in an environment of higher inflation and interest rates for some time.
Meanwhile, Snowflake trades at 37 times sales and is still losing money on a GAAP basis. That is extremely expensive. Yes, the company is technically free cash flow positive, but it also pays out a ton of money to executives in stock-based compensation.
Snowflake paid out nearly $400 million in stock-based compensation last quarter alone. Annualizing that to $1.6 billion, it represents 2.7% dilution per year, at this market cap. And that stock compensation will also likely grow in the years ahead.
Of these five stocks, Snowflake may still work out as a long-term investment; in fact, I wouldn't fault someone for having Snowflake as part of their portfolio. However, there isn't much margin of safety in a stock that is valued so highly. If one of the large cloud players or another Silicon Valley start-up becomes more of a competitive threat, Snowflake could get a big rerating. And if interest rates stay high, it could take a long time for Snowflake to grow into its current valuation.
So there is risk involved, even though the business is operating at a high level.
AMC Entertainment
Finally, movie theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) and AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE: APE) preferred stock are risky as well.
AMC rose to meme stock status during 2021, whereby retail traders pushed the stock so high that management was able to sell some stock and raise cash at high stock prices, staving off bankruptcy.
However, the amount raised may not last forever. The comeback from the pandemic has been start-and-stop at best, with the omicron variant delaying a full return to out-of-home activities, and then the inflation surge putting stress on discretionary purchases such as going to the movie theater. Furthermore, the late-summer movie slate is very empty, as most of the films shot before the pandemic have now been released.
AMC did buy itself time, avoiding the fate of Cineworld, the second-largest theater operator in the world, which recently disclosed it may have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
AMC isn't going bankrupt soon, but if audiences don't return to the theaters in the age of streaming, it could become a possibility down the road. Even in the second quarter, which contained a number of blockbusters such as Top Gun: Maverick, AMC still had negative free cash flow of $117 million.
With the summer quarter representing a low point in the film release slate, expect that number to get worse in Q3. Meanwhile, AMC only had $965 million in cash at the end of the last quarter, against $5.4 billion in debt.
That's probably why AMC issued a new class of preferred stock, getting around its year-old promise to not to dilute its common equity shareholders further. If the theater industry doesn't bounce back as many hope it will, AMC may raise more money through the sale of APE preferred shares, which is technically not common stock, even though it has the same ownership rights.
How much will shareholders be diluted? It's hard to say. Still, AMC's and APE's combined $9.3 billion market cap seems lofty for a business with so much uncertainty.

2022-08-30 00:00:00+00:00,Alphabet (GOOGL) Launches Rider-Only Service in Downtown Phoenix,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alphabet-googl-launches-rider-only-service-in-downtown-phoenix,,,"Alphabet’s GOOGL self-driving arm, Waymo, brings an end to the much-awaited rider-only service in downtown Phoenix.

Until now, Waymo was operating its autonomous vehicles with a company specialist seated in the driver's seat. Following the latest launch, these vehicles will run completely without human safety operators.

There will be only riders seated inside these vehicles. As of now, the service is available to riders who have become Waymo One Trusted Testers by taking part in the company’s Trusted Tester program, which was launched in May 2022.

The driverless robotaxi service in downtown Phoenix will be confined to a specific area, which is constrained by Interstate 17 on the west and south, Camelback Road on the north, and 44th Street on the east.

Waymo plans to roll out the underlined service to regular passengers and expand its operating area eventually.

The above-mentioned factor bodes well for the company’s intention to hit the streets of downtown Phoenix, which was announced this March.

The latest move marks Waymo’s expansion in Phoenix. Notably, Waymo vehicles began the ride-hailing service from the East Valley of Phoenix.

The company is in sync with its growing efforts toward the expansion of its Waymo ride-hailing service across the United States.

Expanding Waymo Efforts
The recent step is in sync with Alphabet’s strengthening efforts toward expanding its operations and fleet, and making the vehicles more rider-friendly.

The company has plans to make its ride-hailing vehicles fully driverless on the streets of San Francisco. This also marks Waymo’s first expansion outside Phoenix.

Alphabet recently partnered with Geely, a China-based automotive company. Per the terms of the deal, Geely’s electric mobility brand, Zeekr, will design and develop electric vehicles for Waymo, into which Waymo Driver will be integrated.

The vehicles will be first introduced on the roads of the United States. With the Geely partnership, Waymo will expand its Waymo One fleet.

Apart from this, Waymo teamed up with Google’s Maps to ensure a seamless booking experience for Waymo One. This enables customers to book Waymo One directly from the Maps app.

The endeavors will help Alphabet further penetrate the booming autonomous driving space.

Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the worldwide driverless vehicle market is expected to see a CAGR of 18.06% between 2021 and 2026.
Intensifying Competition
Given the upbeat scenario, not only Alphabet but companies like Amazon AMZN, Intel INTC and Baidu BIDU are also making every effort to capitalize on the growth prospects in the autonomous driving space.

Amazon’s buyout of Zoox, a developer of autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, remains a major positive. Further, the company’s launch of its first self-driving robotaxi strengthened its position in the autonomous driving space.

Currently, the company is gearing up to test its robotaxi in California. It has already applied for a permit in California to test-drive its vehicles.

Zoox intends to open an engineering office and operations facility this year, which will act as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing.

Meanwhile, Intel is gaining from the low power consumption of Mobileye chips and the ability to create maps for self-driving systems. The company intends to introduce a pilot for autonomous taxis and ride-hailing services in Munich and Tel Aviv in 2022.

In April 2022, the company already gave a sneak peek of its robotaxi ride by rolling out a video of a 40-minute autonomous car ride around Jerusalem.

In addition to this, Mobileye recently teamed up with German electric mobility unit Benteler EV Systems and Beep to develop and deploy self-driving, fully-electric shuttles in the United States by 2024.

Baidu is gaining from the strong momentum of Apollo Go Robotaxi service across China on the back of its increasing availability in several cities and a growing number of rides.

Apollo Go is available in ten cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Changsha, Cangzhou, Yangquan, Wuzhen Water Town and Wuhan.

Nevertheless, Alphabet’s growing autonomous driving initiatives are likely to help it stay ahead of the curve.

Currently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) slid 0.6% or 184.41 points to close at 32,098.99 points. The blue-chip index had at one point declined 321 points before paring some of the losses.
The S&P 500 dropped 0.7% or 27.05 points to end at 4,030.61 points. Tech and real estate stocks were the biggest losers.
The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) fell 1.3%, while the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) declined 0.9%.  Ten of the 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory. Energy stocks were the only gainers. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) advanced 1.5%.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged 1% or 124.04 points to finish at 12,017.67 points.
The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was up 2.54% to 26.21. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.91-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.20-to-1 ratio favored declining issues. A total of 9.36 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 10.59 billion.
Investors Worried About Steep Rate Hikes
Wall Street suffered its worst day in months on Friday, with the Dow plummeting over 1,000 points, while the S&P 500 gave up almost all its gains for August. The massive selloff came as Fed Chair Jerome Powell during his speech at the Kansas City Fed’s annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyo, made clear that the central bank would continue its inflation fight and will go for sharp rate hikes so long it doesn’t fully get control over soaring inflation.
This dashed investors’ hopes of a less steep rate hike, which many had been expecting, leading to a massive selloff. Investors are concerned that a steep rate hike will further slow economy’s growth.
Investors knew that more rate hikes were in the coming but they were divided between a 75-basis-point and 50-basis-point hike at Fed’s September meeting. A 75-basis-point hike is now almost assured in Fed’s next meeting.
These fears continued throughout Monday although a rebound looked possible for a brief period when the Dow and S&P 500 turned green. However, the positive sentiment was short-lived as growing concerns of an economic slowdown continued to unsettle investors.
Monday also saw the 2-year Treasury yield hitting a new 15-year high as rate hike fears continued to dent investors’ confidence. Tech stocks were once again the biggest casualties. Shares of Salesforce, Inc. CRM declined 3.4%. Shares of Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Intel Corporation INTC fell 1.1% and 1.3%, respectively. Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
No economic data was released on Monday.

2022-08-30 00:00:00+00:00,Intel's Smart Move Puts Its High-Yielding Dividend on a Firmer Foundation,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-smart-move-puts-its-high-yielding-dividend-on-a-firmer-foundation,,,"Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have been under significant pressure this year. The chip giant has lost more than a third of its value on concerns that the company's ambitious expansion plan could stress its balance sheet, which might impact its ability to maintain its high-yielding dividend. That slumping stock price has pushed Intel's dividend yield over 4%, well above the S&P 500's 1.5% yield.
Intel's higher dividend yield suggests it's at higher risk of a reduction if it runs into financial trouble. However, that risk is much lower following the company's recent partnership with Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) to help fund half the cost of two new fabrication factories. That smart move puts the tech giant's payout on a much firmer foundation.
Heavy investments in its future
Intel is investing heavily to expand its manufacturing capacity to stay ahead of the competition and capitalize on the growing semiconductor demand. Chip sales are on track to double by the end of the decade to top $1 trillion. That's leading the company to invest $30 billion to build two new fabrication plants in Arizona. It could also spend upwards of $100 billion each to construct new manufacturing complexes in Ohio and Germany. Intel expects the initial spending on the Ohio plant to be $20 billion and another 30 billion euros ($30 billion) in Germany.
While Intel generates a lot of cash, that's a hefty financial commitment for the company, especially considering its big dividend. Intel has already paid out $3 billion in dividends this year, less than half the $6.7 billion of net cash it produced by operating activities. However, the company's massive capital program will cost $23 billion this year, and its adjusted free cash flow will be a negative $1 billion to $2 billion this year. That cash burn has some investors wondering if Intel can maintain its dividend during this heavy investment period.
Bringing on a smart partner
Intel took a huge step to address those dividend concerns by unveiling a first-of-its-kind semiconductor co-investment program (SCIP) to help fund two new chip factories it's building in Arizona. Its partnership with Brookfield Infrastructure will see the two companies invest up to $30 billion in the project, with Brookfield financing 49% and Intel the remaining 51%. Intel will retain majority ownership and operating control of the facilities while they will split the revenue.
The partnership with Brookfield will increase Intel's financial flexibility. It will protect the company's cash balance and debt capacity for future investments. The tech giant also expects the deal to benefit its adjusted free cash flow and be accretive to its earnings per share during the construction and ramp phase. Intel thus believes it can continue funding a healthy and growing dividend.
Brookfield Infrastructure is an excellent partner for Intel. The company has a long history of partnering with companies by becoming a co-investor to provide funding for large-scale expansion projects. That allows Intel to tap into Brookfield's access to capital to help finance a significant portion of the costs of building these two factories.
The deal will serve as a blueprint for other SCIP transactions that Intel hopes to complete in the future to help fund the buildout of factories in Ohio and Germany. Intel hopes these deals and other programs will help offset 20% to 30% of its annual capital spending. That will free up capital for other purposes, like growing its dividend.
Intel's high-yielding dividend is looking a little safer
The market has been growing concerned that Intel might be unable to maintain its dividend during its current manufacturing capacity expansion phase. Intel is working to address those concerns by lining up funding partners to help cover some of that cost. While its deal with Brookfield doesn't guarantee Intel can maintain its dividend, it certainly puts the payout on a much firmer foundation. It shows that the tech giant is serious about maintaining and growing its big-time payout amid the buildout.

2022-08-30 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Expands Portfolio With Zen 4 Powered Ryzen 7000 Chip Series,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-expands-portfolio-with-zen-4-powered-ryzen-7000-chip-series,,,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD is expanding its Ryzen processor line-up for gamers and content creators with the introduction of Ryzen 7000 Series desktop processors, powered by the new Zen 4 architecture.

The new Ryzen 7000 series offers four processors — Ryzen 5 7600X, Ryzen 7 7700X, Ryzen 9 7900X and Ryzen 9 7950 X — featuring combinations of 6 cores-12 threads, 8 cores-16 threads, 12 cores-24 threads and 16 cores-32 threads, respectively.

The new Ryzen 7000 series processors are expected to be available globally from Sep 27.

Built on a TSMC 5 nm process node, the new processors promise dominant performance and energy efficiency.

For instance, the premium Ryzen 9 7950 X (available at $699) enables single-core performance improvement of up to 29% compared with the previous version.
 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Quote
 The 7950 X processor offers up to 45% more computing power for content creators in POV-Ray, up to 15% faster gaming performance in select titles and up to 27% better performance-per-watt.

Moreover, the Ryzen 7950X processor is up to 47% more energy efficient than the closest competition.

Apart from the new processors, AMD unveiled the new Socket AM5 platform, which features four new chipsets, X670 Extreme, X670, B650E and B650. While X670 Extreme and X670 will be available in September, the other two will be available in October.
Expanding Portfolio to Drive AMD’s Prospects
AMD is benefiting from strong demand for Ryzen and EPYC processors. The latest Ryzen processors follow AMD’s June-end launch of Ryzen Embedded R-Series system-on-chips processors, which are specifically designed to address solutions for industrial and robotics systems, machine vision, IoT and thin-client equipment.  

AMD’s focus on constantly improving the performance of its Ryzen processors has been a game-changer against stiff competition from the likes of NVIDIA NVDA and Intel INTC.

AMD has underperformed Intel and the Zacks Computer & Technology sector year to date, while outperforming NVIDIA. AMD shares have lost 38.5% compared with Intel’s decline of 36%. NVIDIA has lost 46.3%, while the Zacks Computer & Technology sector has been down 26.3%.

Nevertheless, NVIDIA is giving AMD tough competition in the high-performance computing market. NVIDIA’s processors have been benefiting from the rapid proliferation of AI. NVIDIA is expanding its base in untapped markets like climate science, energy research, space exploration and digital biology.

Nvidia recently teamed up with Hewlett Packard Enterprise to bring AI software services to the cloud. NVIDIA AI enterprise is now available in Hewlett Packard Greenlake in select countries.

Intel, on the other hand, continues to be a leading name in the consumer PC market, thanks to its Alder Lake PC chips. The chip-giant has an innovative pipeline of products that includes Raptor Lake (13th gen) and Meteor Lake chips (built on Intel’s 4 nm manufacturing process).

However, declining PC demand doesn’t bode well for both Intel and AMD. Per the latest report from IDC, second-quarter 2022 PC sales were down 15.3% year over year to 71.3 million units, higher than the first quarter's decline of 5.1%.

AMD-partner Dell Technologies DELL also cautioned about a slowing PC market in its recently concluded fiscal second-quarter earnings call.

In late July, AMD and Dell launched a 17” AMD Advantage laptop, the Alienware m17 r5 Gaming Laptop. The new laptop is integrated with AMD Ryzen 6000 series processors, AMD Radeon RX 6000 series graphics, and new AMD Smart Technologies.
This high-end gaming laptop is expected to strengthen AMD's footprint in the consumer PC market.

Moreover, AMD’s focus on diversifying its product portfolio to cater to new and trending markets like cloud, gaming and data centers is expected to help it counter the declining PC demand.

Moreover, AMD’s acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando will help it to expand in the augmented reality (AR) space and data center business. Xilinx’s acquisition expands AMD's technology and product portfolio and adds multiple high-margin long-term revenue streams across a new set of markets such as AI and AR.

This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company provided strong 2022 guidance for revenues backed by robust growth across all businesses. Higher server and client processor revenues are likely to lead to a sequential increase. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

AMD expects third-quarter 2022 revenues to be $6.7 billion (+/-$200 million), which indicates year-over-year growth of 55%. For 2022, AMD expects revenues to increase 60% year over year to $26.3 billion (+/-$300 million).

2022-08-30 00:00:00+00:00,7 No-Brainer Dividend Stocks to Buy if You Have Money to Invest,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-no-brainer-dividend-stocks-to-buy-if-you-have-money-to-invest,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
No-brainer dividend stocks provide investors with a safe place to put their money and leave it. A dividend is the distribution of a company’s earnings to its shareholders that typically takes the form of a quarterly distribution. However, some dividend distributions are made on a monthly or annual basis.
Most dividends are paid out as cash or in the form of a reinvestment in additional stock of the company. How much of a dividend an investor gets depends on how many shares of a company’s stock they hold.
Over time, dividend payments can add up significantly and many people come to depend on them as a source of income, particularly in retirement. Investors with big stock holdings can earn millions of dollars a year from dividend distributions.
For example, famed investor Warren Buffett owns 400 million shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Hr earns $704 million a year in dividend payments based on Coke’s annual dividend payout of $1.76 per share.
That’s just one of many high-yielding dividend stocks the Oracle of Omaha has in his portfolio. Here are seven no-brainer dividend stocks to buy if you have money to invest.
MO Altria Group $45.88
VZ Verizon $43.25
IBM IBM  $130.38
INTC Intel $33.36
AVGO Broadcom $520.86
HAS Hasbro $80.44
CPB Campbell Soup Company $50.69
Altria Group (Mo)
Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com
With a dividend that yields 7.85%, Altria Group (NYSE:MO) easily makes any list of no-brainer dividend stocks to buy. Investors will be hard-pressed to find another stock with as high a dividend yield.
The average dividend yield among companies listed on the S&P 500 index is just 1.69%. That said, it is important to note that Altria Group is one of the world’s biggest tobacco companies.
Altria is the parent company of Philip Morris and its most well-known product is Marlboro cigarettes. Altria Group also has a stake in e-cigarette maker Juul. The high dividend yield is partly to help investors overcome any qualms they might have about investing in a company that makes an unhealthy product.
Investors who are okay with so-called “sin stocks” should consider Altria for its monster dividend yield that translates into a quarterly payout of $0.90 per share.
Another reason to consider an investment in MO stock is that it has outperformed the broader market so far this year. Since January, Altria stock has declined 4%. That’s a much better performance than the 15% year-to-date drop in the benchmark S&P 500.
Altria also rewarded investors by repurchasing more than 21 million of its own shares in the first six months of 2022.
Verizon (VZ)
Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com
Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is a household name and known for its telecommunications services, notably its mobile network, which counts more than 120 million subscribers. That makes Verizon the biggest wireless carrier in the U.S.
VZ stock also pays a huge dividend yield of 5.92% which is one of the very biggest payouts among technology companies. Consider that many leading technology companies, such as Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), pay no dividend, and Verizon’s yield looks truly exceptional. The dividend payment of VZ stock is currently $0.64 a share per quarter.
As with many of the no-brainer dividend stocks to buy on this list, the high dividend yield is designed to attract and keep investors despite the chronic underperformance of VZ stock.
Verizon has declined 21% over the past 12 months and is down 10% over the last five years. At $43.25 a share, VZ is currently changing hands at around the same price it was at in 2007.
Shareholders can console themselves, knowing that they’re earning a decent income from holding the stock in their portfolio. Verizon looks well-positioned for the future, having recently spent $45.5 billion to acquire the most 5G internet spectrum among major U.S. carriers. As no-brainer dividend stocks go, the 5G bet seems obvious.
IBM (IBM)
Source: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has a high dividend yield of 5.06%, which equates to a quarterly payment to shareholders of $1.65 per share.
The ultra-high dividend is to compensate for the disappointing performance of IBM stock over the past two decades. At its current price, IBM stock is trading at the same level it was in July 1999.
IBM got as high as $200 a share in 2013 but has largely struggled for many years, much to the irritation of shareholders. But there is hope for IBM stock.
Last November, IBM spun off its long-in-the-tooth managed infrastructure services arm, which is basically its army of more than 90,000 information technology consultants, into a new publicly traded company called Kyndryl (NYSE:KD).
That leaves IBM to focus on more profitable business areas that include computer hardware, software, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence and research. KD stock is down 73% since going public last fall and trading at $10.89 a share.
Intel (INTC)
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is another struggling technology company with a strong dividend that currently yields 4.38%.
Still the world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturer by revenue, Intel has lost ground in recent years to competitors that include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). However, it makes the cut as one of the no-brainer dividend stocks to buy because Intel is fighting its way back.
INTC is investing billions of dollars in developing advanced semiconductors and microchips. Specifically, the company has announced plans to invest $20 billion in two new chip fabrication plants in Ohio.
The two Ohio plants are the first step towards a mega-site that will eventually house eight chip factories at a development cost of $100 billion. The heavy investments and time required to revamp Intel’s operations weighs on INTC stock, which is down 37% this year.
The dividend yield translates to a $0.37 per share quarterly payout to patient shareholders. It’s worth noting that with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 7.15, INTC stock looks extremely cheap right now. Investors with a long time horizon might want to buy into Intel’s turnaround story.
Broadcom (AVGO)
Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com
Another semiconductor company that pays a strong dividend is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), with a 3.15% dividend yield. That’s a strong payout from Broadcom, whose semiconductors are used to help power data storage centers and wireless networks.
Unlike the other tech companies on this list, AVGO stock has performed well for shareholders, having risen 4% in the past year and gained 106% over the last five years. That makes it the no-brainer of no-brainer dividend stocks. Currently sporting a P/E ratio of 25.81, Broadcom is not cheap. But it is worth it for the dividend and share price appreciation.
Broadcom first paid investors a quarterly dividend of $0.07 a share in the fourth quarter of 2010. Since then, the company has grown its dividend payout by 20% annually to its current level of $4.10 a share per quarter.
At the end of its fiscal second quarter this year (ended on May 31), Broadcom paid dividends to shareholders worth $3.5 billion, which equaled a payout ratio of 47%, making the AVGO stock dividend very sustainable.
Investors can reasonably expect further dividend increases for many years to come. Broadcom certainly has strong earnings to justify increasing its dividend payouts, with net income in the past two quarters growing 81% to $4.9 billion.
Hasbro (HAS)
Source: Shutterstock
Switching gears away from tech stocks, we come to toy and game maker Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) which today yields 3.48% or $0.70 per share each quarter.
Despite the success of its many toys, HAS stock has also struggled in recent years, trading 18% lower today than where it was five years ago.
The company’s stock has been hamstrung in recent years by the ill-fated acquisition of media company Entertainment One in 2019 for $4 billion. At that time, Hasbro was looking to spin its toys brands into films and TV shows. But there are now rumors that Hasbro is planning to sell off Entertainment One and adopt a back-to-basics approach.
Hasbro is expected to provide more information on its intentions for Entertainment One at its upcoming investor day conference this October. In the meantime, the company has partnered with The New York Times Co. (NYSE:NYT) to develop a new board game based on the popular Wordle digital puzzle.
Campbell Soup (CPB)
Source: HeinzTeh / Shutterstock.com
Lastly, we come to the Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB), one of the biggest processed food companies in the U.S. and an easy inclusion on a list of no-brainer dividend stocks to buy. 
CPB stock offers a dividend yield of 2.92%, good for a quarterly payment of $0.37 a share. In addition to the dividend, Campbell Soup’s stock has been fairly reliable over the years. At its current price of $50.69 a share, the stock is up 16% this year, far outpacing the S&P 500 index. In the last five years, CPB stock has gained 12%.
Analysts note that Campbell Soup is the type of consumer staple stock that tends to outperform in times of economic uncertainty and during periods of high inflation. Indeed, the company’s most recent earnings were very strong, leading several analysts who cover the company to issue upwardly revised price targets on CPB stock.
The company also issued bullish forward guidance and made clear that it is able to manage inflation pressures and continue to grow this year despite a challenging environment. Analysts seem to agree that Campbell Soup is a best-of-breed consumer staple stock. The high dividend yield is just icing on the cake.

BRUSSELS, Aug 29 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators will not appeal a court ruling scrapping its 997-million-euro ($991 million) fine against Qualcomm QCOM.O, people familiar with the matter said, in a major win for the U.S. chipmaker that ends a long-running saga.
The Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest, in its June judgment was scathing of the European Commission's handling of the case, saying procedural irregularities had affected Qualcomm's rights of defence.
Judges also invalidated the Commission's analysis that payments made by Qualcomm to Apple AAPL.O were anti-competitive because the regulator had not taken into account all the relevant facts.
It would be very difficult for the EU competition watchdog to win on both counts in an appeal, the people familiar with the matter said.
The judgment was a major setback for EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, who has handed out billion-euro fines to Alphabet GOOGL.O unit Google and opened investigations into Amazon AMZN.O, Apple and Facebook owner Meta META.O as part of her crackdown on Big Tech.
The European Commission, which can appeal to the EU Court of Justice (CJEU) on points of law, declined to comment. Qualcomm found itself in the EU's crosshairs in 2015.
The Commission's decision not to contest the Court finding was not surprising, said Peter Alexiadis, visiting professor at King's College in London.
""Even if the Commission were to succeed on the substantive grounds of appeal, such a victory would be nothing more than Pyrrhic, given the fact that the Commission decision would nevertheless inevitably be annulled on the procedural grounds, where the Commission's case seems to be weak,"" he said.
An appeal might, however, force the court to clarify which exclusivity relationships held by dominant firms were problematic, Alexiadis said.
""It is nevertheless disappointing that the antitrust Bar does not have a chance to benefit from a CJEU ruling on the question of economic incentives to pursue exclusivity strategies,"" he said.
The EU competition enforcer, in its 2018 decision, said Qualcomm paid billions of dollars to Apple from 2011 to 2016 to use only its chips in all its iPhones and iPads in order to block out rivals such as Intel Corp INTC.O.
Vestager faces her next test on Sept. 14, when the General Court will rule on Google's challenge against a record 4.34-billion-euro antitrust fine imposed for using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals.

Today we look at two noteworthy recent insider buys.
On Friday, Kennedy-Wilson Holdings's Director, Stanley R. Zax, made a $635,250 purchase of KW, buying 35,000 shares at a cost of $18.15 a piece. Kennedy-Wilson Holdings is trading up about 0.2% on the day Monday. Before this latest buy, Zax made one other buy in the past twelve months, purchasing $405,650 shares for a cost of $23.18 a piece.
And on Wednesday, CEO Patrick P. Gelsinger purchased $501,153 worth of Intel, purchasing 14,800 shares at a cost of $33.86 each. Before this latest buy, Gelsinger bought INTC on 3 other occasions during the past twelve months, for a total cost of $992,473 at an average of $47.04 per share. Intel is trading off about 0.5% on the day Monday. Bargain hunters are able to snag INTC even cheaper than Gelsinger did, with shares changing hands as low as $33.18 in trading on Monday which is 2.0% under Gelsinger's purchase price.

This change lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.67%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.57%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.14%.
Heading into today, shares of the world's largest chipmaker had lost 8.12% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.81% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.65% in that time.
Intel will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Intel to post earnings of $0.35 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 79.53%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $15.59 billion, down 18.77% from the year-ago period.
Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.27 per share and revenue of $66.31 billion. These totals would mark changes of -58.5% and -15.02%, respectively, from last year.
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Intel. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.

2022-08-29 00:00:00+00:00,1 Green Flag and 1 Red Flag for Nvidia After a Tough Earnings Report,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-green-flag-and-1-red-flag-for-nvidia-after-a-tough-earnings-report,,,"Most know by now that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) missed its second-quarter earnings estimates, which had already been lowered in a preannouncement, while delivering forward revenue guidance that was nearly $1 billion below analyst estimates.
Nvidia is experiencing a sudden collapse in demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) in its graphics segment, as video game, PC, and cryptocurrency mining demand have ground to a sudden halt.
While this is all known at the moment, and Nvidia's 50% plunge from highs reflects some of these concerns, the question for investors is where things go from here.
Looking ahead, there appears to be a big long-term green flag that could lead to a bullish rebound at some point, but another red flag that may cap Nvidia's gains -- or even lead to further declines if things don't go as planned.
Green flag: AI Transformers are more than meets the eye
While Nvidia's gaming division is in the post-pandemic doldrums, its most important segment is likely the data center market, specifically around new use cases for artificial intelligence (AI).
In each of the past few earnings calls, CEO Jensen Huang has noted the incredible importance of the recent innovation of Transformer models in AI. For reference, Transformers allow AI models to learn skills without the need for human-labeled data. In other words, the Transformer models allow AIs to ""learn"" for themselves, which is leading to increased use cases and breakthroughs across a host of different industries. ""The importance of this new model, Transformers, can't possibly... be overstated,"" Huang said on the Q2 conference call with analysts.
Although gaming plunged 44% last quarter, data center revenue managed a 61% year-over-year gain and a 1% quarter-over-quarter gain. But the muted quarterly gain was due to supply constraints for other non-GPU parts, such as networking devices, showing that data center demand is still healthy. ""We're seeing a great deal of demand for GPUs in the cloud,"" Huang said.
This argument for resilient data center demand in the face of a weakening or uncertain macroeconomic environment does seem to hold water. When money is tight, more companies may plug into the cloud, as opposed to building their own data centers. Furthermore, AI helps to boost company efficiency and competitiveness.
For example, even though Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is struggling right now on the revenue side and may be cutting some staff, it still wants to quintuple the amount of GPUs in its data centers this year for its deep recommender engine in order to combat Tik Tok.
Furthermore, cloud investment in China ground to a halt in the second quarter amid widespread lockdowns; however, that is unlikely to stay that way as the country reopens and stimulus measures begin to take hold.
Nvidia's new AI chip, Hopper, is also set to be released at the end of this year, which could reaccelerate data center growth. Hopper is designed specifically for Transformer models, which are leading to breakthroughs that, Huang said, ""I don't think anybody could have predicted.""
Given the rapid growth of AI applications, especially in the cloud, as evidenced by Meta's announcement, recent earnings from all of the large cloud infrastructure hyperscalers, as well cloud data platform Snowflake, it seems likely Nvidia's data center segment has years of growth ahead of it, no matter what the consumer side of the equation is doing.
Red flag: Interest rates and valuation
Although the data center segment seems poised for growth, the gaming headwinds could last for some time, just given the fading of pandemic headwinds as well as lower consumer spending likely in the year ahead.
On Friday, Fed Chairman Jay Powell said that bringing inflation back down would take ""some time"" and involve ""some pain."" That means the Federal Reserve would likely continue raising interest rates until the Fed has achieved its 2% target. Some leading economists think the Federal Funds rate will need to go much higher in order to tame inflation, even though there has been significant increases already.
While Nvidia's stock has been bid down this year, down 48.3% from all-time highs, it still trades at 44 times earnings. That multiple is certainly high, especially for the cyclical semiconductor sector. While Nvidia should still generate above-sector growth over the long-term, as this quarter's results and guidance showed, its non-data center businesses in gaming and professional visualization are still quite cyclical. Since Nvidia's peers trade at more market-level multiples (or below) due to their cyclicality, it's curious that Nvidia's multiple has made such a gap over its peers.
So while there may not be anything particularly wrong with Nvidia's business -- quite the contrary, actually -- rising interest rates and a potential recession next year could make upside difficult. Furthermore, if on the off-hand chance either Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) or even Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which is beginning to make its own GPUs, makes competitive inroads, Nvidia's sky-high multiple could cause a fall in the stock, since there isn't much margin of safety there.
For the record, I don't see Nvidia losing its lead in high-end GPUs anytime soon, it's just with a multiple that much ahead of its semiconductor peers, and with interest rates likely to stay higher than they have been for the last 10 years -- when Nvidia's stock took off --its valuation remains a red flag in this environment.
If Nvidia's ""green flag"" in the data center has more growth upside to compensate for the ""red flag"" of the high multiple, the stock may bottom here; however, investors should note that there isn't the biggest margin of safety in this much-loved stock, and we are headed into a very uncertain environment in terms of both interest rates and economic activity.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-08-27 00:00:00+00:00,Looking for Tech Stocks? These 3 Are Great Buys,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/looking-for-tech-stocks-these-3-are-great-buys-4,,,"The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) market index is down 20% year-to-date, nearly doubling the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) market tracker's 12% price drop.
As a result, some of the most expensive tech stocks of yesteryear are on fire sale in 2022. And while a few of them really deserved a radical haircut, others haven't done anything wrong and investors should consider buying them at today's modest share prices.
On that note, here are three tech stocks that look like fantastic buys right now. Will they fit your portfolio, too? Let's have a look.
Intel: A sleeping giant
Semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has been on the ropes in recent years. Management scandals and manufacturing mishaps provided an opening for smaller chip companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) to chip away at Intel's dominant market share, especially in the lucrative data center market. If you sold your Intel shares in the last five years, I understand you.
But you can't keep this technology titan down for long. Intel is investing heavily in expanded and improved chip-making facilities, including a $30 billion expansion of its fabs in Chandler, Arizona. The company is many times larger than AMD or Nvidia, and eager to turns its unequaled capital reserves into a real-world business advantage again.
Meanwhile, Intel's stock is trading at five-year lows at a deeply discounted valuation of 7.5 times earnings or 9.5 times free cash flows. These metrics stand far below their 5-year averages of 13 and 16, respectively.
The stock also offers a generous dividend yield of 4.3%, among the highest yields in company history. I recommend locking in those tremendous effective dividend yields while Intel's share prices are low.

Nokia: Don't call it a comeback
... because Nokia (NYSE: NOK) has been here for years. It just looks a bit different from what you're used to.
The Finnish telecom equipment giant has changed a lot in recent years. Smartphones are just a hobby for Nokia nowadays as the company focuses on the network providers' side of the mobile networking equation. As a global leader in that space, Nokia is a preferred provider of 5G network equipment in important markets like the U.S., Taiwan, Mexico, and Japan.
These multi-year deals give Nokia a strong operating base from which it can deliver steady top-line sales and improving profit margins even in challenging market conditions. Yet, Wall Street isn't paying attention to this proven technology leader. Nokia's shares have fallen 18% in 2022 and currently change hands at the bargain-bin valuation of 11 times forward earnings or 1.3 times trailing sales.
And if you thought the switch from handsets to telecom infrastructure was a radical strategy shift, maybe you didn't know that the same company used to sell paper products and car tires. This company is ready to roll with whatever punches the market might throw at it, and the stock is incredibly cheap. That's a reliable recipe for strong long-term returns.
Roku: A market-defining pioneer
The entertainment industry is changing. I mean, the way people consume movies and TV shows is transforming before our eyes. Cable TV, broadcast stations, and movie theaters used to rule the roost but a new set of digital streaming services are eating their lunch right now. So I could recommend streaming content leader Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) or family friendly veteran Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) here, pointing out how digital streams still account for a small portion of consumers' content consumption, both domestically and around the world. The target market is about the size of the planet and the untapped growth potential is enormous.
But then you'd have to pick a long-term winner in the streaming wars. Early leaders like Disney and Netflix are likely to hold on to their market shares for many years, but you never know when another content creator might step up to the plate with a surprisingly successful catalog.
I don't want to pick a winner here, so I own both Netflix and the House of Mouse. At the same time, I have also built a large position in streaming technology expert Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), because this company will benefit from the growing digital media market no matter who comes out on top in the content battles.
Furthermore, Roku has been hanging out in Wall Street's bargain bin recently. Roku's stock was not invited to the broader market's modest rebound over the summer and the shares trade near their three-year lows today. Critics point to a slowdown in advertising sales, which led to Roku falling short of analysts' earnings and revenue estimates in last month's second-quarter report. But the bears are making a mountain out of a temporary molehill.
""The current economic state is causing TV advertisers to pause and reconsider spend, which is painful in the short term,"" Roku CEO and founder Anthony Wood said in the latest earnings call. ""But it also causes them to seek greater efficiency and [return on investments], which will benefit Roku in the mid and long term. This reminds us of when advertisers paused spend during the 2008 recession, but it became a catalyst that accelerated the shift of ad spend from print publishing to digital.""
That insight makes a ton of sense. Advertisers are seeking ultra-efficient marketing platforms right now, hoping to stretch every advertising dollar as far as possible. The lessons learned on both sides of the ad platform and advertiser relationship will come in handy when marketing budgets are going up again.
In other words, market makers are punishing the stock because results look a little weak in the short term while Roku is currently learning how to turn a richer profit in the long run. That's a no-brainer buy signal in my eyes.

2022-08-26 00:00:00+00:00,Is It a Good Time to Invest in Semiconductor Stocks?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-a-good-time-to-invest-in-semiconductor-stocks,,,"With the global semiconductor market expected to witness double-digit growth in 2022, it could be the right time to invest in semiconductor stocks. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) are the five semiconductor stocks that could help investors pocket exceptional returns as the market expands.
According to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), the global semiconductor market is expected to rise by almost 14% this year to $633 billion, riding on strong chip demand. This follows a 13.3% year-over-year increase in worldwide semiconductor sales to $152.5 billion in the second quarter of 2022, data from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) showed.
Elaborating on the second-quarter figures, John Neuffer, the President and CEO of the SIA, said that semiconductor sales rose “across all major regional markets and product categories” year-over-year.
In 2022, WSTS expects the Logic semiconductor segment to lead all categories with a growth of 24.1%, followed by Analog (21.9%) and Sensors (16.6%). It also projects semiconductor sales to surge 23.5% in the Americas, 14.2% in Japan, 14% in Europe, and 10.5% in the Asia Pacific region.
WSTS has also provided a worldwide semiconductor sales forecast for the next year. It anticipates the global semiconductor market to be valued at $662 billion in 2023, up 4.6% year-over-year, driven by mid-single digit growth across all categories. The Logic segment is expected to rise the most next year to reach $200 million and account for around 30% of the total market.
Now, let’s learn more about the five companies mentioned above that could receive a major boost as the demand for semiconductor chips rises.
Before we proceed any further, here is a pictorial comparison of the five stocks, NVDA, INTC, AMD, AVGO, and QCOM, for you to consider.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)
Founded in 1993, Nvidia offers computer graphics and artificial intelligence services to industries including transportation, gaming, and healthcare. Based in the Californian city of Santa Clara, the company boasts of a market cap of over $430 billion.
Nvidia recently reported financial results for the fiscal second quarter, which were hit by supply chain constraints and a challenging macro environment. While several analysts reduced their price target for Nvidia, following the release of its results, they continued to maintain a Buy rating on the stock. This signifies that they expect the company to overcome the headwinds and continue to grow.
Is Nvidia a Buy?
On TipRanks, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys and seven Holds. Nvidia’s average price forecast of $220 implies 22.8% upside potential. Bloggers are also positively inclined toward the stock, as they are 81% Bullish on the company, compared to the sector average of 66%.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
With a market cap of almost $140 billion, Intel is one of the oldest technology companies in the world. It offers Internet of Things (IoT), data center, cloud computing, and PC solutions to power today’s digital world. The California-headquartered company recently signed a $30 billion deal with Canada-based Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) to set up a semiconductor fabrication plant in Arizona.
The deal forms a part of Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger’s plan to make the company a leader in contract chip manufacturing. It would also help the tech giant save cash to continue paying dividends. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon believes the deal would rid Intel of the need to borrow funds to implement its expansion plans.
Is Intel a Buy, Sell or Hold?
Based on five Buys, 16 Holds, and nine Sells, Intel has a Hold consensus rating, as per TipRanks. INTC’s average price target of $40.50 suggests 16.1% upside potential to current price levels. Meanwhile, bloggers and retail investors are convinced about Intel’s future growth, which is visible from their positive stance on the stock.
TipRanks data shows that 77% of financial bloggers are Bullish on the stock, compared to the sector average of 66%. Additionally, 1.8% of retail investors on TipRanks have increased their exposure to the stock over the past 30 days.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)
Advanced Micro Devices manufactures and sells graphics, processors, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SOCs (system-on-chip), and software to the gaming and business computing industries. The $150 billion company reported upbeat second-quarter results at the beginning of this month. However, its third-quarter forecast fell slightly short of analyst expectations.
Is AMD a Buy Right Now?
Encouraged by strong second-quarter results, most Wall Street analysts reiterated a Buy rating on AMD recently and suggested that investors could consider buying the dip as the company is poised for long-term growth.
As of now, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, which is based on 19 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell. AMD’s average price target of $123.17 implies upside potential of 26.7%.
As per TipRanks, as many as 19 hedge funds that were active in the last quarter increased their stakes in AMD by 1.9 million shares.
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)
Based out of San Jose, Broadcom designs, manufactures, and sells semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Its offerings include motor drive & control solutions, broadband access solutions, enterprise security solutions, financial services solutions, data center solutions, and broadband Wi-Fi AP solutions.
The $222 billion company is scheduled to release its fiscal third-quarter results next week. The Street anticipates earnings to come in at $9.56 per share, compared to $9.07 reported in the second quarter and $6.96 per share reported in the fiscal third quarter of last year. Broadcom expects revenues to total around $8.4 billion in the third quarter.
Is Broadcom a Good Stock to Buy?
All nine analysts that have provided coverage on the stock have a Buy rating on Broadcom, which makes AVGO stock a Strong Buy. Broadcom’s stock price prediction of $702.50 mirrors 27.7% upside potential.
Bloggers and retail investors have a positive stance on the stock. TipRanks data shows that 2.1% of retail investors increased their exposure to the stock over the past 30 days. Further, 95% of financial bloggers are Bullish on AVGO, compared to the sector average of 66%.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)
San Diego-based Qualcomm develops and sells wireless technology, semiconductor chips, IoT, PC computing, and 5G solutions, among others. Last month, the $164 billion company reported outstanding fiscal third-quarter results, driven by record QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) Automotive and IoT revenues.
However, it lowered its fiscal fourth-quarter outlook to account for the impact of macroeconomic headwinds and lower-than-expected global demand for smartphones. Following the results, John Vinh of KeyBanc said that Qualcomm will be able to boost its share in markets like automotive, augmented and virtual reality devices, and computers.
What Is Qualcomm’s Price Target?
Qualcomm’s average price target stands at $189.85, implying almost 30% upside potential. The stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TipRanks, which is based on 11 Buys and five Holds. Further, QCOM scores a nine out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, suggesting that the stock has strong potential to outperform the market.
Are Semiconductor Stocks a Good Long-Term Investment?
Semiconductor stocks could prove to be a good long-term investment option as demand for semiconductor products is bound to rise on the back of technological advancements and increased global digital connectivity. Smartphone and computer manufacturers are not the only clients of semiconductor companies anymore. Makers of electronic devices like TVs, refrigerators, washing machines, and LED bulbs have also started using semiconductor products and devices in their offerings.
Additionally, analyst Vinh believes that “deteriorating demand for smartphones” is a short-term phenomenon and is not likely to have any significant impact on the profitability of semiconductor companies.

2022-08-26 00:00:00+00:00,5-Star Analyst Thinks Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Has a Bright Future,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-star-analyst-thinks-intel-nasdaq%3Aintc-has-a-bright-future,,,"For the past few years, the world’s largest chipmaker, Intel (INTC), has been buckling under pressure from elevated costs, intense competition, and supply shortages and constraints. The company also had hit a plateau with regard to technological innovation and, thus, lost its appeal on the way. Shares of the company have dropped considerably and are currently trading near its 52-week low of $33.6. Nonetheless, Needham analyst Quinn Bolton reiterated his bullish stance on the company recently, stating that it has a bright future.
Interestingly, the productivity lull was broken with the announcement of an investment program in partnership with global asset management firm Brookfield, on August 23. As part of the agreement, both partners will jointly invest $30 billion toward chip production. The investment will hasten the construction of two new wafer fab equipment production sites in Chandler, AZ.
Has Intel Found Its Way Back?
Bolton is upbeat about the financial flexibility that the partnership is expected to bring to Intel. The capital from the program will be below Intel’s cost of equity (CoE) of approximately 8.5% and above its cost of debt (CoD), which is around 4.5%, strengthening the balance sheet. For context, CoE is the returns expected by an investor on an equity investment, and CoD is the effective interest rate that a company pays on a loan. Bolton expects the cost of new capital to be around 6.5%.
Back in February’s Investor Day event, Intel had projected that the support from the U.S. government, private investment, and others would reduce its five-year expected capital expenditures by at least 10%, which might go up to 20-30%. The latest program deal and the government’s CHIPS and Science Act, signed earlier this month, make it all the more likely that the capital expenditure offsetting can hit the higher end of the projection, at least in CY2022. The funding itself will reduce upfront CapEx by about $15 billion.
Moreover, the program is also likely to help Intel achieve cash flow break-even sooner than it would under the traditional model. While boosting the bottom line of the company, this will also ensure the maintenance of cash/debt balance for other investments and continued dividend payments.
Bolton said, “Prior to the call, we believed Intel may have to give up half of its profits once the fabs reached full volume. This is NOT the case and we are more positive on the program as Intel keeps most of the upside.”
Needless to say, the analyst reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $40.
Is Intel a Buy, Sell, or Hold?
Wall Street is yet to arrive at the same conviction as Bolton and has a Hold consensus rating on Intel, which is based on five Buys, 16 Holds, and one Sell. INTC's average price target is $40.50, indicating a 16.08% upside from current levels.
Parting Thoughts
The financial strength that the semiconductor investment program is expected to offer Intel holds most solutions to the concerns about the company’s future. Cash flows will start reflecting in the company’s profitability earlier than expected, which will boost its dividends as well as share gains.

Aug 25 (Reuters) - Dell Technologies Inc DELL.N posted its slowest revenue growth in six quarters on Thursday as a surge in the dollar and COVID-19 flare-ups in major market China offset a jump in its enterprise-focused business.
Shares of the company fell more than 7% in extended trading.
The greenback surge has this year eaten into the earnings of technology firms from Microsoft Inc MSFT.O to Apple Inc AAPL.O, compounding pressure from a drop in consumer spending on electronics such as personal computers and smartphones.
Dell's revenue rose 9% to $26.43 billion in the quarter to July 29 and was roughly in line with market expectations, according to Refinitiv data.
Consumer revenue fell 9%, echoing weakness seen at Intel Corp INTC.O and Lenovo Group 0992.HK as demand weakened after a pandemic-fueled boom and decades-high inflation prompted consumers to prioritize essentials.
But orders from businesses gearing up for the hybrid-work era pushed Dell's commercial revenue up by 15% to $12.1 billion. The storage and servers-focused unit also posted strong growth.
Net income from continuing operations fell to $506 million, from $629 million a year ago.
Excluding items, Dell earned $1.68 per share.

2022-08-25 00:00:00+00:00,7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy on the Dip,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-on-the-dip,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
With August’s signing of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, investors ought to consider semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip. Primarily, this groundbreaking legislation will make historic investments to bolster competitiveness among U.S. workers and businesses. More importantly, the bill represents a key component of economic stability and national security.
Earlier, I mentioned that the CHIPS Act could potentially address supply chain vulnerabilities. One of the lessons of 2022 is that the U.S. competes with international rivals who may lack a full deck. For instance, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine forced the recognition that inflows of critical commodities risk disruption at a moment’s notice. However, bolstering domestic production could mitigate such impacts, thereby drawing interest for semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip.
Moreover, stability in the chip-manufacturing space represents a tailwind for every technology player. True, the CHIPS Act seemingly supports certain semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip more so than others. However, in a tacky Hallmark sort of way, we’re all in this together. What’s good for the U.S. chip sector should invigorate domestic and western-friendly markets.
Semiconductor Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Intel (INTC)
Source: tomeqs / Shutterstock.com
Tech icon Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) represents one of the riskier plays among semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip. However, it may also be the most compelling.
Recently, Reuters reported that Intel inked an agreement with Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) to “jointly fund up to $30 billion for the U.S. chipmaker’s leading-edge chip factories in Arizona.” This contract fuels “Intel’s ambition to bring more chip production onshore without weighing on its balance sheet.”
Reuters added that through the deal, “Intel could preserve debt capacity for other priorities with financing commitment for a multi-year project, while maintaining operational control.” David Zinsner, Intel’s finance chief, stated that the arrangement “builds on the momentum from the recent passage of the CHIPS Act in the U.S.”
Here’s the deal with INTC stock. On a year-to-date basis through the close of the Aug. 24 session, shares hemorrhaged more than 36% of market value. However, Gurufocus considers Intel to be “significantly undervalued.” In particular, the company’s forward price-earnings ratio is 13.6 times, below the industry median of 17.
Micron Technology (MU)

Another intriguing name among semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) represents a clear beneficiary of the CHIPS Act. According to the White House announcement on the matter, Micron announced a $40 billion investment in memory chip manufacturing.
Per the statement, the initiative will create up to 40,000 new jobs in construction and manufacturing. “This investment alone will bring the U.S. market share of memory chip production from less than 2 percent to up to 10 percent over the next decade.”
To be sure, this latest development represents a substantial tailwind for the broader U.S. tech industry. However, Micron is especially eager to bolster stability in domestic supply chains. A few years ago, the New York Times highlighted how the company suffered from a sophisticated Chinese corporate espionage incident.
Looking at the equities market, MU clearly has seen better days, suffering a 39% YTD loss. Still, Gurufocus rates shares as “modestly undervalued.” Therefore, MU should be on your radar of semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip.
Semiconductor Stocks to Buy: Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)

To be clear, the CHIPS Act’s main focus centers on invigorating U.S. production, thus directly challenging China’s hegemony. At the same time, the bill may benefit neighboring countries, particularly Mexico as an alternative to Asian chip production. Therefore, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) may deserve some attention from investors bargain-hunting semiconductor stocks.
According to Nikkei Asia, “Mexico stands to benefit from U.S. incentives for chipmakers, an Economy Secretariat official said, arguing that her country offers a lower-cost production base for companies like Intel.”
Mexico, with its proximity and trade links to the U.S., sees America’s bid to decouple its chip supply chain from Asia as an opportunity to attract nearshoring investment.
“It does not make sense to do everything in the United States because it is much more expensive,” Monica Duhem Delgado, head of the secretariat’s global economic intelligence unit, said in an interview. With Skyworks already having operations in Mexico, SWKS may be built for the long run.
Additionally, the integrated device maker features a significantly undervalued profile, likely attracting attention among speculators.
ASML (ASML)

As a Dutch company, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) doesn’t immediately stand out as one of the semiconductor stocks to buy. At least, it doesn’t stand out in terms of CHIPS Act beneficiaries. However, investors should consider two factors. First, ASML calls a friendly nation home. Second, it’s the only company capable of assembling extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, per CNBC.
“ASML has a monopoly on the fabrication of EUV lithography machines, the most advanced type of lithography equipment that’s needed to make every single advanced processor chip that we use today,” said Chris Miller, assistant professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. “The machines that they produce, each one of them is among the most complicated devices ever made.”
Put another way, CHIPS Act or not, ASML drives indelible relevance to the chip-manufacturing segment. With the U.S. securing its own supply chain, this may be a matter of a rising tide lifting all boats.
As a bonus, Gurufocus considers ASML stock to be “modestly undervalued.” Not surprisingly because of its relevance, the issuing company features excellent profitability metrics.
Semiconductor Stocks to Buy: Microchip Technology (MCHP)

Billed as a leading provider of smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions, Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) offers an intriguing take on semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip. While shares have enjoyed some recent momentum, gaining about 6% in the trailing month, MCHP currently is down 22% for the year. Given the broader implications of the CHIPS Act, the stock potentially has much room to run higher.
In part, Microchip released this statement regarding the legislation:
It provides critical investments to even the global playing field for U.S. semiconductor companies and is strategically important for our economic and national security. As the largest U.S.-headquartered supplier of microcontrollers and the global leader in semiconductors in , we will benefit from the Act’s investment tax credits and potential additional grants.
Because of rising tensions in the geopolitical sphere, Microchip will likely see greater fundamental demand. As well, MCHP delivers a nice bonus, with Gurufocus rating the company as modestly undervalued. In particular, its forward PE of 12 times is more favorable than the 17-times median for the semiconductor industry.
Nvidia (NVDA)

While the CHIPS Act represented a key achievement for the Biden administration, it didn’t receive universal support. True, the bill was bipartisan in nature. However, drilling into the granularity, some critics pointed out that the federal government will end up picking winners and losers. In other words, the CHIPS Act directly benefits chip manufacturers, not designers who outsource the manufacturing component to other companies.
Therefore, on the face of it, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) doesn’t appear to be one of the best semiconductor stocks to buy here. Its specialty focuses on innovative chip designs, not physically building them. To the critics’ point, Nvidia’s rivals that do feature a manufacturing arm (i.e. Intel) get an unfair advantage.
Nevertheless, the bigger point to remember is that the CHIPS Act should shore up domestic tech supply chains. When the coronavirus pandemic hit us, it devastated everyone involved in the semiconductor ecosystem. With greater stability forecasted, Nvidia should improve, meaning NVDA belongs on your radar.
Semiconductor Stocks to Buy: GlobalFoundries (GFS)
Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.com
When one of the starkest lessons of the Covid-19 crisis focused on dependencies. As multiple news outlets discussed, Taiwan dominates the foundry (or outsourced semiconductor manufacturing) business. However, the country also finds itself routinely embroiled in geopolitical controversy. Plus, the region itself represents a hotspot waiting to spill over militarily.
So, many people asked themselves why the U.S. couldn’t drive its own foundry industry? Well, the Malta, New York-headquartered GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS) offers a viable solution. Combined with the CHIPS Act, it now has the support it needs to drive its expansion efforts.
According to the aforementioned White House press release, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and GlobalFoundries have announced a new partnership. In part, this agreement involves $4.2 billion to “manufacture chips in an expansion of GlobalFoundries’ upstate New York facility. Qualcomm, the leading fabless semiconductor company in the world, announced plans to increase semiconductor production in the U.S. by up to 50 percent over the next five years.”
Now, GFS shares are up 30% over the trailing month so they might not have the greatest upside potential. Still, down almost 10% for the year, GFS is one of the semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip.

2022-08-25 00:00:00+00:00,October 7th Options Now Available For Intel Corp (INTC),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/october-7th-options-now-available-for-intel-corp-intc,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 7th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new October 7th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $33.00 strike price has a current bid of 82 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $33.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $32.18 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $34.41/share today.
Because the $33.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.48% return on the cash commitment, or 21.09% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $33.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $35.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.17. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $34.41/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $35.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.11% if the stock gets called away at the October 7th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $35.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.40% boost of extra return to the investor, or 28.86% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $34.41) to be 34%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-08-24 00:00:00+00:00,Which Blue-Chip Stock is Rated a “Strong Buy” by Wall Street Pros?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/which-blue-chip-stock-is-rated-a-strong-buy-by-wall-street-pros,,,"Persistent market volatility is keeping investors worried. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance indicates continued interest rate hikes to tame inflation. Many fear that rising interest rates might push the economy into a recession. Amid these uncertain times, many investors seek opportunities to pick up some blue-chip stocks trading at attractive levels. Blue chips are large, well-established companies, and often rank among the dominant players in their respective sectors. Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, we placed Intel, Boeing, and AT&T against each other to pick the blue-chip stock that earns a “Strong Buy” consensus rating from Wall Street analysts.     
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
The chip giant has been struggling over the past few years and has been losing ground to rivals, like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), due to product delays and a lack of innovation. The ongoing macro challenges have made matters worse, with Intel recently reporting a massive second-quarter earnings miss. Aside from the economic downturn, the company also blamed internal execution issues and supply chain bottlenecks for its poor performance. 
Intel’s Q2 adjusted earnings per share declined 79% to $0.29 and revenue fell 22% to $15.3 billion. The company’s top line was impacted by lower demand for personal computer chips and weaker-than-anticipated data center chip sales.
Following the print, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann cut his price target for Intel stock to $30 from $40. Mosesmann reiterated a Sell rating, calling the quarter an “unmitigated disaster.” The analyst questioned as to why such a big earnings miss was not pre-announced by the management.
Mosesmann also pointed out the delay in the company’s next-gen Sapphire Rapids data center processors into 2023. The analyst feels that Intel's business model will be under pressure due to numerous years of share losses in the data center market, regardless of a recovery in the PC chip market.
Overall, with five Buys, 16 Holds, and nine Sells, the Street has a Hold consensus rating on Intel stock. The average INTC price target of $40.04 suggests 17.94% upside potential.  
Boeing (NYSE:BA)
Aviation giant Boeing has been under tremendous pressure over the past few years due to the grounding of its 737 MAX planes following fatal crashes, production halt related to the 787 Dreamliner, impact of the pandemic on the airlines sector, supply chain bottlenecks, and internal operational lapses.
Coming to recent performance, Boeing’s second-quarter results missed analysts’ expectations. However, the company is optimistic about delivering positive free cash flow this year.  
Furthermore, Boeing investors recently got a reason to rejoice as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) gave clearance to the company to commence deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner. Deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner aircraft have been suspended for more than a year due to production flaws.
Morgan Stanley analyst Kristine Liwag believes that the FAA’s preliminary regulatory clearance for 787 Dreamliner deliveries is “a major milestone for the business and unlocks another lever of free cash flow generation.”
Liwag noted that Boeing’s inventory comprises 120 787 aircraft, which according to her estimates could generate revenues of $17 billion. That said, the analyst cautioned that the company still needs to make the required fixes and FAA inspectors will have to give clearance to each aircraft before delivery. Overall, Liwag has a Buy rating on Boeing stock with a price target of $215.
On TipRanks, Boeing has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys and two Holds. The average Boeing stock price prediction of $213.33 implies 33.27% upside potential. 
AT&T (NYSE:T)
Earlier this year, telecom giant AT&T completed the spinoff of the WarnerMedia business to focus more on its core telecommunications business and invest in the growth areas of 5G and fiber. AT&T’s renewed focus seems to be fetching results, with the company reporting an impressive 813,000 postpaid phone net additions in the second quarter. What’s more, AT&T Fiber net additions came in at 316,000.
Despite better-than-expected Q2 results, investors were spooked by AT&T’s decision to slash the full-year free cash flow outlook by $2 billion to the $14 billion range. Growth investments, an elongated bill payment cycle, and macro challenges weighed on the company’s Q2 free cash flow and led to a downward revision to the full-year guidance.
Following the Q2 print, Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar downgraded AT&T stock to a Hold from Buy, and lowered the price target to $20 from $22. While the analyst acknowledges the impact of macro challenges on Q2 results, he feels that the company’s performance in the quarter could “renew concerns about management credibility.” The analyst noted that AT&T’s management lowered its guidance within four months of issuing it.
Venkateshwar opines that “visibility may worsen” if the economy slips into a recession. The analyst concluded, “AT&T seems to be back in the same place that it started with respect to concerns about its dividend sustainability and management credibility.”
The Street is cautiously optimistic on AT&T stock, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 10 Buys versus nine Holds. At $22.81, the average AT&T target price implies 26.30% upside potential.
Final Thoughts
While Intel is in the midst of a turnaround, persistent execution issues are keeping most of the analysts on the sidelines. Coming to AT&T, analysts seem to be treading carefully due to cash flow concerns. Meanwhile, currently, Wall Street is highly bullish on Boeing and sees higher upside potential in this blue-chip stock compared to Intel and AT&T. While Boeing still has much to do to regain its credibility, the company seems to be on the right track to revive its business.

The joint investment will be to the tune of up to $30 billion.
Intel will have a 51% stake in the expansion project for operational control. This will help it to conserve debt capacity for other requirements with commitments in finance-based projects having a time horizon of more than one year.
The investment reflects the continuation and extension of the deal signed by Brookfield and Intel in February for Intel’s site manufacturing finance-based options.
According to the terms of the investment, Intel will have operating control of the two chip factories assigned to produce advanced chips in Chandler, AZ. Brookfield will invest up to $15 billion for a 49% stake in the expansion project.
New products such as Xeon Scalable, improvements in cloud computing, enterprise upgrade and virtualization are expected to increase Intel’s sales. The company’s investment in field programmable gate array enables it to develop custom solutions for big players by increasing performance at lower power and increasing memory to reduce latency.
