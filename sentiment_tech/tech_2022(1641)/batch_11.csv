2022-10-19 00:00:00+00:00,"2 Semiconductor Stocks With 149% to 178% Upside, According to Wall Street",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-semiconductor-stocks-with-149-to-178-upside-according-to-wall-street,,,"There's no sugarcoating it: This has been a miserable year for professional and everyday investors. Regardless of whether you're new to investing or have been putting your money to work on Wall Street for decades, short-term losses in the three major U.S. indexes have put a dent in most portfolios.
Since hitting their respective all-time highs between mid-November and the first week of January, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and technology-fueled Nasdaq Composite have plunged by as much as 22%, 28%, and 38%. This places all three indexes firmly in a bear market.

But when there's pain on Wall Street, there's always opportunity -- and analysts know it. This may be especially true for the tech stocks that have really taken it on the chin since the year began.
For instance, semiconductor stocks have been taken to the woodshed on the growing prospect of a recession amid higher interest rates and persistent supply chain issues. But widening the lens a bit creates a far different outlook.
Based on a report from Fortune Business Insights, the global semiconductor market should near $1.4 trillion in value by 2029 and sustain a compound annual growth rate above 12% over the next seven years. In other words, patience could pay off handsomely for chip-stock investors.
What follows are two semiconductor stocks that offer upside ranging from 149% to as much as 178%, according to Wall Street.
Nvidia: Implied upside of 149%
The first chipmaker and solutions specialist with incredible upside potential is former top-10 market cap company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Analyst Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research foresees Nvidia hitting $280, which would imply a hearty 149% gain from where shares ended last week.
Ferragu, who increased New Street's price target on Nvidia in April, believes crypto-driven weakness will be short-lived, and that the company's data center business will be a significant long-term growth driver.
Although Nvidia is best-known for developing and selling the graphics cards used in personal computers for gaming, the company's data center solutions appear well positioned to take advantage of a shifting data climate. Though businesses were already moving data into the cloud well before the COVID-19 pandemic, the pace of this shift has picked up considerably in its wake. As data center demand increases, so should this high-margin opportunity for Nvidia.
Something often overlooked about Nvidia is the company's fast-growing professional visualization segment. Though it, too, is prone to cyclical weakness, this segment offers sustainable double-digit sales growth potential during long periods of economic expansion.
Professional visualization is the springboard that can help Nvidia become a key player in the metaverse -- i.e., the next iteration of the internet that'll allow connected users to interact with each other and their environment in 3D virtual worlds. The software and infrastructure needed to bring the metaverse to life will take years to develop. Nevertheless, the metaverse represents a multitrillion-dollar opportunity over the long run.
However, Nvidia is also contending with aforementioned supply chain challenges, and new regulations from Washington that restrict technology chip sales/exports to China. With a lot of near-term revenue uncertainty tied to this new regulation, it seems highly unlikely that Nvidia will approach New Street's price target anytime soon.

Intel: Implied upside of 178%
The second semiconductor stock with a boatload of potential upside, according to Wall Street, is Dow Jones component Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Analyst Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial has a $72 price target on shares of Intel, which represents upside of 178% from where shares of the company closed last week.
Feinseth's price target, which was upped from $68 to $72 in January (i.e., before the broader market meltdown), is based on the expectation that Intel's investments in processor innovation should allow it to generate abundant cash flow and remain highly competitive.
Interestingly, one of Nvidia's biggest cash flow drivers happens to also be one of Intel's. As more data is moved by businesses into the cloud, demand will grow for data center servers. Intel holds the lion's share of central processing unit (CPU) market share for data center servers.
That leads into the next point: Intel's market share demise is greatly overstated. Although Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has made inroads and chipped away at Intel's CPU share in personal computers (PCs), mobile, and data center servers, Intel's share losses in these segments have been nominally small. When viewed with a wider lens, intel is still the dominant CPU provider in PCs, and it's well ahead of AMD in mobile and data center servers.
Looking a bit further down the line, Intel should be one of the key beneficiaries of the CHIPS and Science Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in August. This law provides nearly $53 billion in subsidies for chipmakers to build domestic manufacturing plants and conduct research. Intel is already deploying $20 billion to build two manufacturing plants in Ohio. With potential subsidies in its sails, Intel is incented to expand its internal production/foundry capabilities to meet the demands of an increasingly digitized and tech-dependent world.
Optimists will also be intrigued by the upcoming spinoff and initial public offering (IPO) of autonomous vehicle segment Mobileye. Intel purchased Mobileye for $15.3 billion five years ago, but believes the company could fetch a $30 billion valuation for its IPO. Mobileye's sales surged 41% to $460 million in the June-ended quarter, which is all the more impressive considering the challenges the U.S. economy faced during the second quarter.
But just like Nvidia, Intel has multiple headwinds to contend with. Economic weakness, coupled with the China export ban, is likely to slow chip demand. Further, it'll still be a few years before the company reaps the rewards of increased manufacturing capacity. While shares of Intel are ripe for the picking by long-term investors, Feinseth's price target of $72 appears out of the question anytime soon.

2022-10-18 00:00:00+00:00,Could The Market Be Wrong About Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/could-the-market-be-wrong-about-intel-corporation-nasdaq%3Aintc-given-its-attractive,,,"With its stock down 34% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Intel's ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.
How Is ROE Calculated?
The formula for return on equity is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intel is:
19% = US$19b ÷ US$101b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.19 in profit.
Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
Intel's Earnings Growth And 19% ROE
To start with, Intel's ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 19%. This certainly adds some context to Intel's moderate 11% net income growth seen over the past five years.
We then compared Intel's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 26% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.
NasdaqGS:INTC Past Earnings Growth October 18th 2022
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Intel's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.
Is Intel Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?
Intel has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 26% (or a retention ratio of 74%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.
Besides, Intel has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 54% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 13%, over the same period.
Summary
In total, we are pretty happy with Intel's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

2022-10-18 00:00:00+00:00,"Tech Sell-Off: These Nasdaq Stocks Could Drop Further, but One Looks Like a Screaming Buy",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tech-sell-off%3A-these-nasdaq-stocks-could-drop-further-but-one-looks-like-a-screaming-buy,,,"Weak demand after two years of solid growth is taking a toll on personal computer (PC) sales in 2022, and market research firm IDC's latest report suggests that the situation won't get better anytime soon.
IDC reports PC shipments fell 15% year over year in the third quarter of 2022. Aside from Apple, all the major PC original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) saw a big decline in shipments last quarter. Market leader Lenovo, for instance, had a 16% decline in shipments over the prior year, while HP and Dell saw greater declines of 28% and 21%, respectively.
The sharp drop in PC shipments doesn't bode well for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). These chipmakers are reeling under the impact of already weak PC shipments that have led to a drop in the demand for their processors. IDC's report indicates that things could be about to get worse for these semiconductor giants and their stock prices could drop further.
Nvidia, AMD, and Intel could see further sales declines
Nvidia sells graphics processing units (GPUs) that are used in PCs for content creation and gaming. Intel is the leading supplier of central processing units (CPUs). AMD, meanwhile, supplies both CPUs and GPUs for the PC market.
The sharp decline in PC shipments this year has weighed heavily on these companies. Intel's revenue, for instance, dropped 17% year over year in the second quarter to $15.3 billion. Nvidia's gaming revenue fell 33% year over year in the fiscal second quarter to $2.04 billion. The graphics specialist estimates that gaming revenue will drop further in the current quarter, and IDC's latest report suggests why that's going to be the case.
AMD, which seemed insulated from the PC market's troubles in the first half of the year, has also succumbed to the end market's weakness. The chipmaker slashed its Q3 revenue guidance by $1.1 billion to $5.6 billion. It expects year-over-year revenue growth of 29% now instead of the prior expectation of 55%. The company blamed ""reduced processor shipments due to a weaker than expected PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain"" for the massive reduction in its guidance.
IDC estimates that PC sales could drop nearly 13% for the full year to 305 million units, which points toward another year-over-year drop in sales during the fourth quarter. Total PC shipments stood at 226 million units in the first three quarters of 2022, which means that 79 million units are forecasted to be shipped in Q4. That would translate into a decline of nearly 15% over the year-ago quarter's shipments of 92.7 million.
As a result, Nvidia, AMD, and Intel's guidance for the final quarter of 2022 may not be up to investors' expectations as the PC market's contraction will limit their opportunities to boost sales or stage a recovery.
Analysts expect Intel's revenue in the quarter that ends in December to decline 14% year over year to $16.7 billion. Nvidia's revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter (which coincides with the final two months of 2022) is anticipated to drop 19% year over year. AMD is still expected to clock 26% year-over-year growth in Q4, which the company may be able to achieve thanks to strength in other areas such as gaming consoles and data centers.
However, it won't be surprising to see a tempered forecast from AMD on account of lower processor sales and a drop in the average selling prices of CPUs, the two factors that affected its performance in Q3.
What should investors do?
Intel is trying to turn its business around and prevent more share losses to AMD. But that looks unlikely thanks to the latter's advantage on the technology front. So, there's a strong chance of Intel stock falling further. The stock is already down about 49% so far in 2022, which is why investors may want to hold off on the stock right now.
Nvidia stock is down about 59% in 2022. Given that gaming is one of its biggest businesses and produced 30% of the top line last quarter, the oversupply in GPUs on account of weak PC demand and higher inventories is likely to weigh on this segment as the company has been forced to reduce prices to sell its chips.
Additionally, the government-imposed restrictions on sales of Nvidia's data center chips to China have knocked the wind out of the sails of its data center segment. As Nvidia stock trades at a rich 38 times earnings even after its sharp decline in 2022, a turnaround in its fortunes appears to be difficult since it may not be able to clock the high levels of growth required to justify the valuation.
AMD, meanwhile, looks like the only stock that may be worth buying amid the PC market weakness. The stock is not only cheap at 24 times trailing earnings and 12 times forward earnings, but AMD is also managing to post impressive growth despite the headwinds. As such, investors may want to accumulate AMD stock if it falls further due to negative investor sentiment as it is becoming more of a value play thanks to its impressive growth and cheap valuation.

2022-10-18 00:00:00+00:00,Challenging a Bearish Call on Semiconductor Stocks,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/challenging-a-bearish-call-on-semiconductor-stocks,,,"Semiconductor sales could be impacted after the U.S. decided to double down on its anti-China semiconductor policy. Analyst Vivek Arya promptly capitalized on the news and provided coverage on the semiconductor sector. According to Arya, various blue-chip semiconductor companies could lose up to 10% in annual sales, with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) being the most likely losers.
I decided to juxtapose Arya's argument and place a hold rating on Intel, NVIDIA, and Lam Research, as I believe these enterprises are part of an intra-industry secular growth trajectory that would phase out most systemic headwinds.
Intel
Intel has lost almost half of its market value since the start of the year amid an array of systemic headwinds. However, despite its recent stumbles, Intel's embedded growth remains promising, and financial market participants could soon change their attitude toward the stock.
Intel's cash cow is its desktop CPU (central processing units) segment which holds down a market share of 69.5%. Moreover, the company's exposure to the GPU (graphics processing unit) domain is highly lucrative, considering the GPU domain's proliferating at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 33.6%.
Furthermore, Intel's autonomous driving unit (Mobileye) spin-off could be tremendously beneficial as the detachment allows the segment to brand itself more effectively. Intel's set to retain full ownership of the entity, which could streamline its balance sheet while retaining access to valuable future cash flows.
Lastly, Intel provides lucrative total return prospects as the security is undervalued with a price-to-earnings ratio of 6.5x, along with a compelling dividend yield of 5.63%.
Is INTC a Good Stock to Buy?
Turning to Wall Street, Intel earns a Hold consensus rating based on four Buys, 15 Holds, and nine Sells assigned in the past three months. The average INTC stock price target of $36.09 implies 36.6% upside potential.
Nvidia
Nvidia's year-to-date slump is possibly due to two reasons. First is the company's interlinkage with the crypto-mining space, which has clearly taken a hit in the past few months. Yet, I feel as though the narrative is overblown as Nvidia owns approximately 79% of the fast-growing GPU market, servicing an array of industries, including gaming.
The second reason why Nvidia's stock has struggled this year is because of its high beta coefficient. A stock's beta measures its sensitivity to the overall market, and Nvidia was always going to shed weight in 2022's bear market. However, the worst of the broad-based stock market drawdown is likely past us, and Nvidia's stock will likely see impressive returns once the market begins to pivot.
Lastly, Nvidia is on a secular trajectory with a 5-year revenue CAGR of 28.94%. The company's secular trend is a by-product of its product pricing power, communicated by its impressive EBITDA margin of 35.91%.
What is a Good Price for NVDA Stock?
Turning to Wall Street, Nvidia earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 23 Buys and nine Holds assigned in the past three months. The average NVDA stock price target of $200.67 implies 68.8% upside potential.
Lam Research
Lam Research is one of the few semiconductor companies that beat its latest financial quarter's earnings estimate, with the company's earnings-per-share beating analysts' estimates by $1.51. Lam Research runs on attractive profit margins, with its operating income leaning on a 31.5% margin of safety. Therefore, it's valid to conclude that the company displays a high degree of operating leverage, meaning its bottom-line earnings is recession resilient.
In recent news, Lam's established a new R&D lab in Bengaluru, India. The workspace is said to be its most advanced scientific facility in the region and is well-placed to leverage the growing intellectual capital pool that India provides.
Furthermore, Lam's market-based prospects are looking up. Citigroup recently listed Lam Research as a conviction play, citing quality as a factor. To elaborate on the latter, quality refers to companies with robust financial statements and wide market shares, which results in outperformance during late-stage bear markets.
Another appealing feature of Lam Research is that it's fundamentally undervalued. The stock's price-to-earnings ratio is at a 37.5% discount to historical averages, meaning that smart-money investors could soon enter the fray.
Is LRCX a Good Stock to Buy?
Turning to Wall Street, Lam Research earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys and seven Holds assigned in the past three months. The average LRCX stock price target of $533.06 implies 69% upside potential.
My Concluding Thoughts on INTC, NVDA, and LRCX Stocks
Vivek Arya's bearish call on semiconductor stocks should be taken with a pinch of salt as the sector is expanding at an exponential rate. Intel, Nvidia, and Lam Research are three ""best-in-class"" stocks that could experience an upswing sooner rather than later.

2022-10-18 00:00:00+00:00,Mobileye targets up to $16 bln valuation in U.S. IPO,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mobileye-targets-up-to-%2416-bln-valuation-in-u.s.-ipo-0,,,"Adds details from filing, background
Oct 18 (Reuters) - Mobileye, Intel's INTC.O self-driving car unit, targets a valuation of nearly $16 billion in its initial public offering in the United States, a regulatory filing on Tuesday showed.
Mobileye's initial public offering follows Porsche's P911_p.DE blockbuster debut in Europe and could be an early sign of improving investor sentiment.
The move sets the stage for what is expected to be one of the biggest technology listings of this year amid a market rout that has sapped the appetite for deals, as companies struggle with rising interest rates and increased investor scrutiny on profitability after a stellar 2021.
Mobileye confidentially filed for its IPO earlier this year and was targeting a $50 billion valuation before the rout in tech compelled many high-flying companies to stomach haircuts in valuation.
The company is offering 41 million shares of common stock priced between $18 and $20 per share, aiming to raise up to $820 million, based on the top end of the proposed range of the listing.
Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and BofA Securities are among underwriters of the offering.

2022-10-18 00:00:00+00:00,See Which Of The Latest 13F Filers Holds Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/see-which-of-the-latest-13f-filers-holds-intel-2,,,"At Holdings Channel, we have reviewed the latest batch of the 21 most recent 13F filings for the 09/30/2022 reporting period, and noticed that Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) was held by 12 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.
Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.
Having given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in INTC positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:
FUND NEW POSITION? CHANGE IN SHARE COUNT CHANGE IN MARKET VALUE ($ IN 1000'S)
Clearview Wealth Advisors LLC Existing +476 -$158
XR Securities LLC Existing -18,587 +$83
Mystic Asset Management Inc. Existing +2,490 -$232
Regent Investment Management LLC Existing -200 -$261

Valicenti Advisory Services Inc. Existing +36,592 +$193
HGK Asset Management Inc. Existing -331 -$1,147
Defender Capital LLC. Existing -25,150 -$2,081
Mathes Company Inc. Existing -300 -$102
Plimoth Trust Co. LLC Existing +6,752 -$832
WBH Advisory Inc. Existing -1,274 -$420
Core Alternative Capital Existing +96 -$16
Aggregate Change: +42 -$5,289
In terms of shares owned, we count 5 of the above funds having increased existing INTC positions from 06/30/2022 to 09/30/2022, with 7 having decreased their positions.
Looking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the INTC share count in the aggregate among all of the funds which held INTC at the 09/30/2022 reporting period (out of the 745 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of INTC shares those same funds held back at the 06/30/2022 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for INTC. We found that between these two periods, funds reduced their holdings by 2,464,808 shares in the aggregate, from 34,365,955 down to 31,901,147 for a share count decline of approximately -7.17%. The overall top three funds holding INTC on 09/30/2022 were:
» FUND SHARES OF INTC HELD

While looking at individual 13F filings can sometimes be misleading due to the long-only nature of the information, the sum total across groups of funds from one reporting period to another can be a lot more revealing and relevant, providing interesting stock ideas that merit further research, like Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC).

The stock lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 2.65%. At the same time, the Dow added 1.86%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.24%.
Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's largest chipmaker had lost 11.39% over the past month. This has was narrower than the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 12.03% and lagged the S&P 500's loss of 8.99% in that time.
Investors will be hoping for strength from Intel as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 27, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.34, down 80.12% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $15.49 billion, down 19.28% from the year-ago period.
INTC's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.21 per share and revenue of $65.76 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -59.6% and -15.72%, respectively.
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Intel. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.
The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 2.19% lower. Intel is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
In terms of valuation, Intel is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 11.75. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 8.56.
We can also see that INTC currently has a PEG ratio of 1.57. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Semiconductor - General was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.64 at yesterday's closing price.
The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 209, which puts it in the bottom 18% of all 250+ industries.

2022-10-17 00:00:00+00:00,Intel's Mobileye IPO eyes significantly lower valuation - report,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-mobileye-ipo-eyes-significantly-lower-valuation-report,,,"Adds background
Oct 17 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O is eyeing a valuation that is significantly lower than previously expected for the initial public offering of its self-driving car unit Mobileye, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Mobileye, which was originally expected to land a roughly $50 billion valuation, is now set to target one of under $20 billion and sell a smaller number of shares than originally planned, according to the report.
Intel did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The lower valuation underscores the downturn in the market for new listings, with the tech IPO market facing its worst drought in nearly two decades.
Mobileye, which late last month unveiled its filing for a U.S. IPO with plans to list shares on Nasdaq under the ticker ""MBLY"", counts BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Nissan, Honda and General Motors as its clients.
The self-driving car unit is also planning to launch its roadshow for prospective investors on Tuesday, a day later than anticipated, WSJ reported.

2022-10-16 00:00:00+00:00,Strike Back at the Bear Market With These 3 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/strike-back-at-the-bear-market-with-these-3-high-yielding-dividend-stocks,,,"The bear market has taken a bite out of most investors' portfolios. Share prices are down more than 20% on average as investors fret about the impacts that high inflation and rising interest rates will have on the economy.
However, this plunge also provides some opportunities, because dividend yields generally move in the opposite direction of share prices. As a result, now that share prices are down, investors can lock in much bigger income streams, providing them with higher tangible returns and steady income streams. Three high-quality companies currently offering much higher dividend yields than they did before this bear market are Alexandria Real Estate Equities (NYSE: ARE), Enbridge (NYSE: ENB), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
A healthy payout
Shares of Alexandria Real Estate Equities have tumbled about 40% from their recent peak. That sell-off has pushed the real estate investment trust's (REIT) dividend yield up to 3.5%. That's double the S&P 500's current 1.7% dividend yield, and the payout is on a sustainable foundation.
While Alexandria is an office REIT, it's not facing the same pandemic-related work-from-home headwinds as others in its niche because it primarily owns lab space that is leased to tenants in the life sciences sector. Demand for these properties has increased since the pandemic as healthcare companies are pouring more money into research and development. Rental rates on leases signed this year are averaging 25% above the prior lease rates on the same spaces.
Alexandria complements its rock-solid property portfolio with a top-notch balance sheet. Its credit rating is in the top 10% of all publicly traded U.S. REITs. It also has a conservative dividend payout ratio of 55% of its projected 2022 funds from operations (FFO) after factoring in a recent 5% increase to its already attractive dividend. That leaves Alexandria with enormous financial flexibility to expand its portfolio, which should allow it to continue growing its dividend.
The fuel to continue growing
Enbridge's stock price has fallen by more than 20% from its peak. That has pushed the energy infrastructure company's dividend yield up to 7.3%. And that payout, too, is on rock-solid ground.
Enbridge's low-risk pipeline-utility business model generates stable cash flow backed by long-term contracts and government-regulated rate structures. Meanwhile, Enbridge only pays out about 65% of its steady cash flow via the dividend. That gives it a solid cushion and allows it to retain funds for expansion. It also has a strong investment-grade balance sheet, which provides it with additional financial flexibility.
Enbridge has the financial capacity and secured project backlog to grow its cash flow per share at a rate of 5% to 7% annually through at least 2024. Meanwhile, it has a growing list of longer-term projects underway and in development. That should give Enbridge the fuel to keep boosting its dividend, which it has done for an impressive 27 straight years.
Down but not out
Intel stock has tumbled more than 50% over the past year. That has driven the technology company's dividend yield up to 5.5%.
On the one hand, Intel faces many headwinds. Slowing demand for its tech due to macroeconomic conditions has put pressure on sales and earnings. Meanwhile, the company is investing heavily to jump-start its growth and get ahead of its competition. That has led some to be concerned that Intel might not have the funds needed to maintain its dividend at its current level while it expands its manufacturing capacity.
However, the company has a cash-rich balance sheet and recently brought in a funding partner to help finance two of its new plants. Factor in the passage of the CHIPS act, which will provide tens of billions of dollars in incentives to promote chipmaking in the U.S., and Intel should be able to continue growing its dividend during this heavy investment phase.
A great opportunity to grab higher yields
The bear market has sent shares of some high-quality dividend stocks much lower. Because of that, investors can now lock in some pretty enticing yields from companies like Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Enbridge, and Intel. Buying those stocks will allow you to get paid well while you wait for the bear market to end -- and for years afterward. Meanwhile, those payments could help you strike back against the bear market because you could potentially use them to capitalize on other new investment opportunities.

This video was recorded on Oct. 10, 2022.
Chris Hill: Don't look now, but we have another Tech IPO. Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Chris Hill, joining me today, Motley Fool Senior Analyst, Jason Moser. Thanks for being here.
Jason Moser: Thanks for having me.
Chris Hill: Welcome to the calm before the storm. [laughs] I say that because there's really not a lot of news. Jamie Dimon made some comments that we'll get to shortly, but four times a year, it's very quiet right before earnings season. There are increasingly indications that this upcoming earnings season is going to be stormy for investors. For anyone who missed it on last Friday's show, our guest was Malcolm Ethridge, financial planner here in the DC area. I asked him what he was expecting heading into earnings season. His one-word answer was bad, [laughs] which he expounded on. But I tend to be optimistic by nature. But Jason, I think he's right in terms of the results. I think we should all prepare ourselves for the three-month results that most companies are going to be reporting. Particularly when you look at how strong the dollar is for companies that have international businesses, it's not going to be great.
Jason Moser: Yeah, I'd love to meet the person or the people who are like, I think this is going to be a pretty good earnings season, I'm feeling good about things, gives me some surprises to the upside. I think that's probably correct. I don't know very many folks that are out there expecting a whole heck of a lot from this particular earnings season. This is going to be talking about the third quarter of the year. If you look into FactSet Data, for example, as of today, the S&P 500 is expected to report revenue growth of 8.5 percent for the quarter, 8.5 percent from a year ago. So if that is the actual revenue growth rate for the quarter, that'll mark the first time the index has reported revenue growth below 10 percent since the fourth quarter of 2020 or else 3.2 percent. Then if you look at the actual earning side, earnings growth is estimated around 2.4 percent. If that's the case, it would mark the lowest earnings growth rate reported by the index since the third quarter of 2020 when it chalked up negative 5.7 percent.
Generally speaking, expectations aren't that high. It's very understandable why that's the case. I think if you look at what's going on around us, we have to acknowledge the level of pessimism is pretty darn high right now. A year ago, for example, you could buy anything in the stock market, just throw a dart, hit a company, buy it and it goes up. That's what it felt like. Clearly, the pendulum has shifted and it feels like anything you buy, you can bet money, it's going to go down. [laughs] That makes a lot of sense when you look at everything that's going on right now, but we've got recession talk, we've got inflation. I saw a report here, Adobe does not have very high expectations for holiday spending. Clearly, there are foreign exchange challenges. We have 40 percent of international revenue exposure to the S&P 500 overall.
So that does matter. While we tend to take a longer view on that currency issue, it is something that exists, and yet, you have to at least expect it to impact the numbers here over the coming quarters. Credit card balances saw their largest year-over-year percentage increase in more than 20 years here. Aggregate limits on cards, largest increasing over 10 years. The personal savings rate of 3.5 percent, is historically very low. When you hear someone saying, well, we think the consumer is still at a good position. I would push back on that, to me, it doesn't feel like the consumer is in a very good position right now. They're employed and wages are keeping up, but it feels like the consumer is increasingly in a tougher position. You put that all together, it's very easy to understand why expectations are so low because there is just so much pessimism out there today.
Chris Hill: Every earnings season, we talk about companies that the company executives issue guidance that is different from the actual results. It's the company had great quarterly results, but the stock is down because of their overly cautious guidance. Because we all have, or most of us have this expectation that the actual results companies are going to be reporting are not going to be that great. Does the guidance that we get from management this upcoming earnings season, does it matter more? Not to say like, we're looking to cling to anything positive but when for example, I look at the data around the cost of a shipping container and how that has dramatically come down over the past year. I do wonder if some of these large important companies are going to give us guidance. Not just about their business, but about what they are seeing on a more macro level when it comes to input costs like that.
Jason Moser: Yeah, I think that is what I'm personally paying more attention to hear this coming earnings season. Is really the guidance going forward, not just for Quarter 4, but really for going into 2023. If you look at the last several quarters, at least the last couple of quarters, labor costs and supply chain disruptions have been cited as the top two challenges to revenue and margins. Really coming in third place is currency impacts. So you've got this trifecta of challenges that the companies I've been dealing with here and it's going to be helpful to get an idea from these management teams when they see these challenges start to abate or are they seeing signs of that abating now? Because as we know, the market is forward-looking, it's a forward-looking mechanism, it's looking into the future and essentially telling us what the future holds more or less. I think that's something very important to remember because right now we're sitting here talking about all of this pessimism and these weak expectations, these low expectations.
It's not like you and I are in on some big secret, that's common knowledge, everybody knows this. The market is pricing a lot of that in today. But if we get a lot of these management teams on these calls here in the coming weeks and they start talking about how they're starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel, then I think that's going to make a big difference. When you look at right now the forward 12-month PE for the S&P 500, it's just under 16, it's 15.8 and that's below the five-year average of 18.5, and below the 10-year average of 17.1. Again, the market is pricing in some pretty weak expectations. If we start to see signs that things might start improving a little bit, then I think that bodes well for the market and we've talked about this before on this show.
Generally speaking, and historically we see the stock market performs worse in the time leading up to the recession with the year leading up to the recession is when we see the worst performance. We very well could be living through that right now because we've seen Jamie Dimon's comments. Europe already in a recession and we are not far behind and the expectation is 6-9 months. We're probably witnessing that official declaration here as well. Some would argue that we're already in a recession and I certainly understand that perspective. We did witness two consecutive quarters of contraction, so it's a unique time for sure. But again, going back to your point there, I think paying attention to guidance here in really those challenges, labor costs, and supply chain disruptions, I think it'll be two key things to search for these calls and get an idea of how leaderships feels about these.
Chris Hill: Yeah, speaking of management teams, Dimon gave an interview to CNBC this morning talking about what do you call it, a ""very, very serious mix of factors"" that he believes are going to push the US into recession in the next 6-9 months. I did appreciate the fact that when speaking about the Federal Reserve, you get the sense that because there are some people who are willing to go on financial television talk about the Federal Reserve and just bash away at J. Powell. I appreciate the fact that Dimon basically said like, ""Look, I'm rooting for this guy."" To paraphrase what he says, I'm hoping this works out. There's no real incentive for me or anyone to root against Powell and to have this all go worse than we wanted to.
Jason Moser: Yeah, it's very much in vogue these days to go on Twitter and just bash the Fed and Powell and just give them a piece of your mind and tell them how wrong they are. Anybody can do that. Obviously, they missed that transitory call, they're not going to get everything right. None of us will get everything right. I like that, about Dimon. He's certainly rooting for the best outcome. He's more often the guy he's trying to be a part of the solution as opposed to part of the problem. Clearly, one of the smartest guys out there. When he speaks, it's worth listening to. I like his equanimity, he takes that smart middle-of-the-road approach and he's like, listen, we hit a recession and it can be very mild to quite hard. There are a lot of things we just don't know, if the Fed continues to keep its foot on the gas in regard to interest rates, you've got this war going on over in Ukraine with no clear outcome and no real sign that it's going to be concluding anytime soon.
There are a lot of different ways things could be impacted. He is recognizing that and consequently, he's saying, Hey, look, from our perspective as JPMorgan, we're going to be very conservative with our balance sheet. I don't know if he was a boy scout. I think he may have been because I love his advice here. He said, hey, be prepared from the investor's perspective, from the consumer's perspective, you just have to look at this and say, well, I'm hoping for the best, but I'm expecting or preparing for the worst. As such, he said they will be very conservative with their balance sheet, make slow methodical smart decisions and just see. We'll see how this earnings season plays out and see what companies, see what these leadership teams are thinking. That'll help dictate how we approach the beginning of 2023 as investors.
Chris Hill: Jason Moser, great talking to you. Thanks for being here.
Jason Moser: Thank you.
Chris Hill: In 2017, Intel bought Mobileye, a self-driving car company for $15 billion. Just four years later, Intel announced it would be spinning it back out into the public markets and that time has come. How interested should investors be in shares of Mobileye? Ricky Mulvey and Dylan Lewis break down the offering.
Ricky Mulvey: We've got a second big-name IPO in 2022, Intel is spinning off Mobileye, which makes chips and cameras and driver assistance features. Joining us now to talk about it, is Dylan Lewis. Good to see you.
Dylan Lewis: Great to be here. Another IPO, Ricky. We went such a long time without them and now we get two in relatively short succession. That's pretty awesome.
Ricky Mulvey: Porsche and Mobileye. So my question though, because it is a little strange, is Mobileye brave or does Intel need some money?
Dylan Lewis: I'm going to say that people feel like Mobileye is a business that can weather current conditions and will not be dampened too much by what we've seen in terms of growth stocks and some of the growth expectations being hit. I do think it's a little bit of column A, column B, where Intel sees an opportunity here to spend something out that has a very different profile than its core chip business, and maybe it feels like there's an opportunity for the market to realize a little bit more value for Mobileye that we're currently seeing. But it's certainly an interesting development. I'm excited to talk about it.
Ricky Mulvey: The headline is that it's getting into autonomous driving, which would make you think this company makes no money. However, 800 vehicle models already have Mobileye's advanced driver assist systems. You probably know this if you've seen a lane departure warning, lane-keeping assist, emergency braking. That's where the company is making the majority of its money right now. They recognize that. They say we believe that the future of mobility is fully autonomous in these technologies built into each other. For example, with the advanced driver assist systems, when your car uses that, it sends tiny packets of data back to Mobileye so it can make these highly detailed maps. The company has said, ""Well, today ADAS, advanced driver assist systems, is central to the advancement of automotive safety. We believe that the future of mobility is autonomous.""
Dylan Lewis: Yeah, Ricky, earlier you said fully autonomous. I think that we have to recognize that autonomy and driving is both the future and to some extent, the present. It's easy to think about it as something that you sit back, you're in the car and you're doing nothing, but we already have the creep of driver assistance features coming in and helping realize a quasi-autonomous existence. It's not necessarily what people have in their mind, it's not as sci-fi friendly, but that's where Mobileye's really plugging in right now and that's where a lot of the money is coming in for this business. It's sensors and cameras.
Ricky Mulvey: Speaking of money, let's dig into some of the numbers. Mobileye already has some revenue. Mobileye made $1.4 billion in 2021. However, it recorded net losses of $75 million, slowing down net losses. When you look through the income statement and the balance sheet, do you have confidence that this company can become profitable?
Dylan Lewis: I think so. You look at the growth profile of 45 percent year-over-year growth in 2021, it's looking like we'll see 21 percent year-over-year growth in the first half of 2022. When you see a business that's losing money, what you want to really look at is, is there expanding margin potential? Where is the spend going that's preventing that company from being profitable right now? The tout and adjusted positive net income figure, we have to remember that's non-GAAP, so you can't hang your hat on that one. It's not net income. But generally, yeah, the losses have narrowed. When you start zooming in on where the spend is actually going, I think that's the key because this is a business that has roughly 50 percent gross margins.
When you look at where the remaining money goes, for the most part, it's in the company's R&D spend. The vast majority of the money is going there. A comparatively small amount is going into their selling, general administrative, and marketing spend. The reason I think that is important is because this is a tech business. It truly lives on the cutting edge of technology and where the world is going. The R&D work for this company is really its moat and if that's where they're spending, they're allocating capital correctly. It also signals to me that they don't need to spend a ton of money to acquire customers and grow their business. Their technology is able to do that for them.
Ricky Mulvey: It's got another important company under its arm called Moovit. It's a bit like Uber and Lyft. This is going to be the Robo-taxi arm of Mobileye, or at least that's the plan for it. Are you excited about this partnership or do you think Mobileye is trying to do too much at once?
Dylan Lewis: It's hard to tell. I mean, this isn't uncommon for companies in this space. You look at other companies that play autonomy and you see a lot of them leaning into various ideas of what mobility could look like in the future. I think Uber and Lyft are good examples of this. Uber, in particular, they are originally a ride-hailing company. They have autonomous driving ambitions or have had them in the past. They've expanded into food delivery, but they've also expanded into a lot of last-mile urban commuting. I think the reason a lot of these companies try to do this is to have fingers in the pot for a bunch of different places for where mobility could go and where we could see autonomy early. Because it's going to be a big part of whoever wins that market and really whoever takes a sizable share, to begin with. It's also, let's be real, a way for these companies to expand their total addressable market and look for other opportunities to make money while some of these more futuristic business lines take a little while to materialize.
Ricky Mulvey: There's also a huge amount of room for disruption because you think about how many cars are just sitting in the driveway. In the S1, they mentioned the Department of Transportation's figure that cars are only used for an hour a day on average. You can imagine how a company would want to make that more efficient. One other piece of the Mobileye dynamic is not just the companies that it owns, but the company that owns them, that is Intel. Mobileye was already a public company between 2014-2017 before it was bought out by Intel. Now it's being spun off. But Intel is still owning a majority stake in the company. One of the big questions is why is Intel spinning it off now and then also, why are they cutting its valuation? Originally, they were looking for about $50 billion, now they're settling on around $30 billion.
Dylan Lewis: Yeah, it's an interesting dynamic. I think you always want to understand why a company wants to spin something out, particularly in the case of Intel and Mobileye, where they bought it for $15 billion about 4 or 5 years ago. They are now bringing it to the public markets at 30 billion. I think we're seeing that revised number just because the appetite for growth has slowed pretty dramatically and they just want to be able to right-size the offering a little bit. That's why we're seeing it come down from about 50 billion, which was speculated when this was originally announced in late 2021. But you think about that. That company is doubled basically in value for them if they hit that issuance price. In a relatively short period of time, it has performed dramatically better than Intel stock, even when you consider the dividends that it's paid out to investors.
Why do they want to spend something out that is growing faster than its core business? Let's be real. I mean, $30 billion is not insignificant to a company like Intel that has a $100 billion market cap. It's increasingly becoming a large part of the pie for this company. It seems to me, and we saw some indications of this and how the company has talked about it, they want to spend this out so that the financials for Mobileye are not being weighed down by the financials for Intel. The growth story that is happening with autonomous driving and some of these driver assist features now can really play out and be realized by the market rather than being weighed down by the overall Intel business. Now, they have a reason for that. It's because the plan is for them to continue to be the majority shareholder of Mobileye. You could see this being something where they're may be able to realize a little bit more value on the equity that they hold in this business, even as they reduce some of that holding to make it a public company.
Ricky Mulvey: Mobileye owes Intel a little bit of money. It looks like there's a promissory note of $3.5 billion and Intel is looking to recoup some of that from the IPO.
Dylan Lewis: Yeah. Always want to zoom in on the intent of proceeds or use of proceeds section in an S1 and in this case, $3.5 billion seems like loan, basically, that Intel provided to Mobileye. We're going to see them repay most of that with this deal and then we'll see any additional money from the deal wind up going over to working capital and general corporate expenses. So basically, working capital just gives them more money to be able to finance the things that they wanna do. Not surprising, but it is a little complicated. One of the things that I had a little bit of a harder time working through the ins and outs of when I was looking at this prospectus.
Ricky Mulvey: Yes. Speaking of the perspectives and the risks that they list there, is there a particular risk that caught your attention?
Dylan Lewis: I think the biggest thing is just how the market materializes for autonomous driving. We've talked about it before. There are a lot of companies that are approaching this in a lot of different ways. I think the thing that hovers over this entire market is, what does the regulatory environment look like as we start to move closer and closer to people not actually commanding the car? I think that's just a catchall risks that we have to pay attention to for all these companies. That's the main one that I zoom in on. I just want to pay attention to some of the dynamics between Intel and Mobileye and make sure we understand them. It seems like they're going to continue to be strategic partners. Obviously great to have a strategic partner, like Intel, one of the biggest chipmakers in the world. Certainly helpful for them. But just making sure we understand the corporate dynamic there too.
Ricky Mulvey: Intel gets a perpetual license to the patents and patent applications. How the intellectual property is split up while Mobileye was an Intel company and how that intellectual property is split between the companies going forward is something that I don't know how they're going to figure it out, but I'll be interested to see how it happens. I also have a question of stickiness. Mobileye's technology has been incorporated into cars that have gone on and built their own software. They mentioned, ""Tesla had previously incorporated our ADAS Solutions in their vehicles, but then transitioned to their own in-house solutions. It'll be interesting to see how many car bankers stick with Mobileye technology in the years to come. Dylan, when you look at this, when you look through the S1, how does this fall for you between investable, runaway, or a company worth studying?
Dylan Lewis: Yeah, I'm not immediately buying shares at this business. I had a couple of reasons for that. One is we've already seen growth deceleration and pretty dramatic growth deceleration, and I'd like to get a firmer sense of where that number is going to sit long term. We're heading into an environment that could be a little tricky for this business for a variety of reasons. To some extent, this company is going to make money based on how many cars people are shipping and selling. A tougher economic environment means that we're probably just not going to see as many cars being shipped out.
Also, the financing environment for cars is going to become a little bit tougher and a little bit less consumer-friendly. I think that's something to pay attention to. Also, there's just the catchall here of, like I said before, understanding what the autonomous future looks like. This is something where I think there will probably be many winners. I think it's interesting to invest in a company like Mobileye, where they're a little bit less tied to a specific brand and much more focused on the technology side of it. Reminds me a little of the Roku-type approach to streaming, but just for autonomous driving. Certainly an interesting company. I want to get a little bit more clarity though on where this business is going over the next couple of years and where growth rates settle for that first.
Ricky Mulvey: I found myself becoming more interested in Intel then Mobileye as I studied Mobileye's S1. Perhaps not a great sign. Dylan Lewis, thank you for your time.

John Rotonti: Ten to 15 years ago, the industry was largely driven by PC cycles and iPhone cycles, to be honest with you. But now, like we said, they go into everything. I mean, is demand for the cloud going to go away? I don't think so.
Chris Hill: I'm Chris Hill and that's Motley Fool senior analyst John Rotonti. He joined fellow analyst Jason Moser for an introduction to semiconductors. Computers, cars, and whatever you're using right now to listen to this podcast need them to function. They're an important building block for our economy. Today, John and Jason discuss companies in the semiconductor value chain, the industry's risks, and one important chipmaker that's cheaper than the S&P 500.
Jason Moser: Let's go and start from the very beginning. What are semiconductors and why are they so important to the economy now?
John Rotonti: Thanks, Jason, one of my favorite things to talk about. Semiconductors are the brains of all electronic devices. They partially or semi-conduct currents. They are largely made of silicon, which is made from sand. Like beach sand. They're varying sizes, but most of them are, you can think about the size of your thumbnail or a postage stamp. These very small devices are packed with, in some cases, tens of billions of transistors.
Jason Moser: It's a lot.
John Rotonti: Yeah. Exactly right. Especially when you're packing them onto something the size of a postage stamp. These transistors amplify currents and actually turn electrical signals on and off. You've got these electronic brains that power devices. They are in everything from the remote control on your TV to the fastest supercomputers in the world, to healthcare devices, to our military's weapons systems. They are a matter of life and death, literally when it comes to healthcare, when it comes to national security.
They are the devices that power our modern digital economy and digital world. We would not have cloud computing without semiconductors, we would not have artificial intelligence or machine learning. We would not have video gaming. We will not have the metaverse if that comes to play. All of these things, EVs, 5G, all of these modern technologies, all of these innovations are powered by semiconductors. To sum up, I would say they are the critical infrastructure and modern building block of the digital economy.
Jason Moser: Yeah, it really does feel like we're only headed more and more in that direction. Their role, it really should only grow in importance. I think when we look at this industry, I find the actual value chain in semiconductors to be very interesting. I think there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes that maybe some folks don't realize in the market that comes to mind, it reminds me a little bit of the payments industry. If you look at it on the surface, you think it's just simple. Oh, well, companies make these semiconductors and boom, and it goes into your device and consumers use them.
But then when you look at the value chain behind the scenes and all of the different participants in this market. It's worth noting because there are a lot of different ways to capitalize on this as investors, so let's talk about the main touch points of this value chain. The semiconductor. Most people are probably familiar with names like Qualcomm or Intel. Those are semiconductor companies, but there are companies even before that, that are involved in making the actual physical material. I mean, you've got everything from foundries and the equipment companies and then designers. Walk us through that value chain if you could.
John Rotonti: Yeah, Jason, the value chain is fascinating because it is so complex and technologically advanced and capital-intensive that if you look at the value chain, which we'll go through in a second. At every step of the semiconductor manufacturing value chain, these global oligopolies or duopolies or in some cases, even earned monopolies have formed. Basically, the first stage of making a semiconductor, designing a semiconductor is designing it using software. You take a company like Nvidia or Apple that wants to design their next semiconductor, they're going to use software, very likely from one or two companies because these are the two companies that do it at scale globally. It's Synopsys, and Cadence Design Systems. If you think about a blue, an architectural blueprint for your house or building. This is the architectural blueprint for a semiconductor. Just much more complicated because like we said, there are tens of billions of transistors they need to map and blueprint onto the chip.
These two companies, they are electronic design automation software companies, really they're computational design software companies. This is highly, highly complicated. This software is using a combination of matrix algebra, multivariate calculus, AI, advanced geometry, and more. This is not a software that you take an online course in Python or something you learn how to use it. This is software run by specialists, masters and Ph.D.s in this software. That's the first stage is to, is to blueprint it out using this software. Then what happens after that is that software is is printed onto a mask, and then that mask, which is just like a stencil basically, or a model. That mask is then used to print the blueprint onto a silicon wafer, which is usually 12 inches in diameter. It's a circular, thin piece of silicon that's 12 inches in diameter.
To do that, you use extreme ultraviolet light and a series of lasers and mirrors to print that blueprint onto the silicon wafer. There's only one company in the world that does that extreme ultraviolet lithography. We'll get into that in a second, but it's ASML, a Dutch company. Then from there basically there's three main steps. You deposit a bunch of chemicals onto these chips and those depositions, there's basically three primary companies that do the deposition or deposit, and that's Lam Research, Applied Materials, and Tokyo Electron. Then you etch away or carve out little holes where the transistors go. That's called etch. There's basically three companies that do that and it's the same three. It's Lam Research, Applied Materials, and Tokyo Electron. So you have two main software companies.
You've got three main semi-capital equipment companies that do the etching and the deposition. You've got one company doing the light sourcing, that's ASML. Then you have a couple of companies that, that test it after the semiconductor is made. The two big ones there are Teradyne and Advantest, which is a private company. All of this takes place in a foundry. The big foundries are the largest foundry is Taiwan Semiconductor. Samsung is another leading player. There is a major player for lagging-edge semiconductors, foundry manufacturing, and that's GlobalFoundries. Then Intel's a fourth player trying to get into third-party manufacturing. That's the semiconductor manufacturing value chain in a synopsis.
Jason Moser: Well, very well done by the way and I appreciate it because I think you showed that this industry that just seems to be so simple on the surface as consumers we buy these devices, but the behind the scenes is just so much more involved. It's always great to know that from the investing perspective, knowing that value chain I think is key for whatever industry you're focused on. Semiconductors certainly you can see is a very involved value chain as well and it seems like there's a theme there in that. This is just very highly technically skilled work.
John Rotonti: Yeah.
Jason Moser: The barriers to entry just on understanding how to do this and getting the talent to be able to do this, and getting the equipment and the software to be able to do this. It just seems like those barriers to entry are very, very high.
John Rotonti: I would agree.
Jason Moser: Yeah. So you focus your coverage specifically on foundries and semi-cap equipment companies and so I wanted to dig into those a little bit more because that's where you pay most of your attention. Who are the major competitors? We talk about them a little bit but let's dig into the major competitors in that part of the value chain and the foundries and the semi-cap equipment companies and we'll talk a little bit about their advantages and their merits as investment ideas.
John Rotonti: Starting with foundries, we mentioned Taiwan Semi and Samsung. Those are the two leading advanced, leading-edge, semiconductor third-party manufacturing foundries. There's also GlobalFoundries, Intel, maybe a few smaller players, but you can't talk about foundries without talking about Taiwan Semi. The reason is because I think it's one of the if not the most indispensable company in the world. It has 50% market share of all of the outsourced chips manufactured in the world. That's roughly three times higher than the next-largest player, which is Samsung. They have so 50% market share of all chips manufacturered, but they have 85%-90% market share of the world's most advanced chips. Because of that, it generates 90% of global contract foundry profits. It really is this earned monopoly or duopoly with Samsung right now.
It got this position by investing heavily ahead of everyone else, heavily ahead of demand, and being an early adopter of extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography machines by ASML. Taiwan Semi owns more ASML machines than anybody else in the planet and Taiwan Semi has more experience using these extremely complex machines than anyone else in the planet. Because Taiwan Semi has 90% market share of the world's most advanced chips, it has a much, much larger library of recipes or process knowledge or process technology for manufacturing these chips. Each chip has its own recipe and each node builds off the recipe of the prior node.
With semiconductor manufacturing, Jason, scale and market share beget more scale, and more market share, and faster and better process learnings. Process knowledge is extremely capital-intensive. I think Taiwan Semi is going to spend somewhere on the order of $40 billion in capex this year or next year, 40 billion in one year. It's going to be very hard for competitors to catch up. Finally, Taiwan Semi has built up an ecosystem and works extremely closely with all of the major players in the semiconductor manufacturing supply chain that we already talked about. If you go to Taiwan and you go to their facilities, well guess what, Lam Research is located right there, Applied Materials is located right there, ASML has teams right there so they built up these ecosystems around the business.
Jason Moser: I think it's very clear the pros. I think it's very clear the competitive advantages that these businesses possess and I think that either the follow-up to that that I'd really have for you is just what do you consider the threats for businesses like these and so you talk about, are there really any threats for Taiwan Semi?
John Rotonti: I think so and that ties into the valuation right now, Jason. Taiwan Semi is at I looked yesterday, I haven't looked this morning, I know stocks are down. I think it's around 72 down from 145 stock price, so it's down 50% from its 52-week high, has 2.5% dividend yield, Jason, this company that I just explained to you, that is integral to the world is trading at a forward P/E of 12.
Jason Moser: Why?
John Rotonti: I think and just let me just put that into perspective. The S&P 500, the market is trading at about 15 or 16, so it's had a three or four turn discount to the market. I think the reason you asked the risk, I think the market is concerned that it's located in Taiwan and that China claims to control Taiwan and there's been talk and rhetoric recently that China maybe possibly could invade Taiwan. That's the risk and that's why I think there's this overhang on the stock, Jason.
Jason Moser: Yeah, the geopolitical risks. It's something always to keep in mind, obviously out of our control. Nothing we can really control, but it's always something to acknowledge. You see, obviously what's going on with Russia and Ukraine. Those are things that happen. You can't very well predict them but then it also, it goes to show even market leaders like that. There's always going to be a risk that you need to identify and that certainly seems to be very reasonable with Taiwan Semi.
John Rotonti: Even if you take China and geopolitical risk out of the equation, there are other risks. Intel is spending billions of dollars to try to catch up, billions. Competitive risk is there, technological obsolescence to an extent is there, and then semiconductors, the industry has historically been cyclical. I think it's less cyclical now than it's been in the past and we can maybe talk about that now or another time, but there is some cyclicality as well. There's a risk that you could be buying a stock at the top of a cycle, I don't think that's a risk right now. But over a long period of time there is a risk you could be buying at the top and then you have to maybe wait a couple of years for the stock price to catch up, but I think those are the big risks.
Jason Moser: I'm glad you brought up that cyclicality risk because I think that's something that definitely is worth touching on. I run a couple of services here at the Fool that focus on immersive technology, 5G, stuff like that. I've got my share of chip companies and they're your Qualcomms and your AMDs, and your Nvidias of the world. It does feel to me like the cyclicality risk isn't what it used to be. I guess that really goes back to what you were talking about at the top of the show, in that this is the lifeblood of virtually everything we do now, this technology. It's an everything that we do.
John Rotonti: Exactly right.
Jason Moser: It feels like the cyclicality now is more or less just based on where we are in the innovation cycle. But regardless, because this technology is so widespread all around the world, that cyclicality window just seems to be shrinking a bit.
John Rotonti: I think so Jason, 10-15 years ago the industry was largely driven by PC cycles and iPhone cycles, to be honest with you, but now like we said, they go into everything. Is demand for the cloud going to go away? I don't think so. Is demand for EVs and 5G going to go away? Is demand for AI and machine learning going to go away? The use cases, the end markets, the total addressable markets for semiconductors is just so much larger than it was. The other thing is that we've had a couple of major periods of consolidation across the industry. At some point in time there used to be 20-30 competitors, now you've got 3, 4, or 5 competitors. Because of that, I think the remaining competitors are much more rational in their pricing. That avoids the boom-bust pricing cycles of the past. Then if you look at the fundamentals, the last down cycle we had, I think was 2018, like real down cycle. We're in one now a little bit but if you look at the trough margins now and in 2018. The lowest the margins get at a down cycle, those are now higher than peak margins in previous cycles, Jason.
Jason Moser: Wow.
John Rotonti: The fundamentals of the industry have dramatically improved in my view.
Jason Moser: That's astounding. Another thing it's been in the headlines a lot lately, we've been talking a lot about it on the investing team, trying to get just a better idea of where we think, ultimately, how this plays out the CHIPS Act. This supply chain crunch that we've been going through, it's something that we see in virtually everyearnings callbecause this technology is in everything, so it seems like every company on the face of the Earth has exposure to this.
John Rotonti: Sure.
Jason Moser: The CHIPS Act, I wonder, do you have an opinion there? We're talking about $50-plus billion ultimately, that's going to be devoted to spark domestic semiconductor manufacturing. It feels like on the surface, that's a smart idea, diversify that supply chain a little bit, yet I can't help but wonder if maybe this isn't money that's just disappear here and there and not really have as material an impact. I wonder if you have any strong feelings one way or the other on the CHIPS Act.
John Rotonti: I don't have strong feelings on how effective it will be yet, just because it's so new but I'd like to think, Jason, that it's a good start. If we want to build a homegrown semiconductor domestic supply chain, 50 billion is not enough and we talked about Taiwan Semi is going to invest 40 billion on its own this year.
Jason Moser: Just one year.
John Rotonti: Just one company in one year, Jason. The U.S. used to manufacture a lot more of the world's chips, so it used to be 30% or 40% of the world's semiconductors were manufactured in the U.S., now it's 12% and so that's a national security risk. It really came into play during the pandemic when we had all the supply chain bottlenecks, we could really feel it tangibly, you couldn't buy it. Auto manufacturers, for example, couldn't make new cars because they couldn't get the semiconductors because nowadays cars are just chips on wheels. What happened was everyone started buying used cars and that drove up used car pricing. I think it's a good first start, I think it's going to take a decade or more if we're going to be successful and it's going to take hundreds of billions of dollars but we have to start somewhere and so I'm hopeful, Jason.
Jason Moser: Yeah. I think that's a good way, I'm hopeful. It absolutely feels like it's just a start because like you said, it requires so much investment.
John Rotonti: Yeah. One more quick thing, Jason. When it comes to manufacturing, the U.S. is at a deficit, most of the chips are manufactured in the East, that's just a fact. Two-thirds to 70% of the world's chips flow through the island of Taiwan. They're made in the East but we should also point out that the IP, Jason, exists in the West, so those two software companies, Cadence and Synopsys, those are U.S. companies.
Jason Moser: Oh, yeah.
John Rotonti: Those three large semi-cap equipment companies, Lam Research, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron is in the East but throw in Teradyne and let's throw in KLAC, four huge semi-cap equipment companies all located in the West. Then ASML, maybe the most important of the semi-cap equipment companies, that's a European Dutch company, so a lot of the IP, the majority of the IP is in the West. There is this dichotomy of the IP versus the manufacturing, we're just trying to bring back some of that manufacturing.
Jason Moser: Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Given that, let's wrap up the show today. You and I were reading an article the other day, from CNBC, it was just an interesting view. It struck me as the past versus the future. This was an article that dug into Intel and Nvidia. Intel is saying that Moore's law is still alive and well, Nvidia says, no longer. Really quickly, what's Moore's law and what did you think about this article?
John Rotonti: Jason, Moore's law states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles roughly every two years. If we assume the price of the chip stays the same, then the cost of that chip falls in half every two years. Basically, Moore's law says, that chip performance doubles over two years. If we look back in the 1970s, Intel was a chip leader. The chips it was putting out in the 1970s had between 2,000 and 6,000 transistors on them. Today, the Apple M1 Chip, which was pretty revolutionary, Jason, has 16 billion transistors. A chip, the Graviton2 that goes into Amazon Web Services that runs their cloud in their data centers, it has 30 billion transistors on it. The question is Jason, how many of these transistors can we continue to pack onto something the size of your thumbnail?
Jason Moser: But that's right, we run into a physics problem at some point? It's what should be a physics problem.
John Rotonti: Yeah. The edge of physics. What we do is, we do two things. One is we make 3D chips and we start building transistors on top of each other, it's like a skyscraper. Then the other thing is we use extreme ultraviolet light and these machines by ASML. The reason you have to use this extreme ultraviolet light, it's because you need extremely small wavelengths of light in order to trace the pattern of the transistors. You have to bring the transistors closer and closer together and the only way to do that is to use extremely small wavelengths of light. I think in that article, Intel was talking about getting to 100 billion transistors on a chip and we're like 50 billion today.
Once again, that's doubling from 50-100. Can we get there? I hope so because I want to see what the world looks like with 100 billion transistors on a chip. Nvidia is saying, we're up against the limits of Moore's Law and so to get around that, you're going to have to make highly specialized chips used for highly specialized devices and purposes and that's what Nvidia. Nvidia doesn't make commodity chips, Jason, Nvidia makes chips that only it can make and so who's going to be right? I really don't know but I tell you what, Nvidia is an amazing company and Intel was a company that was once amazing and it's trying to turn itself around. I think if anyone could do it, it's Pat Gelsinger, their new CEO, so it will be fun and interesting to watch.
Jason Moser: It will indeed, this is an amazing space, tremendous opportunities for investors and really appreciate you taking the time to go through it and explain it all. John, it's great talking with you today. You want to make sure before we wrap up, you're a good tweeter.
John Rotonti: Thank you, sir.

2022-10-14 00:00:00+00:00,2 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Haven't Been This Cheap in Years,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-high-yielding-dividend-stocks-that-havent-been-this-cheap-in-years,,,"One good thing about this bear market is that it's giving you opportunities to buy stocks at lower prices than they've been trading at in years. And if you're picking dividend-paying stocks, that generally will mean their yields will be much higher than normal, too.
For example, Sanofi (NASDAQ: SNY) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are not only trading near multi-year lows, they're yielding more than 4%. Let's consider what's behind their recent share price declines and weigh the question of whether or not you should buy these stocks today.
1. Sanofi
French pharmaceutical company Sanofi makes a variety of medicines focused on therapeutic areas such as oncology, neurology, and immunology, as well as several rare diseases and rare blood disorders. In addition, it sells consumer health products and makes vaccines. The company's diversification is a source of strength, and could potentially make this an appealing long-term investment.
However, a raft of lawsuits relating to Zantac, the heartburn medication which Sanofi used to sell, have driven the stock down of late. In early 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ordered Zantac to be pulled from the market after it was discovered that potentially carcinogenic risks may exist. As a result, Sanofi faces close to 3,000 lawsuits as well as various class-action suits.
On Aug. 11, Sanofi released a media update regarding the Zantac litigation that management may have hoped would help. However, the press release didn't have that effect. Sanofi's stock price has continued to fall, and it's now back near the level it briefly dropped to during the March 2020 market crash.
All of this litigation does leave Sanofi at risk of significant financial consequences -- and investors need to take those into account -- but how much risk exists can be difficult to predict. Further, such legal battles can drag out for years.
On the positive side, Sanofi's business remains robust. Through the first half of 2022, sales increased by 8% year over year (excluding the impact of foreign currency changes) to 19.8 billion euros.
Top-selling dermatitis treatment Dupixent is a key asset for the company, generating 3.6 billion euros over the past two quarters and growing sales by 44% on a constant-currency basis. The company developed the treatment with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and in June, the FDA approved Dupixent for a new indication -- treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years old. It's also approved for asthma in children, among other indications.
And the companies are still working to expand Dupixent's acceptable uses even further. In total, Sanofi projects the drug's annual sales will peak at a whopping 13 billion euros. Still, Dupixent only accounts for 18% of Sanofi's revenue thus far in 2022. The pharmaceutical company's wide catalog of treatments makes it a fairly safe stock to own for the long haul.
The stock's valuation and dividend are also attractive. The average healthcare stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 20 right now, but Sanofi trades at a multiple of just 15. An added incentive to buy the stock is that its dividend yields 4.5% -- more than twice the S&P 500's average yield of 1.8%.
Again, the litigation risks remain -- and they are hard to measure -- but for contrarian investors willing to take on that risk, Sanofi could make for a good pick up right now.
2. Intel
Chipmaker Intel is a top name in tech and has been for years. Its microprocessors are found in vast numbers of computers and devices. Half of its revenue still comes from its client computing segment and the processors that it builds for personal computers. But that part of the business is struggling. Through the first two quarters of its fiscal 2022, that segment's sales totaled just under $17 billion, down from almost $21 billion in the same period last year.
Amid the global chip shortage, Intel and other chipmakers are playing catch up in an effort to boost production and meet demand. Intel has been investing in increasing capacity. Earlier this year, it announced plans to spend $36 billion on new facilities to make chips in Europe. Despite the growth opportunity here, investors are skeptical about the costs for the business, as this isn't a cheap venture. And in recent quarters, Intel's free cash flow has slipped.
INTC Free Cash Flow (Quarterly) data by YCharts
The danger for investors here is that if Intel gets too aggressive with spending, it may impact profitability. And the company may need to cut or eliminate its dividend to free up cash. That means its payout, which currently yields a lucrative 5.7%, may be at risk. Based on its payout ratio of just 30%, the dividend looks safe, but if the company needs to free up cash, management could still decide to adjust the payout.
Plenty of investors are bearish about the company's future, which is why the stock is now down to levels it hasn't been at since 2014. Between rising competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices and the hefty capital expenditures it has planned to grow its chipmaking capacities, Intel faces an uncertain future.
For the time being, the dividend still looks safe, but investors need to tread carefully -- Intel could prove to be a high-risk stock. Unless you're comfortable with taking those risks in pursuit of potential high rewards, you may be better off looking at other dividend stocks.

2022-10-14 00:00:00+00:00,Mobileye IPO: Should You Buy?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mobileye-ipo%3A-should-you-buy,,,"Investors have been waiting almost a year for Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) to file the paperwork to spin off its autonomous vehicle technology business Mobileye, and last month the chipmaker finally filed its prospectus for the initial public offering (IPO).
Mobileye makes chips that power cameras and other driver assistance systems for self-driving vehicles, a market that is expected to more than triple in size by 2030. It also offers a software platform that Intel says can enable the ""entire stack"" of assisted and autonomous driving technologies.
Image source: Getty Images.
Yet Intel is proposing to bring the company public in the face of a looming recession and a protracted global chip shortage that shows no sign of letting up. While Mobileye has been a successful business for Intel since it was acquired in 2017, the space it operates in is becoming increasingly crowded and competitive, and a tough market for IPOs complicates the plan.
Assuming Intel does actually complete the Mobileye spinoff, let's take a look at whether an investor should buy into this fast-growing semiconductor stock.
Eye on the prize
Intel bought Mobileye five years ago for $15.3 billion, and the business has outpaced its parent over that time. Where Mobileye generated a record $460 million in revenue in the second quarter, up 41% from a year ago, Intel reported an overall 22% decline in quarterly sales.
Year-to-date Mobileye revenue is up 21% versus a 14% decline for Intel, and over the past five years it has grown revenue from $200 million to $1.4 billion, a near-63% compounded annual growth rate.
The vast majority of Mobileye's sales come from chips sold to eight vehicle makers. Its prospectus said 76% of revenue over the first two quarters came from those customers, with its three largest customers being global auto parts makers ZF, Valeo, and Aptiv, which accounted for $43, 15%, and 15%, respectively, of the total.
As Mobileye's business has grown, it has been able to narrow its losses, shrinking them from $328 million in 2019 to $75 million last year, though through the first six months of 2022 the AV tech company recorded $67 million in losses.
The increased pace of losses this year, though, comes from increased research and development expenses, the largest expense on its books, which jumped 39% year-over-year and grew to 42% of revenue from 37% the year before as it increased the number of R&D employees.
A crowded market
That's all incredibly hopeful and sounds like Mobileye is on a growth trajectory that has a long runway, but there are risks.
Autonomous vehicles are truly an emerging market that is still trying to find its path forward, and so far the road has been bumpy. An early pioneer in this space has been Tesla, and while it has advanced the capabilities of the technology (it used to be a major customer of Mobileye), there have been some horrific failures as well.
It was reported earlier this year that between July 2021 and May 2022, nearly 400 car crashes were reported (two-thirds were Teslas) that led to five deaths and six injuries. AV cars have come a long way, but there is still much further to go.
And Mobileye isn't the only one pursuing solutions to perfect the technology. It notes Tesla, Apple, and Sony are rivals in the consumer AV space, while a laundry list of competitors in markets around the world are vying for supremacy in the automotive mobility-as-a-service (AMaaS) segment, including Baidu, Cruise, Didi Chuxing ,Waymo, and Zoox.
In the chip arena, it also faces competition from Advanced Micro Devices, Ambarella, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. Many of these are much larger and better financed than Mobileye and could edge it out as a supplier from automakers investing in the industry.

Additional risks
As noted previously, it's a difficult market Intel is trying to spin off Mobileye in, and there is the added risk of growing tensions between the U.S. and China. The Biden administration is imposing new export controls on chips to China -- and not just from the U.S., but anywhere in the world where they use U.S. equipment.
Mobileye relies on STMicroelectronics for all of its EyeQ systems-on-a-chip, and STM is heavily dependent upon Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing as a subcontractor. While Taiwan says it will abide by the U.S. law, there are constant rumblings of potential war between China and Taiwan.
Reflecting the market uncertainty, estimates of Mobileye's valuation at IPO have degraded. When the prospect of the spinoff was first broached last year, it was estimated Intel could achieve a $50 billion valuation for Mobileye. That has since been cut to $30 billion.
There has been a dearth of IPOs this year, especially in the tech sector, and with the market as dicey as it is right now, Mobileye may not hold up when it is spun off. While Intel will continue to be a majority owner of its offspring, investors may want to give the IPO some breathing room before jumping in.
Mobileye looks like it will be a good stock to own, but not yet. Market turmoil, ongoing supply chain issues, and geopolitical upheavals mean there's a good chance better pricing will be available further down the road.

2022-10-14 00:00:00+00:00,3 Once-in-a-Decade Buying Opportunities in the Dow Jones Bear Market,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-once-in-a-decade-buying-opportunities-in-the-dow-jones-bear-market,,,"Investing in 2022 has proved quite the challenge. The technology-driven Nasdaq Composite, which was largely responsible for pushing Wall Street to new highs in 2021, has really taken it on the chin. Since hitting its all-time high nearly 11 months ago, the index has fallen by as much as 35%.
Likewise, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) hasn't fared much better. Even though it's an index comprised of 30 highly profitable, mature businesses, it hasn't been spared from falling into a bear market.
Image source: Getty Images.
But the interesting thing about fear on Wall Street is that it almost always begets opportunity. Though a Dow Jones bear market can be scary due to the unpredictability and sudden velocity of downside moves, the quality of companies that comprise the Dow can lead to incredible opportunities for patient investors.
What follows are three once-in-a-decade buying opportunities within the Dow Jones Industrial Average as it plunges into a bear market.
Walt Disney
The first buying opportunity long-term investors may not see again is the chance to scoop up theme-park operator and content machine Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) for less than $100 per share. Disney's stock has declined by 54% since hitting its all-time high, which marks the steepest decline from a previous high since 2009.
Walt Disney has undoubtedly navigated its way through some unforeseen struggles. The COVID-19 pandemic shut down many of its theme parks and substantially reduced its entertainment segment revenue, which covers films. But Walt Disney has seen its way through economic downturns and recessions before, and it's never failed to eventually come out stronger on the other end.
Few companies on the planet have the ability to connect with multiple generations of consumers better than Disney. Its theme parks bring friends and families together, while its extensive library of movies and shows can help children and their parent(s) or grandparent(s) find common ground in fantasy. This ability to engage with people across all generations is something no other content provider can match.
To build on this point, no other entertainment or content provider possesses the pricing power that Disney brings to the table. Theme park ticket-price increases for the company have vastly outpaced the prevailing inflation rate for decades -- and people have demonstrated they'll willingly pay these higher prices to enjoy the unique experience Disney can offer. It's one of the few large companies that can honestly say it's well-insulated from inflation.
Walt Disney's inroads in streaming are impressive as well. Since launching its Disney+ streaming service less than three years ago, the company has signed up 152.1 million global subscribers. For context, it took Netflix more than a decade to reach the same number of subscriptions. Including ESPN+ and Hulu, Disney actually has more total streaming subs than Netflix. Over time, as expenses to build out its streaming service taper, Disney+ has a chance to become a serious contributor to the company's cash flow.
Disney is a growth stock that's trading at a value stock price-to-earnings multiple. That makes it a no-brainer buy at its current price.
Visa
A second once-in-a-decade buying opportunity during the Dow Jones bear market is payment processor Visa (NYSE: V). Except for the COVID-19 crash, which occurred over a five-week stretch in February-March 2020 (i.e., in the blink of an eye for patient investors), Visa's shares haven't been this far below their all-time high on a percentage basis since 2011.
Visa is a cyclical company, which is a fancy way of saying that it's going to ebb and flow with the health of the U.S. and global economies. If the tea leaves are correct and the U.S. does edge into a recession at some point, it's quite plausible a reduction in consumer and enterprise spending will hurt Visa's bottom line.
However, being cyclical is a two-sided coin that actually favors long-term investors. Although recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle, they usually only last for a couple of quarters. By comparison, periods of expansion are almost always measured in years. Buying shares of Visa allows investors to take advantage of the natural expansion of the U.S. and global economies and spending over time.
Visa has clearly defined opportunities domestically and abroad, too. It possessed a whopping 54% of U.S. credit card network purchasing volume in 2020 -- that's 31 percentage points higher than its next-closest competitor -- and was the only major payment processor of the big four in the U.S. to expand its share following the Great Recession (2007-2009). The U.S. is the world's leading market for consumption.
Meanwhile, most international transactions are still being conducted with cash. This gives Visa a multidecade runway to expand its payment infrastructure into underbanked markets organically or through acquisitions.
Lastly, investors should understand that Visa strictly avoids lending and sticks to payment processing. While the company would likely have no issue generating interest income and fees as a lender, doing so would expose it to credit delinquencies and loan losses during economic downturns. Since Visa doesn't lend, it's not required to set aside capital to cover inevitable losses during recessions. This is a key reason its juicy profit margin remains above 50%.

Intel
The third once-in-a-decade buying opportunity in a Dow Jones bear market is semiconductor stalwart Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). It's been nearly a decade since shares of Intel were this far below their all-time high.
Intel, like Visa, is a cyclical company. When economic contractions or recessions arise, demand for chips and semiconductor solutions taper. Additionally, it's not uncommon for the pricing power of chipmakers to weaken during these downturns. With competitor Advanced Micro Devices recently slashing its sales forecast, it's plainly evident that chipmakers like Intel are contending with some tangible headwinds.
But as noted, time is the friend of cyclical stock investors. For example, Intel has opportunities that extend well beyond just personal computers (PCs) -- i.e., where it's made its home for decades. As businesses shift their data into the cloud at an accelerated pace, demand for data centers is bound only to rise. Intel can take advantage of this by retaining a significant share of central processing units (CPUs) used in data center servers.
This leads to the next point: Intel's demise has been grossly overstated. Despite AMD chipping away at Intel's CPU share lead in PCs, mobile, and data center servers, Intel still retains the lion's share of the market in all three categories. These are effectively cash-cow segments that allow Intel to reinvest in manufacturing infrastructure, as well as put money to work in higher-growth initiatives.
Speaking of high-growth initiatives, Intel could benefit greatly from the upcoming spinoff and initial public offering (IPO) of autonomous vehicle company Mobileye. Intel purchased Mobileye in 2017 for $15.3 billion and expects the upcoming IPO to fetch in the neighborhood of $30 billion. This premium valuation comes on the heels of Mobileye hitting quarterly record sales amid 41% revenue growth in the second quarter.
Even the recently passed CHIPS and Science Act can be a boon for Intel. With Capitol Hill ready to subsidize nearly $53 billion in domestic manufacturing and chip research, Intel should have no trouble boosting its output to meet the demand needs of an increasingly digitized and technologically dependent world.
Sporting just over a $100 billion market cap and a $25 share price, we may never see Intel this cheap again.

2022-10-14 00:00:00+00:00,Why ASML Holding Fell by as Much as 16.4% This Week,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-asml-holding-fell-by-as-much-as-16.4-this-week,,,"What happened
Shares of ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) fell by as much as 16.4% this week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Investors likely sold off the chip manufacturing equipment supplier because of the U.S. government's increased restrictions on sales to companies in China. As of 12:05 p.m. ET Friday, shares of ASML were down by 11.1% compared to last week's closing price.
So what
ASML sells lithography equipment to computer chip manufacturers -- key tools that allow them to make more advanced and smaller semiconductors for smartphones, cars, and other devices. The ultra-advanced technology ASML provides helps companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) build semiconductors with ever-increasing transistor densities (the more transistors on a chip, the more powerful and efficient it will be), including the currently state-of-the-art 5-nanometer process node. Without ASML's equipment, these manufacturers would not be able to continually improve the computer chips they produce.
With this in mind, it's no surprise that ASML's stock fell after the U.S. government imposed further restrictions on semiconductor equipment sales to China this week. Amid increasing trade tensions, Washington had already blocked ASML from sending its most advanced extreme ultra-lithography (EUV) machines to China, but that ban has now been expanded to include even more equipment. In 2021, 25% of ASML's revenue came from mainland China, so its sales could suffer due to these restrictions.
The latest restrictions have investors feeling nervous about other semiconductor equipment players, too: Applied Materials and KLA both fell by around 10% this week. In addition, there are signs that the semiconductor industry is moving from a supply shortage to a supply glut as consumer and business behaviors shift again from what they were earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic. Investors' concerns about the potential impacts of all these headwinds have caused them to bid down ASML's stock price down by more than 50% year to date.
Now what
If you're an investor in ASML, the latest restrictions on tech exports to China might make you worried about the company's future. However, shift your focus to some of its largest non-Chinese customers, such as TSMC and Intel, and the future looks quite bright. Both of those companies are set to spend hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade on new factories across Asia, North America, and Europe. ASML has a monopoly on advanced lithography equipment, so plenty of those capital expenditures will go toward buying its wares.
Even if ASML can't sell its equipment to Chinese chipmakers, it shouldn't have to worry about finding customers for its equipment this decade. Given that, now might be a good time to purchase some shares of ASML stock to hold for the long haul.

Rising geo-political tensions between the United States and China, the global supply-chain challenges that adversely impacted the semiconductor industry, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, rising inflation and interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve. All of these reasons have created a volatile market situation which has created negative sentiments among investors specifically in cyclical sectors like tech.
Further impacting AMD’s share price negatively is the company’s recent third-quarter 2022 revenue forecast. It forecasted third-quarter 2022 revenues to be approximately $5.6 billion, an increase of 29% year over year, lower than the previously expected rise of roughly 55%.
AMD’s preliminary results reflect lower-than-expected client segment revenues resulting from reduced processor shipments due to weaker demand in the PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain.
AMD expects a non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 50%, down 400 basis points due to lowered client segment revenues.
The volatile macroeconomic situation has the broader tech sector in the doldrums as AMD’s peers in the sector NVIDIA NVDA and Intel INTC also bore the brunt of the situation.
NVDA and Intel shares have fallen 58.9% and 50%, respectively, in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s decline of 50.1%.
However, the company is expecting a significant rise in its high-growth business segments like data center and gaming, in line with its previous guidance. AMD expects Data Center and gaming business to grow 45% and 14%, respectively, year over year. The company is also benefitting from its recent collaborations with organizations like The Energy Sciences Network in high-performance computing (HPC) and high-performance network business segment.

AMD Boosting Top Line by Addressing High-Growth Markets
AMD recently announced that it has collaborated with the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) to launch ESnet6, the latest generation of the U.S. Department of Energy’s high-performance network.
This collaboration with ESnet is an extension of the partnership it built back in 2018. The recent expansion of agreement will help AMD fend off the stiff competition that the company faces from its peers NVIDIA and Intel in its various business segments.
NVIDIA is a dominant name in the data center, professional visualization and gaming markets, where its peers are close on its heels. NVDA has been benefiting from the rapid proliferation of AI. The company has been expanding its base in untapped markets like climate science, energy research, space exploration and digital biology.
Intel is still the leading name in the consumer PC market and is the major competitor of AMD in this segment. INTC is gradually reducing its dependence on the PC-centric business by transitioning to data-centric businesses such as AI and autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, AMD, which currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is expected to benefit from its plans to address new markets, accelerate data center growth and enter the AI and Augmented Reality spaces with its launch of various products by building strategic partnerships with companies like Dell Technologiesand OEM partners Hewlett Packard HPE, Acer and Lenovo. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
AMD is also leading its peers in the HPC business segment as it enables customers across various fields like manufacturing, life sciences, financial services, climate research and more to utilize supercomputers for research purposes.
AMD partnered with Hewlett Packard and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory to build the world’s fastest and most energy-efficient supercomputer — Frontier.
It is also worth mentioning that AMD powers five of the top 10 most powerful and eight of the top 10 most energy-efficient supercomputers globally. CSC’s LUMI supercomputer powered by AMD EPYC and AMD Instinct MI200 systems is third on the Top500 list with 152 petaflops of performance and third on the Green500 list with 51.63 gigaflops/watt power efficiency, while the Adastra system at GENCI-CINES is 10th on the Top500 list and fourth on the Green500 list.

2022-10-13 00:00:00+00:00,Taiwan Semiconductor Shares Rise on Hopes of Lower Fallout from U.S. Curbs,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/taiwan-semiconductor-shares-rise-on-hopes-of-lower-fallout-from-u.s.-curbs,,,"At a time when the global chip industry was reeling from the post-pandemic pullback in demand, the Biden administration announced restrictions on their trading with China. Chipmakers were expecting such an announcement for months, but the actual event is having the expected impact on share prices.
Not all chipmakers will be affected the same however. Companies like Intel INTC, which is reportedly considering headcount reductions will be affected. And Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, which generated 8% of its revenue from China in the last quarter will also be affected, but to a lesser extent.
In fact, most of the business it does in China relates to consumer devices, which are not part of the curbs. The government is concerned about Chinese use of advanced technology in intelligent weapons, which has prompted the decision.
TSM management said on the call that the company has also obtained an extension of one year on its Nanjing facility. Therefore, there won’t be much of an impact on its business at all.
It is the semiconductor equipment makers that will be severely affected because they generate a sizeable amount of their businesses from China, which is gearing up to becoming self-reliant in chips and the leader in AI technology. Applied Materials AMAT has already taken down its guidance while KLA Corp KLAC and Lam Research LRCX are weighing their options in China and ASML cutting services to Chinese customers [Bloomberg reports].
For Taiwan Semiconductor, which reported stellar results in the last quarter, including an 80% increase in profits and 36% increase in revenue, the concern is only partly related to U.S. directives. The 10% reduction in its capex to $36 billion from the July estimate of $40 billion (which was also lowered from $40-44 billion) is not a reflection of the curbs. Management has said that half of it is related to supply chain concerns that are stretching out delivery of tools. The other half is the result of capacity optimization in anticipation of slowing demand next year.
So the main take from management commentary and the read-through to other semiconductor stocks is that demand will soften in 2023, as a result of a softer computing/consumer market (items that were overbought during the pandemic), as well as relatively soft demand for enterprise and commercial PCs as a result of an economy rendered sluggish by the Fed’s tightening actions. The auto market is still going strong, but there has been recent conversation about oversupply next year. Definitely not a good sign for semiconductor suppliers.  
Most semiconductor stocks are therefore in the bottom 50% of Zacks-ranked industries, which means that you shouldn’t expect the stocks included in them to have a good chance of upside in the near term. No matter what their concerns. Therefore, these stocks are best avoided for now.

2022-10-13 00:00:00+00:00,"PREVIEW-Investors worry about hiring outlook, spending before U.S. earnings",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/preview-investors-worry-about-hiring-outlook-spending-before-u.s.-earnings,,,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The outlook for jobs and spending may be chief among concerns for investors heading into third-quarter U.S. earnings as expectations increase that the Federal Reserve will need to keep an aggressive approach to hiking interest rates.
Estimates for the earnings period have been falling, and analysts now expect S&P 500 companies' earnings to have grown just 4.1% year over year in the quarter compared with an estimated increase of 11.1% at the start of July, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Reporting on the period ramps up with the release of results from JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and other major banks Friday.
Stocks have struggled recently, with the S&P 500 falling for a sixth straight session Wednesday, partly because of mounting fears among investors that the aggressive stance by the Fed could tip the world's largest economy into recession and raise unemployment rates. Stocks rebounded Thursday.
Data Thursday reinforced expectations the Fed will deliver a fourth 75-basis-point rate hike next month, with a report showing U.S. consumer prices increased more than expected in September.
""There might not be that many disappointments in the actual results compared to the estimates, but they might tone down any optimistic talk just because of the uncertainty,"" said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates in Toledo, Ohio.
Given the interest rate outlook, investors are keen to hear what company executives say about their plans for hiring and investment spending, which would give strong clues about the health of the U.S. economy.
""If we start to hear more about hiring freezes, layoff announcements, reduction in capex... that's a big red flag,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.
""That means demand destruction is happening, and that will support the argument that they're bracing for a recession.""
Earlier this week, Bloomberg News reported chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O is planning a major reduction in headcount in the face of a slowdown in the personal computer market, citing people with knowledge of the situation.
Some investors said this earnings season may be too soon to give many indications on changes in capital expenditures, but they will be watching profit margins closely.
""Almost any of the indicators we look at, across the board, are giving a very, very clear signal there is likely to be margin pressure in the coming months,"" and that would eventually affect capital spending, said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in London.
Nike Inc NKE.N in its recent report warned of a margin squeeze from widespread markdowns, creating worries of sector-wide contagion of ballooning inventory.
Not all signs point to disappointment this earnings season. On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc WBA.O reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, and the company also forecast a ""better-than-feared"" full-year profit, driving its shares higher.
Last month, Rite Aid RAD.N cut its full-year forecast, citing concerns about consumer spending pressure and supply chain challenges.
Earnings estimates have come down for all of 2022 as well, with S&P 500 profit growth now forecast at 7.4% compared with 9.5% at the start of July, based on Refinitiv data.
Indeed, another big risk to third-quarter earnings is the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which can hurt U.S. multinationals that need to exchange their earnings into dollars.
""This season, company managements have a panoply of headwinds to blame when offering up disappointing results,"" Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital in Chicago, wrote in a note this week.

2022-10-13 00:00:00+00:00,Why Advanced Micro Devices Stock Fell Before a Big Rally Earlier Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-advanced-micro-devices-stock-fell-before-a-big-rally-earlier-today,,,"What happened
Market traders were nervous today after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the latest Consumer Price Index data for September. Inflation came in higher than analysts expected, which ended hopes that the Federal Reserve would stop raising interest rates.
In other news, analysts are still processing how deep the PC market could fall in the near term, especially if higher inflation sends the economy into a recession.
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) were down big at the market open on Thursday, but the stock quickly recovered and was up 2% as of 11:38 a.m. ET. This could signal the bad news is already priced in after the shares have fallen 60% year to date.
So what
While Wall Street wonders whether higher inflation and interest rates will tip the economy into a recession, the PC market might already be there. Earlier this week, the International Data Corporation reported worldwide PC shipments were down 15% in the third quarter. This follows a decline of 15.3% in the previous quarter.
Late Wednesday, Credit Suisse lowered estimates for Microsoft over the steepest decline in the PC market in two decades. AMD's dependence on this market could spell a rough year ahead. In the second quarter, AMD's gaming and client revenue, including sales of desktop chips, made up 58% of total revenue.
Now what
There are two reasons investors can look at the stock's sell-off as a buying opportunity. First, AMD is gobbling up market share. Even with PC shipments falling, the company grew its client and gaming revenue by 25% and 32%, respectively, year over year in the second quarter. Intel is the semiconductor company investors should worry about.
Second, valuation matters. It's a good sign that the market brushed off bad economic news and sent AMD shares up by midmorning. The stock certainly looks like a bargain, trading at 15.3 times 2022 earnings estimates. As long as AMD is gaining market share, investors could make a nice return off these valuation levels when the dust clears.

AMSTERDAM, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Shares in Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML ASML.AS fell 9% on Thursday after its biggest customer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) cut its forecasts for capital spending by 10% this year, citing in part equipment delays.
Half of the reason for TSMC's cut was due to medium-term planning and ""the other half is due to continued tool delivery challenges"", TSMC Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang told reporters on a media call.
A spokesperson for ASML, Europe's largest technology company, said they could not comment ahead of third-quarter earnings on Oct. 17. Shares in the company were down 9.1% at 376.50 euros ($364.94) at 1352 GMT.
ASML, which dominates the market for the lithography tools used by chipmakers such as TSMC, Samsung 005930.KS and Intel INTC.O to create the circuitry of computer chips, has struggled to meet demand for its products.
In 2021, 44% of ASML's sales were to customers in Taiwan.
At its second quarter earnings release in July, the company said it had registered record bookings but CFO Roger Dassen warned that the company was facing ""increasing supply chain restraints"".
ASML has forecast third quarter sales of 5.1 billion -5.4 billion euros ($4.9 billion-$5.2 billion).
In a note, analyst Marc Hesselink of ING said that he expected a ""very limited impact"" to ASML from any downturn in semiconductor markets.
""The revenue risk is mainly due to push-outs,"" he said. ""The main short-term risk we see is on the margin. Supply-chains remain constrained and inflation is pushing up component prices.""
