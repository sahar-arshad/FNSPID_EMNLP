2022-09-15 00:00:00+00:00,"Move Over, Nvidia. These High-Growth Nasdaq Stocks Are Screaming Buys Right Now.",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/move-over-nvidia.-these-high-growth-nasdaq-stocks-are-screaming-buys-right-now.,,,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was one of the most coveted stocks on the market for quite some time thanks to its rapid growth. Much of that growth in Nvidia stock is due to booming demand for the graphics cards that power a variety of applications ranging from gaming computers to data centers and vehicles.
However, the high-flying graphics card specialist fell from grace starting in 2022, down 57% year to date. The loss of momentum in the key gaming GPU (graphics processing unit) business, as well as restrictions by the U.S. government on sales of data center chips to China, are going to weigh on Nvidia's performance in the short run. Of course, Nvidia has enough catalysts in the bag to turn its fortunes around in the long run.
But investors may want to stay away from this Nasdaq stock until there are clear signs of a turnaround in the company's business. That's especially true considering that Nvidia continues to trade at an expensive 47 times trailing earnings.
Further signs of weakness could send the stock lower given its rich valuation, but there are other promising Nasdaq stocks that tech investors should consider now given their impressive growth and attractive valuations compared to Nvidia's. With that said, let's take a closer look at two of my favorite alternatives to Nvidia right now.
1. Advanced Micro Devices
Just like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) also sells graphics cards for data centers and personal computers (PCs). However, the company has remained unaffected by the slowdown in the PC and gaming GPU markets thanks to a more diversified business and the market share gains that it has been scoring against Intel.
The company finished the second quarter of 2022 with a 70% year-over-year increase in revenue to $6.6 billion. Its earnings shot up 67% from the prior-year quarter to $1.05 per share. AMD forecasts a 60% increase in revenue in 2022 to $26.3 billion, driven by the growth of its data center and embedded businesses. The acquisition of Xilinx, which was completed earlier this year, is going to play a key role in this impressive growth.
It is worth noting that AMD is expected to sustain its impressive growth for a long time. Analysts are forecasting an annual earnings growth rate of nearly 27% for the company. That's higher than the 23% annual earnings growth analysts expect from Nvidia over the same period. It is not surprising to see why AMD's growth is expected to outpace Nvidia's.
AMD has a much better outlook for the current year, as we saw above. Nvidia, on the other hand, expects to deliver $5.5 billion in revenue in the current quarter after adjusting for a potential $400 million negative impact from the restriction in sales to China. The updated guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 points toward a 19% drop in revenue from the prior-year period. The chipmaker is expected to finish the fiscal year with a flat revenue performance.
Meanwhile, AMD is making solid progress in lucrative markets such as data center processors, an area that Nvidia has yet to tap. Also, AMD supplies its custom chips to the likes of Microsoft, Sony, and Valve for their gaming consoles. These markets give AMD an advantage over Nvidia.
The momentum is on AMD's side, and so is the valuation. The stock is trading at 36 times trailing earnings, which is a nice discount to Nvidia. Additionally, AMD's forward earnings multiple of 15x is well below Nvidia's multiple of nearly 39x. So investors looking for an alternative to Nvidia should take a closer look at AMD given its impressive growth, bright prospects, multiple catalysts, and relatively attractive multiples.
2. Palo Alto Networks
Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) has sprung into the limelight following management's stock split announcement last month. However, a closer look at the company's recent results and prospects indicates that there are more reasons to buy it than just the stock split.
The company released its fiscal 2022 results for the year ended July 31, 2022, on Aug. 22. It closed the year with a 27% year-over-year increase in revenue to $1.6 billion in fiscal Q4, while full-year revenue was up 29% to $5.5 billion. More importantly, the company's billings increased 37% during the year to $7.5 billion.
The impressive growth in Palo Alto's billings is an indicator of solid future growth. That's because the company's billings refer to the money that hasn't been recognized as revenue yet. Its remaining performance obligations (RPO), which is the value of customer contracts that have yet to be fulfilled, was up 40% year-over-year last quarter to $8.2 billion.
Not surprisingly, Palo Alto expects another solid year in fiscal 2023. Its revenue is expected to increase 25% this year to a range of $6.85 billion to $6.90 billion. The company also expects adjusted earnings in the range of $9.40 to $9.50 per share, up 24% to 25% from last fiscal year's earnings of $7.56 per share. The long-term earnings growth forecast is similar, with analysts expecting nearly 26% annual earnings growth from Palo Alto for the next five years.
The secular growth in cybersecurity spending and Palo Alto's solid position in this market should pave the way for impressive top- and bottom-line growth at the company. All this makes this cybersecurity stock worth buying, especially if you're looking for an alternative to Nvidia. Palo Alto is trading at 10 times sales, compared to Nvidia's price-to-sales ratio of 11x, so investors could get their hands on a fast-growing company at a relatively attractive valuation right now.

2022-09-14 00:00:00+00:00,"Traffic, water shortages, now floods: the slow death of India's tech hub?",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/traffic-water-shortages-now-floods%3A-the-slow-death-of-indias-tech-hub,,,"By Devjyot Ghoshal and Nivedita Bhattacharjee
BENGALURU, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Harish Pullanoor spent his weekends in the late 1980s tramping around the marshes and ponds of Yemalur, an area then on the eastern edge of the Indian metropolis of Bengaluru, where his cousins would join him catching small freshwater fish.
In the 1990s, Bengaluru, once a genteel city of gardens, lakes and a cool climate, rapidly became India's answer to Silicon Valley, attracting millions of workers and the regional headquarters of some of the world's biggest IT companies.
The untrammelled expansion came at a price.
Concrete replaced green spaces and construction around the edge of lakes blocked off connecting canals, limiting the city's capacity to absorb and siphon off water.
Last week, after the city's heaviest rains in decades, the Yemalur neighbourhood was submerged under waist-deep water along with some other parts of Bengaluru, disrupting the southern metropolis' IT industry and dealing a blow to its reputation.
Residents fed up with gridlocked traffic and water shortages during the dry season have long complained about the city's infrastructure.
But flooding during the monsoon has raised fresh questions about the sustainability of rapid urban development, especially if weather patterns become more erratic and intense because of climate change.
""It's very, very sad,"" said Pullanoor, who was born close to Yemalur but now lives in the western city of Mumbai, parts of which also face sporadic flooding like many of India's urban centres.
""The trees have disappeared. The parks have almost disappeared. There is chock-a-block traffic.""
Big businesses are also complaining about worsening disruptions, which they say can cost them tens of millions of dollars in a single day.
Bengaluru hosts more than 3,500 IT companies and some 79 ""tech parks"" - upmarket premises that house offices and entertainment areas catering to technology workers.
Wading through flooded highways last week, they struggled to reach modern glass-faced complexes in and around Yemalur where multinational firms including JP Morgan and Deloitte operate alongside large Indian start-ups.
Millionaire entrepreneurs were among those forced to escape flooded living rooms and swamped bedrooms on the back of tractors.
Insurance companies said initial estimates for loss of property were ran into millions of rupees, with numbers expected to go up in the next few days.
'GLOBAL IMPACT'
The latest chaos triggered renewed worries from the $194 billion Indian IT services industry that is concentrated around the city.
""India is a tech hub for global enterprises, so any disruption here will have a global impact. Bangalore, being the centre of IT, will be no exception to this,"" said K.S. Viswanathan, vice president at industry lobby group the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM).
Bangalore was renamed Bengaluru in 2014.
NASSCOM is currently working to identify 15 new cities that could become software export hubs, said Viswanathan, who is driving the project.
""It is not a city-versus-city story,"" he told Reuters. ""We as a country don't want to miss out on revenue and business opportunities because of a lack of infrastructure.""
Even before the floods, some business groups including the Outer Ring Road Companies Association (ORRCA) that is led by executives from Intel INTC.O, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft MSFT.O and Wipro WIPR.NS, warned inadequate infrastructure in Bengaluru could encourage companies to leave.
""We have been talking about these for years,"" Krishna Kumar, general manager of ORRCA, said last week of problems related to Bengaluru's infrastructure. ""We have come to a serious point now and all companies are on the same page.""
In the early 1970s, more than 68 percent of Bengaluru was covered in vegetation.
By the late 1990s, the city's green cover had dropped to around 45% and by 2021 to less than 3% of its total area of 741 square kilometres, according to an analysis by T.V. Ramachandra of Bengaluru's Indian Institute of Science (IISC).
Green spaces can help absorb and temporarily store storm water, helping to protect built up areas.
""If this trend continues, by 2025, 98.5% (of the city) will be choked with concrete,"" said Ramachandra, who is part of IISC's Centre for Ecological Sciences.
CITY IN DECAY
Rapid urban expansion, often featuring illegal structures built without permission, has affected Bengaluru's nearly 200 lakes and a network of canals that once connected them, according to experts.
So when heavy rains lash the city like they did last week, drainage systems are unable to keep up, especially in low-lying areas like Yemalur.
The state government of Karnataka, where Bengaluru is located, said last week it would spent 3 billion Indian rupees ($37.8 million) to help manage the flood situation, including removing unauthorised developments, improving drainage systems and controlling water levels in lakes.
""All the encroachments will be removed without any mercy,"" Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai told reporters. ""I will personally go and inspect.""
Authorities have identified around 50 areas in Bengaluru that have been illegally developed. Those included high-end villas and apartments, according to Tushar Girinath, Chief Commissioner of Bengaluru's civic authority.
Last week, the state government also announced it would set up a body to manage Bengaluru's traffic and start discussions on a new storm water drainage project along a major highway.
Critics called the initiatives a knee-jerk reaction that could peter out.
""Every time it floods, only then we discuss,"" said IISC's Ramachandra. ""Bengaluru is decaying. It will die.""

2022-09-14 00:00:00+00:00,"Alphabet's (GOOGL) Waymo Makes Way to Bellevue, Boosts Efforts",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alphabets-googl-waymo-makes-way-to-bellevue-boosts-efforts,,,"Alphabet GOOGL is leaving no stone unturned to expand its Waymo ride-hailing service across the United States.

This is evident from the latest move of testing its self-driving vehicles on the streets of Bellevue, WA.

Waymo’s all-electric six Jaguar I-PACE vehicles equipped with its fifth generation Waymo Driver technology will be operated on the roads of Bellevue for six months.

With the latest move, the company makes its foray into the Seattle region. With this, it will be able to check the performance of Waymo vehicles in wet weather.
Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus
  Alphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote
Expanding Waymo Efforts
The recent step is in sync with the company’s strengthening efforts toward expanding its operations and fleet, and making the vehicles more rider-friendly.

We note that Waymo in Bellevue marks Alphabet’s second expansion outside Phoenix, AZ.

The company is also gearing up to make its ride-hailing vehicles fully driverless on the streets of San Francisco. This marks Waymo’s first expansion outside Phoenix.

Waymo launched a rider-only service in downtown Phoenix, where it has been operating its autonomous vehicles with a company specialist seated in the driver's seat until now. The service in downtown Phoenix will be confined to a specific area, which is constrained by Interstate 17 on the west and south, Camelback Road on the north, and 44th Street on the east.

Waymo plans to roll out the driverless robotaxi service to regular passengers and expand its operating area eventually in downtown Phoenix.

Apart from these efforts, Alphabet’s partnership with Geely, a China-based automotive company, remains noteworthy. Per the terms of the deal, Geely’s electric mobility brand, Zeekr, will design and develop electric vehicles for Waymo, into which Waymo Driver will be integrated.

The vehicles will be introduced on the roads of the United States first. With the Geely partnership, Waymo will expand its Waymo One fleet.

The above-mentioned endeavors will help Alphabet further penetrate the booming autonomous driving space.

According to a Fortune Business Insights report, the global autonomous car market is expected to reach $11.03 billion by 2028, seeing a CAGR of 31.3% between 2021 and 2028.

Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the worldwide driverless vehicle market is expected to see a CAGR of 18.06% between 2021 and 2026.

We believe that Alphabet’s growing prospects in this promising market will help it win investors’ confidence in the days ahead.

Coming to the price performance, Alphabet has lost 28% on a year-to-date basis against the industry’s decline of 26.2%.
Intensifying Competition
Given the upbeat scenario, not only Alphabet but companies like Intel INTC, Amazon AMZN and Baidu BIDU are also making every effort to capitalize on the growth prospects in the autonomous driving space.

Intel is gaining from the low power consumption of Mobileye chips and the ability to create maps for self-driving systems. The company plans to introduce a pilot for autonomous taxis and ride-hailing services in Munich and Tel Aviv in 2022.

In April 2022, the company gave a sneak peek of its robotaxi ride by rolling out a video of a 40-minute autonomous car ride around Jerusalem.

In addition to this, Mobileye recently teamed up with German electric mobility unit Benteler EV Systems and Beep to develop and deploy self-driving, fully-electric shuttles in the United States by 2024.

Amazon’s buyout of Zoox, a developer of autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, remains a major positive. The company’s launch of its first self-driving robotaxi strengthened its position in the autonomous driving space.

Currently, the company is gearing up to test its robotaxi in California. It has applied for a permit in California to test-drive its vehicles.

Zoox intends to open an engineering office and operations facility this year, which will act as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing.

Meanwhile, Baidu is gaining from the strong momentum of Apollo Go Robotaxi service across China on the back of its increasing availability in several cities and a growing number of rides.

2022-09-14 00:00:00+00:00,3 Tech Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in September,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-tech-stocks-that-are-screaming-buys-in-september,,,"September has historically been one of the most difficult months in markets, and the market is already down significantly on the year. Moreover, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has been hit even harder, as higher interest rates and slowing post-pandemic growth have led to a double-whammy of bad news for tech stocks broadly.
But with so many stocks down big, there's bound to be some great deals, especially given the innovation happening around artificial intelligence, 5G, electric vehicles, robotics, and other game-changing applications.
Here are three stocks experiencing short-term pain but that should thrive over the long-term, making them bargain buys at today's marked-down prices.
Amazon
Sure, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) may have overbuilt its e-commerce infrastructure during the hypergrowth of the pandemic, which has crushed margins as growth has slowed this year. But that's just a short-term concern.
New CEO Andy Jassy has already made major adjustments, including canceling some buildouts and even subleasing certain warehouses and distribution spaces. Moreover, Amazon is eventually going to grow enough to utilize its market-leading logistics footprint and improve on its margin.
Yet taking a broader view, Amazon's first-party retail business, in which it buys and owns its own inventory, probably gets too much publicity as the highest-revenue segment of the company. But it's also the lowest-margin, and it may not even be Amazon's most valuable segment.
Amazon's smaller businesses are much higher-margin and also growing faster. First, Amazon Web Services (AWS) grew a solid 33% last quarter and garnered a 31% operating margin over the prior 12 months. AWS has first-mover advantage in cloud computing infrastructure, and this is a utility-like business with a long growth runway. Even in a recession, it's possible companies may lean even more heavily on cloud computing to avoid the up-front costs of building their own data centers. In fact, given its high margin and growth profile, AWS may be worth as much as Amazon's entire market cap today.
Moreover, Amazon's up-and-coming digital advertising business is growing nicely, and given the margins seen at other large-scale digital advertising companies, it's likely high-margin as well. And while overall retail is struggling, Amazon's third-party e-commerce sales, which are higher-margin than first-party sales, held up much better, up 9% last quarter, whereas the first-party e-commerce business was down 4%.
Then there are new innovations at Amazon, which include new ""Just Walk Out"" physical retail technology, along with a new push in the fields of robotics. So while the near-term picture in its e-commerce business has suffered this year, the long-term growth picture for Amazon is still very much intact.
While short-term concerns have caused a 20% sell-off this year, even after another underwhelming performance in 2021, Amazon's stock may be due for another big run when the economy recovers.
Applied Materials
While this year has been bad for e-commerce stocks like Amazon, the semiconductor sector has been enduring an even worse drawdown. After consumers loaded up on PCs, phones, tablets, and TVs during the pandemic, inflation and rising interest rates are basically bringing those purchases to a halt, leading to a glut of consumer-related chips.
Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) is the largest semiconductor equipment manufacturing company in the world, so its stock has also seen a big 38% sell-off this year, in spite of solid operating performance to date. Now trading at just 12.8 times trailing earnings, it appears as though the worst may be priced in.
Keep in mind that Applied soundly beat revenue and earnings estimates last quarter, and it also maintained that demand for its cutting-edge machines is still well ahead of its ability to supply. So what explains the disconnect?
Investors should care to separate the semiconductor equipment suppliers from the chip designers in the consumer space. While the memory segment of the market is very weak, as are chips for consumer-related devices, there are other parts of the market that are still quite strong and even undersupplied. This includes automotive and industrial chips, and data center semiconductors also appear to be holding up well.
Meanwhile, there is tremendous competition going on among Intel, Samsung, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to grab the lead in leading-edge chip manufacturing, and leading-edge manufacturing is only becoming more difficult and capital-intensive. Therefore, that should benefit Applied Materials, which got two-thirds of its revenue from foundry and logic customers last quarter, versus just one-third from memory.
If Applied Materials makes it through this chip slowdown with better-than-feared or no revenue and earnings declines, the stock could rerate much higher coming out of this downturn. Given the above-GDP growth projections for semiconductors over the long term, Applied Materials looks like a tremendous long-term bargain today.
Alphabet
Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been very cheap by most measures for a while now, and especially in 2022. Good thing the company is stepping up its share repurchases this year, with a new $70 billion authorization.
At its current market capitalization, that's about a 5% total shareholder return. That's fairly amazing for this growth stock with a huge competitive advantage in online search. Even in a quarter marked by a big pullback in digital ad spending, Google Search still grew 13.5% last quarter, and Alphabet's overall ad revenue climbed 10.1%.
Coming after a very high-growth year last year and given all the macroeconomic headwinds, that's not a bad result at all. In addition, Alphabet's price-to-earnings ratio of 20.5 is cheaper than it's been in years, and it's actually lower than the multiple of the S&P 500 overall, at 21.8. That doesn't seem right, since Google is definitely an above-average business, and Alphabet is still generating losses from both its cloud computing and moonshot ""other bets"" segments. Those losses are depressing earnings by roughly 10%, but those segments still are likely to have significant positive value. That means Alphabet is even cheaper than it appears.
All in all, Google Search looks resilient, the company's cloud computing segment is showing strong growth, and management is finally turning up the share buybacks. It's another bargain tech stock to buy in September.

2022-09-14 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Time to Buy the Dow Jones' 3 Worst-Performing Stocks This Year?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-time-to-buy-the-dow-jones-3-worst-performing-stocks-this-year-3,,,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average is an index made of 30 prominent U.S. companies; its broad representation of America's largest businesses makes the index heavily followed by Wall Street. The Dow is a tough circle to get into, so one might expect its stocks to remain pretty resilient in a volatile market.
However, that hasn't been the case for some of these dogs of the Dow; here are the three worst-performing Dow Jones members of 2022 and whether a turnaround is in store or if the stocks are cheap for a reason.
1. Nike: Down 36% year-to-date
Apparel giant Nike (NYSE: NKE) is one of the biggest names in sports and a globally recognized brand. The swoosh logo is all over the shoes and apparel of some of the world's most famous athletes, including LeBron James, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Michael Jordan. The company's done $46 billion in sales over the past year and has averaged 7% annual revenue growth over the past decade. In other words, Nike keeps growing at a healthy clip despite its massive size and success to date.
But the stock's been a sore spot for investors since the beginning of the year, falling 31% since January. Sometimes a falling share price can signal something is wrong inside the company, but it doesn't have to be that way. Below you can see the stock's valuation using the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) has been a roller coaster over the past few years. The stock traded around 80X earnings in early 2021, far above its historical norms, around a P/E of 28.
NKE PE Ratio data by YCharts.
A bear market often means that overvalued stocks like Nike are going to cool off, and it looks like that's what's happening with Nike. The store returning to its historical valuation is good because it can allow the company's growth to drive the stock price. Analysts believe that Nike's earnings per share (EPS) will grow 12% annually over the next three to five years, about the same as the past decade. Given that, one might argue that Nike's historical norms represent near fair value for the stock. In that case, Nike isn't cheap yet, and the stock could still fall further in the short term.
2. Salesforce.com: Down 37% year-to-date
Enterprise software company Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) was one of the first software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks to hit Wall Street when it went public in 2004. Starting as a customer management solution, companies can run virtually every aspect of their operations through the various features that Salesforce offers. Salesforce has done more than $29 billion in revenue over the past year and is still growing like its hair's on fire; the company's revenue has grown an average of 27% annually over the last ten years.
But that growth could slow down; analysts are projecting annual revenue growth in the low to mid-teens over the next several years, and the stock's price, down 37% since January, reflects reduced expectations. You can see in the below chart how the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) is near its lowest in a decade:
CRM PS Ratio data by YCharts.
The stock's valuation is much lower than average over its history, but Salesforce isn't as small and nimble as it used to be, slowing its growth. It might be fair that the stock's lower valuation has priced in this potential slowdown in the business, though it's become harder to call the store cheap in the face of slowing growth. Long-term investors can still enjoy Salesforce's trajectory as one of the world's dominant software companies, but investors should temper expectations.
3. Intel: Down 43% year-to-date
Semiconductor company Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is one of the leading chip companies worldwide, known for its leadership in central processing units (CPU); it invented the x86 chip architecture widely used today. Total revenue is $73 billion over the past 12 months, making Intel one of the world's largest technology companies. CPUs are essentially the brain of a computer device, executing the commands that users input.
Intel's stock has fallen 43% since January; the company is investing heavily in new fabrication facilities when the economy is shaky, which could be scaring investors. The company's plans could cost Intel most of its free cash flow over the next several years, making the stock a bit riskier in the short term. The declining stock price has repriced shares at a P/E of less than 7, its lowest in ten years.
INTC PE Ratio data by YCharts.
Leaning into a down cycle in semiconductors can be risky but could pay off for long-term investors. The fabrication facilities are long-term assets, and Intel is offsetting some of the upfront costs through strategic partnerships and benefits from the recently signed CHIPS Act. The ride could remain bumpy for a while, but Intel's current valuation could be an excellent entry point if it achieves its long-term goals.

2022-09-14 00:00:00+00:00,"Google loses challenge against EU antitrust decision, wins 5% fine cut",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/google-loses-challenge-against-eu-antitrust-decision-wins-5-fine-cut,,,"By Foo Yun Chee
LUXEMBOURG, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Alphabet GOOGL.O unit Google on Wednesday suffered its second setback in less than a year as Europe's top court agreed with EU antitrust regulators that it had abused its dominance but trimmed the fine by 5% because of a disagreement on one point.
Google lost its challenge to a 2.42 billion euro ($2.42 billion) fine last year, the first of a trio of cases.
""The General Court largely confirms the Commission's decision that Google imposed unlawful restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices and mobile network operators in order to consolidate the dominant position of its search engine,"" the court said.
""In order better to reflect the gravity and duration of the infringement, the General Court considers it appropriate however to impose a fine of 4.125 billion euros on Google, its reasoning differing in certain respects from that of the Commission,"" judges said.
The ruling is a boost for EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager following setbacks in cases involving other tech giants such as Intel INTC.O and Qualcomm QCOM.O this year.
The competition chief of the European Commission has cracked down on Big Tech with hefty fines to ensure a level playing field in the 27-country European Union.
The Commission in its 2018 decision said Google used Android to cement its dominance in general internet search via payments to large manufacturers and mobile network operators and restrictions.
Google said it acted like countless other businesses and that such payments and agreements help keep Android a free operating system, criticising the EU decision as out of step with the economic reality of mobile software platforms.
The parties can appeal on matters of law to the EU Court of Justice, Europe's highest.
The case is T-604/18 Google vs European Commission.

2022-09-13 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Stock (NASDAQ:INTC): Should Dividend Seekers Catch the Falling Knife?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-stock-nasdaq%3Aintc%3A-should-dividend-seekers-catch-the-falling-knife,,,"Shares of fallen semiconductor great Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have continued to trend lower amid their unprecedented fall from glory. Intel stock continues to act as a falling knife, and it's unclear when it will finally be ready to ricochet. Though I'm unsure if Intel can return to its former glory, I remain neutral on the stock at today's depressed multiples. There's a huge 5% dividend yield that's more than secure.
The latest quarterly results were quite abysmal. They fell well short of estimates, with per-share earnings coming in at $0.29, a far cry below the $0.69 consensus estimate. Driving the decline are many of the environmental headwinds that most firms have felt this year.
Intel's free-fall can't be blamed on anyone but itself, though. Intel is losing ground to rivals and fast. Even with a multi-year plan to return to its former glory, engineering such a turnaround could prove difficult, given the momentum of some of its peers.
In the fast-moving tech world, it's hard to close the distance once a firm has fallen behind. Undoubtedly, Intel is an old-school market darling that has endured such a painful fall. Whether it can get up after such a hard fall remains the million-dollar question. Given its age and competitive environment, getting back on its own two feet could prove difficult as momentum tends to be hard to stop (or reverse) in the chip space.
With new CEO Pat Gelsinger aboard, Intel has the right man to engineer a comeback. If Intel can close the gap and retake the lead, the rewards could be enormous from current levels, and if Intel continues to lose market share to rivals, it's arguable that such is already well baked into the share price after a more than 55% haircut.
Intel Has a Tough Fight Against AMD
Just because Intel's dividend payout is sustainable does not mean the firm shouldn't at least consider trimming it. Sure, Intel is continuing to spend aggressively, and arguably, the firm can regain the chip lead without having to bring its dividend to the chopping block. Intel is by no means skimping on spending. That said, Intel needs to go up against AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), an impressive chip rival that doesn't have a lofty dividend commitment weighing it down.
Further, it's arguable that any additional spending from Intel could help accelerate efforts to close the gap with peers and claw back the market share it lost in recent years.
Earlier this year, Intel announced a plan to spend more than €33 billion on R&D and manufacturing within the European region. Intel also plans to split a $30 billion investment with Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) to create an Arizonan chip facility. Such big spending should give Intel's ""IDM 2.0"" strategy a nice shot in the arm.
While I'm sure Intel can make good on its strategic plan, AMD will also be busy on cutting-edge innovations of its own, from consumer-class CPUs to ultra-fast server chips. AMD's still hungry to take more share with its latest lineup of competitive offerings. In a nutshell, Intel needs to outdo AMD, or no turn of the tide should be expected over the medium term.
Can Intel Stock Bounce Back from a Brutal Q2?
After a huge fumble, Intel needs a bounce-back quarter to win back the love of its yield-hungry shareholders. Ongoing supply-chain hiccups and a potential chip glut on the horizon will not make matters any better. Indeed, the chip industry could be in for a doozy as 2023 rolls around. In any case, Intel may use the coming recession as a means to take some share back from its competitors if it's to put an end to its horrific decline.
Intel is more than capable of making up for lost time in future quarters. However, the stakes are high as the chip giant looks to swim against the tides. At writing, the stock trades at 6.3x trailing earnings, 1.6x sales, and 5.3x cash flow.
The stock looks cheap if Intel proves it can outcompete its disruptors. For now, Intel is a deep-value play that's not without its share of risks. If the firm can out-innovate its peers, the type of relief to be had in the stock could be sizeable.
What is the Target Price for INTC Stock?
Turning to Wall Street, INTC stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 30 analyst ratings, there are four Buys, 17 Holds, and nine Sells.
The average Intel price target is $38.55, implying upside potential of 31.6%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $30.00 per share to a high of $55.00 per share.
Conclusion: Intel Faces a Tough Road Ahead
Intel's making all the right investments to stage a comeback. However, AMD will be doing everything in its power to raise the bar even higher, perhaps at a much quicker rate than expected. Semis are a tough place to be in right now, making a swift recovery in deeply-discounted shares of Intel less likely.

2022-09-13 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Intel, Microsoft, and HP Stocks Flopped Today",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-microsoft-and-hp-stocks-flopped-today,,,"What happened
Bad news for investors in the personal computing (PC) industry: In morning trading Tuesday, shares up and down the supply chain -- from chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) to software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to hardware manufacturer HP (NYSE: HPQ) -- are all sliding.
As of 10:40 a.m. ET today, Intel stock was down a big 4.6%, with both Microsoft and HP following with 3.9% losses.
So what
So why are tech stocks taking a bath this morning? It's the economy, silly. Although analysts had predicted that inflation would decline with the falling price of oil, August's inflation rate inched up another 10 basis points, resulting in an 8.3% year-over-year inflation rate for the month.
This stubborn refusal of inflation to act transitory has investors thinking it's basically a given that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by at least another 75 basis points at its meeting next week -- the third such rate hike in a row.
Responding to this prospect, bond rates (which are closely tied to Fed policy) shot up; the 10-year Treasury is now at 3.43%. Simultaneously, tech stocks -- which as a whole carry high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios and become relatively less attractive as risk-free government bonds pay more -- are taking a plunge.
Nor is that the only bad news for investors in PC stocks. Earlier this month, International Data Corporation (IDC) released its latest forecast for the industry, and it was pretty glum, chum. IDC expects that sales of PCs will decline 12.8% year over year through the end of 2022, and that means less money spent on computer chips, PC software, and PCs themselves.
Now what
So bad news for Intel, Microsoft, and HP, right?
Yes, but viewed from purely an investing angle, this bad news might already be priced into these stocks. At 27.4 times trailing earnings, Microsoft isn't all that much more expensive than the average S&P 500 stock right now (which trades for a 20.1 multiple). And that's especially true with Microsoft being expected to grow earnings nearly 20% faster than the average S&P stock over the next five years.
Meanwhile, Intel and HP are both much cheaper than the average S&P 500 stock, at just 6.8 and 5 times trailing earnings, respectively. Presented with valuations like these, I think you have to ask: Does Intel really deserve to sell for a 64% discount to the S&P's valuation? Is HP really worth only 25% what the average large company in America is worth? And even if they are, doesn't Intel's 4.8% dividend yield and HP's 3.6% yield make up for at least some of the difference.
I think these are pretty solid companies, paying solid dividends. And selling their stocks today might be a mistake.

2022-09-13 00:00:00+00:00,Chip tech startup SiFive launches products aimed at automotive market,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chip-tech-startup-sifive-launches-products-aimed-at-automotive-market,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
Sept 13 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley startup SiFive Inc on Tuesday launched three new products aimed at the automotive market, which is emerging as one of the hottest areas for chip makers with electric and self-driving cars expected to boost the number of chips needed.
The new chip designs launched are the E6-A series for digital control applications like steering, S7-A for so-called ""safety islands"" that act as a failsafe for other critical applications, and X280-A to manage data from image sensors and do machine learning work, including for autonomous driving.
“Where you'll see us going is from these targeted compute chips ... to arrays of processors that will be available over the coming 12 to 24 months,” said SiFive CEO Patrick Little.
Before SiFive, Little helped build Qualcomm’s automotive business, and said both Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O could be great customers and partners for SiFive.
Qualcomm and Nvidia are both betting on automotive as a big business and have launched systems such as Snapdragon Ride and NVIDIA DRIVE that automotive customers can use for applications including autonomous driving.
SiFive does not make chips, but makes the blueprint for chipmakers to use. It uses a RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA), a base for building chips that defines what kind of software can run on the chips. Arm Ltd's ARM and Intel's INTC.O x86 are the dominant ISAs used today for general-purpose processors, or the brains of computers, and are proprietary. RISC-V is an open standard and is gaining traction, especially in China.
SiFive competes with Arm, which is also targeting the automotive market.
Little said some of the strongest demand for its chip technology is coming from customers looking to develop autonomous vehicles.

2022-09-12 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-Biden to hit China with broader curbs on U.S. chip and tool exports -sources,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-biden-to-hit-china-with-broader-curbs-on-u.s.-chip-and-tool-exports-sources-0,,,"By Karen Freifeld and Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON, Sept 11(Reuters) - The Biden administration plans next month to broaden curbs on U.S shipments to China of semiconductors used for artificial intelligence and chipmaking tools, several people familiar with the matter said.
The Commerce Department intends to publish new regulations based on restrictions communicated in letters earlier this year to three U.S. companies -- KLA Corp KLAC.O, Lam Research Corp LRCX.O and Applied Materials Inc AMAT.O, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The plan for new rules has not been previously reported.
The letters, which the companies publicly acknowledged, forbade them from exporting chipmaking equipment to Chinese factories that produce advanced semiconductors with sub-14 nanometer processes unless the sellers obtain Commerce Department licenses.
The rules would also codify restrictions in Commerce Department letters sent to Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O last month instructing them to halt shipments of several artificial intelligence computing chips to China unless they obtain licenses.
Some of the sources said the regulations would likely include additional actions against China. The restrictions could also be changed and the rules published later than expected.
So-called ""is informed"" letters allow the Commerce Department to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to put controls in place quickly, but the letters only apply to the companies that receive them.
Turning the letters into rules would broaden their reach and could subject other U.S. companies producing similar technology to the restrictions. The regulations could potentially apply to companies trying to challenge Nvidia and AMD's dominance in artificial intelligence chips.
Intel Corp INTC.O and startups like Cerebras Systems are targeting the same advanced computing markets. Intel said it is closely monitoring the situation, while Cerebras declined to comment.
One source said the rules could also impose license requirements on shipments to China of products that contain the targeted chips. Dell Technologies DELL.N, Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE.N and Super Micro Computer SMCI.O make data center servers that contain Nvidia's A100 chip.
Dell and HPE said they were monitoring the situation, while Super Micro Computer did not respond to a request for comment.
A senior Commerce official declined to comment on the upcoming action, but said: ""As a general rule, we look to codify any restrictions that are in is-informed letters with a regulatory change.""
A spokesperson for the Commerce Department on Friday declined to comment on specific regulations but reiterated that it is ""taking a comprehensive approach to implement additional actions...to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,"" including to keep China from acquiring U.S. technology applicable to military modernization.
KLA, Applied Materials and Nvidia declined to comment while Lam did not respond to requests for comment. AMD did not comment on the specific policy move but reaffirmed it does not foresee a ""material impact"" from its new licensing requirement.
'CHOKE POINT'
The planned action comes as the President Joe Biden's administration has sought to thwart China's advances by targeting technologies where the United States still maintains dominance.
""The strategy is to choke off China and they have discovered that chips are a choke point. They can't make this stuff, they can't make the manufacturing equipment,"" said Jim Lewis a technology expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""That will change.""
In an update on China-related measures last week, the Chamber of Commerce, a U.S. business lobbying group, warned members of imminent restrictions on AI chips and chipmaking tools.
""We are now hearing that members should expect a series of rules or perhaps an overarching rule prior to the mid-term election to codify the guidance in recently issued (Commerce Department) 'is-informed' letters to chip equipment and chip design companies,"" the Chamber said.
The Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The group also said the agency plans to add additional Chinese supercomputing entities to a trade blacklist.
Reuters was first to report in July that the Biden administration was actively discussing banning exports of chipmaking tools to Chinese factories that make advanced semiconductors at the 14 nanometer node and smaller.
U.S. officials have reached out to allies to lobby them to enact similar policies so that foreign companies would not be able to sell technology to China that American firms would be barred from shipping, two of the sources said.
“Coordination with allies is key to maximizing effectiveness and minimizing unintended consequences,"" Clete Willems, a former Trump administration trade official said. ""This should favor broader regulations that others can replicate instead of one-off 'is informed' letters.""

Sept 12 (Reuters) - Micron Technology Inc MU.O, the biggest U.S. memory chip company, on Monday will break ground for a $15 billion factory in Boise, Idaho, and its chief executive told Reuters an announcement of another new U.S. plant will be coming soon.
“We are in final stages of another high volume manufacturing site that is going to be announced in the coming weeks,” CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said.
Both plants will produce DRAM chips that are widely used in data centers, personal computers and other devices. Once operational, U.S. plants will account for 40% of Micron’s DRAM production volume globally, up from 10% today, Mehrotra said. The Boise factory will be operational in 2025, he said.
Micron said this will be the first new memory chip factory built in the United States in 20 years, and will create 2,000 Micron jobs by the end of the decade.
Since U.S. President Joe Biden signed the Chips and Science Act, which provides $52 billion to support home grown semiconductor manufacturing, a slew of companies have announced plans to make chips in the United States.
Intel Corp INTC.O on Friday broke ground on a $20 billion factory in Ohio to build cutting edge processor chips.
While Micron once made chips in Boise where it got its start, volume manufacturing has moved away and it has big production centers in places like Japan, Taiwan and Singapore.
The company's core research and development operation has remained in Boise. Having manufacturing and R&D together will help accelerate the time to market, the CEO said.
Mehrotra said the U.S. investments do not represent a move away from Asian countries.
“This is not about divesting from manufacturing in any other part of the world, or bringing back manufacturing. This is about increasing,” he said.
“To meet the growing demand for memory, we have to increase our production,"" he said, adding that the ""Chips and Science bill enables it to be increased here in the U.S.”
Micron has previously said it will be investing $150 billion through the decade, $40 billion of that in the United States. Mehrotra said that includes funds for research and development, the cost of which is increasing with advanced technologies.

KLA, Applied Materials and Nvidia declined to comment while Lam did not respond to requests for comment. AMD did not comment on the specific policy move but reaffirmed it does not foresee a ""material impact"" from its new licensing requirement.
'CHOKE POINT'
The planned action comes as the President Joe Biden's administration has sought to thwart China's advances by targeting technologies where the United States still maintains dominance.
""The strategy is to choke off China and they have discovered that chips are a choke point. They can't make this stuff, they can't make the manufacturing equipment,"" said Jim Lewis a technology expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""That will change.""
In an update on China-related measures last week, the Chamber of Commerce, a U.S. business lobbying group, warned members of imminent restrictions on AI chips and chipmaking tools.
""We are now hearing that members should expect a series of rules or perhaps an overarching rule prior to the mid-term election to codify the guidance in recently issued (Commerce Department) 'is-informed' letters to chip equipment and chip design companies,"" the chamber said.
The group also said the agency plans to add additional Chinese supercomputing entities to a trade blacklist.
Reuters was first to report in July that the Biden administration was actively discussing banning exports of chipmaking tools to Chinese factories that make advanced semiconductors at the 14 nanometer node and smaller.
U.S. officials have reached out to allies to lobby them to enact similar policies so that foreign companies would not be able to sell technology to China that American firms would be barred from shipping, two of the sources said.
“Coordination with allies is key to maximizing effectiveness and minimizing unintended consequences,"" Clete Willems, a former Trump administration trade official said. ""This should favor broader regulations that others can replicate instead of one-off 'is informed' letters.""

2022-09-10 00:00:00+00:00,Where Will Nvidia Be in 5 Years?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-will-nvidia-be-in-5-years-0,,,"The bad news just doesn't seem to be stopping for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The graphics cards specialist received another big blow last week after the U.S. government imposed restrictions on sales of data center chips to China, Hong Kong, and Russia.
According to a filing with the SEC, Nvidia reported that the U.S. government has ""imposed a new license requirement, effective immediately, for any future export to China (including Hong Kong) and Russia of the Company's A100 and forthcoming H100 integrated circuits."" The restrictions will also apply to future Nvidia products that match or exceed the performance of its A100 chips, as well as systems powered by such chips.
Nvidia stock cratered on the news, as China is reportedly a big market for the company. The tech giant slashed its fiscal third-quarter revenue guidance by $400 million thanks to the restrictions. The company was anticipating $5.9 billion in revenue in the current quarter, pointing toward a big drop over the prior-year period thanks to the weakness in the gaming segment.
The data center business was one of the bright spots for the company, with year-over-year growth of 61% to $3.8 billion. But the restrictions could knock the wind out of the data center business' growth.
In all, it is a difficult time to be an Nvidia investor. The stock is down 53% in 2022 and could head lower as the company is contending with multiple headwinds. But investors shouldn't forget that Nvidia stock has appreciated 220% in the past five years despite bouts of volatility and has handsomely beaten the broader stock market.
NVDA data by YCharts
That's why it may be a good idea for savvy investors to look into the future and see where Nvidia may be after five years, as this could help them decide whether to buy this tech stock while it is beaten down.
The data center business could explode over the next five years
The gaming and the data center businesses will continue to be the pillars of Nvidia's growth over the next five years. However, the company is exploring new areas within these niches that could supercharge its growth.
Nvidia is known for its data center graphics cards but is now making progress in data processing units (DPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) as well -- two areas that could unlock a massive growth opportunity for the company.
Nvidia is expected to start sampling its third generation of DPUs, the BlueField-3, this year to tackle artificial intelligence and analytics workloads. These are programmable networking devices that offer a mix of general-purpose computing along with accelerators to speed up tasks. The DPUs also reduce the load of a server CPU by taking on networking and storage functions, thereby improving the efficiency of server processors.
What's more, Nvidia is already working on its fourth generation of data center DPUs that are expected to be released next year.
It is not surprising to see why Nvidia is looking to establish its dominance in the DPU market. CEO Jensen Huang believes that DPUs are likely to be deployed within every data center in the world by 2026 to accelerate workloads.
Meanwhile, Nvidia is preparing to take a chunk out of the lucrative server processor market as well. The first servers powered by Nvidia's Grace data center CPUs are set to hit the market in the first half of 2023. Nvidia hasn't tapped the server processor market so far, a space that's dominated by the likes of AMD and Intel. That's why the company's move into this market could be a big deal, especially considering that the server processor market is expected to generate $42 billion in revenue in the long run.
The overall data center accelerator market is expected to clock annual growth of nearly 39% through 2027, hitting nearly $70 billion in revenue at the end of the forecast period. So Nvidia could see itself in a stronger position to tap into this huge opportunity over the next five years with a broader product portfolio.
An emerging catalyst that investors shouldn't miss
Nvidia's gaming business is in a tight spot right now thanks to an oversupply of graphics cards. However, the company is taking steps to reduce its dependence on gaming-related hardware with the help of cloud gaming.
The cloud gaming business is expected to generate $22 billion in revenue by 2030, growing at an annual rate of 57% through 2030. The market's impressive growth will be driven by fast internet speeds and lower costs as compared to purchasing gaming titles and hardware, as well as a growing selection of titles that gamers could stream to their devices. Nvidia is already in a terrific position to take advantage of cloud gaming, as it has built a solid user base with its GeForce Now service.
The chipmaker had generated $12.5 billion in revenue from the video gaming business in fiscal 2022. This means the potential size of the cloud gaming business in the long run and Nvidia's estimated revenue share of 60% in this market suggest that this emerging segment could move the needle in a bigger way for the company in five years.
All this indicates that investors may want to keep a close eye on Nvidia and consider going long if the short-term weakness sends the stock price lower, especially considering that analysts are still upbeat about its long-term prospects and expect 22% annual earnings growth for the next five years.

2022-09-10 00:00:00+00:00,Should You Buy the Dow Jones' 3 Worst-Performing 2022 Stocks?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-the-dow-jones-3-worst-performing-2022-stocks-2,,,"As you probably know, the stock market has been rather weak in 2022 so far, with most major averages down significantly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is no exception. As of Sept. 8, the benchmark index has fallen by 13% year to date.
And keep in mind that this is the overall index's decline, and there are 30 stocks that make up the Dow. Some of them have performed much worse.
Let's get right to it. Through the first week of September, here are the three worst-performing stocks out of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average:
COMPANY (SYMBOL)
INDUSTRY
TOTAL RETURN YEAR-TO-DATE
Nike (NYSE: NKE)
Apparel
(35.6%)
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)
Semiconductors
(39.7%)
Salesforce (NYSE: CRM)
Software
(40.1%)
Data source: yCharts. Returns through 9/7/2022 midday, and parenthesis indicate negative numbers.
Why have these stocks performed so badly?
All three of these companies are down for a reason. Sure, overall stock market weakness certainly had something to do with it (especially with tech companies Intel and Salesforce), but there are company-specific headwinds in all three cases.
Nike, which until recently was the worst-performing stock in the Dow, saw the worst of its decline after its fiscal fourth quarter earnings report was released in June. Despite beating expectations on both the top and bottom lines, Nike's management cautioned investors that gross margins are expected to decline in the 2023 fiscal year.
Intel's recent results missed expectations for revenue, and not just by a little bit. Analysts were calling for $17.9 billion in the second quarter, but the company posted a 22% year-over-year decline to $15.3 billion. Plus, Intel reported a net loss, while analysts had been looking for a profit. And just like many other companies, Intel lowered its future outlook, specifically citing supply chain challenges.
Salesforce also recently lowered its full-year guidance (you may be seeing a pattern develop here). In short, the company is worried that its customers might become cautious when it comes to investing in new software products for their businesses. Plus, four out of the five divisions of its subscriptions and services business reported slowing growth in the latest quarter.
Are these stocks a buy now?
First of all, it's worth pointing out that it's not a good idea to buy any stock simply because the price went down. Sure, it's better to pay less than more, all other factors being equal, but it's important to distinguish between a bargain and a company facing long-term problems.
By being included in the Dow, it's safe to assume that these are relatively mature and stable businesses that are among the leaders in their respective industries. And that's definitely the case here. Salesforce is the market leader in CRM software, Intel is the largest company in its chipmaking business, and Nike is the athletic apparel leader. The question is whether the headwinds that have caused these stocks to become so beaten down are short-term issues or long-term problems. For example, Salesforce recently lowered its forward guidance and expects businesses to pump the brakes on spending in the face of economic uncertainty, but at some point, the rising-rate and inflationary environment will come to an end. On the other hand, Intel is facing tough competition from rivals, and if it starts losing serious market share, it could be a thesis buster.
The point is that after doing some digging, you're confident that these businesses will remain strong for years to come, then buying at these lower share prices could be a smart move. But it's important to keep in mind that all three of these are down for good reasons, and investors should expect quite a roller coaster ride as the current market uncertainty plays out.

2022-09-09 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia and Semiconductor Stocks Keep Going Up,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-and-semiconductor-stocks-keep-going-up,,,"What happened
All week long, trading in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been strong. After opening lower following the long holiday weekend, shares of the semiconductors-for-gaming leader have notched three straight days of stock price gains -- including this morning, with Nvidia stock up 2.2% through 10:30 a.m. ET.
You can probably thank sustained buying by Cathie Wood for that. But at the same time that Nvidia shares are bouncing back, so too are shares of rival semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT). Intel stock is up 1.8% right now, and Applied Materials is gaining 2.6%.
So what
As revealed on the ARK website late last night, the growth investing icon spent probably $3.6 million or so scooping up some 25,400 shares of Nvidia yesterday. And granted, those shares represent relative drops in the buckets of the $1.2 billion ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKQ) and the $1.5 billion ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKW) funds that made the investments. But across the several ARK funds that have been snapping up Nvidia shares since late last week, it appears that Wood has been doing a lot more shopping than that, spending in excess of $50 million to acquire more than 375,000 shares of Nvidia.
And that's a lot more significant.
It's not just Wood buying, either. This morning, The Fly reported that investment bank Evercore ISI has put out a note calling Nvidia shares ""extremely attractive"" at $135 per share. And perhaps not coincidentally, $135 was right around the price at which Wood began buying last week!
Granted, there are still worries about Nvidia's China business, given new requirements to obtain export licenses to sell certain data center chips to China. But Evercore thinks there's a good chance Nvidia can obtain the necessary licenses, and even if it can't, that ""alternative product offerings"" could offset any data center business lost in China.
Now what
Well and good. That explains why Nvidia stock has been marching higher this week -- but what about Intel and Applied Materials?
Well, Intel has some good news of its own today, announcing this morning that it has just ""broken ground"" on two new semiconductor manufacturing plants in Ohio, the first step toward investing $20 billion in new production in the state.
As for Applied Materials, well, it stands to reason that what's good news for Applied Materials' customers (and according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Applied Materials counts both Intel and Nvidia's contract manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company among its clients) is good news for Applied Materials itself. But there's further good news in the form of a report earlier in the week from the Semiconductor Industry Association, which reported that global semiconductor sales -- while slowing -- still grew 7.3% year over year in July, including 20.9% growth in the Americas, 15.2% growth in Europe, and 13.1% growth in Japan.
Long story short, rumors of the semiconductor industry's demise may have been exaggerated -- and even if things are slowing down a bit, that risk is arguably already reflected in the share prices of Applied Materials (now selling for just 12.2 times trailing earnings) and certainly of Intel (at 6.5 times earnings). Of the three, Nvidia stock still seems riskiest at a 44 P/E ratio.
But with Nvidia stock already down 38% over the past year, even that high price is starting to tempt investors back.

2022-09-09 00:00:00+00:00,Biden visit to Intel semiconductor plant to test his appeal in heavily Republican Ohio,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biden-visit-to-intel-semiconductor-plant-to-test-his-appeal-in-heavily-republican-ohio,,,"By Steve Holland and Trevor Hunnicutt
WASHINGTON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden is making an election-year visit to an overwhelmingly Republican part of Ohio Friday for the groundbreaking of a semiconductor plant that he will promote as evidence his economic policies are working.
Biden travels to Licking County near Columbus, Ohio, to speak at the site of Intel Corp's INTC.O new $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing facility.
The trip is part of a White House pre-midterms push to tout new funding for manufacturing and infrastructure Biden's Democratic Party pushed through Congress, while decrying opposition Republicans backed by former President Donald Trump as dangerous extremists.
Previous trips to Maryland, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have landed the president in areas where Democrats already have strong support, but Licking County voted Republican 63% to 35% in the 2020 presidential election.
OHIO IN PLAY?
Democrats have lost Ohio in the past two presidential contests, but Republican Senator Rob Portman's retirement may give Democrats a chance to pick up a Senate seat.
Some recent forecasts show Democrats favored to maintain control of the Senate, after a series of wins in Congress. But not all candidates welcome Biden's campaigning support.
Representative Tim Ryan is running against Republican J.D. Vance, a venture capitalist and author of the book, ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" who has Trump's backing.
Asked Thursday if Biden should seek a second term, Ryan told Youngstown, Ohio, network WFMJ, ""My hunch is that we need new leadership across the board - Democrats, Republicans, I think it’s time for a generational move.""
Ryan has not asked Biden to campaign with him in the state, and has broken with the president on some issues.
Trump’s political organization announced on Monday that Trump will appear at a rally for Vance in Youngstown, Ohio, on Sept. 17.
CHIPS ACT PROJECTS
Intel backed the Ohio project in anticipation of the passage of the Chips and Science Act, a funding law that Biden signed last month after some Republicans joined Democrats to support it, the White House says.
The Chips act is aimed at jumpstarting the domestic production of semiconductors in response to supply-chain disruptions that have slowed the production of automobiles.
A string of other companies have announced new semiconductor plants resulting from passage of the Chips act, which authorized about $52 billion in government subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production and research, and an investment tax credit for chip plants estimated to be worth $24 billion.
During Biden's visit, Intel will announce it has distributed $17.7 million to Ohio colleges and universities to develop semiconductor-focused education and workforce programs, part of a $50 million education and research investment in the state.
The Intel facility will contain at least two fabricating plants that the White House said will be built by union labor, creating more than 7,000 construction jobs and 3,000 full-time jobs producing cutting-edge chips.

2022-09-09 00:00:00+00:00,Biden visit to Intel semiconductor plant to test his appeal in deep-red Ohio,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biden-visit-to-intel-semiconductor-plant-to-test-his-appeal-in-deep-red-ohio,,,"By Steve Holland
WASHINGTON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden will make an election-year visit to an overwhelmingly Republican part of Ohio on Friday for the groundbreaking of a semiconductor plant that he will promote as evidence that his economic policies are working.
Biden will travel to Licking County, near Columbus, Ohio, to speak at the site of Intel's new $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing facility.
The trip is part of a White House pre-midterms push to tout new funding for manufacturing and infrastructure Biden's Democratic Party pushed through Congress, while decrying opposition Republicans backed by former President Donald Trump as dangerous extremists.
Previous trips to Maryland, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have landed the president in areas where Democrats already have strong support, but Licking County voted Republican 63% to 35% in the 2020 presidential election.
OHIO IN PLAY?
Democrats have lost Ohio in the past two presidential contests, but Republican Senator Rob Portman retirement may give Democrats a chance to pick up a Senate seat.
Representative Tim Ryan is running against Republican J.D. Vance, a venture capitalist and author of the book, ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" who has the backing of former Republican President Donald Trump.
Trump’s political organization announced on Monday that Trump will appear at a rally for Vance in Youngstown, Ohio, on Sept. 17.
Intel backed the Ohio project in anticipation of the passage of the Chips and Science Act, a funding law that Biden signed last month after some Republicans join Democrats to support it, the White House says.
The Chips act is aimed at jumpstarting the domestic production of semiconductors in response to supply-chain disruptions that have slowed the production of automobiles.
A string of other companies have announced new semiconductor plants emanating from passage of the Chips act, which authorized about $52 billion in government subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production and research, and an investment tax credit for chip plants estimated to be worth $24 billion.
During Biden's visit, Intel will announce it has distributed $17.7 million to Ohio colleges and universities to develop semiconductor-focused education and workforce programs, part of a $50 million education and research investment in the state.
The Intel facility will contain at least two fabricating plants that the White House said will be built by union labor, creating more than 7,000 construction jobs and 3,000 full-time jobs producing cutting edge chips.

2022-09-08 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting INTC Put And Call Options For October 28th,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-intc-put-and-call-options-for-october-28th,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the October 28th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new October 28th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $30.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.34. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $30.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $28.66 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $30.77/share today.
Because the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.47% return on the cash commitment, or 32.61% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $30.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $31.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.64. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $30.77/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $31.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.08% if the stock gets called away at the October 28th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $31.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $31.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.33% boost of extra return to the investor, or 38.91% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the call contract example above is 42%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $30.77) to be 35%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-09-08 00:00:00+00:00,Better Semiconductor Stock: AMD vs. Nvidia,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-semiconductor-stock%3A-amd-vs.-nvidia,,,"Last November, I compared Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and declared that the latter's stronger gaming and data center GPU sales made it a more promising investment than the former. However, Nvidia's stock has declined almost 60% since I wrote that article. AMD stock fared slightly better but was still nearly cut in half.
Both semiconductor stocks were crushed by the post-pandemic slowdown in PC sales and rising interest rates, which drove investors away from higher-growth tech stocks. Plunging cryptocurrency prices exacerbated the pain as frustrated miners gave up and flooded the market with second-hand GPUs.
Image source: Getty Images.
I clearly underestimated those headwinds last year, but could either of these battered stocks bounce back over the next few quarters? Let's take a fresh look at both chipmakers and see if either stock is worth buying today.
What happened to AMD?
AMD generates most of its revenue from x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs, but it remains the underdog in both markets. It controls 35% of the x86 CPU market, according to PassMark, while Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) holds the remaining 65%. AMD holds a 20% share in the discrete GPU market, according to JPR, while Nvidia still dominates 79% of the market.
Throughout most of AMD's history, it relied on selling cheaper CPUs and GPUs to keep pace with Intel and Nvidia. But under CEO Lisa Su, who took the helm in 2014, AMD started to pull ahead of Intel with smaller, denser, and more power-efficient CPUs. It accomplished this by outsourcing its manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the world's most advanced contract chipmaker, instead of producing them with capital-intensive internal foundries like Intel.
AMD has roughly doubled its market share in CPUs against Intel over the past six years, but it hasn't made meaningful progress in the GPU market against Nvidia, which has repeatedly launched cheaper GeForce cards to keep pace with AMD's Radeon cards in the lower-end gaming market. AMD also carved out a niche by selling custom APUs, which merge together a CPU and GPU, for Microsoft's Xboxes and Sony's PlayStations.
In 2021, AMD's revenue soared 68% to $16.4 billion, its adjusted gross margin expanded 370 basis points to 48.3%, and its adjusted earnings more than doubled. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to grow another 60% and 57%, respectively, this year. But in 2023, they expect AMD's revenue and adjusted earnings to only rise 13% and 12%, respectively, as the PC market cools off. A resurgent Intel, which has been aggressively upgrading its plants to produce more advanced CPUs, could also stir up more competitive headwinds over the next few years.
What happened to Nvidia?
Nvidia generates most of its revenue from gaming and data center GPUs. Both markets fired on all cylinders throughout the pandemic. Its sales of gaming GPUs surged as people stayed at home, played more PC games, and mined more cryptocurrencies. The elevated usage of cloud-based services also boosted sales of its data center GPUs, which are mainly used to process advanced machine learning and AI tasks.
Like AMD, Nvidia outsources the production of its GPUs to leading foundries like TSMC and Samsung. Under its founder and longtime CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia repeatedly held AMD at bay with its more power-efficient chips. AMD's top-tier cards come close to matching Nvidia's in terms of graphical performance, but they generally consume a lot more power.
Nvidia's revenue soared 61% to $26.9 billion in fiscal 2022, which ended this January, as its adjusted gross margin expanded from 65.6% to 66.8%. It usually operates at higher margins than AMD because it sells pricier GPUs and isn't encumbered by AMD's lower-margin CPU and APU sales. Its adjusted earnings jumped 78% for the full year.
But just like AMD, Nvidia faces a near-term slowdown as the PC market cools off. Analysts expect its revenue to rise just 3% this year as its adjusted earnings tumble 24%. Nvidia faces a much rougher landing than AMD because it's much more dependent on the cyclical gaming market, which generated 38% of its revenue in the first half of fiscal 2023. Some of those gaming GPUs are also tethered to the sluggish crypto mining market.
To make matters worse, U.S. regulators recently ordered Nvidia to stop selling its most advanced data center GPUs to China. That ban could reduce Nvidia's revenue by up to $400 million in the current quarter. AMD, which doesn't generate much revenue from high-end data center GPUs, doesn't expect that ban to have a material impact on its business.
The valuations and verdict
AMD's forward price-to-earnings ratio has cooled off to 16, but Nvidia still trades at 40 times forward earnings. AMD also trades at just five times this year's sales, while Nvidia still trades at 12 times this year's sales.
AMD's lower valuations, broader diversification, and softer post-pandemic landing all make it a more compelling buy than Nvidia right now. Nvidia is a solid stock, but it won't be a bargain until its valuations cool off to more sustainable levels.
