2022-07-05 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) Outpaces Stock Market Gains: What You Should Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-outpaces-stock-market-gains%3A-what-you-should-know-3,,,"Intel (INTC) closed the most recent trading day at $36.69, moving +0.96% from the previous trading session. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.16%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.42%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.49%.
Coming into today, shares of the world's largest chipmaker had lost 16.15% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 8.85%, while the S&P 500 lost 6.79%.
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Intel as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Intel to post earnings of $0.74 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 42.19%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $17.98 billion, down 8.41% from the prior-year quarter.
For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $3.48 per share and revenue of $75.43 billion, which would represent changes of -36.38% and -3.33%, respectively, from the prior year.
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Intel. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 1.22% lower. Intel is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).
Digging into valuation, Intel currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 10.43. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 9.12, which means Intel is trading at a premium to the group.
Investors should also note that INTC has a PEG ratio of 1.39 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Semiconductor - General stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.79 based on yesterday's closing prices.
The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 157, which puts it in the bottom 38% of all 250+ industries.
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

2022-07-05 00:00:00+00:00,ASML shares fall on report US wants to restrict sales to China,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/asml-shares-fall-on-report-us-wants-to-restrict-sales-to-china-0,,,"Adds ASML comment, context
AMSTERDAM, July 5 (Reuters) - Shares in ASML Holding ASML.AS, a key supplier of equipment to semiconductor makers, fell on Tuesday following a Bloomberg News report that the U.S. government wants to restrict the company from selling equipment to China.
ASML has already been unable to ship its most advanced tools to China, but the report said Washington would also restrict the sale of slightly older machines, citing ""people familiar with the matter.""
A spokesperson for ASML said the company was unaware of any policy change.
""The discussion is not new,"" the spokesperson said. ""No decisions have been made, and we do not want to speculate or comment on rumours.""
ASML's U.S. shares sank 7.2% in the wake of the report.
Other chip gear makers also lost ground, with Lam Research LRCX.O off 3.6% and Applied Materials AMAT.O losing 2.4%.
China is ASML's third largest market, after Taiwan and South Korea, representing around 16% of 2021 sales, or 2.1 billion euros.
ASML has a near monopoly on the manufacture of lithography systems, machines vital for chipmakers such as Intel INTC.O, TSMC and Samsung. Lithography systems cost hundreds of millions of dollars apiece and use focused beams of light to create the circuitry of computer chips.
Lithography and other semiconductor manufacturing equipment require an export license, as computer chips are considered ""dual use"" technology, with military as well as commercial applications.
Since 2019, the Dutch government, in agreement with the U.S., has not granted a license for ASML to sell its most advanced machines, which use ""extreme ultraviolet,"" or EUV, light waves, to Chinese chipmakers.
ASML still sells ""deep ultraviolet,"" or DUV, machines, to Chinese customers.
The majority of chips worldwide are manufactured with DUV lithography. Restricting their sale to China would be highly damaging for China's chip industry and would likely worsen a global semiconductor shortage.
In 2021, the U.S. National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence -- led by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt -- recommended that the U.S. Departments of State and Commerce should push allies to deny China access to top DUV, EUV and related tools.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO), Intel Corp. (INTC), and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
 
You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>
Novo Nordisk shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+32.6% vs. +20.1%) on the back of the company’s promising diabetes drug, Ozempic. The Zacks analyst has described the Rybelsus launch as further strengthening Novo Nordisk's best-in-class diabetes portfolio.
Ozempic, Rybelsus, Xultophy and Saxenda have been helping the company maintain momentum. Label expansion of these existing drugs is expected to boost sales.
However, lower realized prices in the U.S., loss of exclusivity for products and stiff competition are affecting sales totals. Patent expiration on some of the products in Novo Nordisk’s portfolio is a concern. Sales continue to be negatively impacted by the Covid pandemic. Supply challenges for Wegovy have also hurt the stock.
(You can read the full research report on Novo Nordisk here >>>)
Intel shares have declined -28.3% year to date versus the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry’s decline of -41.6%. The chip-making major reaffirmed its earlier guidance for 2022 despite short-term headwinds, as it expects demand to pick up in the second half of the year.
The company is riding on prospects of the Internet of Things and Mobileye businesses. Mobileye growth should be driven by design wins amid a recovering auto industry. Recovery in the enterprise business of the data center segment is a positive. Intel is developing more integrated solutions that will likely be competitive on a cost-per-watt basis while offering customized solutions for bigger firms.

(You can read the full research report on Intel here >>>)
Qualcomm shares have declined -10.9% over the past year against the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry’s decline of -16.7%. The company faces intense competition from low-cost chip manufacturers. High research and development costs are expected to dent margins, while the global chip shortage due to supply-chain disruptions is a headwind. It is susceptible to risks arising from lower handset shipments, especially in China.
However, Qualcomm is focused on retaining its leadership in 5G and the chipset market, delivering low-power resilient multi-gigabit connectivity with best-in-class security. It is witnessing healthy traction in EDGE networking solutions across diverse sectors.
The buyout of Arriver will bolster its ability to deliver fully integrated Advanced Driver Assistance System solutions to automakers. The company is well-positioned to benefit from solid 5G traction with greater visibility and diversified businesses to meet its long-term revenue targets.

2022-07-05 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Becomes Oversold,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-becomes-oversold-0,,,"The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) presently has a stellar rank, in the top 10% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.
But making Intel Corp an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Tuesday, shares of INTC entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $35.54 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Intel Corp, the RSI reading has hit 29.5 — by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel currently has an average RSI of 42.9. A falling stock price — all else being equal — creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, INTC's recent annualized dividend of 1.46/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 4.02% based upon the recent $36.34 share price.
A bullish investor could look at INTC's 29.5 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on INTC is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

Benjamin Graham Stock Ideas
About Benjamin Graham: The late Benjamin Graham may be the oldest of the gurus we follow, but his impact on the investing world has lasted for decades after his death in 1976. Known as both the ""Father of Value Investing"" and the founder of the entire field of security analysis, Graham mentored several of history's greatest investors -- including Warren Buffett -- and inspired a slew of others, including John Templeton, Mario Gabelli, and another of Validea's gurus, John Neff. Graham built his fortune and reputation after living through some extremely difficult times, including both the Great Depression and his own family's financial woes following his father's death when Benjamin was a young man. His investment firm posted per annum returns of about 20 percent from 1936 to 1956, far outpacing the 12.2 percent average return for the market during that time.

2022-07-02 00:00:00+00:00,How Many of Your Stocks Are Based in California? (And Is That a Bad Thing?),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-many-of-your-stocks-are-based-in-california-and-is-that-a-bad-thing,,,"Here's an idea: Go through your portfolio and look up where are all your stocks are based. If it's tech heavy like mine, one state is going to pop up over and over again: California.
In my own portfolio that includes names like Apple, The Trade Desk, Intuitive Surgical, Airbnb, Roku, Doximity, Unity Software, PayPal, Disney, and many more. About half of the stocks in my portfolio are in companies headquartered in California.
Why are so many of my stocks based in one state? And is this a problem that needs fixing? Let's take a look.
Image source: Getty Images.
California is home to the VC industry and Silicon Valley
It's obvious why Disney makes California its home -- Hollywood is famous for its film production. And so it makes sense for a major film studio to be located there. It's perhaps less obvious why so many tech companies are based in California. I think perhaps it's related to California's other major industry: venture capital. Tech startups need seed capital, so if you want to create a new company, you might go where the money is.
Silicon Valley is based in California, too. Back in the 1940s and 1950s, the dean of Stanford's engineering department, Frederick Terman, encouraged his faculty to start their own companies in the area. Hewlett Packard got its start this way. Silicon Valley is where the computer chip was invented. Two major VC firms, Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital, started up adjacent to the Stanford campus.
This is why today so many tech companies are based in the area. Hewlett Packard was started in Palo Alto. Intel was created in Santa Clara. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Alphabet (parent of Google), were students at Stanford. Mark Zuckerberg, who was a student at Harvard, co-founded his company Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) in Menlo Park.
If you're a tech investor, you've probably heard of tiny cities in California like Sunnyvale, Redwood City, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Cupertino. These are all located in Silicon Valley. Sunnyvale is the birthplace of Atari and the video game industry.
Technology often requires collaboration. So it's natural for hubs to develop. Over many decades, Silicon Valley has become a critical hub for tech companies and a major location for companies working in computer software, hardware, the internet, and blockchain technology.
Is too many Cali stocks a bad thing?
One of the dangers in investing is lack of diversity. So it might be a risk if your portfolio has too many tech stocks. And there is a risk in geographical concentration as well. For instance, suppose a major earthquake hits California. That could do a lot of damage. It's estimated that a quake in or around San Jose might cost more than $1 billion in repair and replacements.
Another problem is politics. California is largely a one-party state, ruled by Democrats. Some people on the left are hostile to large corporations and believe they should be highly regulated and taxed. So while there are certainly benefits for tech companies operating in California, there might also be headwinds. Recently two large companies, Tesla and Charles Schwab, have moved their headquarters from California to Texas.
Other companies, like Coinbase and Block, have recently gone from having their headquarters in California to having ""no headquarters."" Coinbase abandoned San Francisco and decided its business is now ""wholly remote."" Block is doing the same. Twilio is closing its San Francisco office as it transitions to a ""remote-first"" environment. PayPal is also closing its San Francisco location.
Some of this may be specific to San Francisco and reports of rising crime and homelessness in the city. For investors, this is largely a nonissue. Companies can and will move if it becomes necessary. And the rise of remote work is arguably making the location of a company's headquarters largely irrelevant.
The value of diversity
I think it's important for investors to consider diversity when making investments. In particular, I think it's important to have investments in several different market verticals. If all you own are tech stocks, your portfolio can take a massive hit in any ""tech wreck"" in the stock market. So it's a good idea to own some healthcare or financials or other types of businesses.
Geographic diversity is important, too. It might be a good idea to think hard about the political situation. For instance, I avoid investing in stocks based in mainland China because that country is ruled by autocratic dictators.
In the U.S., the political climate is much less relevant. If a particular state becomes unfriendly to a company, the business can fairly easily pick up and move to another state. And with remote work, we are seeing more and more decentralization. So while many of my stocks are based in California, for now I think the positives outweigh the negatives. So I think any danger from having too many stocks based in California is remote (in part because many tech companies are now remote).

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been put through the wringer. Despite a recent bounce, AMD stock is still down 49% so far this year. While the stock was hitting new highs late last year, it’s been almost all downhill since.
At this point, it’s not necessary to point out that other tech stocks (and the overall market) have suffered as well. More specific to AMD’s peers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Taiwan Semi (NYSE:TSM) and others have fallen considerably.
Statistically, this year’s action has been an anomaly in the stock market. Not only are down years uncommon for the S&P 500, but the significant declines we’ve seen so far this year are in rare company.
That has slammed AMD stock lower, and although that’s painful for investors who already own the stock, it creates an opportunity for buyers.

AMD’s Turnaround
Too many investors are lazy when it comes to assessing AMD. I know that may sound harsh, but it’s the truth. They’ll look at the stock price from 2016 at sub-$2 prices, look at the 52-week high at $164.42 and simply conclude that “it’s a bubble.” Granted, an 81-fold move does raise an eyebrow. However, there’s a lot more going on here.
At year-end 2015, AMD had ~$4 billion in revenue, gross margin of 27% and net margin of negative 16.2%. That was alongside total long-term debt of $2.23 billion, a free cash flow deficit of $322 million and a net loss of $660 million.
No wonder shares were trading at less than $2 and AMD had a market cap of $2.27 billion.
Fast-forward six years to the year-end 2021.
Revenue: $16.4 billion
Gross margin: 48.25%
Net margin: 19.24%
Total debt: $313 million
Free cash flow: $3.2 billion
Net income: $3.16 billion
Some of these figures are fluctuating or will fluctuate due to the company’s acquisition of Xilinx. On its own, Xilinx was free-cash-flowing $1 billion a year and was a value-add acquisition for AMD.
AMD bears can nitpick certain details of the situation, but the reality is that CEO Lisa Su & Co. have done a fantastic job at turning this company around.
AMD Stock Is Becoming a Bargain
At $160-plus, it was easy to argue that AMD stock had momentum, but hard to argue that it had value. When the stock was trading at its all-time high on Nov. 30, consensus estimates called for earnings of $3.32 a share.
I think it’s worth pointing out that those estimates have only gone up between now and then, despite a bear market in tech and a halving in AMD’s stock price. However, at the high shares were trading for almost 50x 2022 earnings. Looking at the stock now, it trades at 20x 2022 earnings estimates.
The reason for the stunning valuation drop is two-fold: The share price has come tumbling lower, but also, estimates have climbed from $3.32 a share up to $4.34 a share. That’s more than a 30% increase in earnings expectations!

Analysts expect revenue of $26.2 billion this year, a big 60% boost from 2021 thanks to the Xilinx deal. But revenue is still forecast to grow ~15% a year through 2025, all while analysts have been way too conservative with AMD’s growth.
Earnings are in a similar situation too. Forecasts call for profit of $4.34 a share in 2022 and profit of $6.90 a share in 2025. If AMD were to stay at the same valuation of 20 times earnings and earning $6.90 a share in 2025, we’re talking about a share price of $138, or a 63% increase in 30 to 36 months.
Where to Buy AMD Stock

I already feel that AMD stock is at a level that warrants an accumulation strategy — such as a dollar-cost-average (DCA) approach.
However, just because I — or anyone for that matter — believes that a stock is trading at a reasonable price, doesn’t mean it can’t or won’t continue to be sold. If investors are trying to time AMD stock for a potentially better cost basis, there are a couple levels that really stand out to me.
The first is the $73 to $75 area, which was strong support when AMD was trapped between $75 and $100. AMD eventually broke out over $100 and this area was support until the second quarter of 2022. Now the stock is sitting in this prior range support level.
If it continues even lower, the 200-week moving average and the 78.6% retracement are on my radar as potential “add spots.”
As much as I like AMD stock (and for that matter, Nvidia too), there’s no denying that these stocks are in downtrends at the moment. Should they break down further, opportunistic investors now have the key levels to watch.

2022-07-01 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) Shares Cross 4% Yield Mark,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-shares-cross-4-yield-mark,,,"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, in trading on Friday, shares of Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) were yielding above the 4% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.46), with the stock changing hands as low as $35.88 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) back on 12/31/1999 — you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 4% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.
In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Intel Corp, looking at the history chart for INTC below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 4% annual yield.

2022-07-01 00:00:00+00:00,Why Advanced Micro Devices Stock Dropped This Week,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-advanced-micro-devices-stock-dropped-this-week,,,"What happened
Week to date, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are down 16.5% as of 10:38 a.m. ET on Friday, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
One analyst issued a bullish forecast for AMD on Thursday, but that was overshadowed by a disappointing earnings report from Micron Technology that weighed on semiconductor stocks toward the end of the week.
So what
Micron is a leading supplier of memory and storage chips and announced a record quarter. However, the company said it would pull back on expanding capacity to account for the declining demand trends in the consumer PC market.
AMD has been doing well in the enterprise market, taking market share away from Intel in server chips. But investors are selling ahead of the expectation that the economy is heading into a recession. However, this is sending AMD stock down to a bargain valuation relative to its long-term growth opportunities.
Now what
In its last earnings report, issued in May, AMD said it expects full-year revenue to grow approximately 60% year over year. This is partly driven by the additional revenue from the Xilinx acquisition completed in the first quarter, which positions AMD for growth in new markets, such as connected devices, artificial intelligence applications, and robotics.
Analyst Gus Richard at Northland Capital Markets issued a positive note on AMD on Thursday, noting that the company is well positioned to have a relatively good year in 2023 due to its competitive position in the server market.
Fears of slowing growth in the near term give investors a great buying opportunity. AMD shares now trade at an attractive valuation of 16.7 times this year's earnings estimates. This is a big discount compared to the level the shares were at a year ago, when investors were thinking about the company's long-term prospects instead of worrying about the near-term economic trends.

June 30 (Reuters) - Short video app Triller Inc has confidentially filed paperwork for an initial public offering of its class A common stock with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said on Thursday.
The proposed offering comes at a turbulent time for the IPO market with several listings on ice as a selloff in high-growth tech stocks and volatility in the capital markets has soured investor sentiment.
The tepid reception for recent listings underlines the challenges facing IPO-bound companies, including, social media platform Reddit, and Mobileye, the self-driving car unit of Intel Corp INTC.O.
Earlier this month, Triller ended its $5 billion merger with video advertising software provider SeaChange International Inc SEAC.O and said it would pursue an IPO instead, with a potential listing under the ticker symbol ""ILLR"" by September.
Dealmaking was among Wall Street's hottest investment trends during the pandemic. However, the year has seen several companies shelve plans as heightened regulatory scrutiny and falling valuations dampen interest.
The company, which was launched in 2015, has looked to take on larger rival TikTok, and offers similar video sharing, editing and social networking features to users on its platform.
Triller's partners include music streaming giant Spotify Technology SA SPOT.N, Sony Music and Universal Music Group, according to the firm's website.
The company also owns Triller Fight Club, a live-event platform in partnership with rapper Snoop Dogg and operates TrillerTV, a long-form content streaming platform with a library of original shows.

2022-06-30 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting INTC Put And Call Options For August 12th,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-intc-put-and-call-options-for-august-12th,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the August 12th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new August 12th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $36.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.53. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $36.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $34.47 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $37.42/share today.
Because the $36.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.25% return on the cash commitment, or 36.08% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $36.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $38.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.67. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $37.42/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $38.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.01% if the stock gets called away at the August 12th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $38.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $38.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.46% boost of extra return to the investor, or 37.88% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the call contract example above is 39%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $37.42) to be 32%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-06-30 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Corporation (INTC) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-corporation-intc-is-attracting-investor-attention%3A-here-is-what-you-should-know,,,"Intel (INTC) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Over the past month, shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -15.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -8.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Intel falls in, has lost 16.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.75 per share, indicating a change of -41.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +6.4% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $3.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -36%. This estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.66 indicates a change of +4.5% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intel is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Intel, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $17.98 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -8.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $75.43 billion and $78.43 billion estimates indicate -3.3% and +4% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $18.35 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.7%. EPS of $0.87 for the same period compares with $1.39 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.18%. The EPS surprise was +8.75%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

2022-06-30 00:00:00+00:00,Will AMD Cut Its Guidance?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-amd-cut-its-guidance,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) reported some stellar first-quarter results. Revenue surged 71% year over year, helped by the acquisition of Xilinx, and adjusted earnings per share more than doubled. Sales of PC processors and graphics cards surged 33%, while server, embedded, and semi-custom chip sales soared 88%.
Equally as impressive was AMD's guidance. The company called for 69% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter, driven by Xilinx and growth in all its segments. For the full year, AMD expects revenue to surge by 60% to $26.3 billion.

The PC market is cooling off
AMD's growth over the past few years has been fueled by market share gains in the PC and server chip markets, the launches of the latest generation of game consoles, and a very strong market for PCs during the pandemic. AMD's Ryzen PC chips and EPYC server chips have been winning share from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and game consoles powered by AMD semi-custom chips have been in high demand.
It was inevitable that the PC market would eventually cool down, but timing was a wildcard. There are now multiple signs indicating that demand for PCs is slowing. First, IDC reported in April that global PC unit sales declined 5.1% in the first quarter following two years of pandemic-fueled double-digit growth. Overall shipments were still well above pre-pandemic levels in the first three months of the year, but consumer sentiment has only worsened since then.
More recently, Digitimes reported on Tuesday that Intel was cutting prices on its latest Alder Lake chips for OEMs in an effort to boost sales. Tom's Hardware pointed out that some PC makers may be holding off on orders to wait for lower prices, but Digitimes' sources said PC orders for the second half were well below expectations.
This pessimism from PC makers could indicate that a steep drop in PC demand is coming this year. This is just one data point, and it doesn't really say anything about the market for components. AMD and Intel sell their chips to consumers as well as to OEMs, and many PC gamers put together their own systems.
But with inflation persistently elevated and recession fears ramping up, it's possible that demand for PC chips destined for home-built PCs will also decline. Demand for graphics cards could fall as well, although there may be enough PC gamers who held off over the past two years due to high prices to absorb any supply.
There's been no sign that server chip sales are slowing, but a recession could certainly lead enterprise customers to pull back on tech spending in general. That could cascade into a slowdown in cloud computing demand, which in turn would likely lead to cloud companies buying fewer server chips.
AMD could still win market share in both the PC and server chip markets, offsetting any industrywide declines. But Intel has been stepping up its game, and its reported price cuts certainly won't help AMD. Intel's Alder Lake processors pulled the company out of its funk, offering better performance at most price points compared to AMD's Ryzen processors. AMD is set to launch new Ryzen chips later this year, but Intel will follow suit soon after with Raptor Lake.
AMD is in a position where demand for PCs appears to be weakening and market share gains may be harder to come by given the quality of Intel's latest products. Demand for game consoles could hold up better in a recession -- playing video games at home is a lot cheaper than a night out. But it's hard to say.
A lot can change in a few months
AMD's first-quarter report and guidance came nearly two months ago, and its second-quarter report won't come until the end of July. AMD's guidance was based on how things looked after the end of the first quarter, and it's safe to say that things have changed since then. The odds of a recession have certainly increased; layoffs and hiring freezes among tech companies have been piling up; and inflation has been taking a toll on consumer spending.
We're coming off a two-year period where consumers and businesses snapped up PCs, and where demand for cloud infrastructure services soared. It was a great environment for AMD. What comes next probably won't be so great. Given the apparent slowdown in PC demand, I'll be surprised if AMD doesn't get a little less optimistic with its outlook when it next reports results in July.
AMD stock has already dropped around 50% since its peak last year, but any sign of slowing growth could send the stock even lower. On the flip side, if AMD manages to hold its ground and gain enough market share to offset slumping demand for PCs, the stock could be in for a recovery.

June 30 (Reuters) - Recession fears and Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent a chill through equity capital markets (ECM) in the second quarter, depriving bankers of lucrative fees for arranging stock sales such as initial public offerings (IPOs).
The slowdown drove global investment banks' fees from ECM deals down 74% to $2.6 billion, according to Refinitiv data, dragged down by the worst quarter in 13 years for ECM markets globally.
IPOs and other capital raising exercises by listed companies totalled $94 billion between end-March and June 21, a quarter of the amount raised during the same period last year due to the slump in U.S. and European deals.
Bankers hope market conditions will improve in the second half of the year, with luxury auto maker Porsche, chip-maker ARM and skincare firm Galderma expected to catch the next available IPO window.
Some IPO hopefuls, however, have written off 2022 altogether.
""In 2022, it is going to be materially impossible to reach a level close to the volume of operations that was done last year. There is no time,"" said Jerome Renard, head of EU Equity Capital Markets at Bank of America.

""Most of the growth-oriented companies across tech, healthcare and consumer looking to IPO have already pushed their dates to enter the market into the post-Labor Day timeframe,"" said Brad Miller, head of ECM Americas at UBS. The U.S. Labor Day holiday falls on Sept. 5 this year.
Miller said some IPO candidates have pushed back to 2023 or until the outlook is clearer on inflation, interest rates and the market.
The United States and Europe, which traditionally account for around 60% of the global IPO market, made up just 9% of second-quarter issuance, after slumping 96% from last year.

SPAC STOP
The party has also stopped for blank-check companies – formally known as special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, with waning investor interest and tighter regulatory scrutiny.

So far this year, up to five Chinese banks rank in the top 10 in ECM fees. Last year the first Chinese, CITIC, ranked ninth. For an interactive version of the Reuters chart showing ECM league tables in the second quarter click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/3ORq65i
""We have witnessed a significant correction in multiples, which has certainly had an impact on whether selling shareholders and issuers are willing to access the public market in the current context,"" said Stephane Gruffat, co-head of Equity Capital Markets at Deutsche Bank.
With Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" the Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX), hovering at 29, way above the 20 safety marker for an IPO, bankers have been locking for cornerstone investors to support their IPOs.
These investors, who pledge to acquire shares before the formal conclusion of the book building process, help give confidence to the market.
""We believe that cornerstone or anchor processes will be of ever increasing importance for upcoming IPOs to increase transaction certainty and reduce market risk periods post launch,"" said Richard Cormack, co-head of ECM in EMEA at Goldman Sachs.
This strategy is going to be followed by Spanish renewable company Opdenergy, which on Wednesday announced plans to launch an IPO to raise up to 200 million euros and is in advanced discussions with a cornerstone investor to subscribe approximately 25% of the offering.

U.S. stock futures are on the decline ahead of Thursday’s opening bell this week. This comes as the latest update on the U.S. economy continues to weigh on markets. Namely, as of yesterday, the first-quarter U.S. GDP was revised down, indicating a 1.6% annualized contraction. The revision is reportedly due to personal consumption levels being less than previously reported. Pair this with a decline in U.S. consumer confidence throughout June, and investor concerns would not be unwarranted.
In fact, ahead of today’s monthly personal consumption expenditures (PCE) figures, it’s not surprising that investors are taking caution. Adding to this is Loretta Mester, the Cleveland Federal Reserve President. She states, “The fact that the salient prices of gasoline and food remain elevated suggests that there is some risk that longer-term inflation expectations of households and businesses will continue to rise.” Additionally, Mester also notes that she is keen to back another 75 basis point interest rate hike in July. This would be the case, she argues, if the current state of the economy persists through the Fed’s next meeting.
Regardless, companies across the board continue to push forward and there is plenty of stock market news to keep up with today. As of 4:43 a.m. ET, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures are trading lower by 0.73%, 1.20%, and 1.18% respectively.
Micron Earnings Preview: What To Consider
Micron (NASDAQ: MU) could be one of the major firms to consider on the earnings front today. After all, the semiconductor chip maker is set to report its third fiscal quarter results after the closing bell today. Getting straight into it, consensus figures on Wall Street are an earnings per share of $2.45 on revenue of $8.66 billion. Should this be the case, it would translate to commendable year-over-year gains of 30.3% and 16.7% respectively for Micron. Even with the ever-present macroeconomic headwinds it is facing, analysts see persisting growth for the company.
Despite all of this, MU stock, alongside its peers in the chip industry, continues to face pressure now. Year-to-date, the company’s shares are currently down by over 40%. Overall, this seems to stem from a cautious outlook regarding the chip industry from chip titan Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) as well. Nonetheless, it would not hurt to consider what analysts are saying about Micron now. For starters, both Citi (NYSE: C) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) are cutting their third-quarter estimates for Micron. However, their respective views on the company’s growth prospects are varying.
On one hand, Citi analyst Christopher Danely argues that a “collapsing” DRAM market would impact Micron’s key business. So much so that the analyst is lowering his price target for MU stock from $100 to $85. Nevertheless, he is reiterating the firm’s Buy rating on it. On the other hand, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers still has an Overweight rating on MU stock with a price target of $115. Rakers cites the “increasingly important role in core-to-edge compute,” that memory-related solutions are a key driving factor for Micron. With this mix of commentary on the firm, MU stock could be worth looking out for today.

Bitcoin Dips Below $20,000 As Pressures Mount On Crypto Markets; Grayscale Investments Sues SEC Over Bitcoin ETF Rejection
Meanwhile, even crypto markets are experiencing turbulence alongside the broader stock market. This is evident as Bitcoin (BTC) is seeing its value dip below the $20,000 mark today. This follows several weeks of declines, clearing off billions of dollars from the cryptocurrency market. Chiming in on this are analysts from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. They write, “A narrative that could well play out for the rest of the year and beyond is guiding bitcoin lower today, one of looming recession and mushrooming levels of inflation.”
At the same time, Grayscale Investments is butting heads with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Namely, the firm is initiating a lawsuit against the SEC over the rejection of its application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The likes of which it is looking to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) over to. Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said, “We are deeply disappointed by and vehemently disagree with the SEC’s decision to continue to deny spot Bitcoin ETFs from coming to the U.S. market.” As firms like Grayscale continue to push for the legitimization of Bitcoin further into the U.S. regulatory perimeter, investors could be watching closely.

Home Furniture Retailer RH Under Pressure Following Downward 2022 Revenue Outlook Revision
Shares of RH (NYSE: RH) appear to be coming under fire following the latest update from management regarding its 2022 financial outlook. In essence, the high-end furniture provider is cutting its revenue outlook for fiscal 2022. According to RH, among the core reasons for this is decelerating consumer demand for the second half of the year. In its press release, RH anticipates annual revenue to be lower by between 2% to 5% year-over-year. This would be a notable difference from its previous estimate of annual sales being flat to up by 2% year-over-year.
Providing some extra context to all this is RH CEO, Gary Friedman. He explains, “With mortgage rates double last year’s levels, luxury home sales down 18% in the first quarter, and the Federal Reserve’s forecast for another 175 basis point increase to the Fed Funds Rate by year end, our expectation is that demand will continue to slow throughout the year.” As a result of all this, it would make sense that RH stock is feeling the heat in thestock market today

So far this year, up to five Chinese banks rank in the top 10 in ECM fees. Last year the first Chinese, CITIC, ranked ninth. For an interactive version of the Reuters chart showing ECM league tables in the second quarter click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/3ORq65i
""We have witnessed a significant correction in multiples, which has certainly had an impact on whether selling shareholders and issuers are willing to access the public market in the current context,"" said Stephane Gruffat, co-head of Equity Capital Markets at Deutsche Bank.
With Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" the Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX), hovering at 29, way above the 20 safety marker for an IPO, bankers have been locking for cornerstore investors to support their IPOs.
These investors, who pledge to acquire shares before the formal conclusion of the book building process, help give confidence to the market.
""We believe that cornerstone or anchor processes will be of ever increasing importance for upcoming IPOs to increase transaction certainty and reduce market risk periods post launch,"" said Richard Cormack, co-head of ECM in EMEA at Goldman Sachs.

2022-06-29 00:00:00+00:00,Why Advanced Micro Devices Fell Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-advanced-micro-devices-fell-today,,,"What happened
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) fell again on Wednesday, down 5.1% as of 12:48 p.m. ET.
Even though the stock fell hard yesterday on the back of a bad consumer sentiment number from the Conference Board, today followed through with another drop, as a prominent semiconductor analyst slashed his price targets across the sector.
So what
On Wednesday, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya lowered his price target on AMD, slashing it from $160 to $110, although he did keep his buy rating on shares. Arya actually appears bullish on AMD relative to the rest of the sector, but the AMD price target cut was part of a broader downgrade of the whole sector, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which was also kept at buy. These two fared relatively well, however; Arya actually downgraded his ratings for several other semi names to either neutral or underperform, so one could say AMD actually fared better in his analysis than its sector peers.
The reason for the sectorwide downgrade was pure macroeconomics, as Arya anticipates a slowdown in GDP or recession will cause a semiconductor downcycle. His note said: ""All-in we lower our CY22E semi sales forecast to $608bn (9.5% YoY vs. 13% prior) and CY23E to $604bn (-1% YoY vs 7% prior). This includes -4% YoY decline in non-memory chips, similar to past periods of 2-3% global GDP growth, likely the case next year.""
Meanwhile, the first-quarter U.S. GDP numbers were actually revised down slightly today on their third revision, which showed a 1.6% decline, versus the initial 1.5% estimate. The slightly weaker reading comes even as central bankers are aggressively hiking interest rates to tame inflation, which some investors predict will lead to a recession.
Now what
Certainly, a recession would probably not be good for any sector of the economy, and semiconductors have tended to be even more economically sensitive than others in the past. However, semiconductor investors may take solace in the fact that even Arya doesn't think a semi downturn will be as bad as prior downcycles. He continued: ""Since 1995, the average semi downturn has produced sales declines of about 9%, including 15% in memory but only 5%-7% in non-memory, core semis. Today, while a macroeconomic deceleration can cause unit weakness, we do see unique pricing leverage providing some support for semis relative to historical levels.""
AMD is well positioned today, as its chips have vaulted ahead of rival Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) over the past couple years. Since Intel had been the dominant processor manufacturer for years, AMD has the opportunity to take market share, perhaps offsetting some sectorwide weakness, should it happen. Of note, last week other analysts at J.P. Morgan predicted AMD could double its server market share next year, potentially reaching 30%-40% of server chip sales, versus 20% today.
AMD's business has boomed in recent years, but its stock has been a tad expensive. However, with shares now back near 30 times earnings and what looks to be a solid growth year in 2022, AMD's stock is looking enticing for the first time in a while -- although much of the semiconductor sector is as well.

2022-06-29 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks Smart Investors Are Buying Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-smart-investors-are-buying-right-now,,,"It's been a challenging year for investing, with assumptions made in January now needing reassessment in the middle of the year. Few could have predicted a war in Europe, ongoing COVID-19-related restrictions in China (notably in the manufacturing region of Shanghai), and supply chain issues persisting in their virulence.
As such, all three of the stocks discussed here -- one bought in the first quarter by legendary investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and two by highly respected hedge fund manager William Von Mueffling's Cantillon Capital Management -- have underperformed the market. But, of course, this means they are potentially a good value. So let's take a closer look.
1. Alphabet
Cantillon added Google owner Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) stock to its existing holding, which now stands at nearly 6% of its portfolio value. Investors buy Alphabet stock for what it is now as much as what it could become in the future.
Everyone knows about Google's dominant position in search and Google Cloud's potential to generate vast streams of recurring cash flow in the future as it garners customers.
However, the staggering amount of free cash flow (FCF) that Wall Street analysts expect Alphabet to generate -- $267 billion in the next three years alone -- is the key to the investment case for the stock. On top of the FCF, there's already $125 billion in net cash on the balance sheet at the end of 2021.
Of course, what management will do with it all is another question. Indeed, it's not without options (dividends, buybacks, investments, etc.). Nevertheless, given that the $267 billion represents around 18% of the current market cap, it's fair to say Alphabet looks to be a good value.
2. Celanese
Berkshire Hathaway's purchase of chemicals company Celanese (NYSE: CE) has all the hallmarks of a traditional Buffett stock pick. It's not in a fashionable industry (intermediate chemicals used in paint and coatings, electronics, adhesives, packaging, and electrical and electronics products), and it's not a household name. Moreover, given Buffett's track record, it's safe to say Berkshire bought it for its long-term value proposition rather than a near-term call on the direction of specialty chemicals prices.
Celanese benefited greatly from surging chemicals prices last year, but the concern is that sales may slump in the future should rising rates choke off end demand for products that the company's materials are in.
On the other hand, Celanese's operating margin has been on a general uptrend in the past decade. That's because the company has invested in low-cost production plants. In addition, the acquisition of DuPont's mobility and materials business (to be completed at the end of 2022) for $11 billion is intended to generate $450 million of run-rate synergies within four years.
Celanese CFO Scott Richardson says, ""We are confident in our ability to capture synergies that would allow us to double Celanese's total free cash flow within the next five years.""
Data by YCharts
3. Applied Materials
Von Mueffling is known as a technology investor, so when Cantillon adds to its position in semiconductor materials and equipment company Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT), it's usually a good idea to take notice.
The industry should be firing on all cylinders now, with semiconductor shortages creating a significant need for investment. Indeed, Applied Materials sales are growing -- analysts expect double-digit growth in 2022 and 2023. Moreover, key customers like Intel, Samsung, and Taiwan Semiconductor are all ramping up capital spending.
Data by YCharts
However, the problem is, in the words of CEO Gary Dickerson, ""we remain constrained by ongoing supply chain issues"" -- a familiar story in the technology world.
That said, investors should look beyond the near-term issues because the semiconductor industry has plenty of long-term demand growth drivers -- not least, as chips are being increasingly integrated into everyday devices. Examples include the explosion of internet-enabled devices in wireless equipment, intelligent systems in automotives, or industrial automation. In addition, these technologies will increase in adoption due to 5G rollouts and increasing use of advanced data analytics. These are secular growth trends that will carry on long after the supply chain issues of 2022 and 2023 are forgotten.

2022-06-29 00:00:00+00:00,Why I Want to Buy ASML Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-i-want-to-buy-asml-stock,,,"The semiconductor industry saw a record $556 billion in revenue for the full year of 2021. According to analysts, total revenue is supposed to nearly double in size by 2030. But how can investors capitalize on this massive opportunity?
Owning shares of Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography, or ASML (NASDAQ: ASML), might be the best way to capture this opportunity; here's why.
The only game in town
ASML is the sole manufacturer of EUV lithography machines. EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography is what enables advanced chips to be ""printed"" on silicon. As chip designs get smaller, it becomes increasingly difficult to print those designs; EUV technology enables this difficult process. Each EUV machine that ASML creates sells for over $100 million.
ASML does not design or manufacture any semiconductor chips. It designs and manufactures the machines that create the chips. Some of its biggest customers are TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. As the lone manufacturer of these machines, ASML has taken a monopolistic hold on advanced chipmaking. Without ASML's lithography machines, global technological advancement would stop dead in its tracks.
There is no greater competitive edge than owning an entire market. ASML faces no competition in the EUV lithography space, which allows it to maintain high margins that have grown significantly. During the last three years, gross margin has increased 16 percentage points to 52% and operating margin has grown by 41 percentage points to 32%. These numbers are the top tier in the semiconductor space and translated to 222% growth in earnings per share over the last five years as well as a 762% increase in free cash flow.
The 9.9 billion euros in free cash flow for 2021 has been used to reward shareholders. Looking back to last year, 1.4 billion euros was paid out in dividends while 8.6 billion euros was used to buy back shares. That is nearly 5% of all shares outstanding.
Good value, but with one risk
ASML currently trades at a market cap of roughly $200 billion with a free cash flow of $12 billion. These numbers create a price-to-free cash flow multiple of 16, which gives it an attractive valuation compared with its peers. So why is ASML trading at such a cheap price?
One reason might be the supply chain issues that have hit the semiconductor industry harder than most. The Biden administration stated that these issues shaved 1% off of U.S. GDP in 2021. For ASML, quarterly revenue is down 25% year over year and deferred revenue is almost double what it was in 2020.
Deferred revenue means that ASML has taken advanced payments for its products without delivering on those orders -- customers have bought machines that haven't been manufactured yet. The increase in deferred revenue is likely due to major supply chain issues. The orders keep coming in for machines to increase chip fabrication capacity without ASML having the supplies needed to manufacture those machines. The deferred revenue is a liability on the balance sheet until it is realized and moved over to the top line. This $8 billion in deferred revenue will move to the top line in years to come, further boosting growth.
The supply chain is an inherent risk when you invest in any company with exposure to the global economy, but even so, I think that ASML is well-positioned for success. With ASML at a market cap of just under $200 billion, I think this is a great opportunity to buy one of the most important companies in the world.

2022-06-28 00:00:00+00:00,Why Qualcomm Surged Today Even as the Nasdaq Plunged,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-qualcomm-surged-today-even-as-the-nasdaq-plunged,,,"What happened
Shares of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) had surged by 4.5% as of 3:17 p.m. ET Tuesday, a performance that was all the more remarkable since the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was at that point in the session down by 2.8%.
Obviously, there must have been some very positive company-specific news for Qualcomm to defy the sector-wide sell-off. That came from the declaration by a much-followed analyst that Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) efforts to develop its own 5G mobile modem ""may have failed,"" and that Qualcomm will supply 100% of the mobile modems used in the iPhones to be manufactured in 2023.
So what
On Tuesday, Taiwanese analyst Ming-Chi Kuo at TF International Securities tweeted, ""My latest survey indicates that Apple's own iPhone 5G modem chip development may have failed, so Qualcomm will remain exclusive supplier for 5G chips of 2H23 new iPhones, with a 100% supply share (vs. company's previous estimate of 20%).""
If true, this would certainly be fantastic news for Qualcomm, which has seen its valuation multiples contract over the past few years -- even as its results have remained strong -- due to investors' anticipation that it would eventually lose Apple as a major client. Back in 2019, Apple bought Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) mobile modem business for $1 billion with the goal of eventually producing its own modems.
Apple has increasingly looked to develop its own chips in order to improve performance and further differentiate its hardware from Android phones and Windows-based PCs. It has already successfully developed the powerful ""M"" series processor for its Mac computers, displacing Intel's CPUs from them.
However, it appears mobile modems are a tougher nut to crack. Previously, Qualcomm had predicted it would only supply 20% of iPhones in 2023. And since Apple is falling behind on its modem ambitions, who knows how long Qualcomm will retain this business?
Apple has a relatively small share of the global smartphone market, with a percentage in the high teens to the low twenties. However, it controls an outsized share of the market for higher-priced premium phones. Therefore, the news is a big deal, especially since Qualcomm's low price-to-earnings ratio of around 13 indicates that investors are valuing it with the expectation that it will face growth struggles in the years ahead.
Now what
Investors will have to see if the conclusions Kuo drew from his survey turn out to be true. If he's right, that only bolsters an already-solid investment case for Qualcomm. Notably, management has been diversifying the company's revenue streams away from mobile devices, gaining ground in high-growth segments such as automotive chips, Internet of Things chips, and radio frequency chips for 5G radios. Last quarter, Qualcomm's automotive segment revenues were up 41% year over year, and its IoT division sales were up a whopping 61%.
Those newer segments accounted for one-third of revenue last quarter, and they should continue to deliver strong growth for the rest of this decade, which would offset any potential loss of business from Apple. Yet if the tech giant sticks with Qualcomm as a key supplier for a bit longer, the chipmaker should enjoy stronger and smoother growth than investors have expected. All in all, Qualcomm still looks like a great value stock, even after Tuesday's bump.

Intel stock has slipped 25% in 2022 and is now trading at just 6.4 times trailing earnings. This dirt-cheap valuation represents a nice discount to Intel's five-year average earnings multiple of 13.3 and the Nasdaq-100's average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.
Coming to the dividend, Intel carries a fat yield of 3.95%, which is significantly higher than the index's average. It is worth noting that the company has constantly raised its dividend over the years. For instance, Intel was paying out $0.87 per share in annual dividends in 2012. It now has a forward annual dividend rate of $1.46 per share, which means that the payout has increased at a compound annual rate of 5.3% over the past decade.
Intel's latest dividend hike was announced in January this year. The chip giant increased its quarterly dividend by 5% to $0.365 per share. Investors, however, may be worried whether Intel would be able to sustain its fat payout given the near-term challenges it is facing.
The company had generated $11.3 billion worth of free cash flow in 2021, which was 15% of its top line. This year, however, Intel's free cash flow is expected to land between minus $2 billion and minus $1 billion, thanks to the company's focus on boosting its capital expenditure to take market share back from rivals. Its earnings are expected to drop 36% this year on account of higher spending and a flat top line.
In 2023 and 2024, Intel estimates that its adjusted free cash flow will remain neutral and move into positive territory only in 2025, when it is expected to account for 20% of revenue. The good part is that Intel could sustain its impressive dividend despite the near-term problems. That's because Intel has a forward dividend payout ratio of 41% after accounting for the steep drop in the company's earnings.
Finally, Intel's growth is expected to start picking up from 2025 thanks to its aggressive capital spending, so patient investors could be rewarded with a higher dividend and a healthy stock upside in the long run if they buy this chip giant at its dirt-cheap valuation right now.
2. Qualcomm
Qualcomm is another chipmaker that has been clobbered on the stock market this year, dropping over 31% despite clocking impressive growth. The stock is now trading at just 12.8 times trailing earnings and 9.4 times forward earnings. Buying Qualcomm at these multiples looks like a no-brainer as it not only has a healthy dividend yield but also has bright prospects that could send its shares higher in the long run.
Qualcomm sports a dividend yield of 2.4%, which is well above the Nasdaq-100's average. Management had raised the quarterly payout by 10% in March this year to $0.75 per share. It is worth noting that Qualcomm's quarterly dividend payout has tripled since 2012. And with a forward payout ratio of 22.7%, it won't be surprising to see Qualcomm's dividend increase further thanks to the pace at which its revenue and earnings are increasing.
Qualcomm's revenue had increased 41% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 (for the three months ended March 27, 2022) to $11.1 billion. The company's adjusted income shot up 69% year over year to $3.21 per share during the quarter. Analysts expect Qualcomm to finish fiscal 2022 with 33% revenue growth and a 47% spike in earnings.
More importantly, Qualcomm is expected to maintain 14% annual earnings growth for the next five years. However, it won't be surprising to see the company clock stronger growth thanks to multiple growth drivers such as the growing demand for its automotive and Internet of Things (IoT) chips, as well as Qualcomm's healthy position in the smartphone market.
In all, Qualcomm looks like a top dividend stock to buy, and its valuation is proof that investors should consider going long right away.
3. Cisco Systems
Cisco Systems is another high-yield stock that's too cheap to ignore. Trading at just 15.4 times trailing earnings, Cisco looks like an attractive dividend stock to buy right now, considering its impressive yield of 3.5%. What's more, Cisco has increased its dividend for 13 years straight, and it has a forward dividend payout ratio of 43%, which points toward more room for growth.
However, Cisco has run into near-term troubles on account of multiple factors such as supply chain bottlenecks, lockdowns in China, and Russia's war on Ukraine. The company's revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was flat year over year at $12.8 billion, while adjusted earnings increased 5%. But Cisco's weak guidance was a cause for concern.
But then, there are signs that Cisco's business could pick up the pace in the future. The company's remaining performance obligations increased 7% last quarter to $30.2 billion, which represents the total of deferred revenue and contracts for which customers haven't been billed yet. Cisco points out that it expects to recognize 54% of its remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next 12 months.
Additionally, Cisco is sitting on a solid backlog worth $15 billion for its hardware and software offerings. The company points out that its backlog increased 130% year over year last quarter, and this metric is not included in the calculation of remaining performance obligations. As such, Cisco's growth rate could improve as the demand for its offerings remains robust, which is why investors looking to buy a dividend-paying stock on the cheap should take a closer look at this networking giant.

2022-06-28 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Too Late to Buy AMD Stock?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-too-late-to-buy-amd-stock-1,,,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) have been hammered on the market in 2022, losing as much as 45% of their value, but the chipmaker has given investors some relief recently thanks to the broader stock market recovery.
Major indices such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite eked out gains last week. Those gains extended to AMD stock, which was up 7% last week. But does this mean investors have lost an opportunity to buy shares of this fast-growing semiconductor play on the cheap? Let's find out.
Is AMD stock still affordable after its latest rally?
AMD stock is available at an attractive valuation, even after last week's gains. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32 may not be cheap when compared to the Nasdaq 100's multiple of 25, but it is worth noting AMD previously traded at much higher levels, as its five-year average earnings multiple of 103 indicates.
The forward earnings multiple of 20 is also quite attractive and indicates the chipmaker's earnings are expected to increase at a nice pace in the coming year. Management's 2022 outlook has revenue up 60% to $26.3 billion following the completion of its acquisition of Xilinx.
It previously guided for 31% top-line growth this year, but Xilinx will give AMD a major boost by unlocking a massive market opportunity in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and adaptive chips that power a range of applications such as data centers, 5G wireless infrastructure, and automotive, among others.
Additionally, AMD forecasts an adjusted gross margin of 54% for 2022, compared to its earlier estimate of 51%. That would be a big jump over last year's adjusted gross margin of 48% with the potential to flow through to the company's bottom line.
As such, AMD stock remains attractive even after its rally last week. More importantly, the stock's valuation is too good to ignore, as there are multiple catalysts that should ensure healthy long-term growth and help AMD deliver more upside.
More reasons why the stock looks like an enticing bet right now
Wall Street is upbeat about AMD's prospects. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh has a $150 price target on AMD stock, which is 75% higher than current levels. Vinh says the adoption of AMD's server processors has strengthened lately with more cloud providers launching services based on those chips.
Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore is also bullish on AMD's data center prospects. He points out that data center products now account for 50% of the company's gross margin. Moore estimates AMD's data center offerings could produce 65% to 70% of its gross margin in the future on the back of an improvement in the company's market share in this space.
The data center market represents a multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity for AMD, and the company is poaching market share from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). AMD controlled an 11.6% share of the server market in the first quarter, up 2.7 percentage points from the year-ago period, according to Mercury Research.
AMD's server market share could climb as high as 35% based on Bank of America's long-term estimates, which wouldn't be surprising given Intel's struggles to launch competitive chips. Intel has delayed the launch of its Sapphire Rapids server processors once again. These chips were supposed to hit the market last year, but they are now expected to only move into volume production in 2023.
Meanwhile, AMD's fourth-generation EPYC server processors are set to hit the market in the fourth quarter this year. Based on a 5-nanometer (nm) manufacturing process, AMD claims these processors could deliver a 75% gain in performance over the current generation of chips. Intel, on the other hand, will remain stuck on a 10nm process node even when it launches its Sapphire Rapids processors.
AMD's smaller process node means its chips should ideally pack more processing power and consume less energy. This widening of the technology gap would set the stage for AMD to boost its market share further and corner a bigger chunk of data center processor revenue.
Such solid tailwinds make it clear why analysts are forecasting 33% annual earnings growth from AMD over the next five years. So investors who haven't taken advantage of the slide in this tech stock still have an opportunity to do so given its attractive valuation and bright prospects.
