2022-03-16 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) to Invest in Europe's Semiconductor Ecosystem,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-to-invest-in-europes-semiconductor-ecosystem,,,"Intel Corporation INTC has announced plans to invest €80 billion in the European Union over the next decade along the semiconductor value chain. That includes research and development (R&D), manufacturing and packaging technologies.

The company plans to invest an initial €17 billion in semiconductor fab mega-site in Germany, create a new R&D and design hub in France, and invest in R&D, manufacturing and foundry services in Ireland, Italy, Poland and Spain.

Intel intends to bring its most advanced technology to Europe, creating a next-generation European chip ecosystem while addressing the need for a resilient supply chain.

The initiative will boost Europe’s R&D innovation and bring leading-edge manufacturing to the region for the benefit of Intel’s customers and partners around the world.

The investment program is centered around balancing the global semiconductor supply chain with a major expansion of Intel’s production capacities in Europe.

In the initial phase, Intel plans to develop two semiconductor fabs in Magdeburg, Germany, the capital of Saxony-Anhalt. Construction is expected to begin in the first half of 2023, and production is planned for 2027.

The new fabs are likely to deliver chips using Intel’s Angstrom-era transistor technologies, serving the needs of both foundry customers and Intel for Europe and globally as part of the company’s IDM (integrated device manufacturer) 2.0 strategy.

Intel’s investment plans will likely accelerate chip design capabilities, boost the European material and equipment supplier industry.

Intel benefits from the increasing demand in the Data Center Group, with strong server recovery in enterprise and government.

The stock has lost 31.9% in the past year against the industry’s growth of 19%.

Hello, Reader.
Louis Navellier here.
The minute I heard about Eric’s Tech Crisis 2022 event, I jumped at the chance to participate. (Did you get a chance to sign up yet? If not, click here.)
I’ve been following Eric’s work for years — and I 100% believe in his research.
It might surprise some people, but I gained an edge over Wall Street and amassed a personal fortune by understanding the power of new technology and exponential progress.
In fact, I owe all of my investing success to one college assignment… and a big piece of technology.
At Cal State Hayward, one of my professors tasked me with creating a model portfolio that would mimic the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 index.
It was a dream assignment for a numbers guy like me… but I failed at it spectacularly.
The problem? My model kept beating the S&P 500.
This was back in the late 1970s when everyone believed it was virtually impossible to beat the market without taking on excessive risk. Conventional wisdom was that you might get lucky for a while, but no one could consistently beat the market.
Thankfully, my professors gave me unprecedented access to Wells Fargo’s (NYSE:WFC) big, expensive and powerful mainframe computers to continue to build my stock-selection models. (Remember, this was more than 40 years ago.)
Through hundreds of hours of research, and thanks to that mainframe computer, I discovered how an elite type of stock consistently outperformed the broad market, year in and year out. Through extensive analysis, I isolated the eight key qualities that these super-performing stocks shared… and developed a system for riding them.
The research I did back then serves as the foundation of what is now my advanced, high-tech method of computerized market analysis.
Triple-Digit Gains… Like Clockwork
With that in mind, I’d like to share a few examples with you of what my proprietary system can really do…
Back in the day, my proprietary trading code uncovered Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) when it was trading for just $6 per share… well before it became one of the leading and most valuable software corporations in America and traded north of $80.
That’s just one example. But it wasn’t really me who first spotted Oracle; it was my proprietary algorithms. It was the Technochasm. All I had to do was know a good thing when I saw it.
That’s also how I uncovered other huge winners, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), before they became big household names.
NOW OPEN: Register for Our Emergency Stock Market Update
In fact, the tech world these days feels very much like it did when I bought Intel in the 1980s.
Recall, I used mainframe computers to create my trading algorithms in college. Mainframes were massive and, by today’s standards, slow and rudimentary.
So I was just as excited as anyone by the PC revolution.
And remember: They all had “Intel inside.”
It was a tiny device — the silicon microchip — that barely anyone had heard of when IBM (NYSE:IBM) started putting them into the first PCs. But Intel’s chips were far and away the best.
Today, you’ll still find “Intel inside” just about every PC in the world. And its stock price has gone up 11,875%!
The same pattern played out with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in recent years. The company makes graphic processing units (GPUs) for consumers and businesses — more of them every day — though time will tell if it’ll run as high as Intel.
Inflation… Russia… Rising Rates… Recession… Here’s What Comes Next
All I know is that, thanks to my Technochasm-driven method of supercharged gains, I recommended this stock to my subscribers back in 2016. Then in 2019, we sold it for a whopping 166% gain!
My system also pinpointed stocks that resulted in gains like 122%… 150%… 109%… 116%… 209%… and even 487%!
A Simple Goal… but Explosive Results
Since then, for the past four decades, I’ve had a front-row seat to the acceleration and adaption of technology. I’ve seen how a small company can come out of nowhere and totally disrupt an entire industry, destroying every competitor in its wake.
And I’m still using technology to do so.
My proprietary computer programs are constantly scanning the market for companies with outstanding quarterly earnings growth… outstanding annual earnings growth… and a tendency to surprise Wall Street analysts with better-than-expected earnings growth.
In addition to qualities related to superior earnings growth, my computer programs screen for companies with increasing operating margins, increasing sales growth, high returns on equity and strong cash flow.
Corporate America is not Lake Wobegon, where all the kids are above average. The brutal truth is that some companies are much, much better than others. They have better management, better products, bigger profit margins, stronger sales, stronger balance sheets, etc.
My system analyzes over 5,000 stocks, grades them according to the individual qualities listed above and also combines the individual metrics to create an overall composite grade for any stock. These grades are just like the ones in school.
When I see a business with the highest growth and business quality ratings, the stock gets an “A.” A stock with miserable ratings gets an “F.”
The result of all this work? My subscribers get to buy the world’s fastest-growing companies — and hold them through their most successful years of expansion.
Eric’s stock selection and trading system differ from my own. But for now, I want to say that our two systems are complementary… and both produce dozens of triple- and quadruple-digit winners for our readers.
And we hope that if and when the opportunity arises to add more to our tallies, you’ll be there to join us.
So, now… why am I telling you all this?
Because tomorrow, Mar. 16, at 4:00 p.m. ET, I’ll be sitting down with Eric for the first-ever Tech Crisis 2022 event.
During this event, we’ll show you…
Where stocks are heading next…
Two FREE stock picks (ticker included) for these uncertain times…
How inflation, rising rates, Russia, recession and more will affect your money…
and much more.
Make sure you sign up here to save your spot — and receive reminders for the event when the time comes.
I hope to see you tomorrow.

Louis Navellier

2022-03-15 00:00:00+00:00,Why Broadcom Stock Just Popped,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-broadcom-stock-just-popped,,,"What happened
After three days of uninterrupted selling -- and one terrifying note from Citigroup -- shares of semiconductors company Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are bouncing back on Tuesday.
As of 1:25 p.m. ET, Broadcom stock is up 4.3%.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Yesterday, if you recall, Broadcom featured prominently in a research note from Citigroup. In this note, the international investment banker warned of ""incredibly bearish"" investor sentiment surrounding chip stocks and suggested this bearishness was appropriate because of risks China poses to the industry.
Specifically, Citi hypothesized a what-if scenario in which China decides to invade Taiwan, shutting down international semiconductor companies' access to chip-manufacturing services from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM). In this -- hopefully unlikely -- scenario, Citi warned that ""AMD has roughly 55% exposure to TSMC. ADI has roughly 40%, NVDA has roughly 50%, MRVL has roughly 60% [and] AVGO has roughly 75%"" (emphasis added).
Semiconductor stocks of all stripes suffered from Citi's warning. Broadcom, however, with its 75% dependence upon TSMC for the semiconductors it sells, clearly seemed the stock most at risk.
Now what
Now granted, Citi's note was a warning -- not a statement of present-day fact and not even necessarily a prediction of what the banker thinks will happen in the future. Broadcom might just go tooling right along, generating 16% revenue growth at 27.5% net profit margins (as it did last quarter) for years without anything disastrous happening to it.
That being said, Citi presumably voiced its concerns for a reason. The banker also provided some options for investors who want to heed its warning, noting that GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: GFS) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), for example, are two companies that investors remain ""positive"" on because they ""don't rely on Taiwan.""
As for me, given those two choices, I would lean toward an investment in Intel, which trades for less than 10 times earnings over GlobalFoundries, which hasn't earned any profits over the last four years.

2022-03-15 00:00:00+00:00,Germany wins big as Intel spreads chip investment across six EU countries,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/germany-wins-big-as-intel-spreads-chip-investment-across-six-eu-countries,,,"By Supantha Mukherjee, Foo Yun Chee and Jane Lanhee Lee
STOCKHOLM/BRUSSELS/SAN FRANCISCO, March 15 (Reuters) - Intel INTC.O has picked Germany as the site for a huge new chipmaking complex, giving the first details of a $88 billion investment drive across Europe, which is striving to cut its reliance on imports and ease a supply crunch for manufacturers.
The plan is the latest big investment announcement by a major semiconductor maker as the industry tries to catch up with a boom in demand for chips used in everything from smartphones to cars, though there will be no quick fix as the new German plants won't come online until 2027.
The U.S. chipmaker is spreading its investments in Europe around half a dozen countries, including boosting its existing factory in Ireland, setting up a design and research facility in France, and a packaging and assembly site in Italy.
The initial spending will total 33 billion euros ($36 billion), including 17 billion euros in Germany, where the auto industry is likely to be a prime customer for cutting-edge chips that could use technology as small as 2-nanometers.
German automaker Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE highlighted the pain caused by chip shortages on Tuesday, saying it sold 2 million fewer cars than planned last year due to the issue.
Intel's announcement comes after the European Commission last month set out plans to encourage chip manufacturing in the European Union, with proposed new legislation to ease state aid rules for chip factories and enable $17 billion in additional public and private investment.
Chipmakers are looking to build more factories to make advanced chips for use in premium smartphones like Apple's latest iPhones that use chips with 5-nanometer technology. A nanometer is just several atoms wide.
Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon was confident Intel could manage the roll out of investments to match demand going forward, and was positive on expanding with government subsidies.
""(Intel) is using capacity as a strategic weapon ... Part of the strategy right now is to go around the world and beg for money,"" Rasgon said. ""If there's any time to run around the world begging for money to build semiconductor manufacturing facilities now is the time.""
BIG INCENTIVES
Germany has come out as the big winner by cornering the bulk of Intel's investment but CEO Pat Gelsinger declined to say the amount of state aid the company is getting from the country.
Intel will build two factories in Magdeburg, Germany, creating 7,000 construction jobs, 3,000 permanent jobs at the company, and tens of thousands of additional jobs across suppliers and partners, it said.
Gelsinger said Intel wants to spend the remaining money from its planned 80 billion euro investment over the next 10 years to build out the complete Magdeburg site and further develop the sites in Italy and France.
The company will invest an additional 12 billion euros in an existing Irish facility which will take its total investment in Ireland to more than 30 billion euros.
It is also in talks with Italy for a chip assembly and packaging plant for a potential investment of up to 4.5 billion euros, expected to start operations between 2025 and 2027.
In France, Intel plans to build its new European research hub, creating 1,000 new high-tech jobs.
The company will also increase its lab space in Poland and plans to establish joint labs with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center in Spain for advanced computing.
Gelsinger had announced plans in September to spend $88 billion in Europe over the next decade, and the choice of sites comes after some EU governments including Italy offered big incentives to try and woo the chipmaker to invest in their countries.
Spreading its factories around different locations could help the company get more subsidies from different countries.
But Intel will have to negotiate with each European country where it's locating facilities for state aid, European Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton told journalists.
He also said the Commission was talking with other chipmakers and hoping to make similar announcements in the coming months, but did not provide details.

10 stocks we like better than Intel
When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*
They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Intel wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of March 3, 2022
Billy Duberstein: Intel recently had its investor day. It gave a lot of long-term targets and plans. So we'll get into that. One interesting thing is that Mobileye, they're going to try to do an IPO of Mobileye this summer to raise money for their investment into their foundry business. So it's going to be pretty interesting what kind of valuation that gets. I think they bought it for about $15 billion back in 2017. Some think it could be worth as high as $50 billion now and I hope they will get that. But there was a recent DigiTimes article that said Mobileye hopes to build a $5,000 Level 4 autonomous system by 2025. That would make it basically appropriate to put into low-cost cars and really democratize highly autonomous vehicles, which I thought was really interesting. They give a roadmap that it's, I guess it's going to be $4,000 for the cameras, lidar, and radar. So their system is going to be composed of three different technologies. So radar, which I think it's sound waves, that detect objects, lidar, which is just lasers to paint a picture of what's around the car, and then also cameras. I think Tesla's going with like the pure camera approach, I think. Then they are trying to get their IQ Ultra system on-chip. Their IQ is their autonomous driving chip. They're trying to make something called the IQ Ultra system on chip for Level 4, get in production by the end of 2023 and then volume production by 2025. That's actually going to be based on 5-nanometer technology produced by TSMC. So not even Intel there. You can see Intel still having to rely on TSMC for the most advanced nodes, better node for all the products that are not CPUs. That's kind of exciting for Mobileye. If they can translate that into optimism by the summer, they could raise a lot of money so we'll have to see. It's something to track over the next couple of years in the summer.
Jose Najarro: To me this is very crazy. I mean, these semiconductor companies are really starting to focus in these kind of one-stop solutions for autonomous driving. You mentioned, Intel their main chip is going to be called the IQ. I know Nvidia has, was it the IQ, yeah, the IQ. When Nvidia has their chip that's called Orin at the moment and then they are looking to build a full system. Well, Nvidia also has a full system and now what's coming into mind is AMD just recently finished the acquisition of Xilinx, who also has a few chips that work in the automotive market. So who knows, maybe AMD is next to provide some form of chips and home solutions like we're seeing here in the autonomous market. Nick, any thoughts there before we take a quick look at Slido?
Nicholas Rossolillo: I think it's an interesting move. Just all deferred ability on Intel because I follow Intel a lot less closely. But I do think it's an interesting move and it jives with Pat Gelsinger's stated objective for the company. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Intel still going to keep a sizable stake in Mobileye, correct?
Duberstein: They're still going to be the majority shareholder. I'm not sure how much of it they're going to sell it all depends. Yeah.
Rossolillo: They're going to raise a decent amount of cash in this partial spinoff and I think they really need that cash to plow back into manufacturing because TSMC just is a beast. I mean, it's tens of billions of dollars without even batting an eye getting dumped into their existing fabrication capabilities and new ones as well. I think this is a really smart move for Intel and then for us as investors, it's obviously exciting to see such a high-growth technology play get separated out from Intel and we'll get to discover what the true valuation is according to the market.

2022-03-15 00:00:00+00:00,Intel spreads chip investment across six EU countries in race to boost supplies,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-spreads-chip-investment-across-six-eu-countries-in-race-to-boost-supplies,,,"By Supantha Mukherjee, Foo Yun Chee and Jane Lanhee Lee
STOCKHOLM/BRUSSELS/SAN FRANCISCO, March 15 (Reuters) - Intel INTC.O has picked Germany as the site for a huge new chipmaking complex, giving the first details of a $88 billion investment drive across Europe, which is striving to cut its reliance on imports and ease a supply crunch for manufacturers.
The plan is the latest by a major semiconductor maker as the industry tries to catch up with a boom in demand for chips used in everything from smartphones to cars, though there will be no quick fix as the new German plants won't come online until 2027.
The U.S. chipmaker is spreading its investments around half a dozen countries, including boosting its existing factory in Ireland, setting up a design and research facility in France, and a packaging and assembly site in Italy.
The initial spending will total 33 billion euros ($36 billion), including 17 billion euros in Germany, where the auto industry is likely to be a prime customer for cutting-edge chips that could use technology as small as 2-nanometers.
German automaker Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE highlighted the pain caused by chip shortages on Tuesday, saying it sold two million fewer cars than planned last year due to the issue.
Intel's announcement comes after the European Commission last month set out plans to encourage chip manufacturing in the European Union, with proposed new legislation to ease state aid rules for chip factories and enable $17 billion in additional public and private investment.
Chipmakers are looking to build more factories to make advanced and smaller chips for use in premium smartphones like Apple's latest iPhones that use chips with 5-nanometer technology. A nanometer is just several atoms wide.
Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon was confident Intel could manage the roll out of investments to match demand going forward, and was positive on expanding with government subsidies.
""[Intel] is using capacity as a strategic weapon ... Part of the strategy right now is to go around the world and beg for money,"" Rasgon said. ""If there's any time to run around the world begging for money to build semiconductor manufacturing facilities now is the time.""
BIG INCENTIVES
Intel will build two factories in Magdeburg, Germany, creating 7,000 construction jobs, 3,000 permanent jobs at the company, and tens of thousands of additional jobs across suppliers and partners, it said.
The company will invest an additional 12 billion euros in an Irish facility which will take its total investment in Ireland to more than 30 billion euros.
It is also in talks with Italy for a chip assembly and packaging plant for a potential investment of up to 4.5 billion euros, expected to start operations between 2025 and 2027.
In France, Intel plans to build its new European research hub, creating 1,000 new high-tech jobs.
The company will also increase its lab space in Poland and plans to establish joint labs with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center in Spain for advanced computing.
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger had announced plans in September to spend $88 billion in Europe over the next decade, and the choice of sites comes after some EU governments including Italy offered big incentives to try and woo the chipmaker to invest in their countries.
Spreading its factories around different locations could help the company get more subsidies from different countries.
But Intel will have to negotiate with each European country where it's locating facilities for state aid, European Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton told journalists.
He also said the Commission was talking with other chipmakers and hoping to make similar announcements in the coming months, but did not provide details.

2022-03-15 00:00:00+00:00,Apple (AAPL) is Expected To Launch iPhone 14 in Four Variants,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-aapl-is-expected-to-launch-iphone-14-in-four-variants,,,"Per 9to5mac, Apple AAPL has four new models lined up to be launched in the iPhone 14 series. Apple has recently released the iPhone 13 series and is already working on iPhone 14.

Apple’s iPhone 14 variants, codenamed D27 and D28, will be available in 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch versions, while the mini version will be discontinued in the new series.

The mid-range phones will have the same display size as iPhone 13, while iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max will be slightly taller in order to accommodate the new design.

Per Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the two pro models in the iPhone 14 series will be upgraded to the new A16 chip, while the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max will contain the A15 chip.

This is the first time in a decade that Apple is bifurcating the iPhone specs based on the type of chip series.

Apple’s iPhone sales are already benefiting from higher average selling price (ASP), with strong demand for iPhone 13. The launch of iPhone 14 is expected to further contribute to the increasing sales figure in fiscal 2022.

iPhone sales increased 9.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 from the year-ago quarter to $71.63 billion and accounted for 57.8% of total sales.

In the year-to-date period, the company’s shares have fallen 23.7% compared with the Zacks Computer-Mini Computers industry’s and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s declines of 15.1% and 18.9%, respectively.

Apple Banks On In-House Processors to Fight Supply Chain Issue 
Apple has recently launched the M1 Ultra processor, which is the most powerful chip that Apple has ever created.
The new M-series chip is designed by utilizing Apple’s own packaging architecture, UtraFusion, to interconnect the die of two M1 max chips across over 10,000 signals, and possesses incredible computing power.

The newly designed M1 chip is part of a year-long strategy to shift from Intel INTC processors to its in-house processors.

Apple has been heavily dependent on Intel for its chips used in the iPad. However, due to the persistent supply chain issues, Apple could not meet demand with adequate supply. Apple decided to reduce its dependency on third-party sources and manufacture its own chips to support its different products.
Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to Consider
Apple currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Here are a few other stocks worth considering in the broader Computer and Technology Sector that investors can consider:

ASGN ASGN carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

ASGN shares have fallen 12.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry and the Computer and Technology sector’s declines of 22.3% and 18.9%, respectively.

Advanced Micro Devices AMD carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

AMD shares have lost 28.9% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry and the Computer and Technology sector’s declines of 20.9% and 18.9%, respectively.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-03-15 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Growth Stocks That Are a Fantastic Long-Term Value,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-growth-stocks-that-are-a-fantastic-long-term-value,,,"The last year or so has been tough going for growth stocks, but the last few months have been especially brutal. With the Federal Reserve poised to start hiking interest rates, the market's appetite for fast-growing companies has completely soured. Many stocks have crashed like it's the 2000 dot-com bubble bursting all over again.
That doesn't mean these investments are toast, though. On the contrary, high-quality, fast-growing businesses look downright cheap now, considering their long-term prospects. Three that look like especially good values right now are Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT), and Doximity (NYSE: DOCS).

Shopify: A top democratizer of e-commerce
The Great Resignation continues to hit corporate America hard. In Jan. 2022, 4.3 million people quit their jobs (the record monthly number was 4.5 million from Nov. 2021), and many of these folks are starting their own businesses. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, new business applications continue at a near-record pace.
This isn't simply a product of employee frustration being taken out on their employers. Internet technology has reached a point where it's easier than ever for many people to start their own gig. Shopify has been a massive player in this space with its suite of software to help small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs manage all aspects of an e-commerce operation.
As the effects of the pandemic wind down, Shopify's growth trajectory is slowing. But its official (albeit nonspecific) guidance for 2022 is quite noteworthy: Revenue growth is expected to slow from the 57% rate logged in 2021, but it will continue to handily outpace the double-digit percentage growth of the e-commerce market overall.
As of this writing, Shopify stock is down over 70% from its all-time high and has given back all of its gains since the pandemic started. That's right: Even though the e-commerce trend accelerated over the last two years, a simple look at Shopify stock would imply the company has coughed up all of its progress in helping the world bring businesses online -- except the exact opposite has happened. The company is stronger than ever and nowhere close to being done innovating on behalf of its users.
Initiatives to watch in the next couple of years include Shopify's work on its Fulfillment Network to help small businesses provide the same kind of order-delivery services that helped make Amazon a success. Other more niche capabilities include a platform to help businesses sell NFTs directly to customers.
And all this will cost money, which means the 24 times trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a little deceiving. Basically, based on forward profit estimates, this isn't exactly a cheap stock (it trades for 97 times one-year forward earnings estimates).
Nevertheless, Shopify has proven it can be highly profitable, but it's choosing to aggressively invest those profits to promote further expansion -- both for itself and for the millions of small businesses that have grown to rely on its services. I'm a buyer and rooting for Shopify and the democratization of the retail industry.
Applied Materials: New chip equipment for a new era of chip manufacturing
The semiconductor industry is booming right now because of a global shortage of chips. The pandemic and supply chain issues are only partly to blame. These tiny but mighty building blocks of computing technology are undergoing a revolution as they find themselves in everything from cars to home appliances to industrial equipment. Annual industry sales totaled $556 billion last year, and some outlooks (including that of Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger) say that figure will reach $1 trillion by the end of this decade.
A lot more chips will need to be manufactured every year to accommodate this secular growth trend, but this explosion in chip manufacturing will be fueled by companies like Applied Materials (AMAT from here on). You see, AMAT -- along with peers like Lam Research and ASML Holdings -- dominates the field when it comes to developing and selling the machines used to fabricate chips. As chip manufacturers gear up to increase their production capacities and countries worldwide look to bring some production closer to home to withstand future supply disruptions, AMAT is likely to be a big winner.
In fact, management said on the lastearnings callthey believe global fab equipment spending could reach $100 billion in 2022, up from the roughly $65 billion in 2021 and the previous record of about $60 billion back in 2018 (before the U.S.-China trade war started to take a toll on the industry).
Granted, as this is a form of manufacturing, AMAT's business is likely to be cyclical going forward. Sales and profits will ebb and flow as customer demand for equipment changes each year depending on the construction/expansion of facilities. Nevertheless, the company expects strong double-digit percentage revenue growth this year and another year of growth in 2023, based on initial planning from its chip fab partners. After getting pummeled as of late, the stock trades for just 18 times trailing 12-month free cash flow and doles out nearly all of its free cash flow every year via dividends and share repurchases.
AMAT looks cheap right now if you're searching for a long-term growth story from the semiconductor industry.
Doximity: Making life easier for medical professionals
Healthcare is one of those industries almost everyone agrees could use a serious makeover. The cost of obtaining care has been rising for years, and healthcare professionals are strapped for time because of an aging U.S. population. Suffice to say, patients and care providers are in need of help.
Computing technology is beginning to shake things up in the medical field, and Doximity is just one example of how that's happening. Think of Doximity as a type of social network app but on steroids. Often compared to Microsoft's LinkedIn, key features keep medical professionals up-to-date on the news, help them stay in touch with other care providers, and provide a marketing platform for the industry.
But this is more than just social interaction. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a serious deal, but Doximity allows doctors to find and refer patients in a HIPAA-compliant format. Users can make outbound voice and video calls to patients or send and sign digital documents. And a new feature, physician schedule management, is coming via Doximity's acquisition of small software provider Amion.
Telemedicine -- care provided in a virtual format via phone or web-based video -- isn't going away as the pandemic winds down. Doximity is emerging not only as a capable solution but also as an intriguing growth story. Though the stock's first year since its initial public offering (IPO) in summer 2021 has been tenuous (shares are down over 60% from their all-time high and back to where they made their public debut), financial results have been fantastic. Revenue grew 78% to $250 million through the nine months ended Dec. 31, 2021, and free cash flow was $76 million (good for a 30% free-cash-flow margin).
That makes Doximity a rare company that's generating both rapid sales growth and very healthy profit margins. After waiting on the sidelines since the IPO last June, I'm ready to pounce. Shares trade for a premium 66 times trailing 12-month free cash flow, but that could prove to be quite a bargain if the company continues to expand at the rate it has been for a few more years.

2022-03-15 00:00:00+00:00,Intel To Spend More Than EUR 33 Bln On Manufacturing Investments In European Union,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-to-spend-more-than-eur-33-bln-on-manufacturing-investments-in-european-union,,,"(RTTNews) - Intel (INTC) announced the first phase of its plans to invest as much as 80 billion euros in the European Union over the next decade along the entire semiconductor value chain. This includes plans to invest an initial 17 billion euros into a leading-edge semiconductor fab mega-site in Germany, to create a new R&D and design hub in France, and to invest in R&D, manufacturing and foundry services in Ireland, Italy, Poland and Spain. The new fabs are expected to deliver chips using Intel's most advanced, Angstrom-era transistor technologies, serving the needs of both foundry customers and Intel for Europe and globally.
In the initial phase, the company plans to develop two first-of-their-kind semiconductor fabs in Magdeburg, Germany. Intel believes Germany is an ideal place to establish a new hub - a Silicon Junction - for advanced chipmaking. The company plans to initially invest 17 billion euros. Intel is also continuing to invest in its Leixlip, Ireland, expansion project, spending an additional 12 billion euros and doubling the manufacturing space to bring Intel 4 process technology to Europe and expand foundry services. Also, Intel and Italy have entered into negotiations to enable a state-of-the-art back-end manufacturing facility with a potential investment of up to 4.5 billion euros. In total, the company plans to spend more than 33 billion euros on these manufacturing investments.
Around Plateau de Saclay, France, Intel plans to build its new European R&D hub. France will become Intel's European headquarters for high performance computing and artificial intelligence design capabilities. Also, Intel plans to establish its main European foundry design center in France. In Gdansk, Poland, Intel is increasing its lab space by 50%.
Pat Gelsinger, CEO of Intel, said: ""The EU Chips Act will empower private companies and governments to work together to drastically advance Europe's position in the semiconductor sector. We are committed to playing an essential role in shaping Europe's digital future for decades to come.""

Chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (NYSE:TSM) stock has held up fairly well in 2021 but experienced a pulled back along with its tech peers in 2022. TSMC is the ninth highest valued company in the world. It boasts a market capitalization of $534.38 billion.

What makes TSM a must-have stock in your portfolio? The chips churned out by the contract manufacturer are ubiquitous. They can found powering most of the consumer electronics devices sold world over. TSMC supplies life blood to all those fabless semiconductor companies that are heavily reliant on it.
Founded in 1987, the company manufactures chips that cater to diverse applications and products. The diversification of the client base renders the company immune to softness that is specific to a particular sector/industry. It has also been in the forefront innovation and cutting-edge technology. In 2020, the Hsinchu, Taiwan-headquartered company had 281 distinct process technologies and manufactured 11,617 products for 510 customers.
TSMC Is a Cut Above the Rest
TSMC is already working on the next-gen chip manufacturing technology — the 3 nanometer (nm) process node tech, dubbed N3, ahead of many others in the industry. The technology is able to offer a nearly 70% logic density gain, a 15% speed improvement at the same power, and a 30% power reduction at the same speed compared to current 5 nm technology.
7 Growth Stocks That Trade at Attractive Valuations
Volume production of the N3 is expected to commence in the second half of 2022.
An improved iteration of N3, named N3e, which is currently being tested, has shown an improvement in yield, a Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) note shared on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) revealed. Analysts from the firm expect the company to freeze the N3e process flow by the end of March and begin volume production in the second quarter. This would put it around an entire quarter ahead of schedule.
To put things in perspective, Samsung is the only other chipmaker that has taken to 5 nm technology. Chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which has opted to remain an integrated device manufacturer (IDM), hasn’t still made much headway in its quest to wrest back process technology leadership after a series of product missteps.
TSMC commanded a 53.1% share of foundry market in the third quarter of 2021. Samsung was a distant second with a 17.1% share.
TSM Stock Ticks All Boxes With Its Q4
TSMC’s fourth-quarter revenues climbed 21.2% year-over-year and 5.7% quarter-over-quarter to $15.74 billion.
Revenue Contribution by Different Verticals in Q4
Source: Chart by Shanthi Rexaline
The 7 nm and 5 nm process technologies, collectively called advanced technologies by TSMC, contributed about 31% and 19% of wafer revenues, respectively. Fourth-quarter gross margin expanded 1.4 percent points (ppt) sequentially to 52.7% on cost improvement and operating margin grew 0.5 ppt to 41.7%.
The company ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of $42.95 billion.
Robust Chip Industry Outlook Underpins Demand
TSMC guided to first-quarter revenues of $16.6 billion – $17.2 billion. The midpoint of the range suggests a 7.4% quarter-over-quarter increase.
Wendell Huang, TSMC’s Vice President and Chief Financial Officer said on theearnings call
We expect our business in the first quarter to be supported by HPC-related demand, continued recovery in the automotive segment and a milder smartphone seasonality than in recent years.
Citing structural increase in chip demand and the industry trends of 5G and high performance computing (HPC) applications, TSMC hiked its 2022 capital expenditures (capex) from 34% to 47%. From about to $40 billion to $44 billion. The company expects to use 70% – 80% of the capex on advanced process technologies, including 2 nm, 3 nm, and 5 nm technologies.
The global chip industry is well positioned on a trajectory of “robust growth” in 2022, according to management consulting and accounting firm Deloitte. The firm expects the industry to grow at a robust clip of 10% in 2022 to $600 billion.
Deloitte sees strong secular growth trend in the coming years:
Over the long run, semiconductor revenues are likely to oscillate around a trend line. Still, that trend line looks steeper than ever before as we enter a period of robust secular growth.
Bottom Line on TSM Stock
Given TSMC’s technological leadership, strong competitive positioning, flawless execution, operational efficiency and the positive industry outlook, the future holds promise for the Taiwanese company.
The foundry is shooting for long-term revenue compounded annual revenue growth of 15% – 20% over the next several years. TSMC is also confident of achieving long-term gross margin of 53% or higher.
TSMC’s CEO C.C. Wei said on theearnings callthat the company expects to outgrow its fabless and IDM peers in 2022.
When weighed against the prospects, TSM stock looks reasonably valued. It is trading at 9.82 times its trailing-twelve-month (TTM) sales. The forward price to earnings (P/E) for the stock is 20.92, roughly in line with the industry’s 18.5. In comparison AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is trading at a TTM price to sales (P/S) ratio of 9.05 and forward P/E of 29.85.
TSM stock, therefore, could be the best fit for investors who are looking to load their portfolio with a high-growth tech stock that is fairly insulated against industry-wide and economic shocks.

2022-03-12 00:00:00+00:00,2 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy in March,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-dividend-paying-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-march,,,"Inflation is running higher than it has in 40 years, national average gas prices just broke through to record highs, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine is roiling commodities markets.
Couple all this with the Federal Reserve set to initiate the first of several interest rate hikes this month, and stocks are facing pressures they haven't seen in some time. Yet one of the pillars investors can lean on in times of upheaval are dividend stocks. Their payments provide a measure of calm in a sea of turmoil.
Image source: Getty Images.
Last year, the asset managers at Hartford Funds released a report showing the performance of the S&P 500 index both with dividends and without, going all the way back to 1930. It discovered dividend-paying stocks contributed 41% to the total return of the index over that 90-year period.
It covered periods very similar to what we're experiencing now, war and recessions, as well as the so-called ""lost decade,"" the 2000s, when the tech stock bubble burst, 9/11 happened, and the housing market crashed. That resulted in the S&P 500 generating negative returns for investors, but dividend stocks actually returned a positive 1.8%.
Whether you're a recent convert to dividend investing or have long seen the value in owning stocks that pay you to hold them, the question remains: Which dividend stocks do you buy?
Simply chasing yield is a risky pursuit, since a higher yield may indicate higher risk -- you need to look at the business too. This pair of dividend-paying tech stocks happen to not only be solid income stocks but also benefit from having great growth potential as well.

1. Texas Instruments
Chipmaker Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) isn't a manufacturer of flashy graphic processors like Nvidia or high-end central processing units like those made by Intel. Instead, its chips are the workhorses of industry, the analog and embedded chips used by a wide range of customers in the automotive, communications, consumer electronics, and industrial markets.
The no-nonsense semiconductor stock is also largely shielded from the global computer chip shortage hobbling many of its peers. Over three-quarters of its $18.3 billion in annual revenue comes from the analog chips that are produced at its own factories. These were primarily responsible for the 27% year-over-year growth recorded.
Texas Instruments pays a quarterly dividend of $1.17 per share that currently yields 2.8% annually. It has raised the payout every year for 18 consecutive years, putting it on track to become a Dividend Aristocrat, or a company that hikes its dividend for 25 years or more.
Over the past three years, it has increased the dividend at a compounded rate of 17% annually, greater than the typical computer stock and more than double the rate of the average Nasdaq company.
The chipmaker also has a solid payout ratio of around 62%, a key metric for dividend investors, as it helps highlight the sustainability of a dividend. Maintaining the payout is also important for the company, and Texas Instrument chairman, president, and CEO Rich Templeton recently said, ""Our dividends and stock repurchases reflect our continued commitment to return all free cash flow to our owners.""
Of the $8.8 billion in operating cash flow Texas Instruments generated in 2021, it returned $4.4 billion worth to investors in the form of dividends and stock buybacks.

2. Apple
Investors typically aren't buying Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock for its dividend. The tech giant pays investors $0.88 per share on an annual basis for a yield of 0.55%. Think of it as juicing your investment.
Apple reintroduced the payout in 2012 after having suspended it in 1995 but since then has consistently increased the payout every year. In fact, over the last three years, Apple raised its dividend on average by almost 23% annually. And because its payout ratio is under 15%, it is highly sustainable and has plenty of room to be increased by similar double-digit rates for years to come.
The tech star had over $37 billion in cash burning a hole in its pocket at the end of January, along with another $27 billion in short-term investments. Its ability to keep its finger on the pulse of what consumers are looking for ensures sales will continue to grow to support its needs for increasing shareholder value.
Apple just revealed its latest consumer electronic products, and it met expectations for a new, low-cost but feature-rich iPhone SE 3, an upgraded iPad Air, a macro Mac Mini called Mac Studio, and a new Studio Display.
Analysts keep writing Apple off, believing the best of its days are behind it, but the tech leader manages to regularly subvert expectations. With a large, loyal customer following, primarily because of its stability, consistency, and quality over the years, it has pricing power few other companies can match.
In short, Apple is a dividend tech stock that you buy for the capital appreciation to come, bolstered by the income you get from a growing dividend payment.

Next up: $1 Trillion,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/semiconductor-sales-just-passed-%24500-billion.-next-up%3A-%241-trillion,,,"Even amid a global chip shortage, the semiconductor industry continues to reach new highs in terms of sales. In this Motley Fool Live segment from ""Semiconductor Revolution,"" recorded on Feb. 17, Fool contributors Nicholas Rossolillo, Jose Najarro, and Danny Vena discuss the astounding growth in the semiconductor chip market.
{% sfr %}
Nicholas Rossolillo: News this week came out from the Semiconductor Industry Association. Sales actually reached or surpassed $500 billion globally for the first time. I've got a chart here that shows what those sales look like over the last, I don't know, roughly decade and a half, as well as expectations for this year, for 2022. You can see in 2021, almost 540 billion in sales. Really, really big jump over the last few years, and we're still in the midst of the chip shortage. So there is some expectations that we might reach 600 billion this year.
Again, just really big double-digit growth and it's compounding. But I think this is to be expected because, I know Danny is going to talk about Intel here in a bit, but their new-ish CEO, Pat Gelsinger, last quarter said that he sees global chip sales reaching one trillion dollars by the end of this decade. So we're really not that far off anymore at this point, and we can see the cyclicality from year to year in this industry. But like we talk about a lot, higher lows and higher highs, this is a secular growth trend. It's the building blocks of technology. A lot of good stuff happening here in the semiconductor industry.
Jose Najarro: Yeah. Like you mentioned, Nick, I definitely heard numerous CEOs of companies share that same thought that by the end of this decade, we're going to hit that one trillion dollar. I think it's a great thing that you mentioned that, hey, it's not going to be a straight line. It doesn't mean every year from now is going to be a straight line. Sometimes we are going to get the cyclicality of semiconductor. So there might be a year where we might fall off. But it does seem from that chart, we are hitting higher lows each time. Danny, any thoughts on the overall sales numbers?
Danny Vena: The thing that stands out for me is the fact that we have, for the past year, probably longer, been talking about a chip shortage, and yet we're hitting new highs in terms of chip sales. I suspect that the numbers would have been significantly higher if we had been able to meet capacity over the course of the last year. I suspect as the logistics and supply chain issues iron themselves out, we've been on a downturn in terms of new cases of COVID, and I think once we see the solid growth in the chip market that I think we should have seen over the past year, I think the numbers are going to be much higher than perhaps people expect.

2022-03-11 00:00:00+00:00,This Semiconductor Market Will Boom by 2030,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-semiconductor-market-will-boom-by-2030,,,"As a massive wave of vehicle electrification comes online in the coming years, demand will continue to grow for semiconductors in the auto industry. In this Motley Fool Live segment from ""Semiconductor Revolution,"" recorded on Feb. 17, Fool contributors Jose Najarro, Danny Vena, and Nicholas Rossolillo discuss how new automotive technologies will drive the future demand for semiconductors.
{% sfr %}
Jose Najarro: The automobile industry is set to have a compounded annual growth rate of 12.3 percent through 2025. I think anything growing at those levels for the next 3-4 years is pretty impressive. The reason for this growth is not just the overall electric vehicles, but that is a major trend. The battery and electric vehicles are growing, but we're also seeing the growth in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, pretty much self-driving car. One thing to note is that, hey, just because not every electric vehicle is going to be a self-driving car and not every self-driving car also will tend to be electric vehicle. You can mix and match to some extent. Also they are seeing an increase in infotainment and telematics systems. Those three systems are really driving the amount of chips needed in the automotive industry.
For example, the average battery electric vehicle produces three times more semiconductor revenue than a vehicle with traditional internal combustion engine. Again, this is a market that is growing at dramatic levels. We're seeing Intel, which we're going to talk about in a bit, spin off their smart vehicle portion of their business. Nvidia during theearnings call they mentioned that, hey, the drive system is going to be a strong grower in the futures. Numerous companies are producing strong numbers with this electric or this automobile industry. Do you guys have any thoughts in the automobile industry with regards to semiconductors?
Danny Vena: Yeah. When I think about Intel and I think about the fact that it's going to spin off Mobileye, I don't necessarily think they're doing that for any other reason than they are trying to unlock a little bit of shareholder value and maybe get a little cash out of the deal. I don't think there's going to be any, there's no question that Mobileye is going to be one of those companies, particularly when you're talking about these systems that we use for smart vehicles or vehicles that have self-driving technology and it doesn't have to be full level 4, car drives by itself. It can be those driver assistance modules that help with things like cruise control and entertainment systems and some of the other things in the vehicle. I think they're going to spin off Mobileye, but I would guess that they're going to maintain a majority share of that company because I think that's a high-growth industry. But that said, there's a lot of different ways that driver assistance technology can be used that comes short of the full self-driving cars, and all of those are going to require an increased number of semiconductors to power those systems.
Jose Najarro: Nick, anything you would like to add?
Nicholas Rossolillo: Yeah. In general terms, in the auto industry, it was just two decades ago that the cost to produce a vehicle, like 20 percent or so of the cost to manufacturer a vehicle was like 20 percent electronic components. We're headed toward 50 percent. By the end of this decade, the general trend is half of the cost to produce a vehicle is going to be electronics, semiconductors, and related stuff. That's a huge trend, given the world spend so much on automobiles. Like you mentioned earlier, Jose, the advanced driver systems are a big deal.
But just vehicle electrification alone, I think what we're seeing here is just like in the 2010s we saw big, bulky, ugly computers get turned into these guys, super sleek, sexy, high-powered computing little units. I think that's happening into the car now. This estimate that you pointed out, about 12 percent compound annual growth, it does fit in with what a lot of the chip companies that play in this market have been saying recently. They're predicting maybe a little bit of flattening in sales maybe in the next year or two. But over the next 3-4 years, we're going to see some really strong growth as this massive wave of vehicle electrification comes online.

2022-03-10 00:00:00+00:00,Advanced Micro Devices: The Snapback Rally Is On,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/advanced-micro-devices%3A-the-snapback-rally-is-on,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock cost 5.4% more when trading opened on Mar. 9 than the previous open on Mar. 8.
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
The rally had little to do with the company’s growth prospects, which remain excellent. The acquisition of Xilinx means bigger profits are ahead. Additionally, Wall Street still loves Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Lisa Su.
What we’re seeing, instead, is another example of Wall Street’s perverse nature. It always looks ahead. It buys the rumor and sells the news.
AMD Strengths
AMD is down by nearly one-third since Nov. 29. Even its 3% gain in overnight trading leaves it below $109 per share. It had peaked at nearly $162 in November. The market cap is now $169 billion on 2021 sales of $16.4 billion. The price to earnings ratio is 40.49. Even at its depressed price, AMD stock is not cheap.
8 Strong Uptrend Stocks to Buy on the Next Dip
Why, then, are so many buying the dip? AMD’s 2021 revenue came in at $16.4 billion. With Xilinx added, 2021 revenue is closer to $20 billion. AMD designs continue to lead those of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the microprocessor space. It is the biggest competitor to Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in graphics. AMD may be second here, but it can still win big contracts in gaming, as well as cloud data centers.  It is Intel that is now stuck with the low-end markets AMD is abandoning, not the other way around.
Su says the chip shortage won’t end in 2022, meaning prices will remain firm. That is a reversal from her position last September.
AMD is a chip designer, so it doesn’t have the capital requirements of Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), which is its primary supplier. That means it ended 2021 with $3.6 billion in cash on the books and just $350 million in long-term debt. Operating cash flow more than tripled last year to $3.5 billion and will rise further this year. Analysts expect another march toward that all-time high.
AMD Weaknesses
While there are strengths, there are also reasons for caution.
AMD stock is more volatile than Intel. While AMD’s market cap briefly topped Intel’s recently, Intel has been outperforming it in 2022, down 9.9% year-to-date against 14% for AMD. That is because AMD remains just one quarter the size of Intel, even with Xilinx’s sales added in.
Geopolitical risk is also greater with AMD stock. Should Ukraine collapse and China make a move against Taiwan, home of its chip supplier (and Su’s birthplace), Intel will be a better stock to be in. Intel would be the primary beneficiary of the billions in aid President Joe Biden’s administration wants to gift the industry. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger was even at the State of the Union address. Additionally, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion on Ukraine has helped the bill move forward.
Taiwan Semiconductor is also building new fabs, so it is possible that the current shortage ends in 2024. The current buying cycle has lasted so long that many forget semiconductors can be as much of a boom-and-bust business as oil.
The Bottom Line on AMD Stock
Like everyone else, I’ve lost a lot of money on my semiconductor investments lately.
What is happening right now is that fundamentals are re-asserting themselves ahead of geopolitics. Those indicate smooth sailing for AMD over the next few years.
But the shocks could return. Even if they don’t, fundamentals indicate that the current shortage will end. That will mean an end to AMD’s excessive profits. AMD has been bringing over 20% of revenue to the net income line. But it was just three years ago that it was bringing just 5% of revenue to net income. In 2017, it lost money.
AMD was one of the great stocks of the last decade, but now it is a giant. Giants move more slowly.

2022-03-10 00:00:00+00:00,Amazon Makes Its Case to Join the Dow,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-makes-its-case-to-join-the-dow,,,"The stock market continued to suffer declines on Thursday, and as we've seen many times in the recent past, the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) proved to be more volatile than most other stock market indexes. As of noon ET today, the Nasdaq was down 247 points, or nearly 1.9%, to stay just over the 13,000 mark. That's not quite 20% below its all-time high, but it hardly indicates for certain that the bear market is over.
Gaining ground today, though, was Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The e-commerce giant represents a big part of the Nasdaq, and its latest announcement suggests that the company might be making its move to persuade the index managers at S&P Dow Jones Indices to admit Amazon as one of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Time to split?
Shares of Amazon had risen more than 5% on Thursday by midday. The company made a couple of moves that should arguably not have a huge impact on the stock. In reality, though, investors saw the announcement as a positive sign.
Amazon's first strategic move was to authorize a 20-for-1 stock split. That will require an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, which in turn will require shareholder approval at the company's May 25 annual shareholder meeting.
If approved, investors can expect Amazon stock to start reflecting its split-adjusted price starting on June 6. Shareholders should get credited with the 19 extra shares for each share they currently own on or around June 3.

The other thing Amazon put into place was a massive $10 billion stock repurchase program. The authorization from the Amazon board allows for purchases through open-market transactions or with entities in private negotiations.
One thing that investors should remember, though, is that just because a company authorizes a buyback doesn't mean that it will necessarily happen. Indeed, Amazon said that the new $10 billion program will replace an existing $5 billion program from 2016, and it had only repurchased $2.12 billion in stock in that six-year span.
Could Amazon join Alphabet in the Dow?
The news is interesting because it follows a 20-for-1 split announcement from fellow tech giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) just over a month ago. Like Amazon, Alphabet had long had an extremely high price above $2,000 per share, and the announced split would take its per-share price down to the $130 to $150 range.
Stock splits have no impact on the intrinsic value of the company, as each new share will have a price of roughly a 20th of its old price. But a lower stock price would allow S&P Dow Jones Indices to consider inviting Amazon to join the Dow Jones Industrials. The price-weighted index counts on its constituent stocks having similar share prices in order to avoid disproportionate influence from a small set of stocks.
To make room for Amazon, the Dow would need to expel one of its current components. With relatively low prices, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) would be potential candidates in the tech arena.
Alternatively, given the fact that Amazon straddles the internet-retail and the communications-infrastructure industries, replacing companies like Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) or Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) might be potential options as well.
When large companies like Amazon and Alphabet aren't part of the Dow, it makes the venerable market benchmark seem out of touch. These stock splits could change that, and it'll be interesting to see if S&P Dow Jones Indices gets the hint.

2022-03-10 00:00:00+00:00,Bluegreen Vacations and Par Pacific have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bluegreen-vacations-and-par-pacific-have-been-highlighted-as-zacks-bull-and-bear-of-the,,,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – March 10, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Bluegreen Vacations BVH as the Bull of the Day and Par Pacific PARR asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Apple AAPL, Intel INTC and Celestica CLS.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
Bull of the Day:
A huge bounce back for the market as crude oil prices came down from the moon to the stratosphere. The relief rally was great for downtrodden stocks that could not get themselves out of a rut. The one-day rally is not enough for the long-term. For the long-term, you need earnings. One way to find stocks with earnings staying power is by leaning on the Zacks Rank. Stocks with favorable Zacks Ranks have the strongest earnings trends. These trends can help these stocks outperform the broad market when it matters.
Today’s Bull of the Day is a stock in the good graces of our Zacks Rank. It’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Bluegreen Vacations. Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation operates as a vacation ownership company. It markets and sells vacation ownership interests (VOI); and manages resorts in leisure and urban destinations, including Orlando, Las Vegas, Myrtle Beach, Charleston and New Orleans, and others. The company also provides resort management, mortgage, title, reservation, and construction design and development services; and financing to qualified VOI purchasers, as well as management services to the vacation club and homeowners' associations. Its resort network includes 45 club resorts and 23 club associate resorts, as well as 128 Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's stores.
It may not feel like it’s ever going to end, but the COVID pandemic will eventually sink off into the distance. Then, we will get back to doing things we used to do like go on vacations. Bluegreen sells vacation packages and ownership. The big boys in this space include Marriott Vacations and Hilton Grand Vacations.These stocks currently trade at near double-digit enterprise value to 2022 earnings estimate multiples. Bluegreen trades close to half that.
That is not the reason for the favorable Zacks Rank. Over the last week, analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current year and next year. The bullish moves have pushed up the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from $2.81 to $2.95 while next year’s number is up from $3.11 to $3.28. This comes on the heels of the company’s share buyback announcement, good for 8.8% of its market cap. On March 8th, Truist reiterated its “Buy” rating and raised its price target to $56 from $44.
Bear of the Day:
Do not for one second believe that a single OPEC headline is suddenly going to reverse oil prices. High prices are not exactly a detriment to them. However, we may be past the peak hype of where oil might go in the short-term. That does not mean that you should avoid investing in the sector. To the contrary, it is probably a great time to stick with it, you just have to do it the right way. Try to avoid stocks in the energy sector with weak earnings trends. If a company can’t make a ton of money when oil is over $100 a barrel, what happens when it comes back down to Earth?
Today’s Bear of the Day is an oil stock that has seen estimates move to the downside while oil is on the rise. I’m talking about Par Pacific. Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. owns and operates energy and infrastructure businesses. The company operates through three segments: Refining, Retail, and Logistics.
The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The reason for the unfavorable rank is the negative earnings estimate revisions coming from analysts recently. Over the last thirty days, two analysts have cut their earnings estimates for the current year while one has done so for next year. The impact to current year Zacks Consensus Estimate is the most dramatic. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped from 67 cents sixty days ago to 14 cents today. Next year’s number is off from $1.26 to $1 even. That means that the current PE sits all the way up at 94x. That will reel in a bit next year with the $1 target. That EPS growth is expected to come on a contraction of 2.73% to revenue.
The Oil and Gas – Refining and Marketing industry ranks in the Top 33% of our Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Apple's (AAPL) New iPad Air Integrated with Ultra-Fast M1 Chip
Apple recently announced the launch of its updated iPad air with the newly designed M1 chip made specifically for Mac. This new inclusion will provide a leap in performance as the newly designed chip is the most powerful chip that Apple has ever created.
The newly designed M1 chip is part of a year-long strategy to shift from Intel processors to its in-house processors.
Apple has been heavily dependent on Intel for its chips used in the iPad. However, due to the persistent supply chain issues Apple could not meet demand with adequate supply. Apple decided to reduce its dependency on third-party sources and manufacture its own chips to support its different products.
iPad sales of $7.25 billion declined 14.1% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and accounted for 5.8% of total sales. Customer demand for iPad Pro was robust in the reported quarter.
The new iPad features 5G connectivity, 8-core GPU and CPU, a 60% performance increase and 2x faster graphics, a 16-core neural engine, a P3 wide color with True Tone, 2x faster USB-C port and 64GB and 256GB storage options.
In the year-to-date period, Apple stock has fallen 11.3% compared with the Zacks Computer-Mini Computers  industry’s and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s fall of 10.2% and 19.2%, respectively.

2022-03-10 00:00:00+00:00,The New Dip In Advanced Micro Devices Is a Buying Opportunity ,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-new-dip-in-advanced-micro-devices-is-a-buying-opportunity,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Tech giant Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is already making solid strides in the industry. The company is winning the console market and is at the top when it comes to semiconductor chips. However, AMD stock is not reflecting this.
Source: Joseph GTK / Shutterstock.com
The stock is down 12% over the past month and has gone from the high of $132 to $108 today. There is no particular reason for the dip. AMD hasn’t made any announcements nor is there any analyst downgrade. The stock is falling for macroeconomic reasons but for long-term investors, this is a solid buying opportunity. AMD might face the heat due to the Russia-Ukraine war but it will not slow the company’s growth rate for the longer term. 
AMD stock may not be this low anytime in the future and this is the best time to load up on the stock. Considering the potential of the company, I am always bullish on the stock and I believe it is the one for the long term. If you did not have the chance to buy the stock, now is the perfect opportunity to do so.
Here’s why I think you should have AMD stock in your portfolio.
Stellar Financials
AMD has enjoyed a blowout quarter and despite the pandemic or the supply chain issues, there was no slowdown in the company’s growth momentum. This speaks for exceptional management and execution.
7 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy for 2022
The company reported a revenue of $4.8 billion in the fourth quarter and total revenue of $16.4 billion in the year. AMD is consistently growing and the quarterly numbers are proof that it has solid fundamentals. It has projected a revenue of $21.5 billion for 2022, which is a massive rise from 2021. If you are concerned about the financials of the company, worry not. AMD has everything in control and it has reported some of the best numbers in the industry and I believe it will continue to do so throughout 2022. 
That said, AMD is known for their gold standard chips in the CPU and GPU markets. It is a major challenger to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and is consistently taking a bite of Intel’s share. Additionally, AMD has a positive outlook for the current quarter which shows the company’s confidence to tread through rough waters. 
AMD Stock Repurchase
All of us love a little bit of share buyback action and AMD is giving us just that. The company recently disclosed that it has authorized an $8 billion share repurchase program out of which it has already purchased $3 billion worth of shares in the last four quarters. AMD plans to fund the repurchase through cash generated from operations.
This program is a solid representation of the company’s cash generation abilities and commitment towards investor returns. AMD had a cash balance of $3.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and it generated $822 million in the quarter through cash from operations. 
The stock was up after the announcement of the repurchase program. 
The Bottom Line on AMD Stock
All in all, AMD is a top tech company to own and one that will not disappoint. Do not judge the company based on the short-term developments or dips. Every dip in AMD stock is a chance to add it to your portfolio. As the company continues to expand and take a larger share from Intel, it will continue to report strong numbers and this will generate value for shareholders. 
The demand for AMD’s products and chips is not going to slow down anytime in the future. With an asset-light business model, AMD has a stronghold in the industry and it will continue to impress customers and investors with solid products and numbers.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-03-09 00:00:00+00:00,4 Red Flags for ASML's Future,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-red-flags-for-asmls-future,,,"ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) is a linchpin of the global semiconductor market. The Dutch company is the world's largest manufacturer of lithography systems, which are used to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only supplier of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which are used to produce the world's smallest and densest chips.
The world's most advanced chip foundries -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Samsung -- all rely on ASML's lithography systems. As a result, it generates stable revenue growth, its gross margins are expanding, and its stock still looks reasonably valued at 35 times forward earnings.
I believe ASML is still a solid long-term investment, but four red flags have also appeared since the beginning of the year. Let's discuss these challenges and how they could throttle ASML's near-term gains.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. The fire at its Berlin plant
On Jan. 3, a fire broke out at ASML's factory in Berlin. It says the production of its older deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems experienced ""some disruption regarding components,"" but that it wouldn't affect the segment's output and revenue targets.
The fire also affected the wafer clamp, a module used to produce its EUV systems. During its fourth-quarter conference call later that month, CEO Peter Wennink said the company could manage that damage without suffering a ""significant impact"" to its EUV system output in 2022.
Those statements suggested the situation was under control, but the fire still rattled investors because a single DUV system costs $60 million and a single EUV system costs $150 million. Therefore, the delayed production of even a single system could drastically reduce ASML's revenue and cause it to miss analysts' expectations for 20% growth (to 22.3 billion euros, or $24.2 billion) in fiscal 2022.
2. Russia's invasion of Ukraine
The Russian-Ukrainian war, which started in late February, generates two significant headwinds for ASML.
First, the conflict is disrupting the global supply of neon gas, which ASML uses in small quantities for the gas-phase lasers in its DUV systems. Ukraine is the world's largest producer of neon gas, and ASML gets roughly a fifth of its supply from Ukraine and Russia. ASML has been seeking out alternative sources to maintain a stable supply of neon, but the soaring price of the gas could squeeze its gross margins until the conflict ends.
Second, ASML is one of the most valuable tech companies in Europe. Therefore, any escalation of tensions between Europe and Russia will likely drag down ASML along with the broader European indexes.
3. More headaches in China
ASML sells DUV systems in China, but the American and Dutch governments have repeatedly barred it from shipping its top-tier EUV systems to Chinese chipmakers -- which could enable them to catch up to TSMC, Samsung, and Intel in the ""process race"" to manufacture the world's most advanced chips. That ban represents a major flashpoint in the ongoing trade and tech wars between China and the United States.
In response, China has started to develop its own DUV and EUV systems -- and it might be copying some of ASML's designs. Just last month, ASML accused Dongfang Jingyuan Electron, a Chinese producer of software for chip manufacturing procedures, of stealing its intellectual property -- which suggests that some of its technologies have already been leaked to Chinese chipmakers.
ASML generated 16% of its system sales from mainland China in 2021, and that business could face unexpected challenges if state-backed Chinese companies suddenly roll out their own lithography systems.
4. TSMC's better-than-expected yield
TSMC is ASML's top customer and comprises most of its system sales to Taiwan, which accounted for 44% of its top line in 2021. TSMC's early adoption of ASML's pricey EUV systems gave it a major advantage against Samsung and Intel in the production of smaller chips.
ASML's current-generation (multi-patterning) EUV systems can be used to manufacture chips as small as 3nm. Its next-generation (high-NA) EUV systems, which are expected to be mass produced in 2025, can be used to produce 3nm chips and even smaller nodes. Therefore, ASML needs to sell a steady supply of current-gen EUV systems -- which generate much higher revenues than its DUV systems -- until those high-NA systems are launched.
However, a recent research report by Morgan Stanley declared that TSMC's initial 3nm production yields were ""higher than expected,"" which suggests that it will actually require fewer EUV systems to hit its production targets. That's all speculation for now, but a reduction in EUV shipments to TSMC could significantly throttle ASML's growth.
Why I'm still bullish on ASML
I personally own shares of ASML, and I'm still bullish on its prospects because it's a crucial gatekeeper of the chipmaking market. That said, I believe these near-term headwinds will prevent ASML's stock from rallying anytime soon. So for now, investors should just sit tight, accumulate some more shares if the stock drops, and focus on its long-term growth.

2022-03-09 00:00:00+00:00,"Third Point takes stake in Cano Health, pushes for company sale",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/third-point-takes-stake-in-cano-health-pushes-for-company-sale-0,,,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON, March 9 (Reuters) - Hedge fund Third Point LLC is pushing Cano Health CANO.N to put itself up for sale because the senior-care facility operator's stock price has tumbled since it went public with a blank check company.
The New York-based firm, run by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, said in a regulatory filing that it now owns 6.4% of the Miami-based company, making it the third-largest investor.
Third Point, which invests $18 billion, spent $106 million to buy 11.5 million shares, the filing said.
Loeb, who has run activist campaigns at Baxter International BAX.Nand Campbell Soup Company CPB.Nand recently pushed Intel Corp INTC.O to make changes, said his firm is currently not looking for board seats. The filing said the firm has ""confidence"" in the company's strategy and management team.
But that could change, the filing said, if the company fails to address the ""value gap"" between its share price and intrinsic value of the company.
Cano's sluggish stock price is related to the fact that investors have ""a largely unfavorable view of companies taken public through special purpose acquisition vehicles"", Loeb wrote. He urged the company to hire bankers and lawyers to review strategic alternatives and said ""this strategic review should focus on a sale.""
Cano Health closed its merger with investor Barry Sternlicht's special purpose acquisition company in June and its stock price lost more than half of its value. On Wednesday the stock price surged 40% on news Third Point was involved, valuing the company at $3 billion.
Cano said in a statement that it is ""successfully executing its strategy"" and that the business has strong momentum, ""as demonstrated by our 115% year-over-year membership growth in 2021 and continued growth into 2022."" The company, which operates primary care medical centers in eight U.S. states and Puerto Rico, also said it welcomes shareholder perspectives.
Third Point participated in a private placement alongside Sternlicht and Fidelity Management & Research Company and BlackRock, according to a statement made when the deal was announced.

2022-03-09 00:00:00+00:00,Apple's (AAPL) New iPad Air Integrated With Ultra-Fast M1 Chip,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apples-aapl-new-ipad-air-integrated-with-ultra-fast-m1-chip,,,"Apple AAPL recently announced the launch of its updated iPad air with the newly designed M1 chip made specifically for Mac. This new inclusion will provide a leap in performance as the newly designed chip is the most powerful chip that Apple has ever created.

The newly designed M1 chip is part of a year-long strategy to shift from Intel INTC processors to its in-house processors.

Apple has been heavily dependent on Intel for its chips used in the iPad. However, due to the persistent supply chain issues Apple could not meet demand with adequate supply. Apple decided to reduce its dependency on third-party sources and manufacture its own chips to support its different products.

iPad sales of $7.25 billion declined 14.1% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and accounted for 5.8% of total sales. Customer demand for iPad Pro was robust in the reported quarter.

The new iPad features 5G connectivity, 8-core GPU and CPU, a 60% performance increase and 2x faster graphics, a 16-core neural engine, a P3 wide color with True Tone, 2x faster USB-C port and 64GB and 256GB storage options.

In the year-to-date period, Apple stock has fallen 11.3% compared with the Zacks Computer-Mini Computers  industry’s and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s fall of 10.2% and 19.2%, respectively.
