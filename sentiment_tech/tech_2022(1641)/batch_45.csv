2022-02-28 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia's Quarter Shows Why It's the Best Tech Stock to Beat Inflation,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidias-quarter-shows-why-its-the-best-tech-stock-to-beat-inflation,,,"Inflation is on pace to be its highest in 40 years, driven by consumer demand and higher supply costs. Companies have seen raw-material prices soar over the last year, and not all of them are in the competitive position to pass those higher costs to customers.
Some investors can make the mistake of investing in value traps during periods like this. My preference is to look for companies experiencing robust demand for their products, even if the stocks have higher valuations. No investments are immune from a broad market sell-off, but companies experiencing lots of growth are in a stronger competitive position to outperform the market over time.
Inflation isn't going to stop the increasing amount of data that the world is gathering. This is driving accelerating demand for Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) advanced graphics processors designed for data centers.
Companies are racing to invest in high-performance computing systems needed to process large amounts of data in the fastest time possible. Let's dive deeper into Nvidia's business momentum and why the stock is running up my buy list.
Dominating the AI market
Companies are deploying Nvidia's graphics chips to run sophisticated artificial-intelligence (AI) applications and services. These are services that people engage with every day, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, chatbots, personalized recommendations, and cloud graphics and gaming.
Over the last three quarters, Nvidia's data center revenue has increased by 71%, 55%, and 35%, respectively. This acceleration entering the new year reflects a widening competitive position for Nvidia as an AI-chip leader.
Buying shares of Nvidia is basically making a bet on the growth of data, just as buying Intel in the 1990s was a bet on the growth of consumer PC sales. Chipzilla has made early investors a lot of money as it became the dominant supplier of CPUs. Nvidia is following a similar course in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market as it controls more than 80% of the market for AI processors used in the cloud and data centers, according to a 2021 report from Omdia.
Nvidia has solidified its lead with recent partnerships. It recently announced that Facebook parent Meta Platforms will deploy 6,000 A100 GPUs in its new AI supercomputer. Meta is expected to expand its usage to 16,000 chips later this year.

Block is using Nvidia GPUs to power its conversational AI for Square Assistant. Meanwhile, social-media leader Snap is using the company's chips to power its recommendation software. Strong demand from leading tech firms is ultimately powering explosive growth on Nvidia's bottom line.
The ultimate inflation beater -- expanding margins
Since Nvidia is the leader in AI processors and system software, it can price its products for healthy margins. As demand exploded over the last four years, Nvidia's non-GAAP (adjusted) operating profit margin improved from 37% to 47%. In fiscal 2022, the company generated $8.1 billion in free cash flow on $27 billion in revenue.
Management guided for fiscal first-quarter revenue to grow approximately 43% year over year to $8.1 billion, plus or minus 2%. It's possible Nvidia could beat those estimates since it has left sales on the table due to supply constraints. During the recentearnings call CFO Colette Kress said supply is ""improving every single day"" and near-term guidance implies accelerating growth in the data center segment in the fiscal first quarter.
Better value
As supply improves, there will be more gamers and enterprise customers able to get their hands on a GPU, so Nvidia should be able to maintain strong revenue growth throughout the year. The market may not be anticipating this, given Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has dropped to 40 based on this year's earnings estimates. That's more attractive than just a few months ago when the stock traded at a high forward P/E of 75.
In fact, Nvidia's forward P/E is attractive compared to slower-growing blue chips like Nike and Costco Wholesale. Nvidia's 83% earnings growth and 40 P/E is a relative bargain next to these stalwarts.

The post-earnings sell-off doesn't make sense relative to Nvidia's underlying business momentum. But of course, any time wars and inflation occur, many stocks get dumped no matter how good the business is performing. This is the time for retirement savers to take advantage of Wall Street's nervousness.
As the valuation comes down amid accelerating demand in the data center business, the stage is being set for better returns. Nvidia's surging growth and high margins make it an ideal stock to buy in this current high-inflation environment, where companies posting decelerating growth are experiencing the brunt of the market's wrath.

MILAN (Reuters Breakingviews) - Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by land, air and sea risks reverberating across the global chip industry and exacerbating current supply-chain constraints. Ukraine is a major producer of neon gas critical for lasers used in chipmaking and supplies more than 90% of U.S. semiconductor-grade neon, according to estimates from research firm Techcet. About 35% of palladium, a rare metal also used for semiconductors, is sourced from Russia. A full-scale conflict disrupting exports of these elements might hit players like Intel, which gets about 50% of its neon from Eastern Europe according to JPMorgan.    
The pain won’t fall evenly. ASML, which supplies machines to semiconductor makers, sources less than 20% of the gases it uses from the crisis-hit countries. Companies may turn to China, the United State and Canada to boost supplies, says JPMorgan. But this may be a slow path. Although the chipmaking industry was able to manage an increase in neon prices stemming from the 2014 Crimean crisis, the scale of today’s conflict looks much larger. (By Lisa Jucca)

2022-02-24 00:00:00+00:00,1 Monster Opportunity in the Global Chip Shortage,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-monster-opportunity-in-the-global-chip-shortage-1,,,"Semiconductors have turned into a gigantic industry over the past few decades. Estimates have global spending at $553 billion in 2021, up from a measly $33 billion worldwide in 1987. Analysts expect the industry to continue growing to almost $1 trillion in total annual spending by 2030, as there is an increased demand for computing processes around the world with the growth of electronics, data centers, and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. On top of these secular tailwinds, the chip industry is being held back due to supply constraints around the world right now, which should push spending higher over the next few years.
Many investors focus on the companies that make or design chips, like Nvidia, Intel, or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). However, as with any gold rush, the smarter move might be to own the company providing the picks and shovels to the industry. Enter Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT). Here's why the semiconductor equipment company is a monster opportunity in the global chip shortage.
Image source: Getty Images.
What is Applied Materials?
Applied Materials is a semiconductor equipment company, which means it provides equipment, services, and software to semiconductor manufacturers like TSM and Intel. These include technologies that allow manufacturers to create, shape, modify, analyze, and connect computer chips, among other processes. The equipment is very complicated, but for our purposes, you just need to know that manufacturers go to Applied Materials to help improve their chip-building processes.
The company has a very defensible position in the marketplace with all these different technologies, with 15.7 thousand active patents at the end of last quarter. It also spends an enormous amount of money on research and development (R&D), adding up to $2.5 billion over the last 12 months. On top of this, it would be incredibly difficult for a start-up to come in and replace Applied Materials at large manufacturers like TSM and Intel because of the high switching costs and capital intensity these firms would need to go through.
Taking all these factors into consideration, it is pretty clear that Applied Materials has a long-term competitive advantage or moat, which should insulate it from most competitors as it tries to sell equipment to semiconductor manufacturers.
Strong track record of growth and profitability
Applied Materials has been able to ride the wave of semiconductor growth over the past few decades. In the first-quarter report for 2022, which ended in January, the company did $24.2 billion in trailing 12-month revenue, up from less than $10 billion 10 years ago. And remember, this is despite a current shortage of semiconductors worldwide. Management thinks demand for wafer fabrication equipment (WFE), its most important end market, will hit $100 billion in spending in 2022 compared to $80 billion in spending last year. While still a relatively long way out, management thinks that 2023 spending will be even higher than 2022. Given Applied Material's defensible position in the marketplace, its annual revenue should be able to grow along with the increase in industry demand.
Revenue growth is nice, but don't forget about what truly matters to investors: profits and cash flow. Applied Materials has a strong track record of generating both. Over the past 12 months, operating income and free cash flow (FCF) hit $7.7 billion and $6 billion, respectively. Both metrics have grown in tandem over the past decade as Applied Materials has scaled its business along with the overall semiconductor industry. As revenue grows over the next decade, operating income and FCF should rise as well.

Cheap valuation if you have a multi-year time horizon
With a defensible position in the industry plus strong prospects for future profit growth, there's only one thing left to consider for investors when it comes to Applied Materials: valuation. Luckily, right now, the market is valuing this high-quality business at a fairly cheap price. As of this writing, Applied Material's stock has a market cap of $118.4 billion. With $6 billion in trailing FCF, that gives the stock a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio (P/FCF) of 19.7, below the Nasdaq's average of 30. If Applied Materials can grow its business at a steady clip along with the semiconductor industry over the next decade, buying in at a P/FCF below 20 should do wonders for shareholders.
Don't forget the capital returns, either. Applied Materials has a dividend yield of 0.73% and has reduced its share count through share repurchases by 17% over the last five years. Add these on top of the underlying business growth, and investors should get strong total returns from holding Applied Materials over the long run.

TOKYO/TAIPEI, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Large chip companies so far predict limited supply chain disruption from the Russia-Ukraine crisis, thanks to raw material stockpiling and diversified procurement, but some industry sources worry about the longer-term impact.
One of the worst security crises in Europe in decades is unfolding, with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday authorising a military operation in eastern Ukraine in what appeared to be the start of a war.
The crisis has hit stocks of tech companies that source or sell globally on fears of further disruptions on the back of a yearlong shortage of semiconductor chips.
Ukraine supplies more than 90% of U.S. semiconductor-grade neon, critical for lasers used in chipmaking. The gas, a biproduct of Russian steel manufacturing, according to market research firm Techcet, is purified in Ukraine. Thirty-five percent of U.S. palladium, used in sensors and memory, among other applications, is sourced from Russia.
""The chipmakers are not feeling any direct impact, but the companies that supply them with materials for semiconductor fabrication buy gases, including neon and palladium, from Russia and Ukraine,"" said a Japanese chip industry source who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""The availability of those materials is already tight, so any further pressure on supplies could push up prices. That in turn could knock on to higher chip prices.""
But companies are better prepared than in recent years, thanks to other disruptions and conflicts, reducing some of the pain.
The White House has warned the chip industry to diversify its supply chain in case Russia retaliates against threatened U.S. export curbs by blocking access to key materials, Reuters reported this month, citing people familiar with the matter.
Ahead of the invasion, the West sanctioned Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline and some Russian banks, and imposed curbs on a number of senior Russian officials. More sanctions could come in the form of Cold War-like curbs on technology, followed by Russian retaliation on exports.
ASML Holding ASML.AS, a key Dutch supplier to chipmakers including TSMC, Samsung Electronics 005930.KS and Intel, said on Wednesday it is examining alternative sources for neon.
DIVERSIFIED
Most chipmakers are in wait-and-watch mode and in communication before Thursday's escalation projected confidence about their supply chains, which they have diversified in the wake of the U.S.-China trade standoff, the pandemic and Japan's diplomatic spat with Seoul.
Some companies had started diversifying away from Russian and Ukraine after Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014, which triggered a huge increase in neon prices.
South Korean memory chipmaker SK Hynix 000660.KS CEO Lee Seok-hee told reporters last week that the company had ""secured a lot"" of chip materials, and that ""there's no need to worry"".
Intel Corp INTC.O said it does not anticipate any impact. GlobalFoundries GFS.O said it does not anticipate a direct risk and has flexibility to seek sources outside Russia or Ukraine, as did Taiwan chipmaker United Microelectronics Corp 2303.TW.
TSMC 2330.TW, the world's largest contract chipmaker declined to comment ""at the moment"".
Taiwanese chip testing and packaging firm ASE Technology 3711.TW said its material supply remains stable ""at this point"".
Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs told Reuters in a statement that it had checked Taiwan's semiconductor supply chain and found no direct impact on materials or production activities.
""Russia is not, at the moment, one of the Taiwanese foundry industry's major markets,"" said Joanne Chiao, senior analyst at market researcher TrendForce.
Malaysian chipmaker Unisem UNSM.KL, whose customers include Apple AAPL.O, said it expects no impact on chip production from a raw materials perspective because the materials it needs are not sourced from Russia, and its machines are mainly from the United States, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and locally.
Malaysia has emerged as an important link in the chip production chain, and accounts for 13% of global chip assembly testing and packaging.
Japan's Ibiden4062.T, which makes packaging substrates for chips, said it currently had enough materials but that the situation could change with sanctions, when asked about supplies of neon and other gases from Russia.
""We are a little concerned,"" a spokesperson said. The company, she added, would buy material elsewhere and keep in close contact with suppliers to tackle any disruptions.

2022-02-23 00:00:00+00:00,7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy as Deals Shake Up the Industry,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-as-deals-shake-up-the-industry,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
I was recently reading an article about the 10 biggest semiconductor news stories of the past year, and that had me thinking about semiconductor stocks.
The article started out by asserting that 2021 was the year that the world gained a greater appreciation for semiconductors’ role in modern society. Of course the importance of semiconductors has long been grasped by business and industry.
But it was the shortage that really drove home the idea to people of all backgrounds. Consumers arguably felt the effects in the automotive sector where prices surged. In fact, the average price of a new car exceeded $47,000 recently. That’s an all-time high. And that is but one example of the semiconductor shortage affecting our lives.
7 Sin Stocks to Buy if the Economy Slows Down
Semiconductor stocks saw big changes as well. There were many deals occurring that promise to shake up the landscape. Companies of all sizes and stripes are vying to better compete in a market projected to grow 8.8% in 2022 and reach $601.5 billion in revenues. 
That means semiconductor stocks will rise and fall and there will be deals to be had. Let’s look at the ones to consider purchasing as the deals continue. 
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML)
Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT)
On Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON)
Semiconductor Stocks to Buy: Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: Allmy / Shutterstock.com
In early February, Nvidia scrapped its plans to purchase chip design firm Arm. Nvidia struck a $40 billion deal back in September of 2020 to buy the U.K.-based chipmaker. It was slated to be the biggest deal ever in the chip industry. However, regulatory hurdles quickly cropped up. 
Competitors and regulatory bodies raised concerns that it would give Nvidia unfair advantages and control over technology its competitors utilize in making their own chips. 
Arm, owned by SoftBank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) will be taken public, likely before April of next year when ARM’s fiscal year ends. SoftBank had planned to take Arm public prior to striking the now defunct deal to sell to Nvidia. 
So why should investors buy NVDA stock given the failure of the Arm deal? The answer is that it remains one of the best stocks with or without Arm under its company umbrella. Nvidia provided investors with another very strong quarter of earnings. The $7.64 billion in revenues topped the $7.42 billion Wall Street expected and EPS figures similarly outstripped guidance. 
The company also projects it will see $8.1 billion in revenues in the coming quarter. Wall Street expects $7.3 billion, signaling Nvidia’s confidence. 
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) 
Source: Fabio Alcini / Shutterstock.com
On Feb. 14, AMD released an investor presentation indicating that it had acquired Xilinx. The market reaction to the news was more muted than might have been expected, but the news remains positive. 
AMD has been pursuing the deal for quite some time. It was fraught with regulatory push back in China, where Xilinx is based. Ultimately the deal succeeded. It gives AMD new expertise in two areas of semiconductor technology it lacked before. Xilinx provides system on chip (SOC) and field programmable gate array (FPGA) leadership. 
Ultimately it ups AMD’s ability to pursue greater revenues. As noted in the corporate presentation, AMD can now address a $135 billion market following the acquisition. That presentation specifically points to opportunities in data center, 5G and embedded areas where the two companies have complementary expertise. 
AMD also looks strong from a financial fundamental perspective as it exceeded analyst expectations with its recent earnings report. The $4.8 billion in revenues it posted bested the $4.5 billion expected. EPS figures reached 92 cents where 76 cents were expected. On top of that, AMD gave guidance for the upcoming quarter of $5 billion. That’s 45% higher than the same period a year earlier. 
Micron Technology (MU)

Micron isn’t particularly connected to any of the deals shaking up the semiconductor industry. But it is an important firm worth watching and a stock worth buying. That’s because the memory chip firm is likely to continue to see strong demand. 
But at the same time, Micron’s image may scare some investors away. The company has historically been more vulnerable to the cyclicality that the semiconductor industry is known for. 
That’s because it provides less specialized memory chips with lower barriers to entry. As demand peaks and inventory begins to pile up it is the less specialized chips that suffer fastest. 
However, demand for its memory chips does not look to be waning anytime soon. Digitization of everything is driving demand for memory chips. New Street Research believes that demand will continue to ramp up and recently initiated coverage of Micron giving it a buy rating and a $135 target price. 
New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu believes “Micron benefits from strong secular growth and will benefit over the years from improving profitability in NAND, which represent a material long-term compounding factor, and for which there is consolidation potential upside.”
Semiconductor Stocks to Buy: Intel (INTC)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
Pat Gelsinger has been the CEO of Intel for just over a year. On his second day of the job he addressed a letter to his employees with his vision for the firm. He believes cloud, mobility fueled by 5G, artificial intelligence and the artificial edge are the focal points for Intel to address under his tenure. He also stated that Intel is the only firm in the world with the depth and breadth of expertise to capitalize on those opportunities. 
Based on Intel’s recent acquisition of Israeli-based Tower Semiconductor that means foundry will be a focal area for achieving those priorities. Intel acquired the firm specifically for its Intel Foundry Service business. It is also investing $20 to expand its Arizona manufacturing facilities and another $20 billion to build what it says will be the “largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet.” 
Intel is building a geographically diverse set of fab operations spanning the globe and under Gelsinger its future is looking much brighter. 
ASML Holdings (ASML) 
Source: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock
ASML Holdings isn’t explicitly connected to any recent acquisitions moving the semiconductor industry. But it is a vitally important firm in the global semiconductor industry. That’s because the firm is a critical supplier of the equipment used to manufacture chips. It produces lithography machines which are systems used to make chips. 
These machines account for the highest capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturing firms. On Jan. 19, a story noted that Intel placed an order with ASML for one such machine costing $340 million. Consider that a cutting edge plant requires approximately a dozen of ASML’s $150 million lithography machines. And then consider that ASML has a near monopoly as its technology isn’t easily replicable. Investors can then see why ASML stock is highly regarded. 
ASML stock maintains an overweight rating and massive upside potential. It currently trades for $650 with average target prices at $930. 
Applied Materials (AMAT)

Applied Materials is another semiconductor firm that specializes in equipment. It’s also a firm that is performing exceptionally well. It has almost become cliche at this point, but Applied Materials exceeded both revenue and EPS expectations. 
Revenues increased by 27% which meant that AMAT stock reported $6.27 billion of sales in the quarter when $6.19 were expected. That translated to EPS figures that outstripped guidance as well. 
CEO Gary Dickerson doesn’t expect things to slow down anytime soon: “Our outlook for 2022 and beyond is very positive as long-term secular trends drive our markets structurally higher and Applied’s broad technology portfolio puts us in a great position to capture a larger portion of our served markets.”
Applied Materials is worth purchasing for the same reasons that ASML Holdings is: It is one of few companies on the planet that can do what it does. Demand is high and it doesn’t look to be slowing. 
Semiconductor Stocks to Buy: ON Semiconductor (ON)

For investors looking to capitalize on surging automotive prices ON stock might be just the stock to consider. The company exceeded expectations which CEO Hassane El-Khoury attributed to high automotive and industrial end market demand. 
That said, ON stock still has plenty of upside remaining based on target prices. It currently trades near $60 but has a consensus target price of $73.81 and a high price target of $90. 
The company’s strong quarter emboldened it to strike out and project higher forward earnings than Wall Street gave. ON Semiconductor expects between $1.74 and $1.84 billion in sales while Wall Street is looking for $1.72 billion.

2022-02-23 00:00:00+00:00,Could the Chip Shortage Be an Opportunity for Real Estate Investors?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/could-the-chip-shortage-be-an-opportunity-for-real-estate-investors,,,"Rapid growth of demand for housing and commercial space around major industrial projects in America is as old as, well, the industrial revolution itself.
From coal mining and textile company towns to the birth of the steel industry, these developments seem to happen overnight, and their impacts can last for, at this point, more than a century. One example: Birmingham, Alabama, still uses the ""Magic City"" nickname it earned when the steel industry took up shop there in the late 1800s and the city popped up out of nowhere as if by magic.
Then there's Detroit and automaking, as another example. A more recent example of that is the Greenville, South Carolina, area where BMW established an assembly plant that has transformed a region beset by textile's demise into an economic powerhouse in the span of a decade or two.
Image source: Getty Images.
Now, on to the next big wave -- and computer chips may be the biggest. There's been a sudden burst of major semiconductor manufacturers building massive new plants here in America as a result of supply chain snafus and surging demand that appears to have nowhere to go but up as the embedded technology becomes ever-more critical. Just ask automakers.
These are huge, long-term investments that present massive opportunity for spinoff activity, too, in the form of construction jobs at first, followed by suppliers and the jobs they create. And then residential and commercial growth that can extend well beyond the communities where the plants are actually located.
Just three examples represent thousands of new jobs and a lot of spinoff to come
Here are three notable developments:
Intel is investing an initial $20 billion in a multi-factory semiconductor site near Columbus, Ohio, which will be the Buckeye State's largest such capital investment ever. The initial 3,000 jobs at the 1,000-acre site will pay an average of $135,000 each. That's in addition to the $20 billion Intel is putting into expanding its current operations at two factories in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler, Arizona.
Samsung is working on a 1,200-acre site in the Austin, Texas, suburb of Taylor that represents a $17 billion investment and is expected to create about 2,000 new jobs in a 6-million-square-foot semiconductor facility that will join an existing company site in Austin itself.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company -- whose chips are in every iPhone -- is building a $12 billion, 3.8 million square foot manufacturing campus to bolster its existing Phoenix operations. Related economic activity, including by homebuilders and ancillary suppliers, already has been announced while the new factory is still in the construction stage.
Global regionalization leads to local opportunity
So, could the chip shortage be an opportunity for real estate investors? The industry's response points to a clear ""yes.""
""This activity validates what we are seeing in the current real estate market regarding the regionalization of manufacturing"" as overseas suppliers expand their U.S. operations, CBRE executive managing director John Morris told Commercial Property Executive in a Feb. 15 article.
He added, ""Manufacturing investments like these do indeed create a cascading impact on local economies and on the logistics real estate markets in the area; these markets can certainly expect an increase in demand for logistics space to support tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers that will need to locate supply materials close to manufacturing plants.""
Indeed, multiple published reports point to suppliers for these major chipmakers investing now in setting up shop to serve these sites, and residential and commercial development is sure to follow as well.
That makes now a good time for real estate investors to investigate their own opportunities in those areas as the opportunity pushes out from those sites well into the suburbs and rural areas surrounding all that activity.
After all, these are not short-term investments these companies are making. They're transformative and likely to be long lasting. Working with local brokers and developers, finding crowdfunding opportunities placed in those areas, and investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs) all could be ways to transform your own portfolio to leverage the opportunities presented by this critical manufacturing sea change.

2022-02-22 00:00:00+00:00,Intel is Oversold,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-is-oversold,,,"The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) presently has a stellar rank, in the top 10% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.
But making Intel Corp an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Tuesday, shares of INTC entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $44.50 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Intel Corp, the RSI reading has hit 29.3 — by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel currently has an average RSI of 44.9. A falling stock price — all else being equal — creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, INTC's recent annualized dividend of 1.46/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 3.24% based upon the recent $45.04 share price.
A bullish investor could look at INTC's 29.3 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on INTC is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

Semiconductor groups such as Intel Corp INTC.O and Applied Materials Inc AMAT.O, hit by supply chain challenges, expect the recovery to take longer despite rising global demand for chips used in products ranging from cars to computers and smartphones.
ASMI, which makes equipment used to deposit atom-thin layers of material on computer chips during their manufacturing, expects first-quarter revenue of 500-530 million euros ($567-$601 million), after 491.3 million euros in the fourth quarter.
Smaller peer BE Semiconductor BESI.AS on Friday also forecast a rise in first-quarter revenue, as the chipmaking equipment supplier expects to benefit from leading chipmakers' plans to boost investments.
ASMI reported record order intake in the fourth quarter of 644.9 million euros, above the company's guidance of around 600 million euros.
The Amsterdam-listed company said it planned to increase its dividend by 25% to 2.5 euros per share.
The group is also launching a new share buyback programme, planning to repurchase up to 100 million euros of stock over 2022-2023.

2022-02-22 00:00:00+00:00,Chipmaker AMD's stock gets top rating from Bernstein after 10 years,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chipmaker-amds-stock-gets-top-rating-from-bernstein-after-10-years,,,"By Siddarth S
Feb 22 (Reuters) - A Wall Street analyst upgraded Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O to a buy rating after 10 years on Tuesday, highlighting its growing market share, a strong portfolio of computer chips to rival that of Intel INTC.O and a relatively cheap stock price.
""This is not the AMD of a decade ago,"" Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon said, lifting the brokerage's rating on the company to ""outperform"" — its highest stock rating — from ""market-perform"".
AMD's market share for laptop central processing unit (CPU) chips had climbed to nearly 20% in the third quarter of 2021 from a low of under 5% six years ago, Bernstein said, citing data from Mercury Research and its own analysis.
""The quality of AMD's portfolio continues to improve ... AMD's desktop CPU are now, on average, on par with Intel's,"" Rasgon said.
AMD shares have ballooned from roughly $2 when Bernstein last had an ""outperform"" rating on them in 2012 to about $114 today, an ascent Rasgon called ""the absolute biggest missed call in our entire Wall Street tenure.""
Shares in AMD were slightly lower in premarket trading on Tuesday, but the chipmaker's market value surpassed that of Intel last week.
Still, AMD's stock price is currently below 30 times its projected earnings for the next 12 months, with shares nearing their cheapest in five years and ""entering into the realm of downright attractive,"" Rasgon said.
Recent commentary from Intel suggests the next several years may be ""open season"" in the key data-center market, another positive for AMD, he added.
AMD could also derive more revenue from its recently closed $50 billion acquisition of Xilinx than first thought, Rasgon said. ""Our math suggests the company might see an annual revenue run rate that could be hundreds of millions of dollars higher than current expectations,"" he wrote.

When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, semiconductor stocks were on fire. The pandemic caused an economic effect that led to unprecedented demand for electronic devices of all sorts, most of which require semiconductors to function.
Demand for goods and services was up across many industries, including computers, cars and cell phones. The semiconductor industry has been through a lot, but it’s now entering an even more challenging phase.
The complex geopolitical landscape is one of the many challenges businesses face in an ever-changing world. The conflict between China and Taiwan, rising tensions over trade agreements with other countries such as America and China (to name just two), can have devastating effects on any business that relies heavily upon those supplies for their success — which includes almost every company out there.
In addition, demand for semiconductor chips is extremely high. And there is no way the industry can keep up with it at this stage. Estimates vary when the companies in the sector will get ahold of the situation. However, it is certainly weighing down sentiment.
7 Momentum Stocks to Buy While the Market Corrects
The tech downturn has been a big hit on the semiconductor sector. But that has also created opportunities in the industry as prices fall, making it more attractive to enter into a stock before it takes off again.

Intel is a chipmaker that has been around for just over half a century. It has been leading the world in technology since its inception.
Intel is among the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturers and one of the top five global PC makers. Intel is one of the best semiconductor stocks based on its exposure to the industry. Several other factors make it one of the most compelling investments available.
The company’s main business is making chips for PCs/servers and selling them. The industry stagnated for several years. However, the pandemic brought it back to life. People have bought machines to work or study, which has provided better business for the company.
Alongside its efforts in the semiconductor space, Intel has invested in many other businesses over the years, including Mobileye. This operating unit is expected to generate a profit for Intel this year.
Overall, Intel is one of the biggest computer chip manufacturers globally. It is also one of the cheapest blue-chip stocks out there, trading at just 13.8 times forward price-to-earnings.
The history of the organization, its strong earnings profile and robust outlook mean INTC stock is a great one for your portfolio. If you add a dividend yield of 3% and a cheap valuation, the stock becomes a must-have among semiconductor stocks.
Texas Instruments (TXN)

Texas Instruments is the world’s leading supplier of semiconductors. The company provides cutting-edge technology that helps keep our lives more efficient and connected than ever before, from chipsets for cell phones to televisions. It was founded in 1951 by Cecil H. Green, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.
Texas Instruments recently announced its earnings and ramped up investments in new equipment. This caused a volatile reaction in the market, with traders making corresponding moves.
In order to maintain its dominance in the analog semiconductor space, TXN will have lower free cash flow and dividend growth for now.
Texas Instruments reported fourth-quarter revenue of $4.83 billion, net income of $2.14 billion, and earnings-per-share of $2.27. Revenue went up substantially, fueled by strong demand in industrial and automotive markets. Analog revenue grew by 20% and Embedded Processing grew by 6% year-over-year.
The company is continuously showing its strength, with cash flow from operations reaching $8.8 billion for the year and free cash flow at 34% of revenue. This demonstrates the quality of its products in its 300 mm production batches as well its efficient manufacturing strategy, which has been paying off during these tense times.
The company expects revenue of between $4.5 billion and $4.9 billion and EPS to be between $2.01 and $2.29.

Apart from its strong financials, Texas Instruments is also a strong income play. In the words of Rich Templeton, TXN’s chairman, president, and CEO, “We returned $4.4 billion to owners in 2021 through dividends and stock repurchases. For the year, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability.”
Semiconductor Stocks: United Microelectronics (UMC)
Source: Ascannio via shutterstock
United Microelectronics Corporation is a global leader in the manufacture of advanced microelectronics and also provides related services such as design, contract manufacturing or verification. The company has expanded across Asia and the U.S. with many locations. It’s also a semicodunctor foundry, which means that it provides many chips for small businesses to purchase.
The semiconductor super-cycle has been occurring since companies are building more chips to meet a sudden and sustained demand. Under these circumstances, the company can profit from its strong standing in the industry. Semiconductor capital expenditures are surging. UMC is positioned to be a winner because it provides basic foundry operations with other related services such as circuit design, assembly and testing.
United Microelectronics Corporation is a company that made headlines last year during the worst of the semiconductor supply crunch. The company could get advance payments from its customers, mostly composed of auto manufacturers and other high-profile clients, for the service engagement with UMC’s services.
The rise of UMC has given it a competitive edge as it continues to increase efficiency and leverage its investments. In addition, the company has a dividend yield of 2.9% and is trading at just 9.7 times forward P/E. All of this makes it a great pick among semiconductor stocks.
Analog Devices (ADI)

Analog Devices has been around for over 50 years and is leading in data conversion, signal processing technology and power management systems. It provides solutions to customers worldwide for products ranging from commercial television broadcast transmitters to medical equipment monitors.
Analog can maintain its market leadership because it has a diverse product line against competition and technological obsolescence. It also helps Analog companies reach a wider audience for their products and services. Connected cars and the “internet of things” are often talked about in the ongoing tech-focused discussions. Remote monitoring is also becoming a big part of workplace technology, and it can help you with security. All of these trends will act as tailwinds for Analog Devices.
ADI recently announced earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations. The company made $280 million in its first quarter, continuing to meet its expectations. Furthermore, ADI says it had 53 cents per share, while its profit after taxes was $1.94 per share. Finally, ADI announced $2.68 in revenue, which also exceeded analyst estimates.
Analog Devices is predicting earnings will be betweem $1.97 to $2.27 per-share for this quarter with revenue ranging from $2.7 billion to just under $3 billion.

Advanced Micro Devices is a major global semiconductor company that specializes in manufacturing. It also offers a range of software, including x86-64 compatible 64-bit computing and graphics technologies that power AMD’s Ryzen Threadripper processors.
AMD beat its earnings estimates and guidance in Q4 and has a strong outlook for 2022. In 2021, AMD saw its sales increase by 68% and its gross margin increase by over three percentage points from last year. AMD’s stock has been rising lately, and so has its processor sales.
AMD recently released new chips with a significant increase in performance, allowing them to challenge Intel as the No. 1 computer chip supplier. It is also buying Xilinx to better compete with Intel.
Furthermore, the company produces chips specifically for the cloud and video game sectors. AMD’s Lisa Su says that growth in demand for console upgrades is surpassing “all prior generations.” That makes this is a key segment to watch.
AMD said that it has been spending $1 billion in the current year on securing long-term supplies. AMD suggests that it will be able to grow without too much of a problem in 2022, which is encouraging news considering the worldwide chip shortage that is happening now.
The semiconductor company set a revenue goal of $21.5 billion for 2022, ahead of analyst expectations of $19.3 billion. This would be a 31% increase over 2021′s sales, thanks to the launch of Ryzen and Vega products this year.
AMD expects to have $5 billion in sales in the first quarter. Most of the sales will come from servers and computers due to AMD’s success with processors. All of these numbers help it feature prominently on this list of semiconductor stocks to buy.
Camtek (CAMT)

Camtek is a world leader in designing and manufacturing metrology equipment for advanced packaging, memory CMOS image sensors and RF technologies. The company offers dedicated solutions that help improve yield rates while driving down production costs across all industries. In other words, Camtek’s products are essential tools used by companies throughout their entire supply chain.
With the need for more semiconductors continuing, it’s no surprise that there are plans to build many new plants. This part of the value chain isn’t exactly glamorous but it is integral in getting these projects off their feet and ramped up quickly enough before producing anything valuable or selling any products.
Camtek has traditionally been one of the top companies in the market, and it saw a 53% increase in its revenue in its latest quarterly results. GAAP operating income was $19.3 million while non-GAAP operating income was $20.9 million, providing a margin of 26% and 28.2%, respectively. Operating cash flow of $21.5 million is a strong figure to close out the quarter.

The company reported record annual revenues of $269.7 million, an increase of 73% compared to the previous year. Record GAAP operating income of $70.9 million, non-GAAP operating income of $76.7 million and 28.4% operating margins, respectively. These are high levels in contrast to the average found throughout most companies.
Semiconductor Stocks: Ambarella (AMBA)

You need to look at the semiconductor industry in general when assessing how well a company has scaled to success. The best thing you can do is to invest in a company with a diversified business model. Some of this appeal comes from niche players.
Still, some want a more specific focus as Ambarella does — its chips are designed for low power and high definition video compression applications, which it markets under an established brand name.
Think of the numerous ways that Ambarella’s technology is used in today’s world. Products such as Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Nest and GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) cameras have successfully implemented this chip into their respective products, showing us just how quickly things can change if we let them.
Due to threats of interest rate hikes, growth stocks are not doing so well. But that doesn’t mean the time is right to bail on this one. Ambarella is a company that specializes in creating semiconductor solutions for the automotive industry. They make up the core of the car’s “brain” and provide software to help cars learn and react to their environment.
Considering the breadth of its services and use cases, this is a stock that you need to have in your portfolio.

Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) lost 1%, while the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) and Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) each declined 0.8%. Ten of the 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.2% or 168.65 points, to end at 13,548.07points.
The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was down 1.28% to 27.75. A total of 11.3 billion shares were traded on Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 12.3 billion. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.84-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.10-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.
Russia-Ukraine Crisis Impacting Markets
Renewed fears of a Russian invasion on Ukraine once again made investors jittery on Friday, adding to the weekly losses. All the three major indexes had taken a massive hit on Thursday and the bloodbath continued on Friday on reports that U.S. officials believe that Russia could attack Ukraine anytime over the next few days.
Fears further escalated after Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the United Nations that the situation at this stage is a “moment of peril”. Although diplomatic efforts to initiate further talks with Moscow remain in focus for several world leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden, fears of a war breaking out anytime looms.
Moreover, reports from the United States and NATO that Russia is deploying additional troops near the Ukraine border instead pulling back has further added to the fears.
Investors Worry About Rate Hikes
Markets have been suffering from the beginning of this year as investors fear that the Fed will adopt an aggressive policy while hiking interest rates this year. Experts believe that the Fed will go for at least four rate hikes this year, beginning March, to put a check on inflation.
The growing worries among investors have been taking a toll on growth stocks, especially tech stocks, and Friday was no different.
Economic Data
In economic data released on Friday, the National Association of Realtors said that existing home sales rose 6.7% in January to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 6.5 million.
However, the index of leading economic indicators for the U.S. also unexpectedly declined 0.3% in January as a result of high inflations, growing cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and supply-chain crisis. This is the index’ first decline since February 2021.
Weekly Roundup
All the three major indexes ended lower for the second straight week. The Dow declined 1.9% for the week. The S&P 500 finished 1.6% lower, while the Nasdaq was down 1.8%.

This Stock Has the Potential,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/aiming-for-a-100-bagger-this-stock-has-the-potential,,,"The market says Joby Aviation (NYSE: JOBY) is worth about $2.9 billion right now. To make a 100-bagger with this one, its market capitalization would have to reach $290 billion one day. Can this air-taxi pioneer pull it off? I'm very bullish on the company's future. But Joby is a high-risk stock. So my investment here is tiny (way under 1% of my family investment portfolio).
I'm bullish on this stock because I'm negative about self-driving cars. I don't think the collective intelligence at Alphabet or Tesla can sufficiently plan for all the variables of driving a car in the street. Even if the artificial intelligence-based technology works and reduces car collisions, every accident is a major lawsuit waiting to happen. For example, suppose Tesla manages to reduce the accident rate from 6 million a year (the total number of car accidents in 2018 in the U.S. and assuming all cars are self driven) to 1 million -- which would be incredible -- that's still 1 million lawsuits a year the company will face.
Joby, meanwhile, is changing the transportation landscape in a three-dimensional way. There's almost zero traffic in the sky. The vehicles are way faster and just as quiet. I think Joby could easily go up 10 times in value, just with human pilots. But if robots start flying those things? The sky's the limit.

So I'm investing in Joby now, even though the company has neither earnings nor revenues yet. Why so soon? Because when you're shooting for a 100-bagger, you don't need (or want) a large initial investment. There are so many things that could go wrong, you might lose everything. But the potential upside is so high, it's worth making small investments now before the crowd wakes up and bids up the stock price.
A couple of 100-baggers will make you rich
While a 100-bagger seems impossibly big, it actually happens fairly often. For instance, if you bought shares of Apple in 2004, after the iPod but before the iPhone, you'd have made over 400 times your money by now.

Data by YCharts.
That's nothing compared to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and its insane 3,000-bagger in 35 years.

Data by YCharts.
Here's a short list of some of the stocks that have pulled off the 100-bagger feat:
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)
Walmart (NYSE: WMT)
Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG)
Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX)
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO)
Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)
Nike (NYSE: NKE)
McDonald's (NYSE: MCD)
If you do the math, you'll see that even a tiny investment in a 100-bagger can make you rich. The 20-year-old college student who bought $500 worth of Microsoft back in 1986 is now a millionaire, just from that one stock buy. So that's why it's worth your time to search for companies chasing massive opportunities, and make small investments while the stock price is still tiny, and the future is uncertain.
How big is the market for air taxis?
A couple of years ago, Morgan Stanley put out a research report that estimates the market for air taxis to reach $1.5 trillion by 2040. It's not hard to see why transportation will go vertical in the future. Joby's aircraft is electric and recently demonstrated how quiet the aircraft, a critical parameter to operate in populated areas. At about 55 decibels during take-off, it's more than a thousand times quieter than a typical helicopter. And that's kind of amazing, because these vehicles are super-fast. How fast? The company's air taxi hit 205 miles an hour in a practice run earlier this year.
The company also demonstrated that the aircraft can fly 150 miles on a single battery charge. The plan is to use them to ferry passengers in and around congested cities. Los Angeles, for instance, is known for its heavy traffic. Electric cars do not fix that problem. Self-driving cars don't fix that problem, either. Nobody likes a traffic snarl, and anything that reduces those bottlenecks will be a blessing. Joby estimates the market for its air taxis in L.A. at $500 million a year. That's just one city!
Tesla in the sky?
How big is the air taxi opportunity? Well, if you don't believe Morgan Stanley's $1.5 trillion number, consider what Elon Musk has to say.
So, over time, we think full self-driving will become the most important source of profitability for Tesla. It's -- actually, if you run the numbers on robotaxis, it's kind of nutty -- it's nutty good from a financial standpoint.
That's thought-provoking. Musk is happy about his fleet of electric cars and his $53 billion in revenues. But he believes self-driving taxis is actually a much bigger opportunity in the future.
Try to imagine investing in Tesla back in 2010, when the company had its initial public offering (IPO). It was a daunting investment. Tesla had no profits and had only sold 1,000 cars in total when the company went public. If the company had suffered a few bad breaks a decade ago, it could have easily gone Chapter 11.
Joby in 2022 is much like Tesla in 2010 -- a highly risky investment opportunity with a huge potential upside. The way you approach a dangerous stock like this is by making a small investment now, and maybe adding to your position as the dangers recede and the market gets more and more excited.

Data by YCharts.
Uber in the sky?
Of course, when you think ""taxis,"" you think Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER), the company that disrupted the taxi industry around the world. You might think Uber would be interested in that $1.5 trillion market opportunity, too. And you'd be right. Back in 2016, Uber published a white paper about the future of urban air transportation. Two years later, the ride-sharing giant introduced its prototype vehicle. But Uber was too late to the party, and so in 2020 the company abandoned the race and sold out to Joby (and invested $75 million in the start-up).
Similarly, Toyota decided to invest almost $400 million in Joby last year. That's a major influx of cash. After several financing rounds and its SPAC last year, Joby is now sitting on $1.6 billion dollars.
So here we have a huge market opportunity. Uber sees it, and Toyota sees it. And yet these two massive companies both decided to back Joby instead of going alone. Why?
Joby has a powerful first-mover advantage. The company has been working on its aircraft for over a decade and has been collaborating with NASA since 2012. Joby's near-term goals are to get its aircraft certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), scale up its manufacturing, and launch its air taxi service in 2024. It's in the lead and likely to be first to market in the U.S.
What about self-driving air taxis?
I think Musk's vision of robotaxis in the future is very exciting. But given the congestion in the cities and the pain-points that air taxis solve, I believe this revolution may very well happen in the air first. After all, the first autopilots in aircraft were introduced in 1912! We already have drones in the air. The safety issues with a self-driving aircraft are minuscule compared to the complexities on the ground.
So that's why I've made a tiny investment in Joby Aviation now, even with a significant possibility that I might lose it all. The long-term upside is so massive, I want to have a minor ownership now, in the hopes that Joby can pull off what the company is trying to do.

2022-02-18 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Stock Crashed Today -- Is It a Buy?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-stock-crashed-today-is-it-a-buy,,,"Since crashing hard after earnings last month, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) spent much of the last three weeks clawing its way back higher -- and even approached its pre-earnings share price last week. All that hard work was undone in a day, however -- today, to be precise -- when Intel unveiled its ""2022 and long-term growth strategy"" last night.
In its presentation, Intel described how, over the long term, it intends to rebuild its business, first reaccelerating sales growth into the ""mid-to-high-single digits"" range in 2023 and 2024, then stepping even harder on the gas pedal, and racing ahead to 10% to 12% annual revenue growth by 2026. Margins are expected to do a U-turn as well, ranging from 51% to 53% in 2023 and 2024, and reaching a respectable 54% to 58% level by 2026.
But what number is missing from all of the above? You guessed it: 2022.
Image source: Getty Images.
In 2022, warns Intel, things are going to look a whole lot worse than any of the above, and worse than what we saw in 2021 as well. Intel forecasts a 4% revenue decline this year, to $76 billion, and an even steeper falloff in profitability -- down 27% from 2021 levels at just $3.55 per share.
At this point, it probably seems almost a rhetorical question to ask, ""Is Intel a buy?"" But let's at least give it the benefit of the doubt.
Now, $3.55 per share isn't a lot of money, but at current share prices of $45 or thereabouts, it is enough to value Intel stock at just 12.7 times current-year earnings. That doesn't look too expensive. With Intel stock paying a 3.1% dividend yield, and promising 10% to 12% growth rates just a few years from now, it might even be an attractive valuation -- or rather, it will be an attractive valuation if and when the growth returns as promised.
Still, that happy future is still four years away. In the meantime, with Intel warning that it will be free cash flow negative this year, and most of its biggest promises about turning around its business still years in the future, I see no compelling need to rush out and buy Intel today.

Feb 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes slumped on Friday as escalating tensions in Ukraine amid fears of an imminent Russian invasion prompted investors to dump risky assets in the run-up to a long weekend.
All the major S&P 500 sectors were in the red, with energy shares .SPNY leading losses due to weaker oil prices. O/R
Russian news agencies reported about a blast in the eastern Ukraine city of Donetsk and separatists planned to evacuate residents from the region to Russia due to heavy shelling.
Western powers warned that Russia's military build-up around Ukraine was continuing and it may use the current developments as a justification to invade the country, which they say could happen anytime.
Speculations about the Federal Reserve's next move have also weighed on equities. New York Fed Bank President John Williams said earlier in the day it would be appropriate to hike interest rates in March without mentioning the magnitude.
""We don't know how many rate hikes we're going to see this year,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC.
""We just know, we're getting into a tightening environment and the unknown is scaring traders. And then you go into the geopolitical risk with the Ukraine situation, and it adds up to trader saying I'm a little bit nervous on stocks right now, especially into a long weekend.""
Expiration of monthly options contracts was also seen adding to the volatility ahead of the U.S. market holiday on Monday for Presidents' Day.
At 13:16 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 305.90 points, or 0.89%, at 34,006.13, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 50.76 points, or 1.16%, at 4,329.50, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 243.13 points, or 1.77%, at 13,473.59.
The indexes were on course for their second straight weekly losses, buffeted by rising tensions between Moscow and the West over Ukraine.
The CBOE volatility index .VIX, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, was last up 28.46 points, well above its long-term average of 20.
Big banks declined and as did mega-cap growth stocks including Amazon.com AMZN.O, Google parent Alphabet GOOGL.O and Tesla Inc TSLA.O.
Intel Corp INTC.O slipped 5.9% after the chipmaker forecast its profit margin to drop this year and then be steady for several years as it invests in new technologies and factories to meet rising chip demand.

2022-02-18 00:00:00+00:00,Why Intel Stock Collapsed Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-stock-collapsed-today,,,"What happened
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) stock crashed in Friday morning trading, down 5.6% as of 11:55 a.m. ET after the company held an investor meeting to lay out its ""2022 and long-term growth strategy.""
Hearing the news, analysts at two investment banks -- Barclays and BMO Capital, rushed to lower price targets on the stock, while a third, Bank of America, warned that investors might see ""no reward until 2026"" from the plan, reported TheFly.com.
So what
So what did Intel say to so spook those analysts -- and traders, too?
Basically, the story goes like this: ""The continued proliferation of technology is driving sustained, long-term demand for semiconductors, creating a $1 trillion market opportunity by 2030,"" said Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger. But Intel will need to invest heavily before it can take advantage of this opportunity -- and getting there will take some time.
Eventually, the company says it's aiming to reach a pace of 10% to 12% year-over-year revenue growth by 2026. But in an illustration of how hard this hill will be to climb, Intel is forecasting only $76 billion in revenue for 2022 -- 4% less than it collected in 2021. Gross profit margins on those revenues will also fall steeply -- from 55.4% in 2021 (according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence) to just 49.6% in 2022 -- as the company invests heavily to support its growth goals.
With revenues and profit margins both dropping, investors can anticipate lower earnings as well. Instead of the $4.86 per share that Intel earned in 2021, management says investors should expect earnings of no more than $3.55 per share in 2022 -- with negative free cash flow, to boot.

Now what
This bleak short-term view is the most likely reason Intel stock is selling off Friday.
Longer term, however, the outlook appears brighter. After that expected contraction in 2022, Intel management anticipates that in both 2023 and 2024, the company will return to growth in the mid-to-high-single-digit percentage range with profit margins in the 51% to 53% range. This will be followed by 54% to 58% profit margins in 2025 and beyond, and the promised 10% to 12% revenue growth rate by 2026.
By that point, Intel thinks it should be generating ""adjusted"" free cash flow in the neighborhood of 20% of revenue, too. So ... fingers crossed.

2022-02-18 00:00:00+00:00,These 8 Gurus All Own Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-8-gurus-all-own-intel,,,"When hedge fund manager ""titans"" think alike, investors are wise to pay attention. At Holdings Channel, we have reviewed 6,497 13F filings for the 12/31/2021 reporting period, and noticed that Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) was held by 8 of the particular managers we have flagged as ""titans"" most widely followed by investors. It is not every day we see this many notable hedge fund managers thinking alike, so we wanted to take a closer look.
Before we continue, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.
Having given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in INTC positions for each of the titans that reported holding some amount of INTC at 12/31/2021:
FUND MANAGER NEW POSITION? CHANGE IN SHARE COUNT CHANGE IN MARKET VALUE ($ IN 1000'S)
Bruce Berkowitz (Fairholme) Existing +108,800 +$4,858
Ray Dalio (Bridgewater) NEW +5,125 +$264
David Einhorn (Greenlight) NEW +309,500 +$15,939
Jeremy Grantham (GMO) Existing +58,271 +$1,646
Joel Greenblatt (Gotham Asset Management) Existing +144,969 +$7,007
Ken Griffin (Citadel) Existing -3,444,189 -$182,077
Seth Klarman (Baupost Group) Existing -1,708,000 -$123,108
Jim Simons (Renaissance Tech) Existing +708,200 +$32,435
Aggregate Change: -3,817,324 -$243,036
In terms of shares owned, we count 4 of the identified titans above having increased existing INTC positions from 09/30/2021 to 12/31/2021, with 2 having decreased their positions and 2 new positions. Worth noting is that Louis Bacon (Moore Capital Management), and Daniel Loeb (Third Point) — also deemed to have ""titan"" status — exited INTC common stock as of 12/31/2021.
Looking beyond these particular hedge funds of interest, we tallied up the INTC share count in the aggregate among all of the funds which held INTC at the 12/31/2021 reporting period (out of the 6,497 we looked at). We then compared that number to the sum total of INTC shares those same funds held back at the 09/30/2021 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for INTC. We found that between these two periods, hedge funds increased their holdings by 14,997,880 shares in the aggregate, from 2,489,456,953 up to 2,504,454,833 for a share count increase of approximately 0.60%. The overall top three hedge funds holding INTC on 12/31/2021 were:
» FUND SHARES OF INTC HELD
1. Vanguard Group Inc. 344,558,754
2. BlackRock Inc. 331,347,190
3. State Street Corp 177,117,083

We'll keep following the latest 13F filings by hedge fund managers and bring you interesting stories derived from a look at the aggregate information across groups of managers between filing periods. While looking at individual 13F filings can sometimes be misleading due to the long-only nature of the information, the sum total across groups of funds from one reporting period to another can be a lot more revealing and relevant, providing interesting stock ideas that merit further research, like Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC).
