Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock plummeted on Mar. 31, dropping 5.8% on the day
The catalyst for the drop was a downgrade from Barclays
Long-term growth investors should take this opportunity to buy AMD stock at a discount
Source: Grzegorz Czapski / Shutterstock.com
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) shares were on the move to end March. After a two-week rally, AMD stock capped the month off with a small drop on Mar. 30. This was followed by a 5.8% drop on Mar. 31. The slide continued on Friday morning. Not great news for Advanced Micro Devices shareholders, obviously, but a steep drop like this offers an opportunity to investors. 
The question is, should you buy AMD stock at this point? Shares are now down over 24% so far in 2022. They are off the all-time high close in November 2021 of $161.91 by nearly a third. The analyst who downgraded the stock raised concerns that AMD could experience challenges in 2023, which raises questions about whether this downward trajectory will continue.
While some investment analysts are hitting pause on AMD stock for the moment, I see this as a buying opportunity. Here is the case for taking advantage of AMD’s weakness to add shares to your portfolio.
AMD Advanced Micro Devices $109.26
Why Did AMD Stock Drop on March 31?
The trouble started immediately for AMD stock, with shares slipping from the moment the opening bell sounded. The catalyst for the drop was a downgrade from Blayne Curtis, an analyst with Barclays. In a research note to investors, Curtis downgraded AMD’s rating to “equal rate” from “overweight.” Curtis also slashed his price target from $148 to $115.
9 Solar Stocks Heating Up on Energy Crisis Concerns
What has Curtis so concerned about Advanced Micro Devices? As reported by The Street, Curtis noted that several of AMD’s key segments — gaming, PC, and its recent Xilinx acquisition — are running at “elevated levels.” The danger is that a cyclical correction is coming to these hot markets. In addition, he feels that AMD is facing increased competition from other semiconductor manufacturers, including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
He sees the two issues converging in 2023, resulting in further weakness for AMD stock.  
AMD Fears Are Overblown
Let’s unpack the issues here. 
Xilinx reported its last quarterly earnings before being acquired by AMD on Jan. 26. The company’s fiscal third quarter saw record revenue, up 26% year-over-year. Much of that growth was driven by big gains in Xilinx’s data center, automotive, and aerospace & defense divisions. Data center spending is projected to keep going at a strong pace through at least 2026. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, defense spending is set to be increased. Despite challenges over the past year, global spending on automotive chips is projected to rise at a CAGR of over 6% through 2027.
I don’t see anything in there that is cause for concern. In fact, this data points toward continued growth for Xilinx.
But what about AMD’s gaming and PC business? There is no denying that AMD has benefited from several factors that could see cyclical decline going forward. The pandemic resulted in more people gaming. Additionally, the remote work trend turned the declining PC market into one unexpectedly experiencing hot growth. A new generation of game consoles have been in high demand and they’re powered by custom AMD chips.
By next year, there could be some cooling in all these areas. But maybe not. Remote work may be fading, but hybrid work — partly at home and partly in the office — is becoming a new normal. That is expected to keep PC sales humming. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are still early in their life cycles. There is no sign of demand letting up. 
As for competition from the likes of Intel, these are early days for Intel’s ventures into computer graphic processing units (GPUs). At the moment, the company has few takers and is just ramping up desktop GPU production with limited edition releases this summer. Convincing PC manufacturers and consumers to adopt a GPU from a new company instead of the brands that have dominated the market for decades will be a tough sell for Intel. The company also has to convince game developers and others to optimize software to run on its GPUs if it is going to see any uptake.
Yes, this is a risk to AMD stock. But for now, it is more something to keep an eye on than a cause for alarm.
Bottom Line: Should You Buy AMD Stock?
AMD is a Portfolio Grader “B” rated stock. It still earns a consensus “Overweight” rating from investment analysts tracked by the Wall Street Journal — despite the recent Barclay’s downgrade. Their average price target of $152.50 offers nearly 40% upside from today’s price. 
The latest drop in AMD stock is just another opportunity for long-term growth investors to add more shares to their portfolio.

2022-04-04 00:00:00+00:00,Which Stocks To Buy Now? 4 Semiconductor Stocks In Focus,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/which-stocks-to-buy-now-4-semiconductor-stocks-in-focus,,,"Should Investors Be Buying These Semiconductor Stocks Right Now?
In the past couple of years, semiconductor stocks have been a popular sector among investors looking to invest in the stock market. With the growing adoption of 5G mobile networks and electric vehicles, demand for semiconductors has been at an all-time high. This, coupled with the supply chain issues caused by the pandemic, has pushed the prices of semiconductors up. And by extension, this could mean higher profit margins for chip manufacturers.
As such, I could see why some may be putting up a list of top semiconductor stocks to buy. Take Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) for instance. At the recent Game Developers Conference, the company launched its Snapdragon Metaverse Fund. According to Qualcomm, the fund aims to be a launchpad for extended reality (XR) developers and companies working to build the metaverse. Elsewhere, we have Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) which reported its earnings last month. Driven by strong enterprise demand, the company achieved record first-quarter results and provided positive guidance for the next quarter. With all that in mind, watch out for these four semiconductor stocks in the stock market today.
Semiconductor Stocks To Watch This Week
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) 
Semtech Corporation (NASDAQ: SMTC)
Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU)
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)
Intel
Starting us off today is one of the leaders in the semiconductor industry, Intel. In detail, the company engages in the design and manufacturing of products and technologies.

The semiconductor firm brought in net sales of $190.55 million for the quarter, up by 15.7% when compared to prior year sales of $164.67 million. Next to that, GAAP diluted earnings per share came in at $0.53, a substantial increase from last year’s $0.24. As for its first-quarter outlook, the company expects net sales to be in the range of $195 million to $205 million. Besides that, GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.58. Considering all this, would you invest in SMTC stock?

Micron
Micron is an industry leader in the innovative memory and storage solutions industry. It continues to transform how the world uses information to enrich itself. Its portfolio of high-performance products includes DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory and storage products. Most of which are under its Micron and Crucial brands. The company’s technologies help fuel the data economy, enabling advances in AI and 5G.
On March 29, Micron announced results for its second quarter of fiscal 2022. Diving in, the company raked in a total revenue of $7.79 billion for the quarter. This signals a substantial increase compared to the same period last year which brought in $6.24 billion. As for profits, Micron brought in GAAP net income of $2.26 billion. Accordingly, this translates to $2 per diluted share. 
As such, Micron’s second-quarter results managed to exceed the high end of its previously quoted guidance for both revenue and margin. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra added, “We’re leading the industry in technology across DRAM and NAND, and our product portfolio momentum is accelerating. With outstanding first-half results, Micron is on track to deliver record revenue and robust profitability in fiscal 2022.” Given this news, should you buy MU stock?

Investors who missed the recent stock market rally or the bull market that unfolded for many years are not too late. April is a new month and with it, readers may look for seven no-brainer stocks to buy. Using astock screenerlike Stock Rover is the best way to start. I will demonstrate in the table below how to pick stocks that have strong quality, growth, and/or value. After filtering for stocks with strong quantitative characteristics, evaluate reasons why the company’s unlocked catalysts outweigh the potential risks. Pick under-valued, high-quality companies that outweigh near-term uncertainties.

In the search, the companies that turn up represent a range of sectors. In the technology sector, two semiconductor companies represent great value. In the consumer discretionary sector, the company’s strong brand name will justify buying the stock. And in the streaming space, the stock’s plunge after posting quarterly results creates a deep value opportunity.
Ticker Company Last Price Quality Score Value Score Growth Score
BMY Bristol-Myers Squibb $73.82 85 78 92
GRMN Garmin  $116.11 84 81 95
INTC Intel $48.11 96 90 78

NFLX Netflix $373.47 89 62 98
SWKS Skyworks Solutions $132.03 96 84 95
TTD The Trade Desk $72.33 94 60 97

In the quant score table above, Intel and Skyworks Solutions have the highest value scores. They are out of favor because investors worry about their growth potential ahead. Netflix, Zoom Video, and Trade Desk have the highest growth score. Those companies should grow faster than the market expects. Investors who buy those stocks now will benefit if those firms post profits that exceed consensus estimates.
No-Brainer Stocks to Buy: Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)

Investors are appreciating the pipeline growth at Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY). The company got good news last month when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first combination drug to treat metastatic melanoma. Opdualag is a fixed-dose combination of nivolumab and retalimab. In a clinical trial, Bristol-Myers said that progression-free survival (PFS) more than doubled the median PFS.
The drug “introduces an entirely new combination of two immunotherapies that may act together to help improve anti-tumor response by targeting two different immune checkpoints,” according to Stephen Hodi, M.D., director of the Melanoma Center and the Center for Immuno-Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
In February, Bristol Myers announced a positive opinion recommending Opdivo as adjuvant treating adults with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma with tumor cell PD-L1 expression.
The drug maker ended 2021 on a strong note. In the fourth quarter, it reported revenue of $12 billion. The gross margin increased from 73.7% to 80.3%, due mostly to an impairment charge. Still, investors should expect a gross margin of 80% or higher in future quarters. Marketing and selling expenses declined. It fell by 13% to $2.4 billion. The company’s accelerated investments in 2020 are now paying off for BMY stock investors.
Garmin (GRMN)

Garmin’s (NYSE:GRMN) stock downtrend is showing signs of ending. In the fourth quarter, the company reported revenue growing by 3% year on year to $1.39 billion. Gross margins of 55.5% are healthy. It may expand after Garmin introduced the Garmin Descent Mk2i dive computer, won an award for Garmin Surround View Camera System, and introduced a new Garmin DriveSmart portable car navigator.
Investors treat Garmin as a GPS supplier for the wearable and automotive markets. Those are strong segments. Garmin is quietly reversing the margin erosion. New OEM products in the auto market will lift results. Revenue will expand as suppliers work through constraints.
7 Stocks Hit Hardest by Supply Chain Issues
In 2022, Garmin expects revenue to grow by almost 10% YoY to $5.5 billion. It will earn $5.90 a share. The company guided a gross margin of 57.5%. If Garmin launches an effective advertising campaign, shareholders should expect stronger demand for its new products. An earnings beat would send GRMN stock higher.
No-Brainer Stocks to Buy: Intel (INTC)
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com
Punished for losing server market share to competitors, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is attractive for its strong dividend and deep value. More importantly, its aggressive investments in semiconductor fabrications across the U.S. and Europe will reward investors. Globalization is ending. The ongoing supply constraints for semiconductors are not easing. Intel is de-risking its supply chain with aggressive investments.
In the next decade, Intel will spend over EUR 33 billion ($36.5 billion) for research and development and manufacturing in the European Union. It wants leading-edge semiconductor fabs in German and France. CEO Pat Gelsinger said, “the EU Chips Act will empower private companies and governments to work together to drastically advance Europe’s position in the semiconductor sector.”
The investment is a first step in the U.S. chip giant moving away from its dependency on China and Taiwan. Intel will also benefit from the bloc subsidizing those investments.
In the graphics card space, Intel will enter the discrete market by introducing GPUs for laptops. This quarter, the industry expects Intel will start selling GPUs for the PC market. GPU prices are almost double the manufacturer’s suggested retail price. Intel may benefit from the supply shortage by entering this space for the first time.
INTC stock’s Quality Score of 96 and Value Score of 90 cements its “no-brainer” status right now.
Coca-Cola (KO)
Source: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is more than a seller of pop drinks. Its core business is so healthy that the company announced its 60th consecutive annual dividend increase on Feb. 17, 2022. It raised its dividend from 42 cents to 44 cents a share.
The company has transformed its business. This resulted in quarterly revenue growing by 10% to $9.5 billion. Revenue benefited from a 10% growth in price/mix, offsetting a 1% decline in concentrate sales. In the quarter and for the full year of 2021, Coca-Cola’s total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverage market share grew. This contributed to a cash flow from operations increase of $2.8 billion, to $12.6 billion.
9 Solar Stocks Heating Up on Energy Crisis Concerns
During the quarter, Coke acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in BODYARMOR. The sports performance and hydration beverages market will complement its core business. To realize higher marketing efficiency, the company named ad giant WPP (NYSE:WPP) as its global marketing network partner. It will rely on WPP to execute its new marketing model. Investors should expect the advertiser to drive Coca-Cola’s long-term global growth.
Analysts have an average price target of $67.40 on KO stock.
No-Brainer Stocks to Buy: Netflix (NFLX)
Source: Riccosta / Shutterstock.com
Investors over-reacted to Netflix’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) weak fourth-quarter report and subscription figures. The company earned $1.33 a share and revenue of $7.71 billion in the fourth quarter. It added 8.28 million net subscribers, barely missing its target of 8.5 million expectations.
In the current quarter, it forecast net subscriber additions of 2.5 million. Since it will still have 224.3 million subscribers in total, Netflix has plenty of opportunities to rejuvenate its growth. For example, it will build on its biggest-ever hit series, Squid Game. The unexpected South Korean drama will get a second season. Netflix will also debut over 20 new shows in the country as well.
In addition to dominating the streaming video market, the company is entering the mobile game market. It has three game launches schedule for this month that will propel NFLX stock higher. Into the Dead 2 is a zombie game. This is a True Story is a narrative puzzle. Shatter Remastered is an updated game of a PlayStation 3 game, Shatter, launched in 2009.
Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)
Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com
Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) reported flat revenue growth in its first fiscal quarter. Based on new product ramps across its diversified portfolio, the company expects revenue will grow in the double-digit percentage year-on-year.
In the last quarter, Skyworks posted revenue of $1.51 billion. It earned $2.40 per diluted share. The business thrived from growth in its mobile and broad markets portfolios. Investors should expect SWKS stock to recover as demand for connectivity accelerates. The industry is expanding its need for multiple essential wireless protocols. Strong adoption for 5G, advanced Wi-Fi, and precision GPS are catalysts.
7 Stocks Hit Hardest by Supply Chain Issues
Skyworks will realize delayed product delivery from the December quarter in the current period. Looking ahead to June, investors should expect the company’s design wins and product releases to lift bookings. By later this year, performance will accelerate as growth recovers.
The Android operating system is a potential growth area for Skyworks. The company needs to construct 5G solutions that increase performance for high-end Android devices. For example, Samsung is a strong customer. When Skyworks wins more business from Oppo, Xiaomi, and Vivo, investors will recognize its long-term growth potential.
No-Brainer Stocks to Buy: The Trade Desk (TTD)
Source: shutterstock.com
In the connected television advertising market, Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) might benefit from a digital-advertising tie-up with Netflix. Netflix may eventually offer a lower-priced ad-supported subscription. If it happens, The Trade Desk’s advertising revenue potential would soar.
In the fourth quarter, the company posted revenue of $395.6 million, up 24% YoY. It earned two cents a share. The company retained over 95% of its customers. With high customer satisfaction levels, The Trade Desk may sell more product solutions. It launched Solimar, a new media trading platform, last July 2021. The solution will help marketers optimize their digital advertising campaigns.
The Trade Desk established a partnership with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in 2021. It forged new partnerships last year with companies including Publicis, Xandr, Throttle and iCook. With those partners, TTD will benefit from strong adoption and support for Unified ID 2.0, identity preservation that values user control and privacy.
Few advertising firms get better data-driven decisions than that offered by The Trade Desk. The company is facilitating the setup and helping its customer in their data-driven decision process. Customers will realize a high return from artificial intelligence and machine learning with Koa.

2022-04-04 00:00:00+00:00,Bull of the Day: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bull-of-the-day%3A-advanced-micro-devices-amd-1,,,"I've written about Advanced Micro Devices AMD as the Bull of the Day several times this year.

That's because it continues to maintain its status as a Zacks #1 Rank Strong Buy after analysts keep raising estimates.

But there's always a bull-bear battle somewhere in Semis and last week brought us this naysayer warning about the PC and gaming markets...

Barclays downgrades AMD to Equal Weight from Overweight

Analyst Blayne Curtis slashed the firm's price target from $148 to $115, saying that ""the company's growth story needs a pause"" with cyclical risks looming in 2023.

""AMD remains positioned to gain market share this year in both the client and server markets, but cyclical risk across several of its end markets, including PC, gaming and broad-based, will come in 2023,"" said the analyst. He believes all three segments are running at elevated levels, which poses risk to AMD's growth trajectory.

Well, that's one view in a diverse sea of bull-bear perspectives. Here was the rebuttal on the same day, March 31...

AMD weakness on competitor downgrade a buying opportunity

Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann said AMD share weakness today is being driven by a competitor downgrade on 2023 cyclical issues, ""angst on potential consumer weakness in PCs and mobile"" even though he says AMD does not sell into this market, and a potential price war with Intel INTC.

However, Mosesmann contends that AMD is ""not in any jeopardy"" of missing its 30% year-over-year sales growth target for 2022 as he views AMD being set to gain significant data center market share, which ""is the thrust of the investment thesis, not a PC market that is up or down 5%.""

And here was a broader view of the Semi market from BofA on March 25...

BofA tactically most constructive on ""MANGO"" stocks in U.S. Semiconductors

The PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) is down 11% year-to-date versus the S&P 500's decline of 5%, noted BofA analyst Vivek Arya, and his recent discussions with investors about the US Semiconductors sector ""have overwhelmingly been focused more on cycle worries like peaking demand and rising capex than on company fundamentals,"" the analyst wrote.

However, as long as global GDP remains above trend, semi stocks are attractive and the ""structural importance of semis to the rapidly digitizing global economy cannot be overstated,"" Arya contends. In that context, Arya made a ""crude attempt at constructing a fang equivalent in semis"" and came up with ""MANGO,"" an acronym that stands for Marvell (MRVL), Broadcom (AVGO), AMD (AMD), Analog Devices (AMD), NVIDIA NVDA, GlobalFoundries (GFS) and ON Semiconductor (ON)

Arya identifies these Semi stocks as those which he is tactically most constructive about. He has ""high conviction"" that these names are ""levered to the right end-markets with solid demand visibility and consistent execution,"" Arya added.

Here's how I view the unique position of AMD, from my recent articles...

The Rise of a Duopoly in HPC and AI

AMD has strengthened its position in the semiconductor market on the back of its evolution as an enterprise-focused company from a pure-bred consumer PC and gaming chip provider.

And after another beat-and-raise quarter -- where the Lisa Su starship offered guidance for Q1 EPS that was 30% above consensus Street estimates -- the stock is on its way back to the old highs.

AMD has emerged as a strong challenger to NVIDIA's (NVDA) dominance in the GPU (graphic processing unit) market based on its Radeon technology. Launch of 7 nanometer (nm)-based AMD Radeon RX 5700-series gaming graphics card family featuring RDNA architecture, high-speed GDDR6 (Graphics Double Data Rate type 6) memory and support for the PCIe 4.0 interface, has helped the company increase presence among gamers.

Since the technology of GPU chips for gaming has driven the R&D for high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), AMD has joined NVDA in the ""category of two"" where enterprises and scientific research institutions must have their technologies to crunch large amounts of data at hyper-speed.

In fact, many use both companys' chipsets to foster ""dissimilar redundancy"" in platform architecture, performance, reliability, and sourcing.

Bottom line on AMD: I still believe shares are a bargain near $100 and would continue to recommend them to investors.

Disclosure: I own AMD and NVDA shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader Portfolio.

Benjamin Graham Stock Ideas
About Benjamin Graham: The late Benjamin Graham may be the oldest of the gurus we follow, but his impact on the investing world has lasted for decades after his death in 1976. Known as both the ""Father of Value Investing"" and the founder of the entire field of security analysis, Graham mentored several of history's greatest investors -- including Warren Buffett -- and inspired a slew of others, including John Templeton, Mario Gabelli, and another of Validea's gurus, John Neff. Graham built his fortune and reputation after living through some extremely difficult times, including both the Great Depression and his own family's financial woes following his father's death when Benjamin was a young man. His investment firm posted per annum returns of about 20 percent from 1936 to 1956, far outpacing the 12.2 percent average return for the market during that time.

2022-04-03 00:00:00+00:00,Why Dividend Stocks With Low Payout Ratios Can Be Better Than Those With High Yields,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-dividend-stocks-with-low-payout-ratios-can-be-better-than-those-with-high-yields,,,"Dividend-paying stocks in the S&P 500 have historically outperformed their non-dividend-paying index peers. Dividend-growing companies in the index have performed even better.
So should we buy the highest-yielding dividend-growth stocks in the S&P 500 and call it a day?
Maybe, but there is one last (and less popular) metric that has historically led to outperformance -- the payout ratio. Specifically, dividend-growing stocks that maintain a payout ratio below 50% help create the exact type of stocked pond people like to fish in, offering investors a healthy balance between returning cash to shareholders and funding company growth.
As a result, it's not the top quintile of highest-yield stocks (and their 74% average payout ratio) that outperform at the highest rate, but the second quintile (and its 41% average payout ratio), according to data from Wellington Management.
Let's find out what this means for investors interested in optimizing their dividend strategy.
Image source: Getty Images.
High-yield dividends, low growth prospects
While high-yield dividend stocks may be alluring at first glance, many tend to have higher payout ratios. The payout ratio is a stock's dividend payout as a percentage of its net income, and it can quickly tell investors how much of a company's profits are going directly back to shareholders.
When these high-yield stocks continue to increase their dividend payments over time, they eventually begin to test the limits of their financial security, paying out bigger portions of their earnings.
High payout ratios typically mean two things.
First, the company will have less money to reinvest back into the business, spending which could have fueled future sales growth, eventually growing the bottom line. Sales growth is a strong indicator of a stock's long-term performance, putting companies with high payout ratios at a disadvantage thanks to their hampered growth prospects.
Furthermore, if a company has a high payout ratio, its dividend growth potential is similarly restricted -- or worse yet, it may need to cut its payout to maintain financial security. While dividend cuts are far from death knells (sometimes even wise decisions), they generally lead to a sell-off in the stock as income-focused investors flee.
S&P 500 companies that cut their dividend not only underperformed their peers over a 48-year period but produced a negative annual return overall, reinforcing the importance of a well-funded dividend.
Low payout ratios, long-term growth potential
On the flip side, stocks with low payout ratios offer a balanced approach between returning cash to shareholders and funding future growth. Thanks to this extra cash available to reinvest in the business, a flywheel effect can take hold.
First, a portion of the excess profits go back into the business, creating new sales that flow through to the bottom line. With this rising net income, the company can increase its dividend, often without raising its payout ratio as profits and dividends paid out rise at a similar rate.
Additionally, if the company still has earnings to spare, management can also consider lowering its share count through share repurchase programs. For example, consider the declining share counts for two great low payout ratio stocks, Lowe's and Union Pacific.
Data by YCharts.
Despite the capital required to maintain their respective operations, these two have not only funded many years of annual dividend increases but rapidly lowered their total shares outstanding over the last decade. Fewer shares make the dividends cheaper to maintain while boosting earnings per share -- furthering the flywheel effect.
Because of these benefits, looking for low payout ratios over high yields is akin to choosing longer-term cash flow potential over higher near-term income.
The best of both worlds
Best yet for investors, a handful of stocks offer relatively high dividend yields and low payout ratios. Let's look at three here:
METRIC CUMMINS INTEL TARGET
Dividend yield 2.9% 3.0% 1.7%
Payout ratio 38.3% 28.6% 22.4%
Maximum dividend potential 7.6% 10.5% 7.6%
Consecutive years of dividend increases 8 19 53
Source: Yahoo! Finance. Maximum dividend potential = dividend yield/payout ratio.
Notice that despite not having the highest dividend yield, Intel has the highest maximum dividend potential based on its dividend yield divided by its payout ratio. Similarly, Target has a dividend yield about one percentage point lower than Cummins, but they have comparable maximums.
I bring these three companies up to illuminate the power of a low payout ratio. Yes, you may be sacrificing some near-term dividend income by forgoing high-yield stocks, but your long-term dividend potential should one day dwarf that high initial income if you hold for the long haul.

2022-04-03 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Should Raise Its Dividend,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-should-raise-its-dividend,,,"Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) dividend yield, an afterthought for most investors, is currently sitting at 0.06%. That is partly due to a stock price that has climbed faster than the company's dividend payments. On that score, the company hasn't increased its dividend in over two years. As the company's profits have climbed on the back of strong demand for advanced graphics chips and data center systems, the dividend payout ratio has dropped to less than 5%.
Here are a few reasons the company should consider returning more income to shareholders.
Nvidia's cash flow and payout history
Nvidia's profit margin improved significantly in recent years as the mix of revenue shifted to data center chips and high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) for gamers that command steep selling prices.
Over the last five years, the company's free cash flow, which is the amount of cash the company can spend on reinvestment in operations, acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases, climbed 457% to $8.1 billion. That represents a high margin of 30% on $26.9 billion in fiscal 2022 revenue.

Management seems to have anticipated the company's fortunes nine years ago. Nvidia initiated its first quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share in fiscal 2012 (ended in January 2013). That year, Nvidia generated $640 million in free cash flow on $4.3 billion in revenue, or a free cash flow margin of about 15%.
But over the last five years, Nvidia's free cash flow has increased more than 400%, while the dividend has only increased 25%. Other companies that design or manufacture chips, such as Apple, Intel, and Broadcom, pay out anywhere from 14% to 58% of their free cash flow in dividends. These companies face just as much competition for their products, yet they far outspend Nvidia in returning cash to shareholders through dividends.
NVDA Cash Dividend Payout Ratio data by YCharts.
Nvidia can afford a higher payout
Nvidia can certainly afford to double its payout to at least 10%. The total spent on dividends last year was $399 million, but Nvidia has spent far more on share repurchases. Since August 2004, management has spent over $7 billion repurchasing shares. After spending $2 billion to repurchase shares in the recent quarter, they currently have another $5 billion left on their share repurchase authorization through the end of December 2022.
The recent $2 billion buyback at these high valuation levels is questionable. Nvidia previously spent $1.6 billion to buy back shares in 2018, when the stock traded at an attractive valuation of around 20 times earnings. Management did not repurchase any shares between 2020 and 2021 as the stock's valuation soared.
So, why did management repurchase shares recently with the stock trading at a nosebleed valuation of 69 times trailing earnings? It would have made more sense from a capital allocation perspective to shift at least some of that cash return to dividends as opposed to buying back shares at these levels.
Furthermore, Nvidia's share repurchases have been completely ineffective in enhancing shareholder returns over the last 18 years. The annual diluted share count has increased 20% over that time, which means the amount spent on buybacks has only partially offset the dilution to shareholders.
NVDA Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Annual) data by YCharts.
At the end of January, Nvidia was sitting on a net cash balance of $10.3 billion, and given management's anticipation of further growth in free cash flow, that cash balance should continue to pile up over the long term.
Demand trends in data centers and gaming should continue to lift gross margin and Nvidia's profitability. Management expects new software opportunities with Nvidia AI Enterprise and Nvidia Omniverse will benefit the company's bottom line. ""Each one of these software offerings has a multibillion-dollar revenue potential and should contribute positively to our gross margins over time,"" said CFO Colette Kress at Nvidia's recent investor day.
Given Nvidia's expanding margins and opportunities, Nvidia should reconsider its capital return priorities. If the company is not going to reduce the share count and boost returns to investors with repurchases, it should shift more of its capital returns to dividends.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are dramatically different companies but have a few things in common. First, both serve the consumer market, and second, both have analysts that believe there is an increased risk of consumer spending slowing down. Here are some highlights from the video.
On March 31, a Barclays analyst downgraded AMD due to the potential risk of a slowdown in demand for its consumer products. On April 1, J.P. Morgan Securities removed Apple from its ""Analyst Focus List"" due to the risk of moderation in consumer spending.
Numerous semiconductor companies that deal with consumer electronics like Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were all down low single digits midday Friday.
The semiconductor market tends to be cyclical, and investors might be worried that the market has peaked for this cycle. Unfortunately, this is very hard to determine due to the strong spending by enterprises and cloud providers. So as one market peaks, the other market could just be getting started. The great thing about long-term investing is that you can ride out the cyclicality without stressing about where we are in the cycle.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock dips are opportunities, not warning signs.

Caution is good, but not all-out panic.
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)  stock has had consistent seasonality behavior for the last three years. Case in point, AMD stock is down 24% this year, more than three times worse than the S&P 500. But does that mean you should avoid it here? No. I think now is a time to buy.
Certainly, it makes more statistical sense to buy this semiconductor stock after a correction and going into May. But I think there should be better outcomes for those who hold it from even now through fall.
Some active investors may try to trade around these edges. But for most longer-term investors, it’s best to make it as simple as possible. For example AMD stock lost 13% in two days this week. After a disappointing Wednesday, it fell 8% again on Thursday after a downgrade from Barclays. They expressed overall sector concerns, so they chose to opt out and watch.
I respect an analyst that expresses their opinion — that is their job. But I find it ridiculous that a stock of this quality suffered so much from that. After all, “I don’t know so I won’t play” doesn’t mean the game is bad. And an analyst rating doesn’t change the facts that are in the AMD financial statements.

AMD Stock Is In Good Hands
Under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su, AMD has accomplished nearly an impossible feat. It more than doubled its business in three years while growing its net income roughly tenfold. Those metrics show absolutely no signs of trouble.
Competition is not a problem either. The demand for tech is growing at an exponential rate, so, there’s enough business to go around. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will all win in the end. If the stock markets are higher in the future, these three are also doing well.
The downgrade yesterday is immaterial to the success of the company. I commend them for their concern, but I would stick to facts and figures. Since I am not from Wall Street, I like to keep thing simple.
The Facts Tell a Good Story
Source: Charts by TradingView
The facts and the figures in the financial statements and the charts don’t lie. There’s no looming sign of impending intrinsic danger for AMD stock. Smart money should be looking for entry points, not panic exits.
This is where the investment mantra of Warren Buffett could apply perfectly. When everyone is fearful of AMD, I would look to be greedy.
Don’t get me wrong, I realize there is much going wrong with the world. In fact, I expected some downside this week. But the problem is not with AMD stock itself but from outside risks.
Not even valuation is an issue for this stock. It has a relatively modest price-to-sales under 10 and a price-earnings ratio under 50. For a company that grows this fast, these are not alarming numbers.
Remember how long critics targeted Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for running on low margins. It takes effort and money to deliver growth this big. At least this one has been profitable since 2018, and last year it netted almost $3.2 billion. Moreover, management generates $3.5 billion in cash from operation. So the rising interest rate environment is not likely to negatively affect it much.

2022-04-01 00:00:00+00:00,Better Dividend Stock: Texas Instruments vs. Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-dividend-stock%3A-texas-instruments-vs.-intel,,,"Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are both blue-chip semiconductor stocks that are often owned for stability and income instead of aggressive growth. But which of these chipmakers is actually a better long-term investment for dividend investors? Let's compare their core businesses, growth rates, and valuations to decide.
The similarities and differences
Texas Instruments and Intel are both integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) that manufacture their chips at their own foundries.
This makes them different from ""fabless"" chipmakers that outsource their production to third-party contract chipmakers. However, both chipmakers still outsource a small portion of their non-core chips -- like TI's embedded chips and Intel's discrete GPUs -- to third-party foundries.

TI mainly provides analog and embedded chips for the automotive, industrial, consumer electronics, and communications markets.
Intel's x86 CPUs, which generate most of its revenue, power most PCs and servers worldwide. TI's chips are cheaper and less powerful than Intel's CPUs, but they're essential for power management, data transfer, and wireless communication features across myriad devices.
Which chipmaker is growing faster?
TI and Intel serve different markets with different types of chips, but their top- and bottom-line growth have remained similar over the past five years:
Source: YCharts
The pandemic generated headwinds for TI by disrupting its automotive and industrial markets. However, the crisis generated tailwinds for Intel as stay-at-home trends and the surging usage of cloud-based services boosted its sales of PC and data center CPUs. Those headwinds and tailwinds have been gradually waning in a post-lockdown market.
But over the next few years, TI and Intel's paths could diverge. TI will likely benefit from a growing appetite for more chips in the auto and industrial markets as companies launch more connected vehicles and robots. Its gross margins should also continue to rise as it continues its shift from 200mm to 300mm wafers, which will cut its long-term production costs by about 40% but squeeze its near-term operating margins.
Meanwhile, Intel faces stiff competition in the x86 CPU market from AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and its manufacturing partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), also known as TSMC.
Intel has fallen behind TSMC in the ""process race"" to manufacture smaller and denser chips at its first-party foundries in recent years, and it plans to significantly ramp up its spending on new plants to close that gap by 2025.
Based on these facts, analysts seem much more optimistic about Texas Instrument's near- and mid-term growth in 2022 and 2023:
ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES
TEXAS INSTRUMENTS
INTEL
Revenue Growth (2022)
8.5%
1.9%
EPS Growth (2022)
10.2%
(35.5%)
Revenue Growth (2023)
3.7%
2.3%
EPS Growth (2023)
2.6%
5.1%
Data source: Yahoo Finance, March 31.
The valuations also reflect that optimism: TI trades at 21 times forward earnings, while Intel has a lower forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.
But what about the dividends?
TI pays a forward dividend yield of 2.5%, which is slightly lower than Intel's forward yield of 2.8%. But TI has also raised its dividend annually for 18 consecutive years, which easily beats Intel's eight-year streak of dividend hikes. TI also aims to return ""all"" of its free cash flow (FCF) to investors via buybacks and dividends, a pledge Intel has never made.
Over the past 12 months, TI and Intel spent 62% and 58% of their FCF, respectively, on their dividends. Those reasonable cash dividend payout ratios indicate both companies still have plenty of room for future hikes.
However, those dividends could still be affected by the rising capex requirements of their plant upgrades. TI plans to spend about $3.5 billion on capex each year through 2025 to expand its 300mm plants, which would represent a mid-teens percentage of its projected revenue.
Meanwhile, Intel plans to spend a whopping $26 billion -- or nearly 36% of its projected revenue -- on capex in 2022 as it desperately tries to catch up to TSMC and Samsung in the process race. I don't expect TI's spending plans to disrupt its dividend, but Intel's aggressive spending plans (and repeated pleas for government subsidies) suggest its dividend is on shakier ground.
The clear winner: Texas Instruments
Texas Instruments and Intel might initially seem similar, but the former is a more reliable investment than the latter because it's better diversified, it faces fewer direct competitors, and its business isn't as capital intensive.
TI might trade at a higher valuation and pay a slightly lower yield, but I firmly believe it will generate higher total returns than Intel over the next few years after factoring in its price appreciation and reinvested dividends.

2022-04-01 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Dropped on Friday,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-dropped-on-friday-0,,,"What happened
Shares of semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) dropped in Friday afternoon trading, falling 2.9% through 12:55 p.m. ET.
In the absence of any other news on Nvidia stock per se, it appears today's drop is tied to a Yahoo! Finance column that may have spooked investors.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Specifically, Yahoo! technology editor Daniel Howley warned today that ""Intel is coming for Nvidia and AMD,"" and launching a new line of ""Arc"" graphics chips to attack Nvidia's (and AMD's) dominance in gaming. And granted, a line like ""X company is coming for Y company"" probably sounds a little bit scary -- but I really don't believe investors need to be frightened at this point.
Why not? Well, if you read past the headline, it turns out that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is still only ""teasing"" its introduction of Arc, and the company will only ""eventually release"" the new GPUs -- but has not yet.
That simply doesn't sound like a clear and present danger to me.
Now what
Granted, some of the arguments in the column make sense. ""U.S. PC hardware sales grew 25% to $5.74 billion in 2021. And gaming isn't going anywhere anytime soon,"" for example. But while Yahoo! frames these statements as arguments for why Intel might want to expand its market share in GPUs -- and I agree -- they're also pretty good arguments for why Nvidia might grow its graphics business quite well if Intel fails to capture market share with Arc.
As Yahoo! notes, nearly half of Nvidia's revenue in 2021 came from the company's gaming division. You can't expect that Nvidia would give up those kinds of numbers without a fight.
Finally, consider further that, as Yahoo! admits, ""we don't even know how Intel's Arc chip compares to Nvidia or AMD's entry-level discrete chips"" yet. Given the uncertainty surrounding both Intel's timeline and its capabilities, I simply don't see this story as something Nvidia investors need to worry about anytime soon.

2022-04-01 00:00:00+00:00,Which Semiconductor Stock Will Outperform the Competition?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/which-semiconductor-stock-will-outperform-the-competition,,,"Wall Street remains bullish about the semiconductor sector.
Demand for PCs, gaming consoles, and laptops has soared in the past two years as more people worked from home due to the pandemic. Moreover, the usage of semiconductors is increasing in different applications from automobiles to mobiles.
A Fortune Business Insights report estimates that the semiconductor market is likely to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.6% between 2021 and 2028 to $803.15 billion.
Let's compare two such semiconductor companies, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, and examine how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.
Intel
Intel’s products include processors that power PCs, a standalone system-on-a-chip (SoC), a multichip package, and memory and storage products. For the past few years, Intel has been technologically falling behind the competition.
To correct Intel’s course, the semiconductor company appointed former CTO Pat Gelsinger as CEO in February last year. Last year, the company also unveiled a process and packaging technology roadmap – IDM (integrated device manufacturer) 2.0 strategy, which included the launch of Intel Foundry Services (IFS), a new foundry business, and a $20-billion investment in two new fabs in Arizona.
However, at an investor meeting in February this year, the company’s business outlook left analysts looking for more. The management expects its annual revenue growth to accelerate from a low-single-digit percentage year-over-year in 2022 to 10-12% by 2025 or 2026.
This outlook could be in doubt because some of Intel’s key product launches (particularly Granite Rapids, a Xeon server processor and successor to Sapphire Rapids) have been pushed back further into 2024.
Wall Street analysts have been concerned that with the delay in the launch of these processors, Intel could lose its market share in the data center market to AMD.
Gelsinger acknowledged at a conference in March that in the data center market, “it's going to be a pretty close race” with AMD when Intel’s “Granites and Sierra Forest” are launched.
The data center market is an important one for Intel, and comprised 32.6% of the company’s total revenues of $79 billion in FY21.
Besides the market share losses, other concerns for Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann are a “change in the business model, suspect secular sales growth [and] sub-optimal manufacturing (lagging leading foundries by 1-2 years).”
As a result, the analyst is bearish with a Sell rating and the lowest price target on the Street on the stock of $40.
Other analysts on Wall Street, however, do not share Mosesmann’s view and are sidelined on the stock with a consensus rating of Hold based on eight Buys, 13 Holds, and seven Sells. The average Intel stock prediction is $53.76, implying 12.2% upside potential to current levels.
Advanced Micro Devices
Shares of AMD dropped 8.3% on Thursday to close at $109.34 following a downgrade of the stock from Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis.
Curtis downgraded the stock from a Buy to Hold and lowered the price target from $148 to $115, the lowest price target on the Street.
While the analyst acknowledged that he expects AMD to continue to grab market share from Intel when it comes to client and server markets, Curtis does not expect AMD to sustain this growth rate going forward.
The analyst stated in his research note, “…while we do see upside to the 31% growth target this year, where we have an issue is for 2023, as we see cyclical risk across several end markets (PC, Gaming, and broad-based/XLNX).”
However, this view is not shared by Mosesmann. The analyst’s investment thesis is centered on his belief that AMD is “set to gain significant data center market share,” and not “a PC market that is up or down 5%.”
Mosesmann believes that AMD will very well achieve its target of 30% year-over-year growth for 2022. AMD primarily offers x86 microprocessors (CPUs) for PCs, and server and embedded processors, semi-custom system-on-chip (SoC) products.
On its Q4earnings call the company’s management stated that for 2022, AMD expects growth across all its business segments fueled by strong demand for its products. From 2023 onwards, AMD anticipates that “the percentage of data center to continue to increase as we go into next year, and we'll give more on that as we go through the year.”
When it comes to the PC market, the analyst is of the view that the PC market will be “flattish” this year based on his channel checks. Even in such a market, Mosesmann continues to see AMD “structurally, to continue to gain PC CPU market share.”
Drawing a comparison between Intel and AMD, Mosesmann agreed with Curtis regarding Intel’s market share. Mosesmann stated that with Intel’s Sapphire Rapids and Granite Rapids processors delayed, “Intel has limited ability to defend server share at any price.”
As a result, the top-rated analyst remains bullish on the stock with a Buy rating and a Street high price target of $200.
Overall, other Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating on the stock based on 14 Buys and seven Holds. The average AMD stock prediction is $150.41, implying 40.6% upside potential.
Bottom Line
While analysts are sidelined about Intel and cautiously optimistic about AMD, it does seem that AMD seems to have an edge over Intel right now as INTC battles delayed product launches.

Since the stock market bottom in March 2020, one of the strongest industries within the tech sector has been semiconductor stocks. Over this timeframe, the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) is up 191%, which is significantly better than the S&P 500’s 109% gain.
The major reason for this outperformance was increased spending on technology by businesses and consumers during the pandemic. Demand outstripped supply even as some factories suspended production, leading to increased revenues and pricing power for companies and even shortages for certain chips. In recent months, the industry has experienced a correction, which is allowing investors to scoop up shares at more attractive entry points.
Further, underlying trends remain favorable for semiconductor stocks as business spending on technology remains strong. Recent earnings reports have also revealed which companies are continuing to gain momentum and are well-positioned to make new highs.
7 Stocks That Insiders Are Buying Now. Should You?
Here are three semiconductor stocks with considerable upside that investors should consider buying now:
AVGO Broadcom $619.66
IMOS ChipMos Technologies $34.89
INTC Intel $47.64
Broadcom (AVGO)

Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) splits its business into two segments: infrastructure software solutions and semiconductors. Its chips are found in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones plus all sorts of computers and networking equipment. Thus, the company has benefitted from increased spending with 5G adoption.
Its infrastructure software is used to manage data centers and has seen substantial growth with cloud computing. Semiconductors account for 76% of revenue but infrastructure software is growing fast as well and comes with bigger margins. 
Given its exposure to two different parts of the tech industry, with both growing impressively, it’s not surprising that the company has seen solid earnings growth recently. Over the last five years, AVGO’s revenues have increased by 60%, and its free cash flow by 153%. 
This momentum has continued with its recent earnings report which showed earnings growth of 27% and 16% revenue growth. It also issued better-than-expected guidance for the next quarter at $7.9 billion, which implies 20% revenue growth. 
AVGO’s POWR Ratings confirm its bullish earnings outlook. The company has an overall A rating, which translates to “strong buy” in our proprietary ratings system. The POWR Ratings assess stocks by 118 different factors, each with its own weighting. A-rated stocks have posted an average annual performance of 31.1% which handily beats the S&P 500’s 8.0% average annual gain over the same period. 
ChipMos Technologies (IMOS)

ChipMos Technologies (NASDAQ:IMOS) researches, makes and sells “high-integration and high-precision integrated circuits and related assembly and testing services” internationally. The company is headquartered in Hsinchu, Taiwan.
IMOS has some similarities with AVGO, such as a low valuation and above-average dividend. Currently, IMOS has a price-earnings ratio of 7.5 and a 4.5% dividend yield. Both are considerably higher than the S&P 500’s P/E of 25.8 and 1.3% dividend yield. This valuation looks even better when considering that it has nearly 20% of its market cap in cash, increasing the chances of dividend hikes or share buybacks.
IMOS offers backend solutions for other semiconductor firms. More specifically, “IMOS is an outsourcing company that provides semiconductor assembly and testing for final placement in devices by their clients.” Therefore, the company’s revenues are well-diversified in terms of customers and product segments. This also means that it’s well-positioned for growth over the next couple of years as the industry invests in new production capacity. 
7 Stocks Hit Hardest by Supply Chain Issues
Given this combination of growth and value, it’s not surprising that IMOS has an overall B rating, which equates to a “buy” in our POWR Ratings system. In terms of component grades, IMOS has an A for Value due to its low P/E. It also has a B for Momentum as the company has demonstrated relative strength during this market correction relative to its peers.

The last of our semiconductor stocks, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), is one of the world’s largest chip makers in terms of both design and manufacturing. Until a couple of years ago, INTC was the clear leader in terms of processors but has been displaced by AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). It’s also lost its leadership in terms of manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM).
However, INTC continues to be a cash-cow as it generated $11.3 billion in free cash flow in 2021. The company also has a solid plan in place to pivot its business, with a goal to become the leading semiconductor manufacturer by 2025. To this end, the company is investing 33 billion euros in production facilities in Europe with governments contributing another $7 billion. 
The events in Ukraine have increased the urgency of its project, as it clearly has national security and economic implications. Semiconductor shortages have had all sorts of negative downstream effects on other industries. It’s also concerning that a fair chunk of the world’s semiconductor production is in Taiwan, which could be at risk in the event of a Chinese invasion. 
Another attractive part of INTC is its ownership of MobilEye. This is one of the leading companies in the autonomous driving space. INTC is looking to spin off MobilEye as its own entity, although it will retain a majority stake. This should help it realize greater value from the investment given that it should trade at a higher multiple than INTC.
INTC’s strong fundamentals and turnaround are reflected in its POWR Ratings. The stock has an overall A rating, which indicates a “strong buy” in our proprietary rating system. 
In terms of component grades, INTC has a B for Value due to having a forward P/E that is nearly half of the S&P 500. It also has a Sentiment grade of B due to a consensus price target of $56.7, implying 17% upside.

Micron earned $2.26 billion, $2 per share fully diluted, on revenue of $7.78 billion during the quarter ending March 3. This handily beat analyst estimates. Micron also issued positive guidance, predicting sales growth of 11% and earnings growth of 15% during the current quarter.
7 Stocks Hit Hardest by Supply Chain Issues
The results sent the stock up 2.7% in overnight trading, on top of a similar gain before earnings came out. Micron is now worth $92 billion, but still has a low price to earnings ratio of under 13.
MU Micron Technology $78.78
The Cloud Supercycle
Micron remains a cheap stock because semiconductors have been a boom-and-bust business for decades.
Revenue remains choppy. While the costs of producing chip memory continue to decline, prices can fall ahead of the improvement. Micron had more revenue and net income in fiscal 2018 than is expected for fiscal 2022.
Micron stock is also cheap because of competition. While it’s the dominant American supplier, production still trails Korean competitors Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and SK Hynix (OTCMKTS:HXSCL).
Demand for Micron chips skyrocketed last decade as chip memory replaced disk memory in PCs, and phones replaced PCs as the primary device for most consumers. Market saturation after 2018 cut demand. But now cloud data centers are picking up that slack. Micron says data centers now take more memory than phones. That growth is expected to continue, with half of all cloud data centers still being built in the U.S.
Despite having over $10 billion in cash and short term securities on its books, against just $7 billion of long-term debt, Micron is pushing alongside Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for subsidies that will let it “in-shore” more production. CEO Sanjay Mehotra says U.S. aid will help the company expand its footprint in Boise, where it is already the second-largest private employer. Micron has 12 manufacturing locations around the world but says it’s safe from any disruption caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.
Riding the Wave
Yet MU stock still remains very volatile.
Shares traded near $100 each in January, and as low as $70 when the war began in earnest. At its present level it has recovered just half that loss and is still down 5% over the last year. The dividend, 10 cents/share, only began last year and will yield just 0.5% if continued over a year.
Despite the volatility, analysts are enthusiastic about Micron stock. There are 19 following it at Tipranks and all but two say buy it. Their average price target of $118 is 39% ahead of where it is presently trading.
But timing can be the key to profit. Analyst upgrades accompanied the stock’s recent bounce off its lows. While there were concerns about supply coming out of the war news, demand remains strong.
The Bottom Line on MU Stock
Timing is the key to maximizing your profit in Micron.
The latest downturn in the share price was the second in less than a year. There were also hard falls in 2018 and 2020.
But for each new low there is a higher high. MU stock is up 195% over the last five years, a nearly 40% capital gain each year. That’s twice the gain of the S&P 500 average.
The best window for buying MU stock may be closing, but long-term investors should still make money even if they buy now. The best strategy is to watch the charts and treat each skid as a buying opportunity. Your patience will be rewarded.

2022-04-01 00:00:00+00:00,Is iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) a Strong ETF Right Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-ishares-semiconductor-etf-soxx-a-strong-etf-right-now-1,,,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) debuted on 07/10/2001, and offers broad exposure to the Technology ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.
Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.
The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.
Fund Sponsor & Index
SOXX is managed by Blackrock, and this fund has amassed over $9.02 billion, which makes it one of the largest ETFs in the Technology ETFs. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index before fees and expenses.
The ICE Semiconductor Index measures the performance of U.S. traded securities of companies engaged in the semiconductor business.
Cost & Other Expenses
For ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.
Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.43% for this ETF, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.
It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 0.72%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
SOXX's heaviest allocation is in the Information Technology sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
When you look at individual holdings, Nvidia Corp (NVDA) accounts for about 8.91% of the fund's total assets, followed by Broadcom Inc (AVGO) and Intel Corporation Corp (INTC).
SOXX's top 10 holdings account for about 47.7% of its total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
So far this year, SOXX has lost about -14.27%, and is up about 12.47% in the last one year (as of 04/01/2022). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $387.58 and $555.63.
The fund has a beta of 1.16 and standard deviation of 36.27% for the trailing three-year period, which makes SOXX a high risk choice in this particular space. With about 35 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.
Alternatives
IShares Semiconductor ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Technology ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.
SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD) tracks S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index and the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) tracks MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF has $1.39 billion in assets, VanEck Semiconductor ETF has $8.67 billion. XSD has an expense ratio of 0.35% and SMH charges 0.35%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Technology ETFs.

2022-04-01 00:00:00+00:00,FOCUS-The chip challenge: Keeping Western semiconductors out of Russian weapons,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/focus-the-chip-challenge%3A-keeping-western-semiconductors-out-of-russian-weapons,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
OAKLAND, Calif., April 1 (Reuters) - When Silicon Valley chipmaker Marvell learned that one of its chips was found in a Russian surveillance drone recovered in 2016, it set out to investigate how that came to be.
The chip, which costs less than $2, was shipped in 2009 to a distributor in Asia, which sold it to another broker in Asia, which later went out of business.
“We couldn’t trace it any further,” Marvell Technology Group Ltd MRVL.O Chief Operations Officer Chris Koopmans said in a recent interview.
Years later, it reappeared in the drone recovered in Lithuania.
Marvell’s experience is one of a myriad of examples of how chipmakers lack ability to track where many of their lower-end products end up, executives and experts said. That could stymie the enforcement of new U.S. sanctions designed to halt the export of U.S. technology into Russia.
While higher-end sophisticated chips that can build supercomputers are sold directly to companies, lower-cost commodity ones that might just control the power often go through several resellers before they end up in a gadget.
The global chip industry is expected to ship 578 billion chips this year, 64% of them “commodity” chips, said TechInsights’ chip economist Dan Hutcheson.
While Russia accounted for less than 0.1% of global chip purchases before the sanctions, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization, new Western sanctions underscore the threat in human terms.
“All those drones we've seen were not armed,” said Damien Spleeters, deputy director of operations at the European Union- and Germany-funded Conflict Armament Research group, which found the chips in the drones.
“Some of these drones that we have documented, like the Forpost, are now used in their armed version in the current conflict” in Ukraine, he said.
The report that prompted Marvell’s tracking work published late last year by the Conflict Armament Research also found chips in Russian drones from Intel, NXP, Analog Devices, Samsung Electronics, Texas Instruments, and STMicroelectronics.
Texas Instruments and STMicroelectronics did not reply to Reuters for comment; NXP and Analog Devices said they comply with sanctions; Intel said it’s against its products being used for human rights violations; and Samsung said it does not make chips for military purposes.
Military weapons such as drones, guided missiles, helicopters, fighter jets, vehicles and electronic warfare equipment all need chips and experts say they often use older chips that are well tested out. Now, under new U.S. sanctions even some of the most basic chips cannot be shipped to prohibited Russian entities.
For the most sensitive chips, controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the U.S. company selling them can be held responsible if the chip ends up with an entity on the U.S. banned list, said Daniel Fisher-Owens, a specialist on chips and export control and at law firm Berliner Corcoran & Rowe.
‘LIKE THE DRUG BUSINESS’
Figuring out where chips go is like tracking the flow of narcotics, experts say.
“It’s like the drug business,” said James Lewis, director of the technology policy program at Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. “There's cutouts. There's middlemen. There's money laundering … There's a black market distribution network.”
The point of the Russian sanctions, Lewis said, isn’t to track every chip, but to disrupt their supply chain, which the intelligence community has been working on.
Finding a solution could take creative technical approaches.
""Knowing where the chips go is probably a very good thing. You could for example, on every chip put in essentially a public private key pair, which authenticates it,” and allows it to work, Eric Schmidt, the former Google chairman, told Reuters in a recent interview, discussing high-end processors.
Marvell says it has a growing number of products supporting fingerprinting and tracing, and is working with industry partners and customers to advance this area. The Global Semiconductor Alliance has proposed its members work on building a “Trusted IoT Ecosystem Security” to tag and trace chips, said Tom Katsioulas, technology executive at the industry group.
That may be a lot harder to do for a $2 chip, without making it prohibitively expensive. The answer could be a matter of manufacturing process, regulation and, perhaps, will.
“Ironically, the technology to do this, all of the things that we've got in there, the blockchain, the IDs in the device, this has all been done before for other applications,” said Michael Ford an executive at Aegis Software who is working with the industry standards group IPC for better supply chain security. “All that is needed is that catalyst to make it happen.”
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could be that catalyst, he said.

2022-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,EU regulators look to streamline antitrust rules,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/eu-regulators-look-to-streamline-antitrust-rules,,,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS, March 31 (Reuters) - Regulators are looking to update rules, which target companies abusing their market power and those setting up illegal cartels, to make them more efficient, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday.
Under the rules, known as Regulation 1/2003 and in force since 2004, the European Commission has taken on Alphabet GOOGL.O unit Google, Apple AAPL.O, Amazon AMZN.O, Meta FB.O, Microsoft MSFT.O and Intel INTC.O and imposed billions of euros in fines.
The rules have also allowed the EU competition enforcer to go after car parts cartels, banks' manipulation of financial benchmarks and other illegal price-fixing groups, putting the EU agency in the forefront of antitrust enforcement.
The Commission wants to maintain its leading position, Vestager said.
""I'm announcing today that in the coming months we are going to launch an evaluation of Regulation 1/2003, the central plank of our antitrust enforcement framework,"" Vestager told a conference organised by economic consultancy CRA.
""It is important that we hear the views of stakeholders concerning what has worked well, and where there is scope for more efficient and effective procedures and enforcement tools; making sure Regulation 1 is truly 'fit for the digital age',"" she said.
Vestager said the updated rules would seek to make them more operational and useful to businesses.
Such procedural changes would relate to requests for information sent to companies, dawn raids, oral hearings where companies seek to defend their cases and the 10% cap on fines levied for breach of rules or non-compliance.

2022-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,Blend Some Defense Into Your Portfolio With These 3 Proven Stocks,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/blend-some-defense-into-your-portfolio-with-these-3-proven-stocks,,,"With interest rates rising to cool down an overheated economy and geopolitical issues disrupting many facets of the world, the market’s outlook appears a little hazy.
Investors are closely watching for Treasury yield curve inversions and keeping close tabs on the Fed’s recent hawkish nature. Many have noted the unique current economic environment and believe that relying on historical data from previous yield curve inversions and interest rate hikes is futile.
Nonetheless, it’s beneficial to pivot to stocks that provide a higher level of defense during an economic recession if it were to happen. I’ve selected three stocks that provide precisely that, with one large-cap company that provides tech exposure. Let’s look at these three companies and analyze some key metrics.
Tyson Foods, Inc
Tyson Foods, Inc TSN, currently residing in the Consumer Staples Sector, is the world’s largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork. With the persistent demand for their products, companies within this sector generate consistent, reliable revenues, even in recessionary periods.
Overall, the company’s top line has consistently climbed throughout the years and grew nearly 9% from 2020 to 2021. The three primary sources of revenue – chicken, beef, and pork – saw sizable revenue growth as well during this time frame, increasing by 4%, 14%, and 22%, respectively.

The company’s balance sheet shows that its total liabilities decreased by 3% and total assets increased by roughly 5.4% from 2020 to 2021. Shareholders’ equity increased by 16%, and long-term debt was slashed by 23%. Additionally, as of December 31st 2021, the company has a current ratio of 1.68 with a P/B ratio of 1.73.
Over the last 60 days, analysts have been rapidly revising their EPS estimates upward for the current and next year. The current year’s EPS estimate has soared 21% to $8.74 per share, and next year’s EPS estimate has increased by nearly 6% to $7.87 per share. Notably, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate of $1.91 for the next quarter’s earnings reflects a 42% year-over-year growth from the previous year’s quarter.
Tyson exceeded earnings expectations by a considerable 51% in its latest quarter and overall, has an average EPS surprise of 32% over its last four earnings reports. The king of protein has been around for a long time, and with a strong balance sheet and strong earnings outlook, I believe that TSN would be a great portfolio addition during times of economic weakness. TSN is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with an overall VGM Score of an A.

Walmart
Walmart WMT, considered one of the most popular retailers globally, is a big box known for its discounts and extensive product selection. During times of economic stress, discount retailers can see sales rise when consumers look for ways to reduce spending and keep a few extra bucks in their pockets.
Walmart increased revenue by nearly 2.5% from 2021 to 2022, and since 2018, the top line has expanded by 15%. Two vital streams of income, net sales in the U.S and net sales from Sam’s Club, both saw impressive increases from 2021 to 2022, climbing 6% and 15%, respectively.

Taking a magnified view of the balance sheet, Walmart reduced its total liabilities by a considerable 7.3% from 2021 to 2022 and increased total shareholders’ equity by 5%. Long-term debt was slashed by 13%, and accounts receivables jumped by 27%. Additionally, book value per share increased by 2.2%, and the company’s current ratio of 0.93 reflects a marginal 0.4% decrease from FY21.
Upwards analyst estimate revisions over the last 60 days have pushed the current year’s EPS estimate up by a slight 0.6% to $6.77 per share, and next year’s EPS estimate has increased 0.8% up to $7.30 per share. The current year’s EPS estimate reflects year-over-year growth of nearly 3%, with overall sales expected to grow by almost 5%.
Walmart beat earnings estimates by a positive 2% in its latest quarter and has an average EPS surprise of nearly 15% over its last four. The colossal retailer has a strong balance sheet, can generate significant sales, and has remained at the forefront of the retail industry for as long as I can remember. The company sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an overall VGM Score of an A.

Intel Corporation
Intel INTC is the world’s largest semiconductor company and primary supplier of microprocessors and chipsets. Tech names generally provide lower defense levels during economic weakness, but I believe Intel has the strength to do the opposite.
Intel’s top line saw a 1.5% increase from 2020 to 2021, and since 2018, revenue has increased nearly 12%. Net revenue from its IoT line of business grew by a considerable 80% from 2020 to 2021, and its client computing line of business grew by a slight 1.3%.

The computer giant cut its long-term debt by 1.1% and increased its total assets by 10% from 2020 to 2021. Accounts receivable and shareholders’ equity saw considerable jumps, increasing by 40% and 10%, respectively. Additionally, current assets of the company shot up nearly 23%.
Current-year EPS estimates have decreased by a slight 0.8% over the last 60 days, but next year’s consensus earnings estimate has inched up 0.9% to $3.71 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year’s earnings reflects a 4% year-over-year growth, and the sales estimate represents a 6.3% increase in its top line.
Intel beat out earnings estimates by an impressive 21% in its latest quarter and has a four-quarter trailing average EPS surprise close to 30%. With long-term debt decreasing and assets increasing, substantial growth numbers within shareholders’ equity and accounts receivables, I believe that Intel can stand its ground and reward investors during times of economic uncertainty. Intel is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an overall VGM Score of a B.
