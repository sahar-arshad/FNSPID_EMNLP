2022-02-18 00:00:00+00:00,Italy preparing 6 bln euro package to curb energy bills - draft,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/italy-preparing-6-bln-euro-package-to-curb-energy-bills-draft,,,"Recasts with detail from draft decree
ROME, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Italy's government is finalising new measures worth almost 6 billion euros ($6.81 billion) to help consumers and firms hit by the rise in energy bills, a draft decree seen by Reuters showed.
The package, due to be approved by the cabinet on Friday, comes on top of some 10 billion euros already budgeted since July last year to try to soften the cost of surging oil and gas prices.
Some 3 billion euros will go to cut a range of so-called ""system-cost"" levies, the draft showed. These levies, which help finance things from solar power subsidies to nuclear decommissioning, typically account for more than 20% of Italian retail energy bills.
Rome also plans to introduce simplification measures to speed up the construction of renewablepower plants, the draft showed.
Employers association Confindustria has estimated that energy bills will cost industry some 37 billion euros this year compared with 20 billion euros in 2021.
The decree is not only devoted to capping energy costs, and will involve a total of almost 8 billion euros of extra spending and tax breaks, a government source told Reuters.
Industry Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti has called for around 1 billion euros of public funds to promote the purchase of less polluting vehicles.
Additional funds will be allocated between 2022 and 2030 to support research and development in microprocessor technology, the draft said, without specifying how much.

2022-02-17 00:00:00+00:00,The Xilinx Deal Will Accelerate Growth in Advanced Micro Devices,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-xilinx-deal-will-accelerate-growth-in-advanced-micro-devices,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock rose almost 5% in the 24 hours after it completed the $50 billion acquisition of Xilinx.
Source: Ascannio/Shutterstock
Xilinx was known for inventing Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FGPAs), chips, which can be pre-programmed with software. It had over half the programmable chip market.
Like AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Xilinx is fabless. That is, it doesn’t manufacture chips, just designs them. Like AMD, it uses Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), known as TSMC, as a foundry.
Why Analysts Cheered
Approval of AMD’s deal comes shortly after Nvidia was forced to abandon its acquisition of ARM Holdings from Softbank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY). The original transaction price was $35 billion, based on AMD’s stock price at the time, valuing Xilinx at about 11 times revenue.
Xilinx was profitable at the time of the deal, but net income had fallen for two years in a row, and fiscal 2021 revenue was slightly below that of fiscal 2020. Xilinx’ fiscal year ran from April to March. Due to the ongoing chip shortage, however, 2022 was shaping up to be another growth year, with revenue for the first three quarters just short of the previous year’s total.
The deal values each Xilinx share at 1.7234 AMD shares. In its news release on the transaction, AMD hailed growth in its “Total Addressable Market” (TAM), previously $80 billion, which it now estimates at $135 billion. On the cost side, the deal also doubles the number of AMD employees in India.
7 Hot Stocks That Show No Signs of Cooling Off
Analysts were enthusiastic, believing that combining the two companies’ designs make a whole greater than the sum of its parts. Xilinx becomes the Adaptive and Embedded Computing unit of AMD, with new markets in automotive, aerospace and industrials. Former Xilinx CEO Victor Peng will continue to run the group. Like AMD CEO Lisa Su, he’s a native of Taiwan, and had been at AMD before joining Xilinx a decade ago.
Bad News for Intel
If there is a loser in all this, it’s Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
Intel had bought Altera seven years ago to compete with Xilinx. But the former Altera was recently losing share for the same reason Intel was falling behind AMD, namely TSMC’s superior manufacturing. The solution in both cases is the same, matching TSMC’s Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) process technology in chips with lines closer than 10 nm apart. Both Intel and TSMC are investing heavily in new chip foundries.
Over the last few years, embedded technologies have been merging with graphics processing. Recently, Xilinx had been doing especially well in the data center business, an area of emphasis for AMD. Its designs are expected to boost AMD there, as well as help its Radeon graphics cards compete with those of Nvidia.
I am a long-time fan of AMD CEO Su, but so is most of Wall Street. I recommended AMD in August and suggested you could pick it up for less by buying Xilinx stock.
Bottom Line on AMD Stock
The semiconductor “super cycle” shows no signs of abating.
Chips no longer go just into PCs, phones, and servers. They’re found in any product whose controls interact with its environment. Xilinx let this software be embedded into products through single chips, invisibly.
But this integration of products, like cars, with the computing environment is now becoming tighter. It makes AMD’s acquisition of Xilinx, like Intel’s of Altera, make sense for customers as well as suppliers.
This will not, however, immediately alleviate the ongoing chip shortage. That still depends on TSMC and Intel increasing their manufacturing capacity. Until then, profits will continue rolling in from every side.

SAN FRANCISCO Feb 17 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger on Thursday told Reuters that Intel would be interested in participating if a consortium emerges to own the British semiconductor and software design company Arm Ltd.
He said there had been talk in the industry about forming a consortium even before Nvidia Corp NVDA.O proposed to buy Arm from SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T. That deal, valued at up to $80 billion, officially collapsed last week. SoftBank Group Corp cited regulatory hurdles and said it will seek to list the company.
Gelsinger said Intel would be happy to see Arm do an IPO or be owned by a consortium.
""We're not big users of Arm, but we do use Arm. We're going to get to be bigger users of Arm as we make it part of our IFS (foundry business) agenda as well,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of Intel's Investor Day. ""So if a consortium would emerge, we would probably be very favorable to participate in it in some manner.""
He also said that the acquisition of Tower Semiconductor TSEM.TA would not change Intel's European investment plans.
Earlier this week Intel announced it is buying Israeli chipmaker Tower for $5.4 billion, giving it access to more specialized production as it positions to take advantage of soaring semiconductor demand.

2022-02-17 00:00:00+00:00,3 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy in February,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dividend-paying-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-february,,,"Sometimes, there's nothing better than owning a stock with a steady, growing stream of dividend payments. Especially if you are invested in a nontaxable account like a Roth IRA, these durable businesses can help provide you with life-changing wealth if you buy and hold them for many years.
While dividends are nice, they can be hard to find in the technology sector, with many companies either staying unprofitable or opting for share repurchases instead.
But not all technology companies avoid paying out dividends to shareholders. Here are three dividend-paying technology stocks to buy in February.

1. Texas Instruments: 2.79% yield
The first company on the list is Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN). Yes, this is the same company that makes those bulky graphing calculators for students, but that is only a tiny part of this $150 billion business. Texas Instruments is the leading manufacturer of analog semiconductor chips, mainly serving the automotive, industrial, and personal electronics industries.
Unlike the leading-edge semiconductor manufacturers (which we'll get to with the third company on this list), Texas Instruments has minimal competition and a defensible position, with tens of thousands of patents on different technologies.
Given the steadily rising demand for semiconductors around the globe, Texas Instruments has been able to grow its top and bottom lines at a healthy clip over the past decade. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2021, the company grew sales 19% year over year to $4.8 billion. Over the past 12 months, it generated $6.3 billion in free cash flow, up 15% year over year.
This free cash flow is what funds Texas Instruments healthy 2.79% dividend yield. Over the past decade, Texas Instruments' dividend payouts have grown tremendously, now at $4.21 a share over the past 12 months compared to under $1.00 back in 2010. If revenue and free cash flow continue to compound as they have in the past, the stock's annual dividend payouts will likely grow along with it.

2. Visa: 0.66% yield
Most of you reading this will know Visa (NYSE: V), one of the two dominant digital payment rails along with Mastercard. Visa makes money by partnering with banks and credit card and financial technology (fintech) companies, taking a small fee on every transaction processed on its network. With the steady decline of physical cash payments and the rise of digital payments globally, Visa has ridden a nice secular tailwind over the last few decades.
There are no signs of this ""war on cash"" slowing down anytime soon. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, which ended in December, Visa did $7.1 billion in revenue, up 24% year over year. Growth in revenue was mainly driven by a 20% increase in payment volume around the world. Since Visa's network is extremely asset-light, most of its revenue falls directly to the bottom line. In the first quarter of 2022, the company had a best-in-class 66% operating margin, which shows how incredible Visa's business is.
With these outsized profits, Visa has started to return a healthy amount of money back to investors through dividends and share repurchases. This has mainly been through share repurchases, with $4 billion bought in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 alone, but management has also consistently raised its dividend per share since instituting one a little over 10 years ago.
Visa's dividend yield right now is quite small, at 0.66%, but with a dividend per share that has grown substantially over the last decade, investors will likely be quite happy with Visa's dividend payouts over the next 10 years.

Lastly, Visa stock is a perfect inflation hedge. Since the company takes a percentage of every transaction on its network, if overall payments volume rises due to inflation, Visa's revenue will grow along with it.
3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing: 1.24% yield
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), or just TSM, is one of the largest companies in the world, with a market cap of $600 billion. The company is the largest manufacturer of semiconductors worldwide, focusing on the cutting-edge layer of chips for companies like Apple, Nvidia, and many others. Unlike an integrated manufacturer like Intel, TSM does not actually sell semiconductors to end customers but manufactures them based on designs outlined for them by companies like Apple and Nvidia.
This foundry strategy, as it is called in the industry, has led TSM to gain an impressive lead over competitors like Intel due to its massive scale and resources. The company has an estimated 54% share of the foundry market worldwide. Like Texas Instruments, TSM has been able to ride the global tailwind of semiconductor demand while also gaining market share over competitors like Intel, pushing the company to double-digit annual revenue growth over the last few decades. In the fourth quarter of 2021, TSM did $15.7 billion in revenue, up 24% year over year, with a 42% operating margin.
TSM Dividend Per Share (TTM) data by YCharts
TSM has a dividend yield of 1.24%, which likely could be a lot higher if the company still wasn't in a big investment phase. In 2022 alone, management expects TSM to spend $40 billion to $44 billion on capital expenditures.
While costly, this shows that TSM thinks there is a huge opportunity to reinvest for future growth in the coming years, which will hopefully drive revenue and profit growth as well. Once the company matures and spends less of its revenue on capital expenditures, TSM will likely start raising its dividend per share because of the excess free cash flow it will be generating.

2022-02-17 00:00:00+00:00,3 Dow Stocks To Avoid,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dow-stocks-to-avoid,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The Dow Jones Industrials does this, the Dow does that. But when it comes to three Dow stocks and uninspiring earnings reports, the action is looking more doggish and worth staying at arm’s length from or risk getting bit.
On Tuesday, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrials rallied about 1.25% on the back of easing tensions between Russia and Ukraine.
Tech heavyweight Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), along with American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) were among those constituents leading the charge higher with outsized stock performance on the day.
The next day? The venerable benchmark was quick to give back more than half those gains. Oh what a relief it is?
Daily price theatrics aside, some Dow investors are in it to win it with a strategy of buying the Dogs of the Dow or those stocks sporting the index’s largest dividend payouts.
7 Housing Stocks To Sell if You Think the Boom Is Going To Bust
Respectfully, it’s proven a successful investing scheme over the years that’s bested the returns of a simple buy and hold program in the Dow Jones.
Merck (NYSE:MRK)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
3M Company (NYSE:MMM)
Dutifully though and as this decade’s Roaring ‘20s bull market redux attests, this is no ordinary time for Dow stocks. And today some of the index’s top dogs, following bearish earnings reactions, are more inclined to bite than love their bullish owners.
Doggish Dow Stocks to Avoid: Merck (MRK)
Source: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.com
The first of our Dow stocks to avoid are shares of Merck and its 3.60% yield.
Shares of the pharmaceutical giant fell more than 3.5% following early February’s earnings report.
Earnings and revenues topped Street views, but weak guidance for 2022 took center stage with investors.

Source: Charts by TradingView
Right now this Dow stock is up close to 1% on the year and defying the index’s decline of nearly 4.5%. It’s far from all good though on the MRK stock chart though.
Technically and as the monthly view shows, shares challenged uptrend support in the fourth quarter after failing to make good on a near two-year long corrective breakout.
Today and with MRK producing an earnings-driven bearish reversal at its former pattern high, the chance for shares of this Dow stock to break below initial uptrend support is raised.
If January’s candlestick low of $75.35 is broken a second time, I’d forecast the $2.76 in income Dog investors are looking forward too, may feel like little comfort.
Should that occur a bearish move towards longer-term uptrend, Covid and Fibonacci support near $61 and a dividend of around 4.50% could be in the offing.
Intel (INTC)
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com
The next of our Dow stocks to avoid is Intel and its 3.00% annual dividend.
Shares of the embattled chip giant saw investors running for the exits in the immediate aftermath of January’s earnings release.
What’s more, the drop of more than 7% is a headscratcher based on its top and bottom-line beat and management’s upbeat guidance. Oh I know, it was gross margins that got under investors’ skins!

Source: Charts by TradingView
One thing is for sure, the reaction couldn’t be labeled profit-taking based on INTC stock’s mostly bearish Roaring ‘20s price action of the past couple years.
But make no mistake and mysteries aside, with a bearish engulfing and trendline busting monthly candlestick in hand, this Dow stock is poised for even doggedly weaker price action.
7 Defensive Growth Stocks to Buy for February
If January’s low, which found support at Intel’s 2000 all-time-high, is violated all bets aren’t off the table. Just don’t be caught long shares!
Ultimately and as the detailed INTC chart shows, a bear cycle capable of challenging longer-term Fibonacci and uptrend support near $31 – $37.75 and dividend stream of around 4.00% looks plausible in this already doggish Dow stock.
Doggish Dow Stocks to Avoid: 3M Company (MMM)
Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com
The last of our Dow stocks to not get too worked up over just yet are shares of 3M Company and its annualized payout of about 3.75%.
Similar to INTC, 3M is another Dog of the Dow which delivered a seemingly strong earnings in late January.
It also found investors willing to give a decided technical advantage to MMM stock bears.

Source: Charts by TradingView
Weakness in shares following the report resulted in this Dow stock falling back beneath the 50% retracement level of its nearly five-year long corrective cup-shaped base.
That’s a big deal in a bad sort of way.
Further, with the price action coming after a failed handle consolidation, all bets that had been on the table related to the bullish base, were quickly and clearly shown the door.
Today and with some additional pressure in February, MMM stock is in a testing position of an uptrend and 38% retracement level dating back to the financial crisis.
It could be bullish, but this isn’t the Dow stock’s first introduction to either technical support. And further inspection of the price chart hints at a much larger bear market as possible.
One possibility that could reasonably play out is a “W” or double bottom variation which challenges MMM’s Covid bottom.
Bottom-line, if you happen to be bullish on this Dow stock, the only way you’re going to breathe easier during that kind of scenario isn’t a N95 mask—you’d better suit up with a hedged stock collar or simply avoid MMM stock like the plague!

The company, previously called TowerJazz, earned diluted earnings per share of 55 cents excluding one-time items in the fourth quarter, up from 34 cents a year earlier. Revenue rose 19% to $412 million, with organic growth up 28%.
Chipmakers are seeing a surge in demand as economies recover more quickly than expected from the pandemic, with some sectors, such as automaking, reporting shortages.
Tower was forecast to earn EPS of 46 cents on revenue of $425 million, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
For all of 2021, Tower earned an adjusted $1.37 per diluted share, versus 76 cents in 2020. Revenue gained 19% to $1.51 billion. Analysts had forecast EPS ex-one offs of $1.53 on revenue of $1.51 billion.
Tower TSEM.O, which specialises in analogue chips used in cars, medical sensors and power management, has said it would invest in equipment at its manufacturing sites in Israel, Texas and Japan to boost capacity for 200 and 300 millimetre chips.
Intel on Tuesday said it would buy Tower for $53 a share, or $5.4 billion to give it access to more specialised production as it positions to take advantage of the soaring semiconductor demand.
Tower typically issues a quarterly outlook but it said it would not due to the deal, which is expected to close in about 12 months.
Tower's shares have risen more than 40% since Intel's announcement.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).

Dan Pink: Never looking backward is a colossal and stupid idea. What you want to do is you want to look backward, but you want to look backward in a particular way that allows you to understand your choice, unburden yourself of that choice, extract a lesson from that choice and apply going forward.
Chris Hill: I'm Chris Hill, and that was Dan Pink, author of multiple best-selling books, including Drive, To sell Is Human, and When The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing. His new book is The Power Of Regret: How looking backward moves us forward. I wanted to talk with Dan about his book and since he's written about the business world, I also got his thoughts on where companies are going with office space and hybrid work. Since I know he's a sports fan, I also asked him to say the major league baseball season. I know that probably wasn't fair of me to ask since he's not actually involved in the negotiations between baseball owners and players, but I don't regret asking. Until I read Dan's book, I never really thought of regret as being something with great power. I started by asking him what got him interested in this topic?
Dan Pink: I think it was mostly because I realized that I had regrets of my own. If there was a catalytic moment and you can certainly relate to this with two kids in college is that my elder daughter graduated from college in 2019. I'm at her graduation and I'm having this out of body experience where I can't believe this kid is old enough to graduate from college. I also can't believe that I have a kid who's graduating from college because I'm 24. [laughs] I'm having this out of body experience and I'm thinking about, what was my college like? I started thinking about all these regrets that I had. That I didn't work hard enough. That I didn't take enough risks. One that really bugs me is that I felt that wasn't kind enough. When I came back, I just sheepishly mentioned it to a few people. Instead of their recoiling, people leaned in, which to my surprise, they really wanted to talk about this. That's an interesting reaction for a writer. It's a really interesting reaction, especially when you come up with a topic that you think isn't going to go over that well, and people instead just glam onto. I started looking at some of the academic research on it. I ended up actually putting aside a book that I was writing at that moment and spent a month researching regret and then wrote an entirely new proposal and had to go to my editor and say, ""I got some good news and some bad news. The bad news is the book you think I'm writing, I'm not going to do that anymore. The good news is that I think I have something better.""
Chris Hill: I did have that thought because, you and I have talked about this before, I remember talking to Scott Galloway about this, it doesn't matter how successful a nonfiction writer is, when they go [laughs] to their publisher with, here's my idea for a book. As often as not the publisher would be like, ""Oh, God really? You want to do that?"" There's no trust in the track record, so it's nice to know that they responded the way they did. As you indicated, there is a lot of research on this topic, you get to some of the research in your book. But you did research of your own. Can you share your thought process around the research that you originated and how you went about it?
Dan Pink: Sure thing. I'm glad, and thanks for asking about that because I'm really psyched about that. I did look at about 50 years of research. Mostly in social science, some neuroscience and medical science on regret. But I also did two projects of my own. One of them was something that I called the American regret project, where working with a company called Qualtrics, I put together the largest public opinion survey of American attitudes on regret ever done. We served a 4,489 Americans beautiful, gorgeous representative sample. To ask a whole bunch of questions about American attitudes about regret, in part to try to understand what demographic differences there were. At the same time, I did something else which I called the World Regret Survey, where I basically just set up a website and invited people to contribute their regrets hoping to get several 100. Well, we're over 17,000 now [laughs] so I ended up with 16,000 regrets from 105 countries. Those proved just an incredible source of insight and emotion and in a weird way, inspiration.
Chris Hill: You include some of them in the book. Every chapter begins with a few regrets that actual people have sent you. I was struck by the fact that there's such an enormous range of things that people regret. Some people regret at what on the page seem like very big decisions. But I was really struck by the people who have a regret of something they did long ago, and it seems like a small thing, and yet it's stuck with them. Maybe that gets to the power of regret that it doesn't matter how small it is, it can stick with you.
Dan Pink: You know what? It's a fascinating insight that you're making there because very few people talked about regrets in terms of their size. The fact that it happened and it was meaningful to them is enough. I think what's interesting is, and I think your insight is really powerful here, while there is a wide variety of regrets about the domains of life. One of them that really stuck with me was a 70 something year old woman in New Jersey who regretted stealing candy when she was a kid, 60 years later, she's still bugged by that. We're people with regrets about careers and health and romance and family and so forth. They run the gamut of the whole human experience. But what I found in looking at that giant trove of regrets was a deep down, around the world, it's amazing, people kept expressing the same four core regrets over and over again, irrespective of the domain. That took me to a place through this avenue of regret that I didn't expect to reach.
Chris Hill: This is where you and your team really build on the research of the past 50 years with categorizing the four types of regret; foundation, boldness, moral, and connection. If you can, did that just become apparent over time like, oh, we're starting to see this pattern and it breaks into these four groups?
Dan Pink: I'd love to tell you a story of how I bolted up right in the middle of the night and had this epiphany about the four core regrets. But it was much more undramatic and laborious than that as I was just reading through these regrets and trying to categorize them and thinking of categories on the whiteboard. But the other thing is that these two different pieces of research work together. For instance, when I did the quantitative survey, I thought I was going to get at the question of what people regretted. I had them categorize their regrets by domain. What I found is what researchers have been finding for 50 years is that they regret a lot of things, just as you're saying, they span, and I said, ""God, that's so unsatisfying."" I started thinking a little bit differently about the qualitative regrets. There I started seeing some patterns. Let me give you an example because I think that it makes more sense in the specific. I know that a lot of the Fools are entrepreneurs, so I'll give you an entrepreneurial idea here, Fools. Start a travel agency that serves people who went to college who regretted not studying abroad. I've got hundred of those, so think about that regret.
That's called out an education regret. Then I've got people, hundreds around the world who have a regret that says, ""I've always wanted to start a business, I've always wanted to go out of my own, but I never had the guts to do it."" That's a career regret. Then I have once again, hundreds around the world, almost with the exact same formulation, ""X years ago, I met a man/women whom I really liked. I wanted to ask him/her out, but I was too chicken to do it, and I've always regretted."" That's a romance regret. But to my mind, as far as you started seeing this, those are all the same regret. Those are all regrets about boldness. Those are all regrets about being an injunction on your life and having a choice. Do I play it safe or do I take the chance? When people play it safe they often regret it, not always and when they take a chance they don't always relish it. But it's pretty overwhelming that we regret not taking that chance. That's boldness regret. To meet all these four core regrets reveal something, I mean, again, it's weird, Chris, because I didn't expect to go there. But all these four regrets in a way reveal what makes life worth living and one of the things that makes life worth living, one of the components of a good life is doing stuff, trying stuff, learning, growing, leading a psychologically rich life. Boldness regards are one of the really most significant regrets that people have.
Chris Hill: I think that's probably the category that most stock investors can identify with. Because the two of the biggest regrets when it comes to investing are, I should have bought this stock earlier or I should not have sold this stock and the reason we don't buy the young upstart on profitable company is because of the risk factors involved it. The reason we sell that young, unprofitable upstart company after it gained 30 percent in the year is like [NOISE]. This isn't good. It's playing it safe instead of being bold.
Dan Pink: I think in many ways these four core regrets go to not only how we invest, but to some extent why we invest. A good example of it, and would you see over and over again, I mean, I think anybody who's listening to this probably doesn't have many in this first category, foundation regrets. Boldness regrets are if only I'd taken the chance. Foundation regrets are if only I'd done the work. What that means is people who regret not studying hard enough in school, a lot of those. Smoking, huge numbers of people regard smoking, not taking care of their health, and not saving money. One of the things that comes out with, I mean, obviously fools know this is the power of compounding interest in both the literal and metaphorical sense. Foundation regrets are these things where you make small decisions early that seemed to have no huge consequence, but over time they accumulate and then they become unstoppable.
I have one guy who I found very pointed who said, I mean, he says, ""I regret not saving money diligently ever since I started working."" He's 43. It's nearly crushing every day to think how hard I've worked over the last 25 years but financially I have nothing to show for it. What does that tell us though? I think it's something full investors understand is that an element of a good life is stability. We want to have some stable platform when our lives are unstable when our lives are chaotic and unpredictable, that drains our ability to lead a satisfying life. Financial markets are a challenging one because the nature of regret requires some agency on the part of the person who has the regret. They have that regard as your fault, not someone else's fault. But with foundation regrets it can be challenging. It's hard to save if you graduate from college, burdened with massive student loans. It's harder to do well in university if you went to a secondary school that wasn't very good. With foundation regards, we have to be a little bit careful with agency, but they're really important. Having that stable foundation is extraordinarily important to people.
Chris Hill: Let's get to a couple of things in the book that are again the subtitle how looking backward moves us forward. Because there's a lot of research you get to you in terms of regrets that are by nature looking backward. But one of the great things about your book is that it provides us with insight on tools of, don't just look backward with regret. Here are the tools to look forward and make better decisions. Once you get to is an example we've talked about on the show before, you categorize it as self-distancing. The example we've talked about before over the years on this show is Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel, that was faced with the decision of basically walking away from a profitable division of the company and investing in new technology and weighing that decision and then he turned to a trusted lieutenant, and said, ""If you and I got fired, the people who replaced us, what would they do?"" His lieutenant was like, ""They would absolutely invest in this new technology."" He's like, ""Great, that you're right. That's what they would do. That's what we should do.""
Dan Pink: That is one of the most important elements and how we deal with our regret at a big picture. We have to do some triangulation with our regret. You can say, we have this philosophy out there, no regrets, which is nonsense because you can say, however, regret, ""It doesn't matter. I always look forward. I never look backward."" That's a bad idea. Regret exists for a reason, regret isn't structured. If you do that you're never going to learn anything. On the other hand, some people over-index on their regrets and ruminate over them, wallowing them. In some cases, use the regrets as a way to exonerate themselves from doing something. That's a bad idea too. What you want to do is you want to use your regrets as signals for thinking and one way to do that is exactly as you say with self-distancing is, take a step back and say, ""What did I learn from this and how can I apply that moving forward?"" As you say, Chris, there's a pile of research showing that we're better off solving other people's problems than our own problems. What we want to do is give ourselves some distance from those and then some really clever, interesting tactics like that. For you Chris, if you wanted to deal with your regret, you could say, not what should I do, but what should Chris do? Talking to yourself and a third person, amazingly enough, seems to have that power.
Going forward in time and saying, ""Hey, 10 years from now, what decision will I have wanted to make?"" The replacing yourself that Andy Grove talked about is powerful there too. One of my favorite techniques and something that Tennessee Liggett, Stanford University calls a failure resume, which is to put together a resume of your failures. We don't have these resumes in LinkedIn profiles that say that we're the greatest things since sliced bread and that we probably deserved both the Heisman Trophy and Oscar earlier in our lives. These things they just glisten. If you look at people's resumes they just shine. That's part of us, but it's not all of us. The flip side of that Tina says, is to create a failure resume which is a glorious compilation of your screw-ups and your setbacks and your failure. I did this myself, listed the mall. It's not pleasant. But what I did, but you have to do it systematically as you say, so I listed those things and then I said, what did I learn from this stuff, and how am I going to apply forward? For me, it was regulatory because I found that a lot of my mistakes keep coming back to the same two core blunders that I was making and I've more or less stewed around those in the future.
Chris Hill: The self-distancing is such a great strategy. I have to confess though. I was surprised to reading your book to see the comparison between Julius Caesar and Elmo. [laughs] I was not [laughs] expecting that. [laughs] Well you're right. Those are Julius Caesar, Elmo, they're big for referring to themselves in the third person.
Dan Pink: They both talk about themselves in the third person and so spanning a long amount of time, and arguably a span of species suggested that this technique is somehow useful to us. This is actually an important thing and how we analyze human beings. It's like we think about something like regret. Regret is the second most comment emotion that people express overall, it's the most common negative emotion that people express. Why is that? It must serve some purpose. All of us wouldn't be feeling bad if there wasn't a reason for it. The reason for it very clearly in the research is that if you deal with it right, it's instructive, it points a way forward and so never looking backward is a colossally stupid idea. What you want to do is you want to look backward, but you want to look backward in a particular way that allows you to understand your choice. Unburden yourself of that choice, extract a lesson from that choice and apply going forward.
Chris Hill: Is part of the process trying to do a better job in setting our own expectations? I just think about the research you have in your book around Olympic athletes and in particular Olympic medalists, and how across-the-board people who win the bronze medal are happier than people who win the silver medal, even though the silver medal is a greater achievement. But the bronze medal is in some cases, it's people who are just happy that they got a medal at all.
Dan Pink: Yeah.
Chris Hill: Maybe expectation setting is a part of that.
Dan Pink: It is a big part of that. What that shows is that again, our cognitive machinery is programmed for that counterfactual thinking. There're two different ways to do that counterfactual thinking. One is to imagine that things could have been better and that hurts. That's what regret is, but it's instructive. The other one, which is actually an OK tactic sometimes is to imagine that things could have turned out worse. An upward counterfactual regret is what I call and if only, but the downward counterfactual, how it could have turned out worse isn't at least. The silver medalists are saying, if only I had, I talked about a bike race in the bulk. ""If only I'd pedal a tiny bit harder, I don't want to go rather than a silver."" Whereas the bronze medalist is like, ""Oh my God, at least I didn't slip from the lead like that other rider, and lose out on the medal stand altogether.""
I described this race which I didn't see live, but I saw a video of it. When they come over the finishing line, the silver medalist who just play second in the Olympics, she has a face buried in her hands, and the bronze medalist is exorbitant. This tells us something now, how do we apply that going forward for certain regrets particularly the regrets action. We can use that at least mechanism. I sell that a lot in the database of regret. Basically finding a silver lining, that can make you feel better. It doesn't necessarily mean that you do better, but it can make you feel better, and feeling better is OK sometimes. The most common one of that [laughs] in the database was, once again, dozens if not hundreds of people, I think they were all women, who said, ""I really regret marrying that idiot, [laughs] but at least I have these two great kids."" That's a silver lining. You can take certain kinds of regrets and at least them. Certain kinds of action regrets you can also undo. You get a tattoo and you're like, ""That was a stupid idea."" You can have the tattoo removed.
Chris Hill: One of my favorite stats in your book, that [laughs]for all the people touting they have no regrets, the tattoo removal business in America is a $100 million a year business.
Dan Pink: Yes. Maybe your analyst should be looking for a publicly held tattoo removal technology.
Chris Hill: When you and I talked about your last book, When: The Scientific Secrets, you said the research changed the way you live your life. When you make medical appointments, for example, they are always in the morning. By the way, having read your last book, I'm the same way, all medical appointments are before noon.
Dan Pink: All important medical appointments. I'll do a routine teeth cleaning in the afternoon. Because I think your listeners want to know this, I actually scheduled my next teeth cleaning for 8:00 AM, in case you were wondering about my dental hygiene here.
Chris Hill: Good to know. Has your work on this book, the research you've done, any changes for you personally?
Dan Pink: Yeah, several. I'll tell you the biggest one, it has to do with connection regrets, which was the biggest category of regrets. Connection regrets are if only I had reached out. I heard so many stories all over the world of people who had a relationship or should have had a relationship and it came apart. Not romantic relationships, but relationships with parents, or kids, or siblings, or other relatives, or friends, my gosh Chris, so much stuff about friends. These relationships come apart in profoundly undramatic ways. They just drift apart. What happens is someone says, ""I should reach out but it's going to feel really awkward and the other side won't care."" They're wrong.
They're flatly wrong on both counts. It's less awkward than you think, and the other side almost always cares. For me, the big takeaway, and it's one of the things I'm actually trying to work on this year, is to just reach out more to people who we're friends, who I knew, who I liked, who were part of my life at one point. I've always resisted that because I was like, ""It's going to be really awkward, and they're not going to care for that year for me."" This disabused me of that, to the point where my advice to myself that I'm trying to follow, but also to others, is that if you get to a juncture in your life and you're asking yourself, ""Should I reach out?"" The answer is yes. If you've gotten to that juncture, you've answered the question. I think to me a huge takeaway from hearing all these regrets from around the world is always reach out.
Chris Hill: You've written about the workplace, you've written about what motivates executives and employees, and we're at a point in time where so many companies are trying to figure out how to manage employees in a increasingly remote world. I know you are a naturally curious person, so what are you seeing in the stories you read about the future of the office and work culture, and where do you think this is going?
Dan Pink: As for where it's going I have no idea. But I actually think that this question of remote versus on-site is a proxy for bigger questions that have been unresolved and actually never addressed in the way we navigate organizations. Let me give an example of this. What kind of work should be done together and what kind of work should be done solo? We don't have a good theory of that. We have been making it up since white-collar work began. We do not have a good theory of what should be collaborative and what should be alone. What kind of work should be done synchronously and what should be done asynchronously. We don't know that, we just have this habit of having synchronous meetings all the time. Big question that you alluded to, what is an office for today? I think that that is a huge question that is up for grabs and we need to seriously think that. I think there are bigger questions too within the great resignation. It's, what do companies owe employees, what do employees owe companies? This is a question that the Fool has been addressing through conscious capitalism, which I think becomes more and more important each year. I actually even think that these regrets give us some clues about effective organizations. When we think about what people want, what do they want? They want a stable foundation. We know from regret, they want a stable foundation, they want a chance to learn and grow, they want to do the right thing, and they want connection and love. In a way those are the building blocks of a coherent culture: a culture that provides a sense of belonging, a culture that does the right thing, a culture that has a sense of purpose, a culture that fosters a sense of belonging, a culture that allows people to take sensible risks. Even though this has been a tough two years for everybody, I'm actually surprisingly optimistic about what's going to happen once we turn the page. I do feel that we could be in for a significant reboot. I hope so.
Chris Hill: Two more things and then I'll let you go. Recently there was an outpouring of sadness over the passing of comedian Bob Saget, who in addition to being respected and beloved in the entertainment community was very much a doppelganger for you. You could've been Bob Saget stunt double. Did you ever cross paths with him and connect in any way?
Dan Pink: Well, Chris, so I did cross paths with him about, more in a moment. But before I crossed paths with him, I probably had people tell me that six, seven, eight times a year. I would be on an airplane and the flight attendant would say, ""You know, you look a lot like Bob Saget."" I'm like, ""Okay, thank you."" Anyway, I ended up doing a small project with him not that long ago, where we were playing around with a podcasting technology and experimenting with new ways to do audio shows. He and I got together to do something where we just took basically listen to your questions about what's your problem. I got a chance to prep with him and I got a chance to work with him a little bit. I have to say, it's almost cliche to say after someone has passed, but he's just a lovely guy. Here's this guy, he's a huge star, huge, recognized around the world, and he was on the prep calls before me. He was as kind and generous to everybody at every level all along the way. In the way that we dealt with questioners, I expected him to be funny, totally, he was, he was incredibly insightful, and incredibly empathetic. One of the things that you see is that all of us at some level are performing, especially actors. Sometimes somebody performs a role and underneath they're an ass. This was almost the exact opposite, that his public performance was more of like, ""Hey, I'm going to tell some dirty jokes."" But deep down, again, in my limited knowledge of him, he was just a very kind, warm human being. I was devastated when I heard it.
Chris Hill: I know you're a baseball fan, particularly the Washington Nationals. As of right now the season is in jeopardy because the owners of major league baseball teams and the players association have not come to a collective bargaining agreement. This would not be the first time baseball season was threatened. If you could stand in a room and deliver a message about the power of regret to the owners and the players association, what would you say?
Dan Pink: It's a great question. In the last baseball strike I was actually working at the United States Department of Labor for the Secretary of Labor. At one point I said, ""You know what, maybe I can just strap on my Superman uniform and solve this strike."" Of course that was a year that the world series had canceled. [laughs] What I would say is maybe do a little bit of the self-distancing, but it's a self-distancing in time. Ten years from now, how do you want to look back on this decision? If you're an owner, do you want to look back and say, ""In my effort to squeeze out every last cent, I shut down the national pastime and disappointed kids all over America, and perhaps threatened the long-term health of the sport."" With the players, who I'm actually more sympathetic to, I would say, ""Listen, I understand where you're coming from, but remember that, I want you to do the same thing. Look back 10 years from now, and what do you want your kids to say about you? How do you want your kids to view this?"" I think that that distancing in time can help them, not perfectly, but help them reach an agreement.
Chris Hill: The book is The Power of Regret: How Looking Backward Moves Us Forward. It's available everywhere you find books starting on February 1st. That's all for today. But coming up this week, we got a lot in store, including value investing, the Nasdaq, big tech earnings, from Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and more. As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talked about. The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. I'm Chris Hill, thanks for listening. We'll see you tomorrow.

Feb 16 (Reuters) - Applied Materials Inc AMAT.O posted record quarterly revenue on Wednesday on robust demand for its semiconductor-making equipment from chipmakers, but a weak forecast for the current quarter suggested that supply chain woes will hurt its business.
The company forecast revenue between $6.05 billion and $6.65 billion for the second quarter, the midpoint of which was below analysts' average estimate of $6.38 billion.
Applied Materials is among the biggest makers of machinery used to manufacture semiconductors and counts among its top customers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 2330.TW, Samsung 005930.KS and Intel Corp INTC.O.
But shipping delays and shortage of key parts in recent months have made it harder for chipmakers to ramp up production, stopping companies like Applied Materials from fully cashing on a surge in demand.
""While the supply environment remains challenging, Applied Materials is doing everything we can to deliver for our customers and we recorded our highest-ever quarterly revenues,"" said CEO Gary Dickerson.
Shares of the California-based company rose 3% in extended trading.
Applied Materials reported first-quarter revenue of $6.27 billion, above analysts' estimates of $6.16 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Net income rose to $1.79 billion, or $2 per share, during the quarter ended Jan. 30, from $1.13 billion, or $1.22 per share, a year ago.

2022-02-16 00:00:00+00:00,"Third Point sees more value in Amazon, likes some 'old' tech stocks",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/third-point-sees-more-value-in-amazon-likes-some-old-tech-stocks,,,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Hedge fund Third Point LLC said it added new positions and bulked up on names it already owned when markets sold off earlier this year and said that Amazon AMZN.O is at an ""inflection point"" that should lead to a higher share price.
The New York-based firm, whose investments are closely watched by rivals, also said certain technology stocks often referred to as ""old"" tech like Intel INTC.O ""deserve a second look.""
Third Point, which oversees roughly $18 billion, has invested in Intel and Amazon for some time but said it had ""significantly increased"" the size of its investment in Amazon recently, betting new management will move the company forward with new initiatives.
Third Point's founder, billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, wrote about the moves in a letter sent to shareholders on Wednesday evening and reviewed by Reuters.
The outlook for Amazon, valued at $1.6 trillion, was described in the letter as especially bright, as Loeb expects some of the excess costs associated with the coronavirus pandemic, including labor shortages and supply chain disruptions, to disappear as the environment normalizes.
He wrote that he was happy to see Amazon's board buy back shares in January for the first time in a decade, and expects that Amazon may start returning more capital to shareholders.
Loeb also applauded the company's decision to break out advertising revenue and detail capital expenditures by category, calling the steps ""shareholder friendly moves"" as the company's new CEO, Andy Jassy, makes his mark.
The letter called it rare for an investors to get to buy a company like Amazon at a 30% to 40% discount to what it should be worth before an expected uptick in growth that should give Amazon ""an almost unlimited runway of potential to compound in value.""
Amazon's stock price surged during the pandemic in 2020 as people avoided shopping in stores, but grew less forcefully last year, laying the groundwork for Third Point to add to its position.
On a call with investors held earlier in the day, Loeb said the market is not fully recognizing the value of Amazon's two businesses; the e-commerce business and its Amazon Web Services cloud business, a person familiar with the content of the call said.
Third Point also invested in IT services company Accenture ACN.N and is betting that its market share gains will ""sustainably accelerate"" amid growing demand for IT services and shifts to digital transformation.
Loeb also praised Intel's new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who was appointed early last year after Third Point pushed for changes and said the company appears to have ""turned the corner"" with talent coming back, an improving product suite and a willingness to invest for growth.
Last year the firm reported a 22.7% gain in the Third Point Offshore fund, even though the fund lost 5.2% during the last quarter.
Electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive, which listed shares last year, was a big winner during the last quarter and Third Point expanded its holdings when the share price dipped below the $78 IPO price.

2022-02-16 00:00:00+00:00,"Stock Market News for Feb 16, 2022",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-news-for-feb-16-2022,,,"U.S. stocks markets closed sharply higher on Tuesday following de-escalation of geopolitical crisis between Russia and Ukraine. Wall Street has seen a broad-based rally after three consecutive days of losing sidelining investors’ concern of higher interest rate in March. All three major stock indexes ended in positive territory.
How Did The Benchmarks Perform?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) surged 1.2% or 422.67 points to close at 34,988.84. Notably, 26 components of the 30-stock index ended in green while 4 in red. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 14,139.76, climbing 2.5% or 348.84 points due to the strong performance of large-cap technology stocks.  
Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rallied 1.6% to end at 4,471.07. Nine out of eleven sectors of the benchmark index closed in positive territory while two in red. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) and the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) advanced 2.6%, 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively.
The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was down 9.3% to 25.70. A total of 10.63 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 12.60 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 3.03-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 3.87-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.
De-escalation of Geopolitical Tensions
The geopolitical conflicts between Russia and Ukraine have eased to some extent. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said troops that were deployed in the southern and western military districts neighboring to the Ukraine border had completed their military exercise and “have already begun loading onto rail and road transport and will begin moving to their military garrisons today.”

Stock markets across the world rallied following the news. In the U.S. reopening sectors like airlines and leisure-travel operators gained. However, the energy sector suffered as the crude oil price fell immediately.
Fed to Take Tough Monetary Stance
On Jan 26, after the conclusion of the first Fed FOMC meeting of this year, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear the first rate hike in three years as early as in March. The central bank’s quantitative easing program will also end in March. In a separate press statement, the FOMC has also indicated that the Fed is thinking of shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet later this year.
Meanwhile, the consumer price index for January surged 7.5% year over year, triggering a large section of economists and financial researchers to predict a 50 basis point hike in the benchmark lending rate in March instead of the market’s expectation of 25 basis point hike.
Some investment bankers have also said that the central bank may raise interest rate seven time this year with a magnitude of 25 basis point each time. Consequently, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note climbed more than 2%. The yield was 1.5% at the beginning of 2022.
M&A Deal
Intel Corp. INTC has entered into a $5.4 billion deal to acquire chipset manufacturer Tower Semiconductor Ltd. TSEM. Tower Semiconductor makes a wide variety of chips for mass consumer, industrial, automotive and mobile markets. The company has production facilities in the United States, Israel and Italy.
Consequently, shares of Tower Semiconductor soared 42.1% and Intel rose 1.8%. Intel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Economic Data
The Department of Labor reported that the producer price index (PPI) rose 1% in January compared with the consensus estimate of 0.5%. December’s data was revised upward from 0.2% to 0.4%. Year over year, PPI increased 9.7%.
The core producer price index (excluding volatile energy and food items) rose 0.8% in January compared with the consensus estimate of 0.4%. December’s data was revised downward from 0.5% to 0.4%. Year over year, core PPI increased 6.9%.

2022-02-16 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Goes After Gamers AMD Abandoned,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-goes-after-gamers-amd-abandoned,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has been losing market share to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) over the past few years. A combination of chronic manufacturing delays and other missteps at Intel, good products from AMD, and bleeding-edge technology at third-party foundries have enabled AMD to erase many of Intel's long-held advantages.
But Intel still has one thing that AMD can't match: its own manufacturing facilities. While AMD relies on third parties to make all its chips, Intel makes most of its chips in-house and outsources what makes sense. In a world where demand for chips is high and manufacturing capacity is tight, Intel has much more flexibility.

The king of low-end gaming
This is probably one reason AMD's latest batch of desktop PC processors ignored the lower end of the market. When you can only make so many chips, it makes sense to focus on high-priced, high-margin products. AMD's Ryzen 5000 series doesn't include any products priced below $200. Anyone looking to build a budget gaming PC using an AMD processor is stuck with older chips.
Intel reclaimed the overall gaming crown with its Alder Lake chips. For anyone willing to spend more than $200 on a CPU, Intel's latest chips provide the best performance for the price. AMD's chips are still very competitive and good options, and they retain the benefit of being less power hungry, but Intel is back on top.
Intel could have taken the same approach as AMD and focused on higher-priced products, but it seems dead-set on winning back market share everywhere it can. Intel's i3-12100 chip, a quad-core member of the Alder Lake family that's priced at $129, is Intel's ticket to winning back the low end of the gaming market.
Reviewers at Tom's Hardware didn't mince words: The i3-12100 provides ""an unprecedented amount of gaming and application performance"" for the price, and it's ""the hands-down winner"" in this price range. For heavily multithreaded workloads, any AMD chip with more cores is going to win. But PC gaming performance is highly dependent on single-threaded performance. On that front, Intel's new budget chip is spectacular.
Tom's Hardware found that on the AMD side, only the $800 Ryzen 8 5950X was able to provide the same level of single-threaded performance as Intel's little $129 chip. In gaming benchmarks, Intel's budget chip routinely beat out AMD chips that are twice as expensive.
AMD will strike back later this year
Supply constraints in the semiconductor industry may be a reality for a while, so it's hard to know whether AMD's upcoming Ryzen 7000 series will provide an answer in the budget category to Intel's i3-12100. AMD's new chips will use a more advanced manufacturing process than its current chips, which should provide significant performance and efficiency gains. But if manufacturing capacity remains tight, AMD may opt to focus on higher priced chips again.
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is optimistic that Intel won't relinquish its lead in the PC market. In a video posted earlier this year, Gelsinger said: ""AMD in the rearview mirror in clients [consumer market], and never again will they be in the windshield; we are just leading the market.""
AMD is not the same company it was even five years ago, so this victory celebration is probably premature. But Intel has certainly made up a lot of lost ground with Alder Lake, and it has the potential to win back quite a bit of market share by dominating the budget portion of the market.

2022-02-16 00:00:00+00:00,ETFs to Gain on Intel's Buyout of Tower Semiconductor,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/etfs-to-gain-on-intels-buyout-of-tower-semiconductor,,,"The world’s largest chipmaker — Intel INTC — has agreed to buy Israel-based chipmaker Tower Semiconductor TSEM for $5.4 billion to expand its manufacturing capacity and technology portfolio amid rising demand.

This put the spotlight on some ETFs, which could be the best way for investors to tap the opportunity arising from the proposed Intel-Tower deal. Investors should keep a close eye on the movement of these ETFs - First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF FTXL, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ, First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund TDIV and iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor ETF VLUE - having the highest allocation to the world’s biggest semiconductor maker.
Deal in Focus
Per the terms of the deal, Intel will pay $53 in cash for each share of Tower, well above a closing price of $33.13 on Feb 14 (see: all the Technology ETFs here).

The transaction will provide access to more specialized production and make Intel better positioned to take advantage of the soaring demand for semiconductors. This is because Intel is currently grappling with a chip shortage and continues to face challenges linked to persistent global supply chain problems in the upcoming quarters.

The deal will accelerate Intel’s path to become a major provider of foundry services and capacity globally. Additionally, it will create a globally diverse end-to-end foundry to help meet growing semiconductor demand and bring more value to customers across the nearly $100 billion addressable foundry market.

The acquisition, expected to close in about 12 months, will be immediately accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share after the deal closes. The transaction has been approved by Intel’s and Tower’s boards of directors but is subject to Towers’ shareholders’ approval and regulatory approvals.

""Ukraine headlines continue to drive the day-to-day volatility,"" says Michael Reinking, senior market strategist for the New York Stock Exchange. ""As there are reports of some Russian troop withdrawal, there is an unwind of much of the movement seen across financial markets over the last few days.""
This included a big drop in energy stocks, which fell 1.1% as U.S. crude futures retreated from seven-year highs (declining 3.6% to end at $92.07 per barrel).
On the other hand, technology was the biggest gainer today – jumping 2.6% – on news that Intel (INTC, +1.8%) is buying Israeli chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor (TSEM, +42.1%) for roughly $5.4 billion.
""While we have no incremental knowledge as to the validity of these reports, we would not be surprised to see INTC taking such a step to bolster its foundry aspirations,"" says Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore (Hold). ""We expect to learn more about the company's foundry strategy at its upcoming analyst meeting on Feb. 17, regardless of if Tower is part of those plans.""
Also in focus today was the latest inflation update, with the Labor Department reporting the producer price index – which measures how much suppliers are charging businesses for goods – rose a seasonally adjusted 1% month-over-month in January. On an annualized basis, producer prices surged 9.7%.

""The big picture is that inflation has gained momentum and broadened in the economy,"" says Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. ""The Russia-Ukraine conflict was a factor behind January's increase in prices; energy prices rose amid fears that the conflict would slow Russian deliveries of natural gas and oil to global markets. But prices of other goods also rose rapidly in January, as did prices of services."" 
Smith adds that omicron likely played a role too, with the variant causing many Americans to be out of work because they were either sick or quarantining.

Some major acquisition news is making headlines this morning. Indeed, Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) is up over 40% after Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) agreed to buy the company in a deal worth $5.4 billion. In addition, the acquisition will have Intel pay Tower $53 per share of TSEM stock, which represents a 60% premium to its closing price yesterday. Tower is an Israeli-based chipmaker that caters to several markets, such as the automotive, industrial and medical industries. However, shareholders and regulatory officials must approve the deal before it can be closed. So, what else should you know about the billion-dollar deal?

With the acquisition of Tower, Intel seeks to boost its foundry production capabilities. After the transaction closes, Tower will be integrated into Intel Foundry Services (IFS). Furthermore, Tower makes highly specialized chips that Intel currently does not produce. As a result of the buyout, Intel will receive ownership of eight foundry facilities that Tower uses. What’s more, Intel was a customer of Tower before talks leading to the acquisition.
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger praised the acquisition, commenting, “This deal will enable Intel to offer a compelling breadth of leading-edge nodes and differentiated specialty technologies on mature nodes — unlocking new opportunities for existing and future customers in an era of unprecedented demand for semiconductors.”
TSEM Stock: Intel Buys the Chipmaker for $5.4 Billion
The acquisition has already been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies.
Intel has a large presence in Israel. In 2017, the company acquired autonomous vehicle firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion.
Tower produces “most of the exotic chip types that logic-focused Intel does not.” These include silicon-germanium transistors, CMOS image sensors and power management chips.
The addition of Tower will help Intel increase its chip-making capacity. Last month, Intel reported that it would invest $20 billion to build a fab complex in Ohio.
Intel will use cash from its balance sheet to fund the acquisition. The company expects the transaction to close within 12 months.
In addition, the acquisition is expected to be “immediately accretive to Intel’s non-GAAP earnings per share.”
During Q3, Tower reported revenue of $387 million, representing an increase of 25% year-over-year (YOY). The company is profitable and reported a net profit of $39 million, up from $15 million YOY.
Tower will release its Q4 and fiscal year 2021 results this Thursday. The company will not release Q1 guidance in light of the acquisition.

2022-02-15 00:00:00+00:00,Why Tower Semiconductor Stock Exploded Higher Tuesday,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-tower-semiconductor-stock-exploded-higher-tuesday,,,"What happened
Shares of Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ: TSEM) charged sharply higher on Tuesday, surging as much as 43.3%. As of 10:39 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 41.9%.
The catalyst that sent the semiconductor foundry surging was an announcement that the company will be acquired by a tech titan.
So what
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) announced on Tuesday that it had reached a definitive agreement to acquire Tower Semiconductor in an all-cash deal valued at $5.4 billion. The combination will create ""a globally diverse end-to-end foundry to help meet growing semiconductor demand.""
Image source: Getty Images.
Tower Semiconductor manufactures a variety of specialized chips that are used in automotive and consumer products, as well as industrial and medical equipment. This includes power management chips and image sensors, among others. The deal will not only increase Intel's customer base, but also provide additional chip-making expertise.
Intel said the deal will increase its manufacturing capability, expand its global footprint, and upgrade its portfolio in a time of ""unprecedented industry demand.""
Tower Semiconductor shareholders will receive $53 in cash per share of stock they hold, which represents a 60% premium to the stock's closing price on Monday of $33.13. The boards of directors of both companies have already approved the transaction, which is expected to close within approximately 12 months.
Now what
The transaction may not be a slam dunk, as it will still have to secure regulatory approval. That could be a high bar, which was painfully evident as Nvidia was recently forced to abandon its bid to acquire SoftBank's Arm Holdings.
Intel has been working to regain lost ground in the semiconductor industry. The acquisition will position the company to better compete against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world's largest semiconductor foundry. This is also no doubt a part of CEO Pat Gelsinger's plans to modernize Intel's chip manufacturing capabilities.
When Intel released its fourth-quarter and full-year financial report, the company announced plans to spend more than $20 billion to build two new ""leading-edge chip factories"" in Ohio. This came on the heels of plans to increase capacity at its manufacturing facilities in Arizona and New Mexico.
