2022-01-31 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-Vodafone teams up with Intel on OpenRAN in challenge to network suppliers,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-vodafone-teams-up-with-intel-on-openran-in-challenge-to-network-suppliers,,,"By Paul Sandle
MALAGA, Spain, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Vodafone VOD.L has teamed up with Intel Corp INTC.O and other silicon vendors to design its own chip architecture for nascent OpenRAN network technology, aiming to weaken the grip of traditional telecoms equipment suppliers.
OpenRAN allows operators to mix and match suppliers in their radio networks, posing a challenge to the likes of Ericsson ERICb.ST, Huawei and Nokia NOKIA.HE that dominate the global telecoms equipment market with their proprietary technologies.
Development of OpenRAN has taken on greater prominence since some governments either banned or discouraged the use of China's Huawei in national networks.
Vodafone's initiative, based at its digital innovation and R&D centre in Malaga, will also contribute to the European Union's efforts to bolster its chip industry and double its share of global production to 20% after it lost ground to Asian and U.S. suppliers.
Vodafone's director of network architecture Santiago Tenorio told Reuters that OpenRAN would enable the mobile operator to quickly add new digital services and to optimise networks using artificial intelligence (AI).
""It will bring disruptive innovation back to the network,"" he said.
OpenRAN creates interoperability between the software and hardware components of the radio access network, widening the pool of suppliers and lowering the barrier of entry.
Vodafone switched on Britain's first 5G OpenRAN site carrying live customer traffic in Bath, western England, earlier this month, kicking off a deployment that will number 2,500 sites by 2027.
The R&D centre - the first dedicated to advancing OpenRAN chip architecture - will bring 50 people dedicated to OpenRAN together with 650 software engineers, architects and technicians in the Spanish city, where the British company is investing 225 million euros ($251 million) over five years. It opens on Monday.
Tenorio said Vodafone would design silicon for ARM and RISC-V instruction sets as well as Intel x86, although he added that Intel was up to three years ahead of rivals and had already played a key role in OpenRAN's development.
About 20 other vendors have joined the project, including Qualcomm QCOM.O, Broadcom AVGO.O, ARM and Lime Microsystems, with half of the total coming from Europe, the company said.

2022-01-29 00:00:00+00:00,Why Taiwan Semiconductor Is Stepping Up Its Investments,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-taiwan-semiconductor-is-stepping-up-its-investments,,,"Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) is the world's biggest semiconductor manufacturer, which puts it in a unique position during the global chip shortage. That's why it's spending more than $40 billion in capital expenditures this year.
In this episode of ""Beat and Raise,"" recorded on Jan. 20, Fool contributors Will Healy and Brian Withers discuss Taiwan Semi's prospects and why it has such a strong competitive position.
10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*
They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of January 10, 2022
Brian Withers: Looking for Will to come on and talk semiconductors, one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, Taiwan Semi.
Will Healy: Well, I'm going to just dive right in. Fourth-quarter revenue came in at $15.7 billion. That was up 21%, that beat expectations, and also know that the $15.7 billion is their figure. I mean, Taiwan uses new Taiwan dollars, but they translate their figures into dollars, so I'm using their information here.
Earnings per share came in at $1.15, that was up 16%. That was also a beat. However, notice that revenue grew faster than earnings. I think this is because they're just investing so much in the business and they're having to expand capacity due to the chip shortage and they're also doing research to get to advance the technology further, so there's some pressure there.
However, the outlook for Q1 is at $16.9 billion, up 26% year-over-year and that is also a raise from where analysts were placing it. I mean, overall, this was a good quarter, except for earnings not keeping up with revenue.
Some things of note for TSMC, in Q3, they were 53% of the foundry market. That's interesting because companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), like AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), they're fabless, so they depend on TSMC to actually build their chips. If something happened to TSMC, the industry would almost be in the dark ages. So this is probably the most important company in the industry, if not in any industry arguably.
I mentioned the spending earlier. They plan to spend $40-44 billion on capital expenditures this year, and that's a huge amount of money and that may contribute to the shortage that has raised earnings ultimately ending. However, I think they have to do this because all of their competitors are increasing capacity. Again, they have to keep advancing the technology to hold onto their technical lead. That makes a lot of sense they are spending so heavily to maintain their market position.
As for the stock, it trades at about 34 times earnings. I would call that a mid-level valuation. You have stocks, clients like Nvidia and AMD trading at substantially higher multiples while Qualcomm and Intel are much lower. It's really in the middle. Unfortunately, this did not translate to gains over the last year as it's trading relatively flat to where it was.
Withers: It's flat for the year, but if you go back for the five-year chart, it's up 333%, and that's not even including dividends, so, it's had a tremendous run. It feels like maybe it's just pulling back. A lot of my tech stocks over the past year are either flat or in some cases down. So not surprised that this bedrock of the tech community, especially during the silicon shortage, is taking a little bit of a pause on the stock price.
Healy: It is interesting timing though because we've been hearing of the shortage all year and like I said, their clients Nvidia and AMD, those stocks are performing so much better. I don't think people fully appreciate TSMC's role in the industry, and they may be a little hesitant because it's based in Taiwan and China has talked about invading Taiwan, although I don't think it's actually going to happen, but you always have to look over your shoulder. I think the stock trades at somewhat of a discount due to that factor.
Withers: We're running short on time here. I'm going to ask you the same question I did Toby. A-F, how would you grade Taiwan's semiconductors quarter?
Healy: I would say it was A-minus. The only really negative thing I can say is the earnings didn't quite keep up, but I think like I said, they have to spend that money. They have the technical lead right now, but these technical leads are really tenuous even though a lot of people think that nobody can catch up. People left AMD for dead a few years ago and for decades, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) had the technical lead and everyone thought that was insurmountable. In this industry, you always have to look over your shoulder.
Withers: Yeah. Only the paranoid survive, the former Intel CEO would say.

2022-01-29 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Nvidia vs. AMD,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-nvidia-vs.-amd,,,"Computers in many forms are becoming increasingly vital for both business and personal use. Two leading computer component suppliers are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (NASDAQ: AMD).
These competitors have both been successful investments over the last three years, with Nvidia and AMD returning 624% and 594% respectively, handily beating the NASDAQ-100's 140% return. Unfortunately, investors can't go back in time and purchase these two winners -- so which is the better stock going forward?

Company overviews
While Nvidia started off creating graphics processing units (GPUs), it has expanded to include much more. At first, its GPUs rendered 3D graphics and accelerated video. Now they power engineering simulations and data centers along with their continual use in the video game sector. Additionally, Nvidia has crossed over into the software market and has augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) solutions.Nvidia's products are widespread across many industries, such as self-driving cars and medical research, insulating its business from a potential industry-specific downturn.
AMD competes with Nvidia in the GPU segment but also has a wider hardware product range. Its Epyc processor powers data servers and is utilized by practically every cloud provider. As a holder of more than 250 world records, it's not hard to understand why it is considered the most powerful data center processor available. Consumer computers also utilize AMD's processors, making AMD less diversified across business segments than Nvidia.
Winner: Nvidia
New products
During the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) held earlier this month, each company announced a new lineup of products. Nvidia announced several new graphics cards and an autonomous driving solution that utilizes an Nvidia computer and sensors. Not to be outdone, AMD also announced new graphics cards as well as new CPUs.
I don't pretend to be an expert in how important these new products will be. However, each stock and a competitor, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), reacted differently the day after each company made its announcements at CES. Examining what the market thinks is an easy way to understand the potential monetary impact new products will have on the companies.
STOCK PRICE RETURN JAN. 5
NVIDIA AMD INTEL NASDAQ-100
(5.76%) (5.73%) 1.37% (3.12%)
With similar, worse-than-market days, neither Nvidia nor AMD made a big enough splash to trigger a positive response like Intel did.
Winner: Tie
Leadership
Both companies' CEOs are legendary. AMD's CEO Dr. Lisa Su is responsible for resurrecting a struggling company. Prior to her taking the role on Oct. 8, 2014, the stock still remained well below its highs set before the financial crisis and dot-com bubble and had done nothing for five years. It was often said Intel allowed AMD to exist so it wouldn't be accused of monopolistic behavior. Due to Su's leadership, AMD has flipped the script and has Intel on the ropes.
Jensen Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 and has led it over nearly 30 years. With his leadership, the GPU use case expanded and he steered his company to include more than just hardware. Huang is a true visionary and his company is still developing innovative concepts like the omniverse -- a platform for metaverse creators.
Both are great leaders, but Huang has the edge for me because of his proven innovation. He also ranked No. 31 on Glassdoor's top CEO list for 2021, a list where Su did not break into the top 100.
Winner: Nvidia
Valuation
The market enthusiasm for Nvidia is reflected in its high valuation.
AMD PE Ratio data by YCharts
As both Nvidia and AMD are fully optimized for profits, these price-to-earnings (PE) ratios can be taken at face value. With a more than 80 PE ratio, Nvidia is an expensive stock, and investors must pay up for it. AMD is more reasonably valued and defeats Nvidia from this standpoint.
Winner: AMD
Financials
While each operates a similar business, one company has noticeably better financials. During the third quarter, each reported similar revenue growth, with Nvidia and AMD growing 50% and 54% respectively.
When comparing margins, Nvidia's position is enviable next to AMD's.
METRIC NVIDIA AMD
Gross margin 65% 48%
Operating margin 38% 22%
Profit margin 35% 21%
Data source: Nvidia and AMD
Nvidia's cost of revenue is less than AMD's, allowing it to be more profitable. This advantage lets Nvidia invest more in new technologies and other endeavors and still maintain a healthy margin.
Winner: Nvidia
The verdict
At a final tally of three wins, one loss, and a tie, Nvidia takes the cake for the better buy. The biggest takeaway for me is that Nvidia has moved into other industries, where AMD has stayed relatively in the same field. This trickles down to Nvidia's superior financials and affects how the market values each stock.

2022-01-28 00:00:00+00:00,INTC Dividend Yield Pushes Past 3%,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intc-dividend-yield-pushes-past-3,,,"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, in trading on Friday, shares of Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.39), with the stock changing hands as low as $46.30 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) back on 12/31/1999 — you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.
In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Intel Corp, looking at the history chart for INTC below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.

2022-01-28 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Becomes Oversold,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-becomes-oversold,,,"The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) presently has a stellar rank, in the top 10% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.
But making Intel Corp an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Friday, shares of INTC entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $46.30 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Intel Corp, the RSI reading has hit 28.9 — by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel currently has an average RSI of 40.7. A falling stock price — all else being equal — creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, INTC's recent annualized dividend of 1.39/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.89% based upon the recent $48.05 share price.
A bullish investor could look at INTC's 28.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on INTC is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

Here are some highlights from the video.
Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter was $19.5 billion, up low single digits YOY. Regardless, this beat Intel's prior guidance by over $1.2 billion, driven by a solid recovery of its data center market. For the quarter, the data center segment grew over 20% YOY.

*Stock Advisor returns as of January 10, 2022
Asit Sharma: What I am going to do is just take two minutes and return to ASML Holdings. This is the company I talked about two episodes ago which is a specialist in the chip manufacturing field. They use extreme ultraviolet lithography to make chips ever more powerful. That is they compress more and more circuitry on a chip and enable the more well-known chip manufacturers, whoever, Samsung, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), etc, to move from one standard to another.
Without them, this process, I think, would take a lot longer. They occupy a very rarefied niche in this space, and they have almost a monopoly position. I'm going to keep talking about ASML a little bit. It's a hard company to wrap one's head around. Here's just a quick view of the financial statements.
I wanted to point out some really quick things here. Let's take a look at this first observation in euros. This is a pretty big company. I think I mentioned this before, Demitri, revenue has gone from €4 billion euros in the three months ended Sept. 27, 2020, to €5.2 billion in the next year. I usually go from right to left, €5.2 billion growth over 4 billion. You see for the nine-month trend, this is also a nice jump.
Here's the quandary for anyone investing in this industry. How long is this type of sustained demand just going to exist? When will be the point that it tapers down and we see a resumption of normal cycles in this industry? I can't help but think that it's going to be stretched out this time. Some of the reason is what we talk about on this show every time we meet, which is the prevalence of virtual opportunities in almost every sphere. I almost think that it's helpful to think of these as maybe super-cycles in the chip industry. I feel like we're within a super-cycle just now. I could be proven very wrong.
Just a few other things here that are of interest to me is its nice tripling of R&D cost. I'd love to see a company which is growing its R&D in excess of its sales, and ASML which produces some pretty specialized equipment in order to conduct this incredibly complex chip lithography has to invest in it. It does quite a bit. I want to just hit two more points here. If we can move down here. I like this increase in gross profit the company is seeing.
It's got some pricing power as chips are more in demand. It's also crossing a threshold that I give as a rule of thumb from my days in auditing and consulting; if you give me an industry blind that's involved in manufacturing, I want that gross margin to be a 50-60% window. Because lower than that, it can be really hard to turn an inventory effectively, it can be hard to generate really good bottom line profits. You hit that 50%, you show me almost any kind of industry and I can prove that out. I like to see that it's really in that sweet spot. I'll be taking a look at that more deeply as I study this company.
I also love that they give the number of payroll employees, employees on their payroll, and full-time equivalents. They've got a bit of a temporary workforce, but you can round these numbers up. That lets those who are interested in dividing market capitalization by the number of employees make that calculation very quickly and compare it to some other companies in the industry, which is something else I'm working on throwing on a spreadsheet, I'll bring it to the show and show you some interesting comparisons with other chip companies. I did want to just breeze through their balance sheet, pretty healthy here. Let's just stick on this right column, this is the most recent balance sheet date.
Quite a bit of inventory you will see, and a lot of receivables. The hallmarks of a big manufacturer, nice cash position, so between that current assets, about $15.71 billion versus $11.6 billion, sorry, non-current assets. Then I always compare this to current liabilities, and current liabilities are here. Let's do rough math. This is about $6.5 billion in working capital against $4.1 billion in debt. Really, really healthy balance sheet and that leaves plenty of money for further reinvestment. I like the financial profiles, just some big picture things that I think about that are unique to an industry.
Not a huge goodwill balance too for a company that's done some acquisitions, $4 billion dollars out of total tangible and intangible assets of that $11.7 billion. Net equipment after depreciation of only $2.7 billion, so there's that capital efficiency that we always talk about. This is a company that invests in amazing machines to build chip writing machines and yet the net assets on its books, net fixed assets are only $2.7 billion bucks. There's a lot that you can see at a glance in this company, which is extremely interesting and intriguing if you're into working backwards from financial statements

2022-01-28 00:00:00+00:00,Better Chip Stock: ASML vs. Nvidia,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-chip-stock%3A-asml-vs.-nvidia,,,"ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are two very different kinds of companies, but the latter likely wouldn't exist without the former.
ASML, which is based in the Netherlands, is the world's top manufacturer of lithography systems -- which are used to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. The world's top chip foundries -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Samsung, and Intel -- all use its top-tier extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems to manufacture the world's smallest and densest chips.
Nvidia, the American chipmaker that dominates the gaming and data center GPU markets, outsources its chip production to TSMC and Samsung's foundries. In other words, Nvidia can't produce its newest GPUs without ASML's EUV systems.
Image source: Getty Images.
ASML and Nvidia both profited from the surging demand for new chips across multiple industries over the past few years. But both stocks also stumbled this year as rising inflation and higher interest rates sparked a retreat from pricier tech stocks.
ASML's stock has declined 19% year-to-date, while Nvidia's stock has slumped 24%. Should investors consider accumulating shares of either beaten-down semiconductor stock before the macroeconomic headwinds wane?
Different businesses, similar tailwinds
ASML leads the lithography market and is the world's only manufacturer of EUV systems. These systems, which cost $150 million each and require multiple plans to ship, are required to produce the world's smallest 7nm and 5nm chips. ASML spent the past three decades developing this technology, so it doesn't face any meaningful challengers.
In 2023, ASML will start shipping its first ""high-NA"" EUV systems, which will enable chipmakers to manufacture even smaller 3nm and 2nm chips. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel are all racing to install more EUV systems and secure orders for high-NA systems, which will enable them to keep pace with each other in the ""process race"" to create more advanced chips.
ASML shipped 309 lithography systems in 2021, including 42 top-tier EUV systems. But if the secular expansion of the 5G, cloud, data center, artificial intelligence, automotive, gaming, and Internet of Things (IoT) markets sparks a prolonged ""super cycle"" of chip upgrades over the next four years, ASML believes it could ship a maximum of 452 systems in 2025, including 70 EUV systems and five high-NA systems.
Nvidia will profit from many of the same secular tailwinds. It already controlled 83% of the discrete GPU market in the third quarter of 2021, according to JPR, while AMD held the remaining 17% share.
Nvidia's GPUs are generally more expensive than AMD's, but they consistently deliver more processing power. As a result, Nvidia remains the preferred GPU brand for high-end PC gaming, as well as the calculation of complex machine learning and AI tasks in data centers. Those two markets have accounted for most of Nvidia's growth in recent years.
Nvidia also develops Arm-based CPUs for set-top boxes, gaming consoles, data centers, and other markets. It attempted to expand this smaller business by buying the chip designer Arm from SoftBank for $40 billion, but it will reportedly need to abandon that deal -- which faced heavy opposition from antitrust regulators and other chipmakers -- in the near future.
Which company has a clearer future?
ASML's revenue and earnings jumped 33% and 69%, respectively, in 2021 as the global chip shortage drove a 20% increase in its annual system shipments. ASML's gross margin also expanded from 48.6% to 52.7% as it flexed its pricing power and sold more higher-margin EUV systems.
Analysts expect ASML's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow 19% and 22%, respectively, in 2022 as the global chip shortage drags on. A significant portion of the soaring capex at TSMC, Intel, and Samsung to resolve that shortage will likely flow directly to ASML.
Nvidia's revenue and EPS rose 65% and 132% year-over-year, respectively, in the first nine months of fiscal 2022, which ends on Jan. 30. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 60% and 74%, respectively, for the full year.
But in fiscal 2023, a few unpredictable headwinds could throttle Nvidia's growth. Its sales of high-end gaming GPUs could decelerate as the stay-at-home tailwinds for the PC market fade. The cryptocurrency market's recent crash could also impact its sales of high-end gaming GPUs and dedicated mining cards, while macro challenges could cause companies to postpone their data center upgrades. Lastly, Nvidia still remains heavily dependent on TSMC and Samsung to successfully navigate the ongoing chip shortage.
Nonetheless, analysts still expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings to grow 19% and 20%, respectively, in fiscal 2023.
Which stock is a better value?
ASML and Nvidia both got a bit overheated during the tech sector's broader rally last year. But both stocks look more reasonably valued today.
ASML trades at 35 times forward earnings, and Nvidia trades at 47 times forward earnings. Both companies pay dividends, but their forward yields are well below 1% and won't attract any serious income investors.
ASML and Nvidia are both still solid long-term investments. But if I had to choose one over the other, I'd stick with ASML for four simple reasons: It's a linchpin of the semiconductor market, its has an impenetrable moat, its long-term growth is more predictable, and its stock is significantly cheaper.

2022-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,New 52-Week Low Could Prompt More Insider Buying At INTC,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/new-52-week-low-could-prompt-more-insider-buying-at-intc,,,"In trading on Thursday, shares of Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) touched a new 52-week low of $47.84/share. That's a $20.65 share price drop, or -30.15% decline from the 52-week high of $68.49 set back on 04/12/2021. Large percentage drops always require that the stock post even larger percentage gains from the low in order to recover the old price point, and for INTC that means the stock would have to gain 43.16% to get back to the 52-week high. For a move like that, Intel Corp would need fundamental strength at the business level.
Here's a rhetorical question: Who knows more about fundamentals at the business level than the company's own insiders? So let's take a look to see whether any company insiders were taking the other side of the trade as INTC shares were being sold down to this new 52-week low, focusing on the most recent trailing six month period. As summarized by the table below, INTC has seen 8 different instances of insiders buying over the past six months.

In the short run, while the new 52-week low suggests the stock is at the cheapest price and perhaps therefore the best bargain it has been over the last 52 weeks, the low print also means anyone who has purchased the stock over that timeframe is staring at an unrealized loss. Oftentimes, that factor drives a stock's technical analysis metrics by creating overhead resistance, with investors who bought higher now anxious to reverse their trade once they are back to breakeven. The chart below shows where INTC has traded over the past year, with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages included.
Time will tell whether the insider purchases foretell a future rebound for INTC shares, which are presently showing a last trade of $48.15/share, slightly above the new 52-week low.

2022-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Dropped Again Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-dropped-again-today-2,,,"What happened
On a day chock-full of semiconductor news, shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) took another turn for the worse. As fellow chip giants Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Seagate (NASDAQ: STX) reported earnings numbers that sent their stocks rushing off in opposite directions, Nvidia stayed more or less mum.
Result: As of 12:30 p.m. ET, Nvidia stock is down 2.9%.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
What did Intel and Seagate say that might have produced such pessimism in Nvidia investors today?
Well, after surveying analysts' reactions to the other chip companies' reports (as reported by TheFly.com), the primary concern seems to be this:
In Intel's report, CEO Pat Gelsinger opined that he's seeing ""incremental improvements"" in semiconductor supply globally, and that this has the potential to start reducing the critical deficit in chip supplies sooner than expected. Gelsinger still thinks the shortage could linger on into 2024, but ""quarter by quarter,"" supplies should be improving.
This is, of course, good news for chip customers and for the global economy in general, but it still has the potential to ""chip"" away (sorry, I couldn't resist) at semiconductor companies' pricing power over time. What's more, as analysts at Northland commented in a note this morning, Intel itself may be ""under-promising"" on its own ability to increase chip production in 2022, and thus accelerating the erosion in chipmakers' profits.
Now what
A second concern could be Intel's guidance on gross profit margins in the coming first quarter of 2022, which calls for a steep erosion in margin -- down nearly 5 full percentage points to 49%.
Granted, such a decline could be no more than a consequence of all the costs Intel is incurring in building out production capacity to meet demand. But lower gross margins might also imply that Intel is cutting prices in a way that could force Nvidia to cut prices to match, lest it lose market share to Intel. Given that Intel has made regaining market share a priority in its turnaround, it's not unthinkable that cutting prices in order to grab back share might be part of the company's strategy.
If forced to guess what precisely has Nvidia investors feeling nervous today, the prospects of a price war breaking out at the same time as semiconductor supplies start expanding would have to be high on my list.

2022-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Tesla and Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-zacks-analyst-blog-highlights%3A-tesla-and-intel,,,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – January 27, 2022 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Tesla TSLA and Intel INTC.
Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:
Bear Country: Tesla, Intel Beat on Q4 Earnings but Sell Off
Wednesday afternoon, in its statement following the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Fed kept interest rates unchanged at 0.00-0.25%. This comes as no surprise, as the final installments of the taper program, buying fewer and fewer Treasury bonds and mortgage securities, is scheduled to end in March. In a separate note, the Fed also plans to reduce its $9 trillion balance sheet, but not until after interest rate moves have begun.
This is all as expected on Wall Street: markets have been busy over the past few weeks pricing in no fewer than four interest rate hikes in 2022, roughly one every other FOMC meeting this year. Even still, stocks rolled off session highs not 20 minutes past the Fed statement release. And markets continued to creep lower during Fed Chair Jay Powell’s press conference which followed the FOMC statements, as the 10-year Treasury yield nudged first over 1.8%, pushing toward 1.86% by the time Powell was finished taking questions.
Substantively, there wasn’t anything different emphasized this time around: inflation continues “well above 2%,” with residual supply/demand imbalances from the ongoing pandemic largely responsible; the Unemployment Rate has fallen sharply, with labor demand historically strong, and participation “subdued” by an aging population. Powell said interest rate policy will require “humility” and being “nimble.”
Powell also did not add any reassurances regarding whether this now-near-certain March rate hike will constitute a quarter-point or half-point rise, citing the FOMC will make that decision during its March meeting. In short, he left the door open for increased hawkishness, and this would no doubt be contingent on inflation reads from economic prints over the next six weeks until the next meeting. There is also no suggestion from the Fed Chair that “only” four rate hikes may be in the works for 2022.
Regardless of whether the Fed should or should not be more hawkish in its monetary policy going forward, it might be said Powell let slip through his fingers a chance to assure market participants that there will be no reckless advancement of leaping rate hikes and balance-sheet draining. Powell has proven over time to be attuned to economic concerns but perhaps slow to react; in the interest of quashing this narrative about his Fed leadership, it appears he is fine with investors believing he will move higher and faster than earlier anticipated. Markets went from the green to the red by the time of the closing bell.
Tesla shares fell -5% immediately after its Q4 earnings report hit the tape after the closing bell Wednesday, even as the EV leader outpaced expectations on both top and bottom lines: earnings of $2.54 per share easily beat the $2.11 Zacks consensus, while $17.72 billion in quarterly sales swept past the $16.07 billion analysts were looking for. Shares buoyed up a tad ahead of the company's conference call. After a rough patch in its earnings history a couple years ago, Tesla has beaten expectations in nine of the last 10 quarters.
Intel also dropped on its easy Q4 beats yesterday afternoon, with earnings of $1.09 per share on $19.5 billion in revenues well ahead of the 90 cents per share and $18.3 billion analysts were expecting. Guidance for next-quarter earnings was 80 cents per share, which is below the 84 cents in the Zacks consensus. This may go some ways to explain how Intel hasn’t posted an earnings miss since Q3 2013.
Markets were down across the board, save the Nasdaq, which was basically flat. It’s bear territory this winter, and even Fed policy projections aren’t able to put them back into hibernation at this stage. The Nasdaq is -17% from its all-time highs set in November of last year. The S&P 500 is -10% off its most recent highs. The small-cap Russell 2000 has given away all its 2021 gains, and then some.

2022-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,SK Hynix Q4 profit grows four-fold on brisk memory chip shipments,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sk-hynix-q4-profit-grows-four-fold-on-brisk-memory-chip-shipments,,,"By Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL, Jan 28 (Reuters) - South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc 000660.KS said it expects supply chain issues to gradually improve from the second half of the year and demand for memory chips to grow, after booking a four-fold on-year increase in fourth-quarter operating profit.
The world's second-biggest memory chipmaker, whose clients include Apple Inc AAPL.O, on Friday reported 4.2 trillion won ($3.49 billion) in October-December profit, from 959 billion won a year earlier, helped by demand from server clients expanding data storage capacity.
The figure represented SK Hynix's highest quarterly profit since 2018, and exceeded the 4 trillion won average of analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv SmartEstimate.
Revenue climbed 55% to a record 12.4 trillion won.
The fourth quarter saw SK Hynix complete the first phase of its acquisition of Intel's Corp INTC.O NAND flash memory chip business. With that acquisition, SK Hynix expects NAND flash sales to double this year from last, it said on Friday.
Prices of NAND chips that serve the data storage market are likely to fall by 8-13% in January-March from October-December, less than an earlier forecast of 10-15% drop, showed data from TrendForce.
The improved forecast reflects an order increase from PC makers as a COVID-19 lockdown in Xian, China, last month renewed concern about global chip supply, and as manufacturers restock chips amid easing of other component shortages, TrendForce said.
For DRAM chips that are widely used in data centres and tech devices, SK Hynix on Friday said it plans to manage inventory flexibly while focusing on profitability in 2022.
DRAM prices are also likely to fall less than previously expected, or about 5% this quarter, Seoul-based analysts said.

NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street gyrated wildly on Thursday, the S&P 500 once again narrowly avoiding correction confirmation at the end of a session marked by a rally, selloff and recovery as investors juggled positive economic news with mixed corporate earnings, geopolitical unrest and the prospect of a more hawkish Federal Reserve.
All three major U.S. stock indexes have been whipsawed by uncertainty in recent days, marked by wide fluctuations and heightened volatility.
Smallcaps have had a rougher go of it, with the Russell 2000 now more than 20% below its Nov. 8 record high, officially confirming the index has been in a bear market since then.
""This is a market that is schizophrenic,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. ""There are those who believe everything negative has been discounted and there are others who believe that the worst is yet to come.""

For the fourth consecutive day, what markets did in the morning looked nothing like how they finished.
Today's session started off cheerily enough on the back of a pair of positive economic releases. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said U.S. fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) swelled by an annualized 6.9% quarter-over-quarter, smashing expectations for 5.5% expansion.

Contributing most to Q4's growth was a sharp rise in business inventories and consumer spending, especially in services.
""Helped by inventory rebuilding, the economy remained strong in the final quarter of last year,"" says Sal Guatieri, senior economist for BMO Capital Markets. ""While omicron will lead to weaker growth in the first quarter, activity is expected to rebound nicely once the latest pandemic wave abates and supply-chain glitches ease. 
""The Fed will need to be 'humble and nimble' as it navigates underlying economic strength, worsening labour shortages, and stubbornly high inflation.""
Also encouraging were initial jobless claims for the week ended Jan. 22, which declined to 260,000 from an upwardly revised 290,000 the week prior, coming in under estimates for 265,000.
""The first decline so far this year in seasonally adjusted new jobless claims is a welcome sign after three consecutive gains,"" says Bankrate.com Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick. ""Job security has been bolstered by significant improvement in the unemployment rate and solid rise in payrolls over the past year. Remarkably, worker pay has been losing ground against the steepest inflation in decades.""

Investors clearly glommed onto these results in the morning, when they drove all of the major indexes higher … but like yesterday, the momentum faded.
The S&P 500 gained as much as 1.8% before closing down 0.5% to 4,326, putting it 10 points, or a mere 0.2% decline, away from officially falling into a correction. The Dow Jones Industrial Average similarly let a big lead slip away but closed with a marginal loss to 34,160. The Nasdaq Composite (-1.4% to 13,352) slipped further into correction territory.

In far more dire straits was the Russell 2000, which plunged 2.3% to 1,931 – officially in a bear market, having dropped more than 20% from its Nov. 8 closing high. It’s the fifth bear market for the Russell 2000 since 2009, with the others coming in 2011, 2016, 2018 and 2020 (its worst, at a nearly 42% decline).

Netflix (NFLX) jumped 7.5% after Bill Ackman said Wednesday his hedge fund, Pershing Square, acquired a stake in the streaming giant. The announcement follows the stock's rough start to 2022, with NFLX shedding 40% from its Dec. 31 close through its Jan. 26 close. ""Beginning on Friday and over the last several days, we acquired more than 3.1 million shares of Netflix, making us a top-20 shareholder in the company,"" Ackman wrote in a Jan. 26 letter to Pershing Square shareholders.
Tesla (TSLA) took an 11.6% spill after earnings, with investors most concerned over the electric carmaker's warning that global supply-chain issues could negatively impact production levels in 2022. This overshadowed the company's higher-than-expected adjusted earnings of $2.52 per share and $17.7 billion in revenues. Still, Argus Research analyst Bill Selesky reaffirmed a Buy rating on TSLA in the wake of earnings, saying ""the growth story is very much on target."" Despite the supply-chain warning, Selesky expects ""Tesla to continue to post strong revenue growth, to report lower operating expenses, and to improve automotive gross margins, setting the stage for significant profit acceleration"" in 2022.
Intel (INTC, -7.0%) also plunged after its quarterly earnings report.

The Way to Buy Bonds Right Now
Typically in times of broader stock-market tumult, investors can rely on tried-and-true defensive plays. For those who want to stay in equities, that often means utility and consumer staples, but many try to fight off stock volatility by pouring into bonds – which have had their own difficulties in 2022.

We're in a ""stubbornly substandard income environment, says State Street Global Advisors, thanks to the Fed tightening its monetary policy while many international central banks are sticking with loose, crisis-related approaches.
But, SSGA says, some areas of fixed income can still do the trick.
""With rate risk elevated, focusing on mitigating the impacts of rising rates may serve investors well from a total return perspective,"" the fund provider says, noting that ultra-short duration bonds with variable and floating yields could blunt this risk.
SSGA adds that while inflation still is a concern, it can be offset with junk debt and other high-yield fixed income, as well as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS).
You can easily access these strategies and others that are better-positioned for an aggressive Fed via these seven top bond funds for 2022. These funds provide diversified (and typically affordable) access to dozens, hundreds or even thousands of bonds in a range of flavors meant to minimize the impact of rising rates and inflation.

2022-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,Apple (AAPL) to Enable NFC Payments With New iOS Feature,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-aapl-to-enable-nfc-payments-with-new-ios-feature,,,"Apple AAPL is developing a new feature that would enable small businesses to accept payments via credit cards directly on their iPhones without utilizing any extra hardware.

Per a Bloomberg report, Apple intends to turn iPhones into payment terminals using the NFC technology similar to Apple Pay. So far, Apple users had to use external third-party hardware like those of financial services company Block SQ to accept payments using an iPhone.

Apple’s new endeavor will allow the company to bypass Block’s hardware by integrating tap-to-pay terminal technology directly into the iPhone using its built-in NFC chip. This new upgrade will work seamlessly with Apple Pay, allowing users to make a payment by simply tapping one iPhone on the back of another.

The NFC payments feature has been designed primarily keeping small business owners in mind who were compelled to use other hardware to accept payments using the iPhone. Apple has recently released iOS 15.3 to the general public, and the new feature can be rolled out as an update in the coming months with iOS 15.4.

Services to Drive Top Line
Apple’s latest effort to develop iPhone as a payment gateway follows the acquisition of Mobeewave in 2020 for around $100 million, per 9TO5Mac. The iPhone maker has been facing stiff competition across various different segments, thus the new endeavor might be a strategic decision to reduce dependency on third-party sources and reduce competition.

Apple is already under the process of reducing dependency on third-party chip providers including Intel INTC and Advanced Micro Devices AMD and designing home-grown chips.

It has been gaining from continued momentum in the Services business segment that has turned out as the new cash cow for the company and helps in reducing dependency on its one primary source of revenues — the iPhone.

Apple is strengthening its Services and Wearables businesses, which is anticipated to drive top-line growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond.

The company currently has more than 745 million paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The App Store continues to draw the attention of prominent developers worldwide, helping the company offer appealing new apps that drive App Store traffic.

One of the notable offerings of Apple services business is Apple Pay. It is designed on the basis of NFC technology, and has been gaining traction across several markets. Apple Pay has allowed entry to more than 150 stadiums, ballparks, arenas and entertainment venues globally with contactless tickets.

Apple Pay users can avail public transport in Shanghai, Beijing, Tokyo, Moscow, London and New York. They can also access dorms and services of additional universities across the United States through Apple Watch and iPhone. The growing adoption of contactless payment primarily due to the coronavirus pandemic bodes well for Apple Pay.

However, it has not been clear whether the new feature to accept payment using iPhones will be branded as part of Apple Pay or a standalone feature.

2022-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,Why Intel Stock Crashed 7% Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-stock-crashed-7-today,,,"What happened
Shares of semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) reported an earnings beat Wednesday evening -- then its stock crashed Thursday morning. As of 10 a.m. ET, shares of Intel stock are down 7.2%.
Analysts had forecast Intel would earn only $0.90 per share on sales of $18.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, but Intel beat those numbers with a stick. For the quarter, Intel actually earned $1.09 per share and delivered sales of $20.5 billion.

So what
That sounds like pretty great news, so why is Intel stock down today? Well, as it turns out, Intel's news might have been less disastrous than Wall Street had predicted for it, but it was still pretty bad.
Although quarterly sales were better than expected, they grew only 3% year over year in the middle of the biggest semiconductor deficit in history (and all the pricing power that should imply). Gross profit margin, instead of rising in this environment, declined 320 basis points to 53.6%. And net income per share also declined under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) -- not quite as bad as the $1.09 pro forma number implies, perhaps, but still down 21% at $1.13 per share.
For the full year fiscal 2021, sales grew only 1% to $79 billion, gross margin slipped 40 basis points to 55.4%, and Intel ended up with $4.86 per share on the bottom line, down 2% from 2020.
Now what
Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2022, Intel is forecasting sales of approximately $18.3 billion, a 49% gross margin, and earnings per share of only $0.70 per share (or $0.80 non-GAAP). Although the revenue projection is quite a bit better than the $17.6 billion analysts have been forecasting for Intel, management's gross margin projection shows a continued deterioration in the profitability of Intel's business. Similarly, the company's projection for Q1 profit falls well short of the $0.86 per share (pro forma) that Wall Street will be looking for.
Translation: After beating on earnings in Q4 2021, Intel's probably going to miss -- and miss badly -- in Q1 2022. This, in a nutshell, is why investors are selling today.
