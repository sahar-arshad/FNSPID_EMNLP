2022-11-28 00:00:00+00:00,Is iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) a Strong ETF Right Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-ishares-msci-usa-value-factor-etf-vlue-a-strong-etf-right-now-5,,,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) debuted on 04/16/2013, and offers broad exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.
These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.
The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Blackrock, VLUE has amassed assets over $8.28 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Value. This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index.
The MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index is based on a traditional market capitalization-weighted parent index, the MSCI USA Index which includes U.S. large and mid capitalization stocks.
Cost & Other Expenses
When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.
Annual operating expenses for VLUE are 0.15%, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.
It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 3%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
Representing 24.80% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector; Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.
When you look at individual holdings, At&t Inc (T) accounts for about 4.81% of the fund's total assets, followed by Intel Corporation Corp (INTC) and Ford Motor Co (F).
VLUE's top 10 holdings account for about 27.17% of its total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF has lost about -10.67% and is down about -6.42% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 11/28/2022), respectively. VLUE has traded between $81.86 and $114.92 during this last 52-week period.
The ETF has a beta of 1.04 and standard deviation of 27.54% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 155 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
IShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.
IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) tracks Russell 1000 Value Index and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) tracks CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $55.26 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $107.31 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Value.

2022-11-26 00:00:00+00:00,2 Cheap Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-cheap-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now-8,,,"There are plenty of affordable stocks on the market nowadays. Market makers latched on to skyrocketing inflation rates and other macroeconomic challenges, which made them back away from certain types of stock at top speed. Anything that looked even a little bit risky was often deemed unfit for investment, sending share prices to the bottom of Wall Street's bargain bin.
It's true that some of the deeply discounted stocks probably deserved a price correction. In other cases, nervous investors threw out top-quality businesses with the proverbial bathwater.
Let's look at a couple of tech stocks in the latter category, whose stock prices are incredibly low while their long-term business prospects still look stellar. They are cheap in distinctly different ways, but we're looking at two clear combinations of low-priced stocks and tremendous long-term business prospects. That adds up to a pair of no-brainer buys.
Roku
Media-streaming technology specialist Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) is growing by leaps and bounds. The company grew its number of active user accounts by 16% over the last year while also generating 10% higher revenues per user over the same period.
Yet, investors have found reasons to back down from this exciting long-term growth story. Top-line growth has been relatively modest this year as consumers are buying fewer smart TV sets and media-streaming devices, and management's guidance suggested a weak holiday season. Specifically, digital ad sales are disappointingly soft amid the inflation-based slowdown in consumer spending.
As a result, the stock has fallen 89% from the highs of 2021. Roku shares currently trade at prices not seen since December 2018. It's as if the last four years never happened, and Roku has run out of business growth options. This is the end of the line, folks -- high time to sell every Roku share and never look back!
Yeah, right. We are actually looking at an incredible buying window here.
Roku's business has indeed evolved in recent years. Let's assume that Roku meets its revenue guidance of $800 million in the fourth quarter (though the company has a long history of setting the guidance bar low and exceeding it by a country mile). Full-year sales would then hit $3.06 billion, up from $2.76 billion last year and $743 million in 2018 -- the last time Roku shares traded this low.
Meanwhile, Roku's user count has nearly tripled in four years, and this growth was essentially based on smart TVs in North America. The company has only just begun to explore international expansion on a global scale, and its product portfolio is also developing into adjacent market opportunities.
The untapped growth potential in front of Roku is gigantic. The slowdown in 2022 will inevitably turn into a full-throated recovery when the inflation issue subsides. If you're not buying Roku stock at these thrifty share prices, you'll leave a lot of money on the table when the rebound comes.
Intel
Semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) finds itself in a strange situation.
Archrival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has been taking market share from Intel in important target markets such as data center processors and consumer-grade PC chips in recent years. The smaller chip designer's market value has been essentially equal to Intel's all year long. To a casual observer, it looks like AMD has outgrown its role as Intel's eternal challenger.
INTC Market Cap data by YCharts
But that's an illusion.
In reality, AMD remains the underdog and will stay in that position for years to come. AMD's growing slice of the data center sector, for example, still stands at a modest 17.5% of the annual revenue opportunity, far behind Intel's $4.2 billion data center revenues and 46% market share. Overall, Intel's top-line sales are triple the size of AMD's.
The balance of power tilts even further in Intel's direction when you consider each company's financial platform. Intel's balance sheet holds $22.6 billion of cash reserves, $5.8 billion in long-term investments, and $75.8 billion of net property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) infrastructure. AMD's cash equivalents add up to just $5.6 billion, with no long-term investments to speak of and a net PP&E balance of $2 billion.
And Intel is putting its unmatched financial assets to work.
AMD spun off its in-house manufacturing operations to private capital firms from Abu Dhabi in 2009, creating what is now known as GlobalFoundries. AMD relies exclusively on third-party manufacturing partners like GlobalFoundries. Meanwhile, Chipzilla invested $7.3 billion in capital expenses in the third quarter alone, building and upgrading its chipmaking facilities in places like Ohio, Arizona, and Germany. The company now sells semiconductor manufacturing services to other companies, aiming to become one of the world's largest chip foundries by the end of this decade.
Don't forget that Intel is running under relatively new management, and that the current team must unwind the mistakes made by the cost-cutting policies of the previous team. That takes time in an industry where new products go through a multiyear development pipeline before reaching store shelves. So Intel is a turnaround story in progress, but I believe in the innovation-oriented leadership under CEO Pat Gelsinger.
Intel's stock is down by 41% in 2022 and trades at the laughably low valuation of 9.2 times trailing earnings. The effective dividend yield has soared to 5%, which makes Intel a great income investment as well. What's not to love?

2022-11-24 00:00:00+00:00,Should iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) Be on Your Investing Radar?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-ishares-msci-usa-value-factor-etf-vlue-be-on-your-investing-radar-4,,,"If you're interested in broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market, look no further than the iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 04/16/2013.
The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $8.26 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.
Why Large Cap Value
Large cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.
Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.15%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.01%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
ETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 24.60% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, At&t Inc (T) accounts for about 4.81% of total assets, followed by Intel Corporation Corp (INTC) and Ford Motor Co (F).
The top 10 holdings account for about 27.17% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
VLUE seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index before fees and expenses. The MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index is based on a traditional market capitalization-weighted parent index, the MSCI USA Index which includes U.S. large and mid capitalization stocks.
The ETF has lost about -10.88% so far this year and is down about -6.77% in the last one year (as of 11/24/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $81.86 and $114.92.
The ETF has a beta of 1.04 and standard deviation of 27.56% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 155 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
IShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, VLUE is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.
The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $55.23 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $107.01 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.
Bottom-Line
An increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.

2022-11-23 00:00:00+00:00,"Six Stocks With Notable Insider Buying: Home Depot, Intel, Overstock and Others",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/six-stocks-with-notable-insider-buying%3A-home-depot-intel-overstock-and-others,,,"Insider buying always draws interest from investors. 
Insiders can sell for a whole host of reasons, including to make other investments, buy a house and pay for life’s expenses. Put simply, insider selling doesn’t have to mean the insider is necessarily bearish on the underlying stock. 
However, insiders only buy for one reason and that’s because they believe the stock price is going higher. 
As Peter Lynch once said: “Insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.”
With that, let’s look at some recent insider buying. 
Nerdy (NRDY)
Not a name that many are familiar with, Nerdy (US:NRDY) had a rather large CEO purchase last week. 
That’s as Charles Cohn bought 108,204 shares on Friday Nov. 18th and 132,547 shares on Monday Nov. 21st. While it’s a low-priced stock, the purchases were nothing to sneeze at, totaling $254,279 and $310,159, respectively. 
He also bought 108,204 shares on both Nov. 16th and Nov. 17th. 
With the purchases, Cohn — who also serves on the board of directors and has a more than 10% stake in the firm — now has a stake north of 10,400,000 shares. 
Intel (INTC)
In September, Lip-Bu Tan was elected to the board of directors for Intel (US:INTC). Since then, he’s been a busy man. 
Tan also serves as the executive chairman of Cadence Design Systems (US:CDNS) and the chairman of Walden International. For his role with Intel, Tan will “join the M&A Committee of Intel’s board of directors.”
As for the insider buying, Tan bought roughly 1,800 shares on Nov. 4th and more than 48,000 shares on Nov. 8th. A few days later on Nov. 16th, Tan bought another 50,000 shares for one of his trusts. 
Home Depot (HD)
Home Depot (US:HD) also made the list of insider buying, after Santilli Paula scooped up 1,583 shares on Nov. 16th. Some may scoff at a sub-1,600 share position, but when it’s valued at roughly $500,000, they shouldn’t. 
Paula was named to Home Depot’s board of directors in February. 
Cronos (CRON)
Cronos (US:CRON) also made the list with insider buying, as Jason Marc Adler has been active in the stock. 
Adler is a board member with Cronos and has made eight separate purchases of Cronos stock this month for his Gotham Green Fund III, where he a co-founder and managing member. 
From Nov. 15th to Nov. 18th, Adler purchased more than 390,000 shares of Cronos between $2.90 a share and $3.10 a share. 
Wolfspeed (WOLF)
The company formerly known as Cree but now known as Wolfspeed (US:WOLF) makes our list after Duy-Loan Le bought the stock this month. 
Between Nov. 1st and 2nd, she bought 3,000 shares between $71.90 and $77.26. A few weeks later, she picked up another 2,000 shares for roughly $91, bringing her total stake to 29,662 shares. 
Further, on Nov. 18th, she bought another 3,000 shares through an LLC, where she now owns 5,000 shares. 
Overstock (OSTK)
Last but certainly not least on our list of insider buying is Overstock (US:OSTK), as two insider transactions stood out. 
Joseph J. Tabacco, Jr. has served on the board of directors since 2007 and scooped up 10,000 shares on Nov. 16th, bringing his total to 86,747 shares. 
A day later, CEO Jonathan E. Johnson III — and a board member since 2013 — bought 4,000 shares at $23.13. The move brought his total stake up to 127,134 shares.

2022-11-23 00:00:00+00:00,Here’s What the Intel Layoffs Mean for INTC Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-what-the-intel-layoffs-mean-for-intc-stock,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
What does a bottoming process in a stock look like? In the case of microprocessor manufacturing giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), reaching rock bottom is bound to involve layoffs and a general sense of pessimism. The layoffs aren’t going to be pleasant, but they’re a sign that Intel’s management is doing what’s needed to turn the company around and rebuild confidence in INTC stock investors.
After a euphoric 2021, investors will remember 2022 as the year of the Big Tech wreck. Semiconductor stocks have been particularly downtrodden. And Intel remains stuck in the doghouse even as a new year approaches.
Thus, it feels like news of Intel’s layoffs is a signal of the company’s impending doom. Really, though, it’s a sign that Intel’s management is ready to exercise fiscal discipline — and contrarian investors should be in the mood to buy, not sell.
INTC Stock Is Despised… But Not by Everyone
Again, we have to bear in mind what a bottoming process actually looks and feels like. Think of the stock market in March of 2009 as an example. The bulls were mocked at that time, yet they were 100% right.
Similarly, you won’t make a lot of friends if you go on a financial message board and proclaim your optimism for INTC stock. It certainly didn’t help the bull camp when JPMorgan analysts joined the chorus of pessimistic voices on Wall Street earlier this month.
In case you didn’t get the memo, the JPMorgan analysts issued a dreaded double downgrade. They downgraded Intel shares from “overweight” to “underweight,” and halved their price target on the shares from $64 to $32.
At the same time, Vanguard, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), State Street (NYSE:STT) and other large-scale investors reportedly held long positions in INTC stock. It’s also worth noting that CEO Pat Gelsinger and board member Lip-Bu Tan are both big-time Intel shareholders.
Intel Layoffs Are Part of a Long-Term Plan
Are Intel’s layoffs bad news? For the displaced workers, the answer is probably yes. For Intel’s shareholders, however, the headcount reduction is a sensible and necessary move.
The company announced imminent layoffs in October as part of Intel’s third-quarter earnings report. This isn’t just a haphazard cost-cutting tactic. Rather, it’s part of a bigger plan to create $3 billion worth of cost reductions next year.
Don’t get me wrong; Intel currently has over 121,000 employees, so it will still be a chipmaking powerhouse even after the layoffs. For November, Intel’s management reiterated its intent to enact “targeted” layoffs. So there’s no doubt that some jobs will be lost.
That’s part of the painful process of driving billions of dollars in outlay reductions. Remember, improving Intel’s bottom line isn’t just about generating more revenue. It’s also about curbing costs, including those associated with human capital.
What You Can Do Now
In the final analysis, the word “layoffs” shouldn’t scare sensible investors away from INTC stock. If anything, this is a sign that Intel’s executives understand the importance of financial discipline.
So, don’t worry too much if some folks on Wall Street hate Intel now. There are also some confident big-money buyers out there — and you can join them, if you’d like, with a long-term share position in Intel.

2022-11-23 00:00:00+00:00,3 High-Yield Dow Jones Industrial Average Stocks That Are Screaming Buys,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-high-yield-dow-jones-industrial-average-stocks-that-are-screaming-buys,,,"Since its official debut in May 1896, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) has served as arguably the most-watched barometer of the stock market's health. Over 126 years, the Dow Jones has expanded from an index that housed 12 mostly industrial stocks to one that today is home to 30 diverse businesses.
Even though the Dow has its flaws -- it's a share price-weighted index, rather than a market cap-weighted index -- it's packed with mature, profitable business that almost always pay a dividend and know how to reward patient shareholders. As of this past weekend, 27 of the 30 Dow components were doling out a regular dividend.
Image source: Getty Images.
But no two dividend stocks are created equally -- even within this timeless index. Among the 27 Dow components paying a dividend are six high-yield stocks (those with yields of 4% or above). Three of these high-yield Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks are screaming buys at their current price.
Intel: 4.89% yield
The first Dow stock with a supercharged yield that's begging to be bought is semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Though Intel has bounced a bit off of its recent low, its 4.9% yield is well above its historic average.
Like pretty much all chipmakers, Intel is being weighed down by the growing likelihood of a recession in the U.S., as well as ongoing supply chain constraints, which have hurt demand. Intel has also lost some of its market share to rival Advanced Micro Devices. This combination of factors recently pushed Intel stock to its lowest level in more than eight years. But that pain can be your gain.
According to a report by management consulting firm McKinsey & Co., the global semiconductor industry should surpass $1 trillion in value by 2030. This suggests a compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8% over the next eight years. While that might not be a jaw-dropping growth rate, it supports the idea that more products are becoming tech dependent as time passes. As the largest provider of central processing units (CPUs), Intel is well positioned to benefit.
To address the elephant in the room, Intel has, indeed, been losing some of its market share to AMD. But the magnitude of this loss appears overblown. For personal computers, mobile, and data center servers, Intel is still the unquestioned share leader by a significant amount. Translation: Intel's competitive advantage is securing abundant future cash flow, which the company can use to reward shareholders or reinvest in high-growth initiatives.
One of the most exciting ways Intel is putting money to work right now is happening in Ohio. The company recently broke ground on two chip manufacturing plants (a more than $20 billion expense) that are set to open in 2024. Considering that the recently passed CHIPS and Science Act is designed to subsidize domestic chip manufacturing plant construction, Intel is incented to grow its foundry ambitions.
And don't forget about autonomous vehicle company Mobileye Global, which went public on Oct. 26. Intel acquired Mobileye in 2017 and has been the company's fastest-growing operating segment.
Although Intel's business isn't going to turn on a dime, it's well positioned to bounce back and reward patient investors.
Walgreens Boots Alliance: 4.83% yield
A second super-high-yielding Dow Jones Industrial Average stock that's a screaming buy right now is pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA). Though Walgreens has a nearly identical yield to Intel, it's working on a 47-year streak of increasing its base annual payout.
As I've pointed out, healthcare stocks are usually exempted from recessionary fears. Since we can't control when we get sick or what ailment(s) we develop, there's always demand for prescription drugs, medical devices, and healthcare services. But because Walgreens is so reliant on its physical stores, the COVID-19 pandemic made it an exception to this rule. Lockdowns put a short-term hurt on the company's bottom line.
But there's also good news. The worst of the pandemic looks to be in the rearview mirror, and Walgreens Boots Alliance has implemented a laundry list of changes designed to boost its operating efficiency, organic growth rate, and customer loyalty.
Unsurprisingly, cost cutting has been part of the plan. The company managed to reduce its annual operating expenses by more than $2 billion, a full year ahead of schedule. This cost cutting, coupled with the sale of its wholesale drug operations to AmerisourceBergen in 2021 for about $6.5 billion, has helped the company lower its outstanding debt and improve its operating efficiency.
Just as important as cutting costs is noting where Walgreens is deploying its capital. It's invested heavily in a variety of digitization initiatives designed to encourage online sales and drive-thru pickup. Despite remaining a brick-and-mortar-reliant company, Walgreens should be able to sustain double-digit digital sales growth for the foreseeable future.
Further, Walgreens Boots Alliance is working with VillageMD to open up to 1,000 full-service health clinics co-located at its stores in more than 30 U.S. markets. The duo aims to reach this total by the end of 2027. Being physician staffed is a true differentiator that should help drive repeat business and improve engagement at the local level.
With an improving balance sheet and a pathway to sustainably higher organic growth, Walgreens Boots Alliance looks like an amazing deal at roughly 9 times forecast earnings in fiscal 2023.

Verizon Communications: 6.77% yield
The third high-yield Dow Jones Industrial Average stock that's a screaming buy right now is telecom stock Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ). Verizon's nearly 6.8% yield is far and away the highest in the Dow. What's more, Verizon has increased its base annual payout for the past 16 years. That's the longest current streak among U.S. telecom stocks.
Whereas most tech stocks have thrived for more than a decade, Verizon has been a chronic underperformer. The company's relatively slow growth rate and high debt load enticed investors to put their money to work in faster-growing companies. But with interest rates rising and access to cheap capital cut off, the cash-flow stability and superior yield Verizon offers makes it a stock to buy.
Like Intel, Verizon has macro headwinds working to its advantage. Over time, having wireless access and owning a smartphone have effectively become necessities. No matter how poorly the U.S. economy or stock market perform, churn rates for the company's bread-and-butter wireless segment have remained near historic lows.
To add to this point, companies that provide basic necessity goods and services usually have exceptional pricing power. In June, Verizon was able to pass along a modest price increase to many of its consumer and business plans without any notable impact to its churn rate.
Verizon should also benefit from the 5G revolution for years to come. Prior to Verizon and its peers rolling out 5G wireless infrastructure upgrades, it had been around a decade since wireless download speeds were last meaningfully improved. This pent-up demand should entice businesses and consumers to upgrade their devices and consume more data. In short, Verizon's costly 5G infrastructure upgrades should prove well worth it as high-margin data usage moves its profit needle higher.
Another reason Verizon's organic growth rate can enjoy an uptick in the coming years is the company's aggressive investment in C-Band spectrum. Last year, it spent nearly $53 billion to purchase (and more than double) its C-Band spectrum. The goal for Verizon is to reach 14 million businesses and 50 million households with 5G broadband services by the end of 2025. Broadband sales can generate consistent cash flow, as well as boost the company's operating margin if bundled with other services.
Despite being a relatively slow-growing company, Verizon's 6.8% yield and sustained organic catalysts give it a solid opportunity to deliver for long-term investors.

2022-11-22 00:00:00+00:00,Why Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Was Rising Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-was-rising-today,,,"What happened
Shares of foundry giant and new Warren Buffett holding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (NYSE: TSM) were rising today, up as much as 4% before settling in to an above-market 2.8% gain as of 2:38 p.m. EST.
There wasn't much company-specific news today; however, a key executive departure at rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) may indicate Intel's ambitious plans to catch up with TSMC in leading-edge production may have hit a setback. Intel's loss would could be TSMC's gain.
So what
Last night, Intel announced that Randhir Thakur, the executive who was leading Intel's plan to establish itself as a leading foundry for other semiconductor designers, was leaving the company. In an emailed statement to Bloomberg, Intel said Thakur ""has decided to step down from his position to pursue opportunities outside the company.""
That's certainly concerning for Intel, which is in the midst of an ambitious plan to build out a rival foundry ecosystem to compete with TSMC on the leading edge of semiconductor production. Until recently, Intel had only manufactured its own chips; however, with TSMC surpassing Intel on leading-edge technology a few years ago and continuing to extend that advantage, new Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has changed the company's strategy to become a foundry for other companies as well. It's possible the cumulative knowledge TSMC has gained by serving a diverse set of third-party chip design customers played a part in its technological success, so Gelsinger's new strategy makes sense.
However, the strategy is turning out to be much easier said than done. Producing semiconductors on the leading edge is becoming more and more difficult with each node, so catching up won't be easy, from either a financial or technological perspective. Intel's main source of cash, its dominant PC processor business, has fallen off a cliff this year, as the PC market is seeing the largest year-over-year decline in recent history. Meanwhile, Intel's production of its latest data center processor, Sapphire Rapids, has been delayed into next year, even as competitors -- which are TSMC customers -- have introduced their new chips this fall.
Now, with the head of Intel's third-party foundry business departing, uncertainty is only growing.
Of course, this change in leadership doesn't mean Intel will fail in its ambitions. In fact, Intel is up 1.8% today, about in-line with the broader semiconductor index.
Still, the departure clouds Intel's outlook and seems to only reinforce TSMC's leadership. Hence, why TSMC is outpacing both Intel and the broader tech index today after yesterday's pullback.
Now what
Taiwan Semiconductor stock bounced about 10% higher after last week's news that Warren Buffett had taken a large stake in the dominant foundry and key Apple supplier. However, the stock still trades at just 15 times earnings and is down 34% over the past 12 months.
If in fact today's news is an indication, TSMC's lead over rivals Intel and Samsung is widening, not narrowing. It's just another reason to own this wide-moat dividend stock.

2022-11-22 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Corporation (INTC) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-corporation-intc-is-a-trending-stock%3A-facts-to-know-before-betting-on-it-2,,,"Intel (INTC) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned +6.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Intel falls in, has gained 16.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.23 per share, indicating a change of -78.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -71.1% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $1.96 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -64.2%. This estimate has changed -11% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.92 indicates a change of -2% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -22%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Intel.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Intel, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.5 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -25.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $63.51 billion and $61.66 billion estimates indicate -18.6% and -2.9% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $15.34 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.1%. EPS of $0.59 for the same period compares with $1.71 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.49 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.99%. The EPS surprise was +73.53%.
Over the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

2022-11-22 00:00:00+00:00,How The Pieces Add Up: FEX Targets $92,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-the-pieces-add-up%3A-fex-targets-%2492,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust Large Cap Core AlphaDEX Fund ETF (Symbol: FEX), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $91.56 per unit.
With FEX trading at a recent price near $82.52 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.96% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of FEX's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Vulcan Materials Co (Symbol: VMC), Visa Inc (Symbol: V), and Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC). Although VMC has traded at a recent price of $178.56/share, the average analyst target is 12.45% higher at $200.78/share. Similarly, V has 11.11% upside from the recent share price of $206.32 if the average analyst target price of $229.25/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting INTC to reach a target price of $32.15/share, which is 11.10% above the recent price of $28.94. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of VMC, V, and INTC:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
First Trust Large Cap Core AlphaDEX Fund ETF FEX $82.52 $91.56 10.96%
Vulcan Materials Co VMC $178.56 $200.78 12.45%
Visa Inc V $206.32 $229.25 11.11%
Intel Corp INTC $28.94 $32.15 11.10%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2022-11-20 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia Scores a Huge Win -- Microsoft Will Be First Public Cloud to Adopt Its AI Stack,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-scores-a-huge-win-microsoft-will-be-first-public-cloud-to-adopt-its-ai-stack,,,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) just reported third-quarter earnings, and it's still working through too much inventory and a tough market in China. Results were about what could be expected right now.
The biggest news, though, was a partnership with Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) cloud computing segment, Azure, to build a new supercomputer. Nvidia says Microsoft is the first public cloud business to adopt its full, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) stack built from Nvidia hardware and software.
It isn't the first deal like this announced lately. But it underscores how far Nvidia has come -- and how much it still has to gain in the coming years -- as its data center segment grows. Here's what investors need to know.
Nvidia GPUs head for the private and public cloud
If Nvidia's new supercomputer partnership with Microsoft Azure sounds familiar, here's why. Just a few weeks prior, Nvidia said it was partnering with tech stalwart Oracle. Oracle has a public cloud infrastructure and platform service, and it's trying to play catch-up with some of the other big names like Azure, Amazon's AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. Besides adding ""tens of thousands"" of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) to its service, Oracle will also make Nvidia AI software available to its users.
The deal with Microsoft is slightly different, and not just in size and scope. Microsoft's supercomputer will feature tens of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, but it will also be the first public cloud provider to fully adopt Nvidia's AI software development tools and services. This ""full stack"" (which references the hardware, the software that governs how it functions, and actual applications) will be used by Microsoft for its own internal development and also be made available to subscribers to the tech giant's cloud service.
Interestingly, Nvidia's VP of enterprise computing -- the division that's helping spearhead this project with Microsoft -- is Manuvir Das. Das was a general manager at Microsoft in the mid-to-late 2000s, helping to develop the framework for Microsoft Azure.
Microsoft Azure and its other cloud computing segments are massive. The company's intelligent cloud division generated $20.3 billion in revenue last quarter, a 20% year-over-year increase. Nvidia's data center, by comparison, hauled in just $3.8 billion, good for nearly 31% year-over-year growth.
How high can Nvidia data centers fly?
As CEO Jensen Huang discussed in the latestearnings call lots of companies -- from large, well-established ones to a slew of new start-ups -- want quick and easy-to-use access to Nvidia's full-stack computing offerings. Thus, getting distribution of its hardware and AI software via public clouds like Microsoft and Oracle is a big deal for Nvidia. The quicker it can do so, the better. It's still early on in generating a recurring revenue stream from cloud subscription access to its AI suite, and distribution via partners like Microsoft and Oracle will help it reach more customers at a faster rate.
But how far could Nvidia take things? After all, it has competition in this space. AMD also has data center computing accelerator chips. Even Intel, though woefully behind at the moment, is trying to make some headway designing GPUs for data center AI applications.
However, Nvidia's strategy of building hardware and software is unique. It's steadily worming its way into the enterprise software market here, creating a diverse set of tools that can be used by developers to build their own solutions all the way to full-blown applications that are ready to use. Cloud-based enterprise software is worth hundreds of billions of dollars in annual spending worldwide. Suffice to say there's some room to wiggle in. Even a small slice of this pie would be huge for Nvidia.
Given the incredible number of use cases out there for its software suite, Huang said Nvidia will start disaggregating its data center segment a bit going forward. Rather than just a lump sum ""data center"" figure -- now far and away the company's largest moneymaker -- Nvidia will begin reporting on different industries within the whole. In other words, giant customers like Microsoft aren't Nvidia's only source of growth anymore. Look forward to some extra commentary on specific industry customers and financials spanning automotive, energy, healthcare, and more.
Nvidia is dealing with some tough times right now as its consumer-facing businesses undergo a big adjustment. However, given the breadth and depth of its expertise in the burgeoning AI space, Nvidia remains my top buy-and-hold stock that I expect to stick with for the duration of the 2020s.

2022-11-19 00:00:00+00:00,2 Value Stocks to Buy Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-value-stocks-to-buy-right-now,,,"You have to get two things right to successfully invest in stocks. First, you must have a decent idea of a company's long-term growth potential and the associated odds. Second, you must pay a price that is reasonable based on those odds.
Over the past couple of years, many investors forgot that second part. It didn't matter until it did. With rising interest rates and recession fears putting a chill on valuations, the priciest growth stocks have been decimated in the true sense of the word.
A value stock is not simply a cheap stock, it's a stock with a valuation that doesn't fully reflect the underlying company's growth potential. Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are two prime examples.
1. A media and entertainment juggernaut
It's tough to value Disney right now because the company is going through a transition that's knocking down profits. The media giant is pouring billions into its streaming businesses, and if you look at subscriber counts, that strategy is working like a charm. But the cost of that success is steep.
Disney now has over 210 million streaming subscribers spread across its various services. Disney+, which launched just three years ago, has attracted 164.2 million paying customers. The company's unmatched portfolio of intellectual property, which includes Marvel and Star Wars, gives it an endless source of ideas for streaming content.
Disney has used rock-bottom prices to juice its subscriber gains. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, the average customer pays just $5.96 per month for the service. Disney will likely use the same strategy it uses for its parks: raise prices over time to reflect the value and unique nature of what it can offer its customers. Right now, the streaming business is losing around $4 billion annually. Disney has pricing power, and it can flex it to turn streaming into a wildly profitable business in the long run.
Disney's stock doesn't look particularly cheap on the surface. The company generated adjusted EPS of $3.53 in fiscal 2022, putting the price-to-earnings ratio at around 26. But it's not Disney's current results that are important; it's the company's long-term potential. The optionality Disney's IP portfolio provides should not be underestimated. Disney's performance is messy right now, but this is an iconic company that should grow stronger over time.
2. A chip giant with a plan
Intel is one of the last remaining semiconductor companies that both designs and manufacturers logic chips. The company is investing heavily to build out its own foundry business, aiming to take a big chunk of the global foundry market by selling its manufacturing capacity and expertise.
That's part of Intel's comeback plan. The other part is to retake the performance and efficiency crowns from rival AMD in its core PC and server CPU markets. Intel has already succeeded in PCs -- the company's Raptor Lake chips beat the competition in nearly every measure. It's going to take a while in the server market -- while Intel suffered delay after delay with its Sapphire Rapids chips, AMD was stealing market share and putting out superior products.
Intel's market share losses and the heavy spending necessary to build its foundry business have weighed on the stock. Like Disney, simply looking at the P/E ratio as it stands today isn't all that meaningful. The company expects to produce adjusted earnings per share of $1.95 this year, putting the P/E ratio at roughly 15.
Earnings will be depressed as Intel invests heavily in manufacturing and executes on its roadmap to take back the server market share that it's lost. A weak PC market isn't helping, although billions in cost cuts over the next three years should offset some of the pain.
The best-case scenario for Intel is for it to start to reverse AMD's market share gains in the PC and server chip markets while winning foundry customers that have become overly dependent on market leader TSMC. Being a U.S.-based manufacturer is a big advantage. TSMC is based in Taiwan, which is caught in the middle of tense relations between the U.S. and China.
Relative to sales, Intel stock is about the cheapest it's been in decades. That's not enough of a reason on its own to buy the stock, but it gives a sense of how pessimistic the market has become on the semiconductor giant. The reason to buy Intel is its potential to reclaim its dominance in PC and server chips while building a multi-billion-dollar foundry business that benefits from the growth of the broader semiconductor market.
The next few years will be messy for Intel as it cuts costs, brings new server chips to market, and continues to lay the foundation of its foundry business. But if the company succeeds even partially, the stock could be worth a lot more down the road.

2022-11-18 00:00:00+00:00,4 Green Flags for ASML's Future,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-green-flags-for-asmls-future,,,"ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) is one of the most important semiconductor equipment makers in the world. The Dutch company is the world's largest producer of photolithography systems, which are used to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only manufacturer of top-tier extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems, which are required for the production of the world's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips.
ASML's monopolization of that crucial technology -- which is used by top foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Samsung, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) -- makes it a linchpin and bellwether of the semiconductor industry. But that reputation is a double-edged sword: Persistent concerns regarding the deceleration of sales in the PC, smartphone, and cloud markets all caused ASML's stock to decline more than 30% from its all-time high of $870.85 a share last September.
Image source: Getty Images.
But the stock recently rallied after it allayed some of those fears with its latest investor day presentation on Nov. 11. Let's review four green flags the company just raised regarding its long-term prospects, and why they suggest its stock could head much higher by the end of the decade.
1. ASML offered a big guidance boost for 2025 and beyond
During ASML's previous investor day last September, the company said it would generate 24 billion to 30 billion euros ($24.9 billion to $31 billion) in revenue in 2025, with a gross margin of 54% to 56%. It based those estimates on its ""low"" and ""high"" scenarios for wafer demand across the semiconductor industry.
But this time, ASML raised its 2025 guidance to 30 billion to 40 billion euros in revenue and kept its gross margin guidance at 54% to 56%. It also predicted that its annual revenue would reach 44 billion euros to 60 billion euros by 2030 with a gross margin of 56% to 60%.
The midpoint of that guidance implies ASML's annual revenue could reach a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% from 2021 to 2030. Its gross margin would also expand significantly from 52.7% in 2021 -- which isn't that surprising, since it has unmatched pricing power in the EUV market.
2. ASML is shrugging off concerns about China
ASML generated 15% of its system sales in China last year, but it only sells its lower-end deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems there. The Dutch government previously barred ASML from selling its EUV systems to China amid escalating concerns about Chinese chipmakers producing more-advanced chips.
The Biden administration recently banned all American companies from exporting advanced semiconductors, semiconductor equipment, and semiconductor services to China. But last month, ASML CEO Peter Wennink said all those bans would only have a ""limited"" impact on its system shipments in 2023 because it was only selling DUV systems in China.
Wennink reiterated that position during ASML's investor day presentation, saying that even if Chinese chipmakers couldn't expand their capacity from their current levels, those restrictions could cause a ""temporary hiccup"" but wouldn't alter its outlook for 2030 that much. He said that even if new manufacturing facilities aren't built in China, they would need to be built somewhere else to satisfy the market's growing demand for new chips.
3. An expansion of its annual capacity
In 2021, ASML sold 42 EUV systems, which cost $150 million to $200 million each and require multiple planes to ship. It's still delivering and installing these systems as rapidly as it can produce them, and it's even implementing fast shipments -- that skip part of the testing process and postpone billings for some customers -- to get them out the door faster.
Therefore, the market's demand for ASML's EUV systems is still outstripping its supply even as the semiconductor market cools off. That's because TSMC, Samsung, and Intel still need to continuously invest in smaller and denser chips to avoid falling behind the tech curve.
That's why ASML plans to increase its annual capacity to 90 EUVs and 600 DUVs (compared to 267 units in 2021) by 2025-2026. It also expects to kick off its shipments of next-gen ""high-NA"" EUV systems, which will enable its customers to produce even smaller chips, in 2023 -- and to ramp up its annual production capacity to 20 systems by 2027-2028.
4. ASML has a new share buyback plan
On top of all that rosy guidance, ASML announced a new share buyback plan of up to 12 billion euros ($12.4 billion), which will last through the end of 2025. That represents about 5% of ASML's current market cap, and would continue its consistent buybacks over the past decade:

ASML's stock isn't cheap at 32 times next year's earnings. But I believe its monopolization of a crucial chipmaking technology justifies that premium, and its recent investor day suggests it still has plenty of upside as it increases its capacity and launches new systems. Therefore, ASML is still an easy stock to buy and hold for long-term investors.

Nov 17 (Reuters) - Chip tools maker Applied Materials Inc AMAT.O forecast first-quarter revenue above market estimates on Thursday, on hopes that easing supply chain constraints will help it meet pent up demand from chipmakers ramping up production.
Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company rose nearly 3% in trading after the bell.
Even though the wider chip industry is seeing sluggish demand for consumer electronics like PCs and smart phones, the growing adoption of 5G and shift to hybrid work still remains positive.
Moreover, Applied is also set to benefit from a U.S. push to cut dependency on China and ramp up domestic chip output, prompting chipmakers like Intel Corp INTC.O and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 2330.TW to announce plans for new plants.
The company posted revenue of $6.75 billion for the fourth quarter ended Oct. 30, compared to analysts' average expectation of $6.45 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Chief Executive Gary Dickerson said that the company is slowing the ""rate of spending growth in the near term amid geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges.""
The company forecast current-quarter revenue of $6.70 billion, plus or minus $400 million, compared with analysts' average estimate of $6.45 billion.
Applied said the outlook includes expected impact of recently announced U.S. export regulations and ongoing supply chain challenges.
Earlier in October, the company said export restrictions to China would result in a $250 million-$550 million loss in net sales in the quarter ending Oct. 30, with a similar impact expected in the following three months.
Excluding items, the company earned $2.03 per share, beating estimates of $1.73 per share.

2022-11-17 00:00:00+00:00,Chipmaker Astera Labs valued at over $3 bln after latest fundraise,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chipmaker-astera-labs-valued-at-over-%243-bln-after-latest-fundraise,,,"Nov 17 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Astera Labs said on Thursday it was valued at $3.15 billion following a late-stage funding round led by Fidelity Management & Research, signaling investors' bullishness on the semiconductor sector.
The company raised $150 million in the latest round amid upbeat long-term outlook for chips, especially as growth in artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and machine learning segments booms.
Berkshire Hathaway BRKa.N, which typically stays away from big technology wagers, said earlier this week it had bought more than $4.1 billion in TSMC stock.
Astera Labs has expanded its board of directors, added new product lines to its portfolio, increased its workforce and also added two new research and design centers in Vancouver and Toronto this year.

Nov 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged lower on Thursday following mixed economic data this week, while chip designer Nvidia rose after reporting better-than-expected quarterly revenue.
Wall Street closed the previous session lower as a grim outlook from Target Corp TGT.N sparked concerns about retailers heading into the crucial holiday season, while semiconductor shares .SOX slid 4.3% after Micron Technology Inc's MU.Osupply cut.
Shares of Nvidia Corp NVDA.O rose 2.2% in early premarket trading on Thursday after the company beat estimates for third-quarter revenue, helped by strong demand in its data center business.

Stronger-than-expected retail sales numbers on Wednesday raised concerns that continued strength in spending will keep the U.S. Federal Reserve on track to tighten monetary policy further, even as subsiding inflation gives the central bank room to scale back the size of its interest rate hikes.
""Wall Street was rattled by a conflicting retail picture,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
""Overall sales were stronger than expected showing consumer resilience had not been knocked by super-sized interest rate hikes aimed at pulling down the price spiral. This has added to expectations that higher rates will have to linger for a lot longer to make a difference.""

2022-11-17 00:00:00+00:00,Will AMD Stock Fly or Fall in 2023?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-amd-stock-fly-or-fall-in-2023,,,"So far in 2022, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) investors have taken it on the chin with the stock for the chipmaker down roughly 47%. But recent stock price action suggests the year could end on a positive note with some level of recovery.
Share prices of AMD are up about 36% in the past month, bringing some relief to investors who witnessed a brutal sell-off for most of the year. But will AMD be able to sustain this recovery momentum for the remainder of 2022 and into the new year? Let's take a closer look and see if we can find the answer.
Why AMD stock could fly in 2023
The data center business was a bright spot for AMD this year, helping the company mitigate the negative impact of a weak personal computer (PC) market. Sales of data center chips produced $4.4 billion in revenue for AMD in the first nine months of 2022, up 74% from the same period last year. The segment's revenue increased 45% year over year in the recently reported third quarter to $1.6 billion, driven by market share gains in the server processor space.
The strong showing from the data center business helped AMD finish Q3 with a 29% increase in revenue to $5.6 billion, even though revenue from sales of desktop and notebook processors declined a whopping 40% year over year to $1 billion, thanks to a soft PC market. Mercury Research estimates that AMD gained server processor market share for the 14th consecutive quarter in Q3. Its share reportedly increased 7.3 percentage points year over year to 17.5% last quarter.
It won't be surprising to see AMD sustain its server growth momentum in 2023, driven by the launch of its latest generation Epyc processors this month. The chipmaker is promising that its fourth-generation Epyc processors can deliver a 2.8 times increase in performance and a 54% reduction in power consumption over the prior generation.
More importantly, AMD's new processors have already been chosen for deployment by major cloud service providers such as Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, and Oracle. Also, server OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) such as Supermicro, Lenovo, and Dell will be making systems powered by AMD's latest chips.
Earlier this year, Bank of America estimated that AMD's server market share could hit 35%. The pace at which AMD gained server share last quarter, along with Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) delays in bringing the next generation of its server processors to market could pave the way for AMD to substantially increase its share once again in 2023.
It is also worth noting that while AMD's data center revenue increased by around $1.9 billion in the first nine months of 2022 to $4.4 billion, Intel's data center revenue dropped to $14.9 billion over the same period. Chipzilla generated $16.2 billion in data center revenue during the same period in 2021. So, Intel's loss was AMD's gain, and a similar situation is likely to unfold in 2023 as AMD seems in a position to take more business from its bigger rival.
Another reason why AMD stock could step on the gas next year is because of an increase in the production of gaming consoles. Sony, which uses AMD's semi-custom processors in the PlayStation 5 console, aims to ship 30 million units in fiscal 2023 (which will end in March 2024). That would be a 64% jump from its estimate of 18.5 million units in fiscal 2022.
Meanwhile, Microsoft's Xbox console shipments are expected to jump to 30 million units in 2023, up 42% from this year's estimate of 21 million. This bodes well for AMD as Microsoft is also using AMD's chips in its latest consoles. Throw in the company's solid growth and prospects in the embedded business that produced $1.3 billion in revenue last quarter, an increase of 1,549% over the prior year thanks to the acquisition of Xilinx, and it is evident that a majority of AMD's business is built for growth.
The gaming, data center, and embedded businesses produced 82% of AMD's revenue last quarter. So, there are multiple reasons why AMD stock could fly higher in 2023.
Why the stock could fall
There are two reasons why AMD's misfortune could continue in the new year.
The first is the continued weakness in the PC market that could keep the company's client processor business under pressure. Market research firm IDC forecasts that PC sales are on track to drop 12.8% this year, which explains why AMD is experiencing weak sales of desktop and notebook processors. The market isn't expected to recover in 2023, with IDC estimating that the combined sales of tablets and PCs could drop 2.6% next year.
The second reason why AMD's latest rally could be under threat in 2023 is because of its rich valuation. AMD stock trades at 44 times trailing earnings, which is rich when compared to the Nasdaq-100 index's multiple of 24. Richly valued stocks were hammered this year amid surging inflation that led the Federal Reserve to aggressively hike interest rates. A similar trend in 2023 could spell bad news for AMD.
What should investors do?
The reasons why AMD stock could fly higher in 2023 outweigh the reasons why it could fall, which is why investors who hold this tech stock in their portfolios should continue doing so since it seems capable of sustaining its momentum.
That being said, the stock remains richly valued and a small sign of weakness in the company's growth story could send its shares tumbling. However, that could open an opportunity for savvy investors to buy shares of AMD given that it is built for long-term growth on account of the multiple catalysts that it is sitting on.

Nov 16 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell on Wednesday as a grim outlook from Target spurred fresh concerns for retailers heading into the crucial holiday season, while Micron's supply cut triggered a selloff in the chip sector.
Target Corp TGT.N tumbled as much as 17% in early trading as a pullback in consumer spending despite heavy discounting cut its third-quarter profit by half.
Its bleak results jolted the retail sector, with shares of Macy's Inc M.N, Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N and Dollar Tree Inc DLTR.O dropping between 1.6% and 8.9%.
Meanwhile, Micron Technology Inc MU.O said it will reduce memory chip supply in 2023 and make more cuts to its capital spending plan, as it struggles to clear excess inventory due to a demand slump.
Shares of other chip stocks such as Intel Corp INTC.O, Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O, Applied Materials AMAT.O and Lam Research LRCX.O fell between 2% and 6%, weighing heavily on the tech-heavy Nasdaq.
""There are two things weighing on market sentiment; you're seeing softer demand in two sectors with Target in the retail sector and Micron with the chips,"" said Dennis Dick, market structure analyst and trader at Triple D Trading, highlighting Micron's drag on other chipmakers.
Investors will also keep an eye on chipmaker Nvidia Corp's NVDA.O earnings, which is expected later in the day.
Despite the sales warning from Target, data showed U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in October, boosted by purchases of motor vehicles and suggesting that consumer spending remained stable.
The data and earnings reports come on the heels of upbeat quarterly results from Walmart Inc WMT.N on Tuesday that had added to market optimism driven by a softer-than-expected producer prices report.
All the three main indexes ended higher in the previous session as geopolitical worries were overshadowed by expectations that the improved inflation outlook would allow the Federal Reserve to shift to smaller interest rate hikes as soon as December.
Several Fed officials have also signaled that the central bank could slow its pace of tightening while stressing the need to continue to raise borrowing costs to stamp out high inflation.
San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly on Wednesday said it is reasonable for the U.S. central bank to raise its policy rate to the 4.75%-5.25% range by early next year, with a 5% policy rate as a ""reasonable starting point.""

2022-11-16 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Intel, Qualcomm, and Applied Materials Stocks Dropped This Morning",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-qualcomm-and-applied-materials-stocks-dropped-this-morning,,,"What happened
Wednesday is turning into an unpleasant day for investors in semiconductor stocks as shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) slide in early trading. As of 9:50 a.m. EST, Intel stock is down 2.6%, Qualcomm is selling off 3.6%, and Applied Materials is leading the sector lower with a 4% loss.
But another company entirely may be to blame for this sell-off: Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU).
So what
Yesterday Micron cited weakening market conditions as its reason for cutting DRAM and NAND computer memory production by approximately 20% in Q4, and warned these cuts ""will be made across all technology nodes where Micron has meaningful output.""
NAND memory produced will still be up year over year (YOY), but down sequentially. DRAM production will decline both YOY and sequentially as Micron positions its business to weather anticipated reduced demand in 2023 -- and shrinks its inventories accordingly. But what do Micron's problems have to do with Intel, Qualcomm, and Applied Materials? Why might these stocks be going down today in response to Micron's news?
As Reuters points out this morning, ""Micron was the first major chipmaker to sound an alarm about falling demand for PCs and smartphones earlier this year."" Because of this, investors appear to be making Micron into a sort of bellwether for tech stocks -- the proverbial canary in the coal mine. And if Micron just dropped dead, the worry is that other semiconductor makers (and in the case of Applied Materials, makers of equipment for making semiconductors) may soon also be gasping for air.
Now what
Now, the news isn't all bad. Turns out, just last night -- and importantly, after Micron posted its warning -- investment banker Credit Suisse released new stock ratings in which it recommended buying shares of Micron and Qualcomm, and several other chips stocks besides. According to The Fly, Applied Materials wasn't one of the stocks recommended, nor was Intel.
Interestingly, Credit Suisse cited Intel's need to play catch-up with other semiconductor companies, and the toll this will take on the company's free cash flow, as the primary reason it rated Intel stock only neutral and not outperform (like Micron and Qualcomm). And indeed, if we take a look at Intel's financials, we can see that currently, Intel looks like one of the weakest players in semiconductors, with trailing-12-month free cash flow of negative $13.3 billion.
In contrast, data from S&P Global Market Intelligence shows Qualcomm, Applied Materials, and Micron all still generating positive free cash flow -- $6.8 billion, $4.9 billion, and $3.1 billion, respectively, over the last 12 months.
Of these three, Qualcomm appears to offer investors the best valuation, with a 19.9 free-cash-flow multiple on its stock, a respectable 17% projected growth rate, and a 2.4% dividend yield to boot. If you're looking to take advantage of today's sell-off and buy into semiconductor stock weakness, I suspect Qualcomm stock is the best place to start looking for a bargain.
