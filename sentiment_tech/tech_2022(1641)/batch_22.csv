2022-08-09 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia Tumbles on Fiscal Q2 Revenue Warnings: ETFs in Focus,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-tumbles-on-fiscal-q2-revenue-warnings%3A-etfs-in-focus,,,"The graphics chipmaker Nvidia NVDA disappointed investors following the warning of lower second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues. The warning indicates the latest sign of slackening demand for computer chips.

Shares of NVDA tumbled 6.3% on the day, putting ETFs having the largest allocation to NVIDIA in focus. These include Pacer Data and Digital Revolution ETF TRFK, AI Powered Equity ETF AIEQ, MicroSectors FANG+ ETN FNGS, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH and Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ.

Nvidia slashed its revenue guidance to $6.70 billion for the fiscal second quarter from the previous forecast of $8.10 billion on weak gaming-chip sales. Notably, gaming revenues dropped 33% from the year-ago level and 44% from the prior quarter. The gaming industry, which is largely considered to be recession-proof, is started to weaken as consumers weigh purchases of discretionary items such as video-game consoles.

Nvidia cited weakening demand for its gaming processors by its channel partners and resellers, noting that the lower sales were likely the result of ""macroeconomic headwinds."" To counter these challenges, Nvidia ""implemented pricing programs,"" and noted that these challenging market conditions are expected to persist in the third quarter.

The move came after Intel Corp. INTC, Qualcomm QCOM and Sony Group forecast weak sales on demand concerns for personal computers and phones (read: Intel Misses Q2 Earnings Estimate, Cuts View: ETFs in Focus).

2022-08-08 00:00:00+00:00,"SPECIAL REPORT-As Russian missiles struck Ukraine, Western tech still flowed",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/special-report-as-russian-missiles-struck-ukraine-western-tech-still-flowed,,,"By David Gauthier-Villars, Steve Stecklow, Maurice Tamman, Stephen Grey and Andrew MacAskill
KYIV, Aug 8 (Reuters) - With the tip of a hunting knife, a senior Ukrainian security official removed 18 screws and lifted off the lid of a small black metal box. Inside were four sliding panels packed with scores of computer chips.
This was the electronic brain of an unexploded Russian 9M727 cruise missile — one of the devastating weapons Russia has used to strike Ukraine since it invaded the country on Feb. 24.
Russian troops have fired more than 3,650 missiles and guided rockets in the first five months of the war, according to Ukrainian authorities, destroying military targets as well as apartment buildings, shopping centers, and killing hundreds of civilians. On July 14, three cruise missiles struck the city of Vinnytsia, killing 27 people, including a four-year-old girl, Ukrainian authorities say. Russia says it only fires at military targets.
The black metal box, as well as other Russian weaponry shown to Reuters, were collected on the battlefield by Ukraine's military. They contain Russian electronics bearing Cyrillic markings, sometimes handwritten.
But many of the most important electronic components inside are microcontrollers, programmable chips and signal processors stamped with the names of American chip-makers, including Texas Instruments Inc; Altera, owned by Intel Corp; Xilinx, owned by Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD); and Maxim Integrated Products Inc, acquired last year by Analog Devices Inc. Chips made by Cypress Semiconductor, now owned by Germany's Infineon AG, were also visible.
""It's quite simple,"" said the senior Ukrainian official, who requested anonymity for security reasons. ""Without those U.S. chips, Russian missiles and most Russian weapons would not work.""
The Western components in the Russian weapons were examined as part of an investigation by Reuters in collaboration with the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a London-based defense think tank, and iStories, a Russia-focused investigative news site.
While some of the more sophisticated Western chips in the Russian weapons have been subject to special export licensing requirements for years, the investigation found that many of the armaments also contain run-of-the-mill computer chips and other components found in consumer products. These are easily obtainable and in many cases aren't subject to export restrictions.
After the invasion, the United States and other countries banned high-tech exports to Russia to try to cripple its defense industry and tech companies announced that they had halted all exports to Russia. Yet the reporting team found that the flow of Western brand-name computer parts to Russia hasn't stopped, with thousands of shipments since the invasion of Ukraine. The shippers were mainly unauthorized suppliers, but they also included some manufacturers.
Reuters provided to AMD, Analog Devices, Infineon, Intel and Texas Instruments data from Russian customs records on shipments of their products to Russia that arrived after the invasion.
Three of the manufacturers – AMD, Analog Devices and Infineon – said they had launched internal investigations after Reuters provided the customs data showing thousands of recent shipments of their products to Russia by third-party sellers. Infineon and Texas Instruments said products that they had shipped were already in transit at the time of the invasion. Intel said goods it shipped were internal company deliveries before it ceased its Russian operations in early April.
Asked about their chips' use in Russian weapons systems, the companies said they comply with export controls and trade sanctions. Infineon said it was ""deeply concerned should our products be used for purposes for which they were not designed."" Intel said it ""does not support or tolerate our products being used to violate human rights.""
Russia's reliance on Western electronics for its weapon systems has been known for years. Moscow has a long history of acquiring smuggled military-grade parts from the United States, including costly specialized chips for satellites that can withstand radiation in space. On the day of the invasion, the White House announced that the United States and its allies were imposing ""Russia-wide restrictions on semiconductors, telecommunication, encryption security, lasers, sensors, navigation, avionics and maritime technologies"" that it said would ""cut off Russia's access to cutting edge technology."" Many non-military tech products, however, remain exempt.
Russia characterizes the conflict as a special military operation meant to disarm Ukraine. Moscow has cast the sanctions as a hostile act and has denied targeting civilians.
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Commerce, which administers export restrictions, said, ""The powerful export controls put in place by the U.S. and 37 allies and partners are severely impacting Russia's access to items and technologies it needs to sustain its military aggression, including semiconductors. As time goes on and their stockpiles continue to diminish, our controls will bite even harder.""
""We will remain vigilant and engaged with our allies and partners in enforcing our controls,"" he said.
MICROWAVE-OVEN CHIPS
The onboard computer system inside the cruise missile's black metal box shows that Russia doesn't just rely on state-of-the-art technology for its precision weaponry. For example, stamps on two of the Texas Instruments chips – which process digital signals – showed they were manufactured more than 30 years ago.
""For the most part, it's the same chips that you find in your car or your microwave,"" said a Ukrainian weapons expert with access to recovered Russian military gear.
Gehan Amaratunga, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Cambridge, reviewed a list of more than 600 Western components compiled by RUSI and Reuters that were found in Russian weapons and military systems recovered in Ukraine. ""They are mostly standard products which are dated and can be found in many industrial electronic systems,"" he said. ""As such, they are not specialist military specification products.""
Still, he added, ""it is the reality that all standard integrated circuits can be used for both civilian and military purposes.""
Despite what the West has described as an unprecedented series of strict sanctions against Russia, many commodity electronic components still aren't subject to export controls. And even if they are, there's a global galaxy of suppliers and traders in East Asia and other countries that are willing to ship them and are often beyond the control of Western manufacturers.
A review by Reuters of Russian customs records identified more than 15,000 shipments of Western electronic components that reached Russia after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine through the end of May. The manufacturers included AMD, Analog Devices, Infineon, Intel and Texas Instruments.
The parts included microprocessors, programmable chips, storage devices and other items, according to the Russian customs data.
Russia itself has made no secret of its desire to continue the flow of imported Western tech products. In June, President Vladimir Putin signed a law to permit Russian companies to import electrical goods and their components without the patent owners' permission.
One Moscow-based computer retailer, Kvantech, now proclaims at the top of its website in Russian: ""Attention! We are working normally. Our warehouses are ready to supply equipment to customers from the Russian Federation despite EU and U.S. sanctions.""
The U.S. Department of Commerce declined to comment. The EU didn't respond to a request for comment.
The Russian website features the logos of more than a half-dozen top U.S. technology companies. Asked how Kvantech manages to continue procuring Western computer equipment, a company official who gave his name only as Viktor said it was ""a commercial secret.""
Reuters obtained the Russian customs records from three commercial providers, including one that had 2022 data. To verify the most recent data, the news agency cross-checked a sample of that provider's earlier records – including the date, buyer, seller, international product code and other information – with the two other sources and found that they matched.
Andre Tauber, a spokesman for Infineon, said the German company had launched an internal investigation based on Reuters findings, which identified more than 450 shipments to Russia between Feb. 25 and May 30 of products made by Infineon-owned Cypress Semiconductor. Reuters also found nearly 2,500 shipments of Infineon products that arrived in Russia after the invasion.
""We are in the process of reviewing and verifying the information you provided and will take appropriate actions as needed,"" Tauber said. ""Infineon takes this matter very seriously.""
He added that ""Infineon instructed all distribution partners globally to prevent deliveries of Infineon products or services contrary to the sanctions and their spirit."" He said, ""Compliance with applicable laws is of utmost importance for Infineon, and we have established robust policies and processes to comply with these laws. It proves difficult to control ongoing sales throughout the entire supply chain.""
A spokesperson for AMD said the firm is investigating Russian customs data shared by Reuters showing that between March 2 and May 31, there were about 200 shipments of AMD components and nearly 700 shipments of Xilinx components to Russia.
""The information shared is concerning,"" a spokesperson said. While the company has ""not seen any diversion of AMD products into Russia … AMD takes these matters very seriously and we have commenced a thorough review of the data to identify potential issues.""
Reuters shared with Analog Devices Russian customs data showing that since the invasion, there have been more than 7,700 shipments to Russia of its components through the end of May. There have also been nearly 900 shipments of parts made by Maxim Integrated, which Analog Devices owns, the data showed.
A spokesman for Analog Devices said, ""Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and in compliance with U.S. and EU sanctions, Analog Devices ceased business activities in Russia and promptly instructed all of its distributors to halt shipments of our products into Russia.""
The spokesman added, ""We take this seriously and are investigating the veracity of the"" Russian customs data ""and whether any of our distributors violated our express instructions. Any post-sanctions shipment to Russia would be in direct violation of ADI's express instructions.""
A spokeswoman for Texas Instruments said it had conducted ""an in-depth review"" and found that 36 shipments by the company and six by one of its authorized distributors that arrived in Russia in late February and early March ""were in transit before the invasion began."" Reuters found nearly 1,300 additional shipments of Texas Instruments parts to Russia by third-party sellers.
""We stand behind our earlier statement that we are not selling into Russia … and comply with applicable laws and regulations in the countries where we operate,"" the spokeswoman said.
Asked about more than 80 shipments of Intel products that arrived in Russia in March, a spokesman for Intel said, ""In certain cases, these are internal Intel shipments to our offices in Russia, which supported software development work until our cessation of operations on April 5th.""
In addition, more than 1,300 shipments of Intel components and 800 shipments of Altera parts from other companies ""in most cases … appear to be shipments from third-party suppliers who may have obtained their inventory from various sources,"" he said.
""Intel has a clear policy that our distributors and customers must comply with all export requirements and local and international laws,"" the spokesman said.
BACK DOORS
Russia relies on Western technology for some of its weapons systems because it doesn't produce many of the required electronics parts itself. But Russian defense companies don't just use any available components. Even the most ordinary chips must pass through a strict bureaucratic procurement process designed to test and certify them and make sure they don't contain ""back doors"" that could enable Western spying or sabotage.
The use of foreign-made chips in U.S. military equipment is a top concern in Washington as well, ""because there can be vulnerabilities that are manufactured into them,"" said Ian Williams, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""The Russians are very aware of this, too.""
In a measure of how seriously Russian authorities view infiltration risks, a Ukrainian expert with access to Russian weapons showed Reuters photographs of three small holographic stickers bearing the sword-and-shield logo of Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, its main intelligence agency.
The stickers appeared on electronic components recovered from Russian missiles, combat helicopters and fighter aircraft, the expert said. The FSB didn't respond to a message seeking comment.
To prevent compromised components from making their way into Russian weapons, the Kremlin relies on a scientific institute located near Moscow. Recently renamed the All-Russian Research Institute of Radio Electronics, the body acts as a central certifier of all electronic parts used by the defense industry, including manufacturing, as well as repairs, upgrades and even experiments, said two people familiar with the process.
The institute's central role was bolstered last year when Putin issued a decree elevating it to the rank of strategic enterprise. The institute cooperates with a large network of labs and certification centers to fulfill its task of cataloging, testing and validating tens of thousands of components.
The master list of authorized domestic and imported electronic components curated by the institute can be accessed online by accredited Russian companies. In addition, research and production companies from Russia's defense industry can submit lists of electronic parts they wish to use for a new project, and the institute tries to make sure they don't include any unauthorized components.
One of the institute's mandates is to encourage Russian manufacturers to use domestically produced electronics, if possible.
But an institute document seen by Reuters suggests that many Western components have no Russian equivalents. In 2017, the institute reviewed a proposed helicopter-mounted radio-jamming station – designed to disrupt enemy communications – and determined that of the 921 foreign components the design called for, only 242 could be procured at the time from Russian manufacturers, the document showed. The Kremlin and the institute didn't respond to messages seeking comment.
DEFENSE TIES
Reuters was unable to trace how specific Western chips found inside Russian weapons in Ukraine got there.
However, a review of the Russian customs records shows that some of the same parts were shipped before the invasion by third-party suppliers to several Russian military companies or to other firms with links to the defense industry.
Among the importers named on the customs records as having received some of the same types of Western chips found in Russian weapons are AO VOMZ, AO NPK Uralvagonzavod and AO Radiopriborsnab. According to Russian corporate records, Rostec – a state-owned defense giant – has an indirect ownership stake in all three companies.
In June, the U.S. Department of the Treasury called Rostec ""the cornerstone of Russia's defense, industrial, technology, and manufacturing sectors."" It is headed by Sergey Chemezov, a former intelligence officer who once worked with Putin in the KGB.
Rostec and Chemezov have been targeted with sanctions by Washington, the European Union and other countries. Rostec and Chemezov did not respond to a request for comment.
Radiopriborsnab describes itself on its website as a supplier of electronic components. According to Russian customs records, it has imported Altera and Xilinx chips, the same kind found in Russian radio and electronic-warfare equipment recovered in Ukraine.
Another five Russian importers have participated in tenders to supply Russian weapons manufacturers, according to data from Goszakupki, Russia's official public procurement platform.
Two of those five importers – OOO Trade-Component and AO GK Radiant – were sanctioned last year by the U.S. government, which accused them of trying to import American components ""likely"" for use in Russian military programs.
The Russian importers didn't respond to requests for comment.
Russia has become adept at converting consumer-grade chips for military use. For example, Western weapons manufacturers often rely on special military-grade versions of chips to ensure they can withstand very high temperatures. Since such chips are subject to export controls and harder to procure, Russian weapons companies have found alternatives, according to one of three Ukrainian weapons experts interviewed by Reuters.
Holding the rugged black metal box containing a missile's on-board computer, the expert pointed to a heat sink designed to cool the electronic components inside, as well as a thick insulation seal.
""In Russia, they take the consumer version and put some protection around it,"" he said.
That doesn't mean Russian weaponry is outdated, another Ukrainian expert said, noting that the designs of many Russian weapons feature pioneering concepts. Examining the innards of a Russian cruise missile, he found what he said was true technological prowess: a satellite-navigation antenna engraved on a piece of ceramic the size of a postage stamp.
""This is quite something,"" the expert said. ""A lot of people would be interested in seeing this, even the Americans.""
FLEXIBILITY
Among the Western electronics found in Russian weapons, one particular type of integrated circuit stands out, according to Western microelectronics experts: programmable chips, known as Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs.
One FPGA – a shiny black Altera Cyclone II chip – was mounted between the gyroscopes of a navigation system recovered in Ukraine from a Russian precision-artillery rocket known as a 9M544.
The programmable chips, which have been available for decades, give electronic-equipment manufacturers enormous flexibility because they quickly can be reprogrammed to perform whatever new task is necessary, said Daniel Nenni, a veteran semiconductor professional and co-author of a book on FPGAs.
This is particularly useful for weapons manufacturers whose products require upgrades and modifications through their typically long life cycles, Nenni said.
At a time when many industries are starved for chips because of global supply-chain shortages, another advantage of FPGAs is that they can be recycled.
""The key about the FPGAs is that you can reuse them,"" Nenni said. ""You can buy a washing machine, take an FPGA out and put it in a missile. It's that simple because you can reprogram it to do whatever you want.""

The Dow, which had been +300 points earlier today, closed +28 points - +0.09%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were -0.12% and -0.10%, respectively, while the small-cap Russell 2000 easily outpaced the rest of the pack: +1.17%.

The Russell is also the biggest gainer of the four major indices over the past month, with a very strong +12.2% versus the Nasdaq’s +11.2%, the S&P’s +7.4% and the Dow +5.3%. The small-cap index is still down year to date -14.6%, but that’s still better than the Nasdaq, which is still fighting its way out of bear-market territory, -20% from the first of the year. The Dow blue-chips are outperforming the field year to date, but still -10.3%.

Because NVIDIA is rightly seen as an important player in the world of semiconductors in the present and in the future, the company’s lowered guidance today carried a lot of weight in the early trading hours. We had seen a lower guide from competitor AMD AMD just last week, as well as disappointing earnings results from semi majors Intel INTC and Micron MU. As such, even with a slash to Q2 revenue and Gaming expectations, NVIDIA’s stock has “only” fallen -6.3% on the day.

Because slash guidance the company did: NVIDIA now expects Q2 sales coming in at $6.7 billion — well beneath the $8.1 billion the company initially guided, which also happens to be the Zacks consensus until downward revisions work their way through the system. Gaming is expected to come down -33% to $2.04 billion. NVIDIA reports earnings August 24th — three weeks from Wednesday. We’ve expected lower guides from top companies in most industries virtually all quarter.

Speaking of Gaming, Take-Two Interactive TTWO missed fiscal Q1 expectations on both top and bottom lines in the quarter, reported after Monday’s close: earnings of 71 cents per share was notably light of the 84 cents expected, while revenues of $1.00 billion was just shy of the $1.04 billion in the Zacks consensus. This marks the Grand Theft Auto and NBA2K creator’s second earnings miss in the past five years, and shares are down nearly -7% in late trading, -29.7% year to date.

But unlike Intel, Nvidia's date center segment did grow 61% year over year (YOY).
The gaming segment fell 33% YOY and is down 44% quarter over quarter.
Nvidia will discuss its financial results and outlook on an Aug. 24 earnings call.
It seems like even a company like Nvidia is not immune to tough macro conditions.

2022-08-07 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Rose More Than 19% in July,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-rose-more-than-19-in-july,,,"What happened
Shares of semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) rose 19.8% in July, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Investors had few reasons for optimism at the start of July, with Nvidia tumbling 15.3% in the first week. The stock continued to fall two weeks into the month as analysts reduced its target price and prepared for disappointing quarterly results in mid-August. However, the stock began to soar on July 15, as drafted legislation concerning semiconductor production picked up steam.
So what
At the start of July, fellow chip company Micron Technology released quarterly predictions 45% lower than Wall Street's expectations. The company's stock subsequently fell 6%, with a domino effect leading Nvidia stock to fall 3.3%.
As a result, multiple analysts cut their price target for Nvidia stock. Bank of America's Vivek Arya cut the target price from $270 to $220 while continuing to recommend the stock as a buy. Then on July 8, Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Finacial Partners retained his buy recommendation while lowering his price target from $410 per share to $310. Analysts mainly cited reduced consumer spending from economic concerns and a decline in the crypto market for their reduced target prices.
However, Nvidia stock rallied 2.2% on July 15 when, as reported by Business Insider, ""Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, exercised millions of dollars in Nvidia call options."" The move came ahead of the Chips Act bill drafted in the Senate, which would provide $52 billion in subsidies to bolster American semiconductor manufacturing.
News of the bill continued to boost Nvidia stock for the rest of the month, with shares popping 16% from July 15 to July 20. Although Nvidia will not directly benefit from the Chips Act, as it is a designer and not a manufacturer, the company's CEO, Jensen Huang, has discussed the possibility of partnering with companies like Intel to mitigate supply chain disruptions. The move would help safeguard the business and put Nvidia in a close relationship with a company that would definitely benefit from the expected legislation.
Now what
July was a roller coaster for Nividia, as analysts attempted to predict how the company will fare in its coming earnings report. The stock fell 4.1% on July 22, as investors realized the Chips Act wouldn't boost the company as much as previously hoped.
Conversely, Nvidia's prior earnings could signify a better quarterly report than analysts would have you believe. The company's 2023 first quarter ended on May 1, with Nvidia reporting a 46% rise in revenue, up a record $8.29 billion from the quarter before. In addition, the company is gearing up for its Sept. 19-22 GPU Technology Conference, where the next generation of high-end graphics cards is expected to be announced. The highly anticipated and long-awaited products could increase demand, providing a boost for Nvidia.

2022-08-05 00:00:00+00:00,3 Reasons Why Lam Research Is a Great Long-Term Investment,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-why-lam-research-is-a-great-long-term-investment,,,"Demand from chipmakers for Lam Research's (NASDAQ: LRCX) tools drove its stock price to all-time highs by mid-January 2022. However, the stock has underperformed since reaching those highs amid labor shortages, COVID-19-related supply chain constraints, industrywide shortages, and rising logistics costs. Moreover, now that it looks like a recession is increasingly likely, some investors wonder whether they should avoid this company, since demand for its products could rapidly deteriorate.
Here are three reasons Lam looks like an excellent long-term investment at today's prices.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Demand for semiconductors drives Lam's results
Lam is a wafer fab equipment (WFE) manufacturer, building the machines that manufacture semiconductors. Its main customers are companies like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), and SK Hynix, to name a few.
We live in an age of accelerating innovation, and many of the newest technologies in highest demand rely on smaller and better chips, which semiconductor manufacturers can only make with Lam's advanced tools. Fortunately for Lam, its devices have few alternatives and are in high demand.
What drives that demand? According to global research firm McKinsey, three industries will drive 70% of semiconductor's future growth: automotive, computation and data storage, and wireless. As the end demand for advanced chips from those industries rises, semiconductor companies will need more of Lam's tools to build those chips -- driving its revenues and earnings higher.
2. Lam is a market leader
Since its founding in 1981, Lam has elevated itself to owning some of the market's most advanced and popular chipmaking tools. For example, its tools have cumulatively processed over 40 million more wafers than its nearest competition -- demonstrating its technological superiority. And in addition to leading its competitors in key areas, Lam has an installed base of over 75,000 systems -- a substantial competitive advantage for three reasons.
First, once a chip manufacturer decides to buy, Lam works closely with the customer to tailor its tools to the customer's chipmaking process flow. From this, it gains valuable insights on how to improve its devices.
Second, once a customer installs Lam's tools into their chipmaking process, the cost becomes prohibitive to switch to a competitor's solution.
Third, Lam has scale advantages, meaning it can use its size in the industry to negotiate the purchase of raw materials, products, and logistical services at a lower price per unit than many smaller competitors.
3. Lam makes significant improvements
Two particularly nasty problems left in the wake of the pandemic are supply chain disruptions and inflation -- complications that you can see hit Lam's gross margins in the March quarter, along with a the margins of few other WFE manufacturers.
LRCX Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts
In the June quarter, the company continued to have problems managing costs in freight and logistics, semiconductors, and other critical components for manufacturing WFE tools. Management expects inflation and supply chain disruptions to persist to at least the end of 2022, so investors shouldn't expect massive improvements in gross margin this year.
However, expect improvement over the long term. Management has devoted significant resources to making the company more resistant to economic shocks. For instance, Lam has recently focused on cutting logistics costs by moving company resources closer to its suppliers and customers in the U.S. and globally. These recent supply chain improvements are one reason that despite inflationary and supply chain disruptions, Lam just concluded its second consecutive fiscal year of record revenue and diluted earnings per share (Lam's fiscal year ended on June 27).

Eventually, recent improvements will show up in improved gross margins and operational efficiencies. And the company should emerge from this period of economic disruption as a far more robust and resilient company.
Lam is selling at a fantastic valuation
As I write this, the market values Lam at a PEG ratio of 0.62, and most investors consider any company with a PEG ratio under 1.0 undervalued. Therefore, the market may have already priced in the possibility of a mild to moderate recession. And if you are an investor able to withstand some short-term market gyrations, you should consider picking up a few shares of this high-quality company today.

2022-08-05 00:00:00+00:00,What AMD's Earnings Report Says About Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-amds-earnings-report-says-about-intel,,,"Investors had been anxiously awaiting the second-quarter earnings report from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) earlier this week, especially after a report from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) last week showed it had missed revenue and earnings estimates by a wide margin.
But AMD said it beat analyst estimates for revenue and earnings when it reported on Aug. 2. That strongly indicates Intel's challenges are more internal than a reflection of all semiconductor stocks.
Based on AMD's report investors are now wondering whether AMD will take a permanent lead over Intel or if there's still hope for an Intel comeback?
AMD's earnings and Intel
Despite the stock price dropping in next-day trading, AMD's Q2 earnings report actually indicated mostly good news. Revenue of $6.55 billion increased 70% year over year and beat consensus estimates of $6.53 billion. It also outperformed Intel, whose revenue dropped by 22% over the same period.
Moreover, AMD's non-GAAP income of $1.71 billion, or $1.05 per share, exceeded estimates of $1.03 per share. But while non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) income increased 119% from 12 months ago, GAAP income fell 37% to $447 million. Considerable increases in research and development, and marketing, general, and administrative expenses weighed on GAAP earnings. Also, amortization of intangibles related to its acquisitions further reduced GAAP income.
In Intel's defense, AMD confirmed sector-related weakness in PC sales and gaming. However, AMD reported an 83% revenue increase in data center revenue year over year. This stands in contrast to Intel's 16% revenue decline in its data center and artificial intelligence (AI) group for the same time frame.
Additionally, AMD forecasts a 60% revenue increase for 2022. With Intel predicting an 11% revenue decline for 2022 at the midpoint, AMD appears poised to continue making gains on its longtime rival.
The ongoing competition
Worse for Intel, AMD said on its Q2 2022 earnings call that it will begin selling 5-nanometer (nm) processors in Q2. Soon after Pat Gelsinger became Intel CEO in 2021, he set Intel a goal of catching up to its peers technologically by 2024 and achieving industry leadership in 2025. He reiterated that goal on the Q2 earnings call.
However, Intel currently produces 10-nm chips and has not yet released its upcoming 7-nm chip. That places it far behind AMD, which has sold 7-nm chips since 2019. Given Intel's performance, it is little wonder Intel's stock is roughly flat over the last five years, while AMD stock logged massive gains.
AMD data by YCharts.
Still, Intel could recover eventually. The day it released its disappointing earnings report, the CHIPS Act passed Congress. With its numerous foundries in the U.S., Intel should gain a considerable subsidy from this legislation. The legislation will not directly help AMD as the company outsources all production to partner semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing or GlobalFoundries. Also, with Intel planning to enter the fab business through Intel Foundry Services, it will likely add an additional source of revenue.
Still, fabs take years to build, and Intel's bid to catch up technologically is a three-to-five-year process. This means that Intel will likely remain behind AMD technologically for a long time to come, even if its ambitious plans succeed.
AMD vs. Intel
Intel's Q2 earnings report does not spell permanent doom, but the current earnings report indicates any comeback is a long way off, assuming it occurs at all. With AMD firing on all cylinders and Intel not yet showing results, AMD should lead this competition for the foreseeable future.
Admittedly, Intel has steadily improved its technology, and entering the foundry business should eventually pay off for the chipmaker. But until Intel's plans begin to produce results, investors should consider staying with AMD.

2022-08-04 00:00:00+00:00,Facebook parent Meta makes first-ever bond offering,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/facebook-parent-meta-makes-first-ever-bond-offering,,,"By Nivedita Balu and Shankar Ramakrishnan
Aug 4 (Reuters) - Facebook-parent Meta Platforms META.O said on Thursday it would make its first-ever bond offering, at a time when the social media company is making massive investments to fund its virtual reality projects.
Meta did not disclose the size of the offering but said it would use the proceeds for capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions or investments.
The company received an 'A1' rating from Moody's and an 'AA- rating' and a 'stable' outlook from S&P. Meta is selling four tranches of bonds with maturities ranging from five years to 40 years.
Among big technology companies, Meta is the only one that does not have any debt on its books. Tapping the market now would give it more financial room as it tries to fund some expensive overhauls, including a bet on augmented and virtual reality technology, investors who heard its presentation for the bond offering on Tuesday said.
It might also be a rare opportunity to do so relatively cheaply in the current market environment. Corporate bonds have rebounded in the past month after a rout earlier this year, as investors hoped the U.S. Federal Reserve's fight against inflation through rapid rate increases was starting to have some impact.
This week the U.S. investment grade primary bond markets have rebounded, with companies raising more than $38 billion, making it the eighth busiest week of the year, according to Informa Global Markets data.
Other tech giants such as Apple Inc AAPL.O and Intel Corp INTC.O also issued bonds earlier this week, raising $5.5 billion and $6 billion, respectively.
Bankers and investors said such issuance windows may be rare in coming months. One banker in charge of a bond syndicate desk at a U.S. bank said credit spreads could widen later this year, increasing funding costs.
Meta's bond issuance will come after the company issued a gloomy forecast and recorded its first-ever quarterly drop in revenue, with recession fears and competitive pressures weighing on its digital ads sales.
Its free-cash flow has been depleting as it charges ahead with its metaverse plans, which led the change in its name to Meta Platforms from Facebook last year.
In the second quarter ended June 30, Meta had $4.45 billion in free cash flow, compared with $8.51 billion a year ago and $8.53 billion in the prior quarter.
Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner said on a post-earnings conference call that company had a ""substantial amount"" in its buyback program and expects to continue with buybacks as part of its capital allocation strategy.

Chicago, IL – August 4, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Camping World Holding CWH as the Bull of the Day and Intel INTC as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Shaols Technologies SHLS, Gevo GEVO and Enovix Corporation ENVX.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
Bull of the Day:
Camping World Holding is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that is a provider of services, protection plans, products and resources for recreational vehicle enthusiasts. 
The stock was hot during the pandemic, as people yearned to get outdoors. One way of doing that was camping, which brought people into Camping Worlds all over the country.  
The stock topped out in early 2021, coming up just shy of $50 a share. Since then, the stock has lost over 50% of its value, falling to a 2020 low below the $21 level.  
But after a solid earnings report, investors are jumping back into the stock. CWH has now moved almost 50% off its June lows, so the question is how much is left in the tank for this stock.
More about Camping World
The company was founded in 1966 and is headquartered in Lincolnshire, Illinois. The company employs over 12,000 people and has a market cap of $1.3 billion. The stock pays a healthy dividend of over 9%.
he company's brands consist of Camping World and Good Sam. It offers new and used RVs for sale, vehicle service and maintenance through retail locations and membership clubs.
The stock has a Zacks Style Score of “B” in Value and Momentum, but “F” in Growth. The growth issue has been a problem for investors, but after the recent big earnings beat, that could be changing.
Q2 Earnings Beat
On August 2nd, Camping World reported earnings, seeing a 15% EPS beat. Q2 came in at $2.16 v the $1.87 expected. Revenue was higher, coming in at $2.17B v the $2.03 expected.  EBITDA margin came in at 12.8% v last year’s 16.2%, while same store revenue was up 0.1% year over year.
Management had the following comments on the call:
“We are pleased with the sale of almost 39,000 new and used RVs which contributed to record revenues for the second quarter. We believe our team has both the focus and experience to navigate our business through changes in market conditions as evidenced by our solid financial results.”
The quarter, with its record revenues, impressed investors who bought the stock higher by over 15%.
Estimates To Rise
Because earnings just came out, the Zacks Consensus estimate has yet to reflect what analysts are doing after EPS. These numbers are something to keep any eye on to see if analysts agree with investors on this bullish sentiment.
There are some analysts already out with commentary. Raymond James commented that robust average selling prices are offsetting volume declines and margin pressures.
Additionally, inventory is stabilizing and because margins were not as bad as feared, the company should benefit substantially when the environment normalizes.  
Truist was also impressed with the beat, saying that the numbers imply a market share gain during the quarter.
Investors should expect more positive commentary from analysts and look for those estimates to trend higher.
The Technical Take
The stock was struggling all year until June, when it finally traded above the 50-day MA. Form there, it chopped around until earnings.
The big pop in shares after earnings took the stock right to the 200-day moving average just under $32. Investors can expect some selling at these levels and then look to buy any pullbacks.
Some levels of interest for investors eyeballing a pullback:
The $28 level is the pre-earnings gap higher.
$25.50 is the is the 21-day Moving average, while $25.00 is the 50-day moving average.
In Summary
It has been a rough ride for those investors that were camped out in Camping World. After a year of pain seeing the stock bleed lower, there is now some hope as the stock showed the company is fighting off the current inflationary atmosphere.
Investors should eyeball pullbacks in the stock and look for opportunities as the stock starts a fresh bullish trend higher.
Bear of the Day:
Intel is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that engages in the design, manufacture, and sale of computer products and technologies worldwide.
The stock has come under hard times as loss of market share and an earnings miss has brought INTC to five-year lows. Now investors are struggling with the idea if lower prices as the Intel's peers see relief.
About the Company
Intel is headquartered in Santa Clara, CA. The company was founded in 1968 and employs over 120,000.
Intel offers platform products, such as central processing units and chipsets, and system-on-chip and multichip packages; and non-platform or adjacent products, including accelerators, boards and systems, connectivity products, graphics, and memory and storage products.
INTC is valued at $148 billion and has a Forward PE of 15. The company holds a Zacks Style Score of “C” in Value, but “F” in Growth. The stock pays out a dividend of 4%.
Q1 Earnings
The company reported EPS in late July, seeing a miss of 58%. This was the first miss since 2014, so investors were not happy with the quarter and sold the stock to new 2022 lows.
Looking at the quarter, Q2 came in at $29 cents v the $0.69 cents expected. Revenues were a big miss, with Intel reporting $15.3B vs the 17.9B expected.
To make matters worse, the company slashed their outlook.
The Q3 guide came in at $0.35 v the $0.90 expected. Revenues are seen at $15.16B v the $18.9B previous.
Intel also cut their FY22 outlook to $2.30 v the previous $3.46. With that, the company cut Capex.
Margins were an issue, coming in at 44.8% v the 59.8% last year. The Client Computing group was down 25% y/y, while Data Center Group was off 16%.
Intel management said “The sudden and rapid decline in economic activity was the largest driver, but the shortfall also reflects our own execution issues”.
Estimates
With the big miss on earnings and the big cut in the outlook, estimates for Intel are dropping rather quickly.
Over the last seven days, we have seen numbers go down across the board. For the current quarter, estimates have fallen from $0.90 to $0.40, or 55%. For the current year, they have fallen from $3.43 to $2.36, or 31%.
This drastic drop in earnings estimates is forcing analysts to drop price targets as well. After earnings, Wedbush dropped their targets from $44 to $35. Morgan Stanley also cut had a similar cut, dropping from $46 to $36
Technical Take
Looking at the chart, there isn’t much to like. The stock is now trading at the 2017 spot where it sat before it broke out. There is a good chance that the stock is dead money until there is a proven turn around in the fundamentals.
The $35 area could hold up if the market can rally. But if we get some more weakness, look out for the support levels at $30.50, $28 and even $20.
In Summary
There are other tech and semiconductor names that are performing well as the market starts to rally off 2022 lows. After the current earnings report, investors should shift their focus elsewhere.

3 Clean Energy Stocks Set to Beat Q2 Earnings Estimates
A handful of clean energy stocks, particularly solar and alternative energy companies, which are part of the broader Oil-Energy sector, are yet to release their Q2 numbers. Notably, the results of these companies are expected to reflect solid installation activities, driven by the economic recovery in recent times that has been boosting demand.
Amid this backdrop, we expect clean energy stocks like Shaols Technologies, Gevo and Enovix Corporation to report favorable Q2 results.
What to Expect from Clean Energy Stocks’ Q2 Results?
Factors like rapidly increasing corporate investments in renewables, favorable government policies such as extended federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for offshore wind energy, the extension of production tax credit along with the declining price of raw materials like wind turbines and solar modules are likely to have contributed to clean energy stocks’ quarterly performance.
Moreover, thanks to the economic recovery observed over the past few quarters, there has been an upward trend in installation activities for clean energy stocks, a trend expected to have driven demand in the second quarter of 2022 as well.
Evidently, shipments of solar batteries as well as microinverters of Enphase Energy (ENPH) , a prominent solar stock, observed a solid year-over-year surge in the United States during the second quarter. Such solid shipments boosted the Enphase’s Q2 revenues significantly, a trend expected to be reflected in the results of other clean energy stocks as well.
On the other hand, as stated by the American Clean Power Association (ACPA), wind is currently the largest source of renewable electricity generation in the United States, providing almost 9.8% of the country’s electricity. So, no doubt clean energy stocks focused on wind energy must have also performed well in Q2.
Also, growing interest in hydrogen as an alternative transportation fuel owing to its ability to power fuel cells in zero-emission vehicles has been driving revenues and earnings of clean energy stocks. Hence, both the earnings and revenue Q2 projections for the broader market indicate a decent improvement from the second-quarter 2021 scorecard.
However, higher logistics costs and component costs as a result of global supply chain pricing pressure may have continued to partially impact the overall performance of the clean energy companies.
Q2 Projections
Per the latest Earnings Preview, second-quarter earnings of the Oil-Energy sector are expected to improve a solid 231.7% on 47.3% sales surge.
Zacks Methodology
Given the high degree of diversity in the clean energy space, finding the right stocks with the potential to beat estimates might be quite a daunting task.
However, our proprietary Zacks methodology makes this fairly simple.
We are focusing on stocks that have the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chances of an earnings surprise are as high as 70%.
Earnings ESP provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.
Our Choices
Here we present three stocks that are expected to beat earnings estimates in this reporting cycle.
Shaols Technologies: It manufactures a diverse portfolio of solar balance-of-systems products, including combiner/re-combiner boxes, disconnect boxes, custom harnessing solutions, junction boxes, wire, in-line fuses and racking and monitoring solutions. During the second quarter, Shaols increased the size of its existing revolving credit facility by $50 million to $150 million, which in turn reflects its solid financial position.
The company, with an Earnings ESP of +4.26% and a Zacks Rank #3, is slated to release earnings on Aug 15. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SHLS’ Q2 sales implies an improvement of 23.4% from the prior year quarter figure.
Gevo: It is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company engaged in the development of biobased alternatives to petroleum-based products using a combination of synthetic biology and chemistry. During the second quarter, Gevo announced that its renewable natural gas project in Northwest Iowa has been producing biogas and upgrading and injecting RNG into the natural gas pipeline. This is likely to have boosted its Q2 revenues.
The company, with an Earnings ESP of +25.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 is slated to release earnings on Aug 8. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GEVO’s Q2 sales suggests an improvement of 44.1% from the prior-year quarter figure.  The consensus estimate for the bottom line also indicates an increase.
Enovix: It is involved in the design and manufacture of 3D Silicon Lithium-ion batteries. During the second quarter, Enovix announced that it had started shipping its first commercial battery cells for revenues, which in turn is expected to have boosted its Q2 performance.
The company, with an Earnings ESP of +6.67% and a Zacks Rank #3, is slated to release earnings on Aug 10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ENVX’s Q2 bottom line indicates a solid improvement when compared with the prior-year quarter figure.

2022-08-04 00:00:00+00:00,"EXCLUSIVE-Italy, Intel close to $5 bln deal for chip factory - sources",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-italy-intel-close-to-%245-bln-deal-for-chip-factory-sources,,,"By Giuseppe Fonte and Giulio Piovaccari
ROME, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Italy is close to clinching a deal initially worth $5 billion with Intel INTC.O to build an advanced semiconductor packaging and assembly plant in the country, two sources briefed on discussions told Reuters on Thursday.
Intel's investment in Italy is part of a wider plan announced by the U.S. chipmaker earlier this year to invest $88 billion in building capacity across Europe, which is striving to cut its reliance on Asian chip imports and ease a supply crunch that has curbed output in the region's strategic car sector.
Asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, the sources said the government of outgoing Prime Minister Mario Draghi was working to have an agreement in place by the end of August, ahead of a snap national election scheduled on Sept. 25.
Sources have previously told Reuters that Rome is ready to fund as much as 40% of Intel's total investment in Italy, which is expected to rise over time from the initial $5 billion.
Draghi's office and Intel both declined to comment.
The factory would use new technologies to weave together full chips out of tiles.
Intel and the government have shortlisted possible sites in two Italian regions, the sources said, with one of them adding they are located in the northern regions of Piedmont and Veneto.
A final decision on where to build the facility is yet to be made, both the sources said. The Lombardy, Apulia and Sicily regions had also been considered initially.
The total size of Intel's investment and how Italy plans to fund its share of it is not yet clear.
Under the so-called Chips Act aimed at funding innovative semiconductor facilities, the European Commission early this year said it had made available 15 billion euros in additional public and private investment by 2030. This is on top of 30 billion euros of public investments already planned from NextGenerationEU, Horizon Europe and national budgets.
Rome so far has set aside 4.15 billion euros until 2030 to attract chipmakers and invest in new industrial applications of innovative technologies.
The government is also in talks with French-Italian STMicroelectronics STM.PA, Taiwan chipmakers MEMC Electronic Materials Inc and TSMC 2330.TW, and Israeli Tower Semiconductor TSEM.TA, which Intel bought earlier this year.
STMicroelectronics last month signed a pact with GlobalFoundries to build a $5.7 billion chip factory in France.

2022-08-04 00:00:00+00:00,My Favorite Semiconductor Stock Is One You May Not Know About,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/my-favorite-semiconductor-stock-is-one-you-may-not-know-about,,,"We use analog semiconductors, or chips, every day, even when we aren't aware of it. If you drove a car today, you probably used several analog chips. Watch TV on a flat-screen device? It had analog chips. From advanced medical systems like robotic-assisted surgical systems and CT scanners to home thermostats, analog chips bridge real-world data with many electronic and digital devices.
It's this presence in so many of today's devices and the booming demand for these chips to be added to other devices that has Analog Devices' (NASDAQ: ADI) management seeing growth accelerating to 7% to 10% compounded annually for the next several years.
Analog Devices generates plenty of passive income
Analog Devices' products are popular and that has been good for the company's bottom line. The company's free cash flow leaped by 30% in fiscal 2021 from $1.8 billion to $2.4 billion (see chart below) and this could be the start of a secular trend.
Data source: Analog Devices 2022 Investor Day report. Chart by author.
Another recent event should also contribute to a growing bottom line. Congress has just passed the Chips and Science (CHIPS) Act, which will provide $52 billion in incentives to semiconductor producers to boost manufacturing in the U.S. Any of this money that makes its way to Analog Devices will increase free cash flow and ultimately flow to shareholders.
All that free cash flow has helped Analog Devices raise its dividend annually since 2004. It paid $0.04 per share that year and is on pace to pay $3.04 per share in 2022. The dividend has gone from $0.48 per quarter in 2018 to its current $0.76, an impressive 12% compound annual growth rate. The company forecasts a free cash flow margin of 34% to 40% on its growing revenue stream, which is terrific news for shareholders. And Analog Devices plans to return 100% of this free cash flow to its investors through dividends and stock buybacks.
Analog Devices has less recession risk than competitors
Some investors are rightfully concerned that a slowdown in the economy could affect consumer spending and end up hurting semiconductor stocks as well. Semiconductor stocks like Nvidia and Intel are trading down 47% and 34%, respectively, from 52-week highs based largely on these concerns. But Analog Devices is only off its 52-week high by about 10% because its business relies less heavily on consumer devices. In fact, only 14% of its sales come directly from consumers (see chart below).
Data source: Analog Devices 2022 Investor Day report. Chart by author.
Analog Devices has over 75,000 products, and its sales are incredibly diversified. This combination makes the company better able to withstand a recession.
With a market cap of $89 billion, Analog Devices trades at 18.5 times forward earnings and 7.5 times forward sales. Analog Devices' market cap could increase 50% in five years by hitting the midpoint of its growth target and still trade for the same sales multiple-plus, and investors get to pocket or reinvest the growing dividend.
ADI PS Ratio data by YCharts
With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19 and a price-to-sales ratio of 8.6, Analog Devices stock trades at historically high rates right now. But the future potential for the company justifies the premium stock pricing. Analog Devices could make a terrific portfolio addition for dividend growth investors or retirees because of its secular trends, increasing revenue, and strong cash flows being returned to shareholders.

2022-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,Why AMD Shares Rose 23% in July,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amd-shares-rose-23-in-july,,,"What happened
Advanced Micro Dynamics (NASDAQ: AMD) shares rose by 23.5% in July 2022, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
The 23.5% gain follows a 25% drop in June. However, July's rally came from high expectations for the company's second-quarter earnings report, with news of supply constraints easing and the Chips and Science Act passing on July 28.
So what
Although AMD stock saw significant falls in June on the back of the larger economic climate, investor optimism for the company's Q2 results was AMD's gain. Ahead of earnings reports, Wall Street forecasted that AMD would beat 2021's Q2 revenue by 70%, following Q1 2022 results with a similar increase of 71%, year over year. The projections were confirmed when AMD announced its Q2 2022 earnings on August 2.
Other events last month led to significant single-day increases for AMD. News that the company's chip supplier Samsung expected a 21% growth in revenue in Q2 2022 suggested that demand for AMD and its competitors' products may not be slowing as previously feared, making concerns over a reduction in pandemic-level demands inconsequential. AMD will also be launching its new Ryzen processors and Radeon graphics cards later this year, which will test the limits of its production capacity and should increase demand even further as anticipation grows for the upcoming products.
Additionally, the House passed the Chips and Science Act on July 28, which led to stock increases for AMD, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Although the act primarily benefits Intel and not AMD or Nvidia, investors appear to be bullish on government investment in the industry.
Now what
On August 2, AMD released its Q2 2022 earnings report that matched expectations of a 70% increase in revenue YOY.
The horizon looks good for AMD over the next two quarters as the company plans to fully unveil and launch its new Ryzen processors before the end of Q3 2022. The upcoming 7000 series processors will be the biggest central processing unit (CPU) launch for the company since 2016, as they also involve the release of its new AM5 socket. The change in socket is significant as it means every new Ryzen 7000 CPU that AMD sells will need to be accompanied by a motherboard that contains the new socket. Since users who want to upgrade their CPU will also need to upgrade their motherboard, AMD should see a spike in revenue that reflects the generational shift as it profits from the sales of both products.
Moreover, the debut of the Radeon 7000 series graphics cards is expected before the end of the year, and AMD has promised significant performance gains for the new cards, further growing anticipation.
Suffice it to say, prospects are favorable for Advanced Micro Devices in the run-up to its new product releases and a return in supply. Of course, macroeconomic factors may still affect the company's stock, but AMD's outlook should secure it as a good long-term buy.

2022-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia Stock Can Thrive Despite CHIPS Act Pressure,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-can-thrive-despite-chips-act-pressure,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Although Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has moved higher in the past month, inflation, higher interest rates and recession worries are certainly continuing to put pressure it.
But that’s not all. Industry-specific developments are also hurting its near-term performance. Namely, the CHIPS Act, which recently made its way through Congress.
This bill, which will provide subsidies to the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing industry, is seen as good news for chip makers who produce their own chips, but bad news for “fabless” chip companies like Nvidia, which outsource production.
However, even if rivals stand to benefit from billions in government largesse, that doesn’t mean this purveyor of GPUs and CPUs stands to see zero benefit. Let’s dive in, and see why the CHIPS Act doesn’t change my view on Nvidia’s long-term prospects.
NVDA Stock and the CHIPS Act
Before exploring the possible impact of the CHIPS Act on Nvidia, we’ll first take a look at this legislation itself. U.S. politicians (both Democrats and Republicans) are looking to bring more chip production back to the United States.
Largely, this is due to national security worries. With the U.S. dependent on chips manufactured in Asia, there’s concern that this leaves America in a vulnerable position. To promote reshoring of chip production, the CHIPS Act provides $52.7 billion in subsidies for new U.S. chip fabrication facilities. It also provides around $24 billion in related tax incentives.
On July 27, the U.S. Senate approved the bill, which is officially known as the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. Then, the House of Representatives passed it and President Joe Biden is ready to sign it into law. Again, this bill is seen as bad news for NVDA stock, as it disproportionately benefits its rivals, like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
Even so, taking a closer look suggests that the opposite instead may be true. That is, instead of being a major negative, this legislation ends up being a modest positive for the company.
Why This Bill Doesn’t Change the Story With Nvidia
To some, the CHIPS Act may seem like a case of the U.S. government picking winners and losers. Yet while Nvidia isn’t directly “winning” from this bill, it’s not exactly “losing” either. Why? Two reasons.
First, federal support of the U.S. chip manufacturing industry could be a small positive for the company. It may reduce its dependence on Asian production facilities. This could limit future supply disruptions.
Second, although the CHIPS Act gives an edge to Intel in production, it does little to give Intel a leg up in chip design and innovation. That continues to be one of Nvidia’s key areas of strength. That’s why it continues to dominate the discrete GPU market, with 78% market share.
It’s also why it continues to see robust demand for its GPUs among end-user areas like cloud computing and gaming. Not to mention, it’s the reason why the company is well-positioned to dominate in emerging areas like self-driving vehicles and the metaverse. Doing little to affect its main strength, this bill will not change the story with NVDA stock.
The Verdict
My view on shares remains unchanged. Nvidia stock continues to earn a B rating in my Portfolio Grader. That’s not to say concerns about this bill will no longer have an impact on its stock price. We could see more volatility due to this bill. The uncertainties that have affected Nvidia’s price performance this year could also continue to put pressure on it.
Even so, that’s not a reason to skip on it. In the months ahead, it could become clear that demand in areas like cloud computing could outweigh a drop in demand due to a recession, such as with gaming chips. Put simply, the market is overly pessimistic about how it will fare under more challenging economic conditions.
The same may apply here, with the market’s view on the CHIPS Act. If you’ve been looking to buy NVDA stock, take advantage of a possible overreaction to this development.

2022-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,Better Chip Stock: Intel vs. Qualcomm,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-chip-stock%3A-intel-vs.-qualcomm,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) are two of the world's most important chipmakers. Intel is the largest manufacturer of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers, while Qualcomm is one of the top suppliers of mobile chips and baseband modems for smartphones.
Yet Intel's stock price declined about 30% this year as sales of new PCs cooled off in a post-lockdown world. Qualcomm stock also shed more than 20% of its value as investors fretted over the slowing growth of the smartphone market. Rising interest rates exacerbated that pain by driving investors away from tech stocks and toward more conservative investments.
Image source: Getty Images.
Should investors consider buying either of these out-of-favor chipmakers as the bulls look the other way? Let's review their near-term challenges, long-term opportunities, and valuations to decide.
Intel faces tough near-term headwinds
Over the past several years, Intel struggled with R&D blunders, product delays, chip shortages, and jarring CEO changes. All that instability caused Intel's first-party foundries to gradually fall behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) in the so-called ""process race"" to manufacture smaller and denser chips.
As a result, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), which outsourced its top-tier chips to TSMC's foundries, pulled ahead of Intel with more advanced chips. AMD's stable chip supply and lower prices also enabled to it gain ground against Intel. Between the third quarters of 2016 and 2022, Intel's share of the CPU market fell from 82.5% to 64.2%, according to PassMark Software.
Intel once considered going ""fabless"" like AMD, but CEO Pat Gelsinger -- who took the helm last February -- doubled down on expanding its plants to catch up to TSMC instead. Gelsinger expects that aggressive expansion, along with the recently passed CHIPS Act, to help it catch up to TSMC by 2025.
But until that happens, investors need to brace for many more quarters of sluggish growth and higher expenses. Intel's adjusted revenue, which excludes the ongoing divestment of its NAND chip business, rose 2% to $74.7 billion in 2021. But this year, it expects its revenue to decline 9% to 13%, its adjusted gross margin to slide from 57.7% to 49%, and for its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to plunge by 58%.
Intel mainly blames that slowdown on weak sales of consumer PCs, which should persist throughout the rest of the year, as well as sluggish sales of data center chips amid the current macroeconomic headwinds. But other challenges -- including new Arm-based server chips, delays across its roadmap, and Apple's decision to fully replace Intel's chips with its own silicon -- are causing even more headaches.
Qualcomm faces another cyclical slowdown
Qualcomm also dealt with several existential challenges in recent years. It quelled a revolt from OEMs that refused to pay its wireless licensing fees, it was fined by regulators for using anticompetitive tactics, and it narrowly fended off a hostile takeover attempt by Broadcom as it failed to buy NXP on its own. It also lost its crown as the world's top mobile chipmaker to MediaTek over the past two years, although it remains the market leader in premium smartphones.
But over the past year, Qualcomm moved past most of those issues and focused on three priorities instead: preserving its lead in the high-end market with new Snapdragon SoCs (system on chips), reducing its dependence on the smartphone market by selling more chips for connected vehicles and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and generating healthy cash flows for its buybacks and dividends.
Qualcomm is a fabless chipmaker, which outsources most of its production to TSMC and Samsung, so it isn't struggling with any major chip shortages or costly plant upgrades. But that also means it won't benefit from the CHIPS Act, which provides hefty subsidies to first-party manufacturers like Intel.
Qualcomm's adjusted revenue rose 55% to $33.5 billion in fiscal 2021, which ended last September, as its EPS more than doubled. For fiscal 2022, it expects its revenue to increase 31% to 33% and for its EPS to grow 45% to 49%. Those growth rates are dazzling, but it's bracing for slower growth next year as the smartphone market faces another cyclical slowdown. That's why analysts expect Qualcomm's revenue and adjusted EPS to increase just 6% and 5%, respectively, in fiscal 2023.
The valuations and verdict
Intel stock trades at just 11 times forward earnings and pays a forward yield of 3.6% -- but that dividend could be reduced as it ramps up its spending on new plants. Qualcomm also trades at 11 times forward earnings, but it pays a lower forward dividend yield of 2.1%.
Both stocks look cheap, but they're trading at discounts for obvious reasons. Intel's investors see sluggish PC and data center chip sales ahead as it desperately chases TSMC in the costly process race, while Qualcomm's investors are getting ready for slower smartphone sales.
I wouldn't rush to buy either of these chip stocks right now, but Qualcomm is clearly a better pick than Intel for three simple reasons: its business is less capital intensive, it faces fewer competitive threats, and it doesn't need to pull off a painful multiyear turnaround to remain relevant.

2022-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,5 Green Flags for Texas Instruments' Future,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-green-flags-for-texas-instruments-future,,,"Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) posted a strong second-quarter report on July 26. The analog and embedded chipmaker's revenue rose 14% year over year to $5.21 billion, exceeding analysts' expectations by $560 million. Its net income increased 19% to $2.29 billion, while its earnings per share grew 20% to $2.45 and topped the consensus forecast by $0.33 per share.
Those headline numbers were impressive, but a deeper dive into TI's report reveals five other green flags that make it a great buy right now.

1. Texas Instruments had another quarter of stable growth
TI produces a wide variety of analog and embedded chips for the automotive, industrial, personal electronics, communications, and enterprise sectors. That broad diversification enables it to avoid cyclical slowdowns in narrower markets like smartphones and PCs.
TI generated 77% of its revenue from its analog chips during the second quarter. Another 16% came from its embedded chips, while the rest came from other products. Here's how those two core businesses fared over the past year, even as other chipmakers grappled with cyclical challenges.

2. The auto and industrial markets are growing
Most of TI's growth came from the auto and industrial markets, which together accounted for 62% of its revenue last year. The post-lockdown expansion of those two markets insulated TI from slower smartphone sales, which dragged down chipmakers like Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), as well as softer demand for new PCs, which cast dark clouds over Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Advanced Micro Devices, and Nvidia.
TI didn't disclose the exact growth rates of either end market in the second quarter, but it said its industrial revenue increased by the ""high-single digits"" year over year and that its automotive revenue rose ""more than 20%."" That robust growth easily offset the weaker growth of its personal electronics business, which includes its chips for mobile devices.
3. Waning headwinds in China
In TI's first-quarter earnings report from late April, the chipmaker warned that it would face COVID-19-related disruptions in China -- where it generated about a quarter of its revenue last year -- and reduced its Q2 guidance by about $500 million to reflect those uncertainties.
But in its second-quarter report, TI said those headwinds peaked in April and waned in May and June, and its Chinese customers quickly ramped up their orders to make up for lost time. As a result, TI barely experienced a meaningful slowdown in China, which enabled it to actually surpass analysts' revenue estimates by more than $500 million for the full quarter.
4. Rock-solid margins
TI manufactures its own analog chips while outsourcing its embedded chips to other foundries. It's been upgrading its plants from 200-millimeter to 300-millimeter wafers over the past several years, which reduces the costs of its unpackaged parts by approximately 40%.
Those upgrades have consistently boosted TI's gross and operating margins, and its free cash flow (FCF) margin remains comfortably between 30% and 40%, giving it plenty of room to keep repurchasing its shares and raising its dividend.

5. The CHIPS Act
Finally, the recent passage of the CHIPS Act, which grants up to $52 billion in subsidies and tax breaks to U.S. chipmakers, will also generate tailwinds for TI.
The CHIPS Act will only award those subsidies to integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) like TI or Intel that manufacture their own chips instead of ""fabless"" chipmakers that outsource them to other foundries. Earlier this year, TI said it would boost its capital expenditures to about $3.5 billion annually, or a mid-teens percentage of its projected revenue, over the following four years to upgrade its 300-millimeter plants. It also plans to keep its capex elevated at about 10% of its revenue from 2025 to 2030.
TI reiterated those ambitious plans during the conference call, but the CHIPS Act could soften the blow and ensure that it remains on track to expand its domestic fabs, which include its Richardson, Texas, fab this year; its Lehi, Utah, fab in 2023; and its Sherman, Texas, fab in 2025.
Still cheap and still evergreen
For the third quarter, TI expects its revenue to rise 6%-14%, and for its EPS to increase 8%-21%. For the full year, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to climb 10% and 8%, respectively, which are solid growth rates for a stock that trades at 19 times forward earnings.
Many aspects of TI's business are cyclical, but I believe it's an evergreen stock. Between 2004 and 2021, it raised its dividend every year, reduced its share count by 46%, and grew its FCF at an average annual rate of 12%. It's also generated a total return of more than 550% over the past 10 years -- and it could still have plenty of room to run over the next few decades.

2022-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,"As US eyes new China chip curbs, turmoil looms for global market",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/as-us-eyes-new-china-chip-curbs-turmoil-looms-for-global-market,,,"By Joyce Lee
SEOUL, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Export restrictions being considered by Washington to halt China's advances in semiconductor manufacturing could come at a substantial cost, experts say, potentially disrupting fragile global chip supply chains - and hurting U.S. businesses.
Reuters reported on Monday that the United States is considering limiting shipments of American chipmaking equipment to memory chip producers in China that make advanced semiconductors used in everything from smartphones to data centres.
The curbs would stop chipmakers like South Korean giants Samsung Electronics 005930.KS and SK Hynix 000660.KS from shipping new technology tools to factories they operate in China, preventing them from upgrading plants that serve customers around the world.
Samsung and SK Hynix, which control more than half of the global NAND flash memory chip market, have invested heavily in China in recent decades to produce chips that are vital to customers including tech giants Apple AAPL.O, Amazon AMZN.O, Facebook owner Meta META.O and Google GOOGL.O. As well as computers and phones, the chips are used in products like electric vehicles that require digital data storage.
""Samsung's China production alone accounts for more than 15% of global NAND flash production ... If there's any production disruption, it will make chip prices surge,"" said Lee Min-hee, analyst at BNK Securities.
The potential for fresh turmoil - the curbs have yet to be approved - comes just as a global chip supply shortage that has disrupted businesses from autos to consumer devices for more than a year is finally showing signs of easing. Supply chain adjustments and weakening consumer demand amid the slowing global economy have combined to repair damage.
But the shortage has yet to be fully resolved. Any signs of fresh disruption could rekindle supply uncertainty, triggering a price surge - as seen earlier this year when China imposed COVID-19 restrictions in Xian where Samsung manufactures chips.
Chipmaking equipment has to be installed and fully tested months before production is due to start. Any delay in shipping the gear to China would pose a real challenge to chipmakers as they seek to manufacture more advanced chips in China facilities.
""Many U.S. companies, like Apple, use Samsung and SK Hynix memory chips. No matter what strategy (the South Korean firms) end up choosing, it will have global implications,"" said BNK Securities analyst Lee.
Samsung and SK Hynix declined to comment. Apple, Amazon, Meta and Google didn't respond to emails seeking comment outside regular U.S. business hours.
AMBITIONS, COMPLICATIONS
In Samsung's memory chip operation in Xian, central China, one of the largest foreign chip projects in the country, the company has invested a total of about $26 billion since it broke ground on the site in 2012, including chip production as well as testing and packaging.
The tech giant makes 128-layer NAND flash products in Xian, analysts said, chips that store data in devices such as smartphones and personal computers, as well as in data centres.
The facility accounts for 43% of Samsung's global NAND flash memory production capacity and 15% of the overall global output capacity, according to TrendForce late last year.
The U.S. crackdown, if approved, could also complicate SK Hynix's ambition to expand its presence in the NAND market where it is ranked third as of first quarter behind Samsung and Japan's Kioxia Holdings, which was spun out of Toshiba Corp 6502.T.
SK Hynix completed late last year the first phase of its $9 billion purchase of Intel's INTC.O NAND business, including its Dalian, China NAND manufacturing facility.
CHINA STRATEGIES
The move being considered by the United States is one of several recent signs of deepening tensions between Beijing and Washington over the tech sector.
Congress last week approved legislation to subsidise semiconductor production in the United States. It bars any company that receives federal subsidies from investing in certain chip technology in China during the subsidy period.
The deepening tensions could leave Samsung and SK Hynix having to review strategies on China investments, analysts and industry sources said.
""Until now, companies tended to invest in countries like China, where costs were cheap,"" said Kim Yang-jae, analyst at Daol Investment & Securities.
""That's no longer going to be the only consideration. The biggest change these potential limits will bring will be where the next chip factories are built.""
They could also face potentially diminishing returns from their multi-billion dollar China plants, which could be stuck making older-technology, less lucrative chips.
SK Hynix has not been able to upgrade its DRAM memory chip production facilities in Wuxi, China with the latest extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) chipmaking machines made by Dutch firm ASML ASML.AS as U.S. officials do not want advanced equipment used in the process to enter the country.
The EUV machines are used to make more advanced and smaller chips that are used in high-end devices such as smartphones.

2022-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Stock: This Falling Knife is Too Hard to Catch,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-stock%3A-this-falling-knife-is-too-hard-to-catch,,,"Shares of ailing chipmaker Intel (INTC) haven't participated in the broader market's relief bounce, with shares extending to new lows not seen in nearly five years. Though Intel has a plan to close the gap with its fierce rivals in the semiconductor space, the recent quarterly earnings miss is not doing any good for investor confidence, which continues to deteriorate. With the stock down about 47% from its 2021 high, Intel stock has a lot of negative momentum behind it.
Though the valuation is starting to get compelling, Intel stock strikes me as a troubled name that's too hard to back at a time like this.
The way I see it, there are more comforting places to be right now, with the S&P 500 (SPX) still down ~15% on the year. I am bearish on INTC stock, as its strengthening rivals could weigh heavily on sales and margins moving forward.
Intel Hit a Wall in Its Second Quarter 
Intel can't seem to catch a break. The company reported a horrid Q2 earnings miss, with EPS coming in at $0.29, far lower than the analyst consensus of $0.70. Revenue came in at a soft $15.3 billion, down 17% quarter-over-quarter.
Understandably, there was quite a bit of macro pressures and supply-chain woes dragging down the results. However, the finger can't be blamed entirely on the weakening state of the economy. Intel felt the full force of its sluggishness in the PC market.
With Apple's (AAPL) Mac business gaining traction, thanks in part to hardware innovations (think the M1 and M2 chips), it's not too far-fetched to believe that the Mac is in a spot to finally pressure the PC where it hurts.
Indeed, the Mac is back, and without Intel inside, it's Intel that seems to be left out in the cold. In the PC market, Intel is also at risk of losing market share to top rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which provides consumers with a great bang for their buck.
Over the coming months, AMD could pass Intel in market cap for good. While AMD is in a bit of a slump of its own, it's hard to imagine PC users switching back to Intel processors anytime soon - not unless Intel can pivot and move past its operational hiccups more effectively.
Intel Stock Looks Cheap but Not Cheap Enough
There's no sugar-coating it. Intel's second quarter was brutal. Still, a valuation exists where even the most distressed firm can offer investors a great risk/reward. At writing, Intel stock trades at 7.7x trailing earnings, 2x sales, 1.5x book value, and 4.7x operating cash flow. On each metric, Intel is considerably cheaper than the semiconductor industry average - and for a good reason.
There are issues that need to be ironed out if Intel is to get sales and margins heading higher again. Severe headwinds are facing Intel as it looks to turn the tide back in its favor. However, it needs to focus on innovation to get things back on the right track.
If Intel can improve upon per-watt performance, it can take market share back. Even if a coming recession weighs heavily on the broader PC market, a solving of the firm's idiosyncratic issues may be enough to put a bottom in the stock.
I'm not so sure Intel can reverse the trend, as its rivals look to have the upper hand. For now, the 4.1% dividend yield — the highest it's been in recent memory — is relatively safe. However, there isn't much room for error as the firm looks to CEO Patrick Gelsinger to steady the ship amid choppy waters.
Wall Street's Take on INTC Stock
Turning to Wall Street, INTC stock comes in as a Hold. Out of 30 analyst ratings, there are five Buys, 16 Holds, and nine Sell recommendations.
The average Intel price target is $40.04, implying an upside of 11.2%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $30.00 per share to a high of $72.00 per share.
Conclusion: It Will be Tough for Intel to Catch Up
It's been such a fall from glory for Intel. As the torch is passed to AMD, it may prove tougher for Intel to play catch up. The latest quarter was one of the worst of this earnings season. With a reduced full-year sales guidance ($65-68 billion from $76 billion), the bar has been lowered.
In any case, the stakes are as high as ever.

Reuters


HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - A Chinese chipmaker is becoming Beijing's poster child for technological self-sufficiency. Hygon Information Technology is readying a $1.6 billion float – the largest so far on Shanghai's STAR market this year. The company's controversial https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-tried-to-stop-china-acquiring-world-class-chips-china-got-them-anyway-11561646798 joint venture with U.S.-based AMD formed back in 2016 gave it a leg-up in microprocessors, and the deal’s huge valuation premium spotlights its ongoing hope for success as it strikes out on its own. 
    Hygon may be little-known outside the People's Republic, but it is a rising star at home. The company in 2018 debuted a cutting-edge processor on par with Intel and AMD. Its partnership with the latter allowed Hygon to license advanced chip designs and sell its production to local hardware manufacturers including Lenovo. Escalating U.S.-China tensions have dealt a huge blow to the business, however. In 2019, Washington added both Hygon and its joint venture’s units onto the Entity List restricting them from U.S. exports. AMD says it has stopped selling products, providing services or transferring technology to the joint venture.
    The debutant’s challenge now is to become China's answer to AMD and more without the help of the U.S. giant. Proceeds from its initial public offering will mostly go towards research and development, a spend the company has been ramping up since its blacklisting. Between 2019 and 2021, Hygon invested 3.5 billion yuan ($519 million) in R&D, some 95% of combined revenue over the period. Its top line, in the meantime, is booming: sales last year more than doubled. The company also swung to a net profit from a net loss a year earlier.
Hygon’s fortunes also will be felt in Beijing, where President Xi Jinping wants to reduce his country's reliance on foreign technology, especially in advanced semiconductors vital to strategic areas like artificial intelligence. Despite funnelling billions of dollars into developing local chipmaking, China is still technologically years behind leaders like Intel or Taiwan's TSMC, the industry behemoth U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi may https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/08/02/pelosi-tsmc-meeting-taiwan visit today as part of her contentious visit to the self-governed island.
    Hygon will debut at a valuation over 300 times its 2021 earnings, an astronomical premium to global peers and almost three times the average of where four local listed rivals trade. At least there is plenty of vested interest in its triumph.

Hygon Information Technology is due to open books on Aug. 3 for its initial public offering on the Shanghai STAR market, according to financial publication IFR. The company, which designs and manufactures microprocessors, plans to raise 10.8 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in what will be STAR’s biggest offering in 2022.
As part of the deal, Hygon is selling 300 million shares, or 12.9% of the enlarged capital, at 36 yuan each. The implied valuation is roughly 316 times its 2021 earnings, according to the company.
In 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce added the company, as well as units of its joint venture with U.S. chipmaker AMD onto its Entity list, which restricts access to U.S. goods and services.

Aug 2 (Reuters) - Semiconductor stocks fell globally on Tuesday as an expected visit by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan fueled a fresh escalation in tensions between Washington and Beijing.
China views the visit by Pelosi, a long-time critic of Beijing, as sending an encouraging signal to the pro-independence camp in Taiwan and has repeatedly warned against it.
Taiwan is home to the world's biggest contract manufacturer of semiconductors, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW, and peer United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) 2303.TW. Shares of the companies fell 2.4% and 3%, respectively.
Taiwanese stocks .TWII dropped 1.6%, marking their biggest percentage decline in three weeks, while Chinese stocks posted their biggest fall in more than two months on mounting geopolitical tensions.
""Chip stocks are really exposed to Asia. Some of them, especially chip equipment companies, have 70% of their sales in that region so it's a big deal for them,"" said Jack DeGan, chief investment officer at Harbor Advisory.
U.S. chip stocks including Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, Intel Corp INTC.O, Qualcomm QCOM.O and Micron Technology Inc MU.O fell between 0.7% and 1.9%.
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX shed 1.1%.
In Europe, Infineon IFXGn.DE declined 1%, while Dutch firms ASML ASML.AS, ASMI ASMI.AS and BESI BESI.AS fell between 2% and 3%.
""The longer term impact is unlikely to be significant unless the situation escalates, which wouldn't be my expectation right now,"" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard in London.
