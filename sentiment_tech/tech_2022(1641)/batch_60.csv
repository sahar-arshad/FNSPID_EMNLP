2022-08-12 00:00:00+00:00,Is Marvell Stock a Good Investment Option Now?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-marvell-stock-a-good-investment-option-now,,,"Considering its solid fundamentals and growth prospects, California-based Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVL) could be an attractive investment option for investors seeking exposure to the U.S. semiconductor market.
The $45.7-billion company is an integrated circuit maker, which has expertise in making digital signal processing, analog, standalone, mixed-signal, and other varieties of semiconductor chips. The company also develops core processors (single or multiple), hard disk drives, and other products.
On TipRanks, analysts are unanimously optimistic about the prospects of Marvell and have a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 20 Buys and two Holds. MRVLâs average price target of $76.77 mirrors 42.93% upside potential from the current level.
A few days ago, Tore Svanberg of Stifel Nicolaus reiterated a Buy rating on MRVL with a price target of $78 (45.22% upside potential).
Factors Influencing Marvelâs Growth
The companyâs products are widely used in automotive/networking, data center, enterprise networking, consumer, and carrier infrastructure markets. The growing popularity and need for cloud-optimized silicon are beneficial for it.
Its serviceable addressable market (SAM) is forecast to increase by 13% CAGR to $30 billion in the calendar year 2024 from $20 billion in 2021. Business opportunities are believed to be the highest in automotive/industrial and data center markets.
In addition to the above tailwinds, the companyâs diversified portfolio of products and solutions, technological expertise, customer-centric approach, operational excellence, and solid management team raise its appeal.
Its financial performance has also been solid in the past few quarters. The average earnings surprise in the last fourth reported fiscal quarter was 6.6%. In the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 (ended April 30, 2022), the companyâs earnings of $0.52 per share surpassed the consensus estimate of $0.51 per share by 2%. On a year-over-year basis, the bottom line grew 79.3% on the back of a top-line surge of 76.8%. High costs and expenses, however, played spoilsport in the quarter.
In May 2022, the companyâs President and CEO, Matt Murphy, said, âWe are guiding for growth to continue in the second quarter, projecting revenue at the midpoint to grow 5 percent sequentially and 41 percent year over year. With 88 percent of our overall revenue derived from data infrastructure, we are confident that our unique secular growth drivers in cloud, 5G, and auto, will continue to help drive sustainable long-term growth.â
On the contrary, supply-chain bottlenecks, cost inflation, and labor problems could hurt the company in the quarters ahead. Also, weakness in demand, due to the fears of a slowdown in the economy, could be troubling. These headwinds hold significance until the company gets fully equipped to deal with these issues considerably.
For the fiscal second quarter (ended July 2022), the company forecasts revenues to be $1,515 million (at mid-point) and adjusted earnings to be $0.56 per share (at mid-point).
Marvell is slated to release its results for the second quarter of Fiscal 2023 on August 25, 2022, after the market close. The consensus estimate for second-quarter earnings and revenues stands at $0.56 per share and $1.52 billion, respectively.
Bloggers & Hedge Funds Are Optimistic about Marvellâs Prospects
According to TipRanks, financial bloggers are 76% Bullish on MRVL, compared with the sector average of 65%.
Also, hedge funds are Very Positive about Marvell and have increased their stake in the semiconductor company by purchasing 224 thousand shares in the last quarter.
Concluding Remarks
Marvel is a well-rooted company in the semiconductor market of the United States, as evident from its growth trajectory in the chart below. Also, the company has a Smart Score of 8, which mirrors its potential to outperform the broader market.
The chart also reveals that MRVLâs shares have fallen since the beginning of 2022. The 40% decline in the stock price was due to macroeconomic uncertainties and industry headwinds. For prospective investors, the company's low price could be used to gain exposure to the stock.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $247.15 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions.

2022-08-10 00:00:00+00:00,"While shareholders of Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) are in the black over 5 years, those who bought a week ago aren't so fortunate",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/while-shareholders-of-marvell-technology-nasdaq%3Amrvl-are-in-the-black-over-5-years-those,,,"The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. One great example is Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) which saw its share price drive 224% higher over five years. And in the last month, the share price has gained 9.1%. But the price may well have benefitted from a buoyant market, since stocks have gained 5.6% in the last thirty days.
Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 8.0%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price.
Marvell Technology isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.
For the last half decade, Marvell Technology can boast revenue growth at a rate of 13% per year. That's a pretty good long term growth rate. We'd argue this growth has been reflected in the share price which has climbed at a rate of 27% per year over in that time. Given that the business has made good progress on the top line, it would be worth taking a look at the growth trend. When a growth trend accelerates, be it in revenue or earnings, it can indicate an inflection point for the business, which is can often be an opportunity for investors.

NasdaqGS:MRVL Earnings and Revenue Growth August 10th 2022
Marvell Technology is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Marvell Technology will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)
What About Dividends?
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Marvell Technology, it has a TSR of 238% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
A Different Perspective
While the broader market lost about 12% in the twelve months, Marvell Technology shareholders did even worse, losing 14% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 28%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

2022-07-28 00:00:00+00:00,September 9th Options Now Available For Marvell Technology (MRVL),MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/september-9th-options-now-available-for-marvell-technology-mrvl,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available today, for the September 9th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new September 9th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $53.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.35. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $53.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $49.65 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $53.34/share today.
Because the $53.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.32% return on the cash commitment, or 53.65% annualized â at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $53.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $54.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.40. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $53.34/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $54.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.61% if the stock gets called away at the September 9th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $54.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $54.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.37% boost of extra return to the investor, or 54.11% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $53.34) to be 56%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-07-21 00:00:00+00:00,Sum Up The Pieces: ESGU Could Be Worth $109,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sum-up-the-pieces%3A-esgu-could-be-worth-%24109,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (Symbol: ESGU), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $109.29 per unit.
With ESGU trading at a recent price near $88.06 per unit, that means that analysts see 24.11% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of ESGU's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are ZoomInfo Technologies Inc (Symbol: ZI), Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL), and Equitable Holdings Inc (Symbol: EQH). Although ZI has traded at a recent price of $40.17/share, the average analyst target is 79.77% higher at $72.21/share. Similarly, MRVL has 55.55% upside from the recent share price of $53.68 if the average analyst target price of $83.50/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting EQH to reach a target price of $38.62/share, which is 44.45% above the recent price of $26.74. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ZI, MRVL, and EQH:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF ESGU $88.06 $109.29 24.11%
ZoomInfo Technologies Inc ZI $40.17 $72.21 79.77%
Marvell Technology Inc MRVL $53.68 $83.50 55.55%
Equitable Holdings Inc EQH $26.74 $38.62 44.45%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2022-07-20 00:00:00+00:00,3 Chip Stocks to Buy Ahead of Earnings,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-chip-stocks-to-buy-ahead-of-earnings,,,"The world's top chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (NYSE: TSM), better known as TSMC, second-quarter 2022 earnings report indicates chip spending is still very healthy, especially as businesses update their operations for cloud computing and AI. TSMC said its Q2 sales increased 37% year over year (in U.S. dollars), and provided an outlook for another 36% increase for Q3.
That's fantastic news for TSMC's chip design customers (which use TSMC to make the actual chips to fulfill orders). With demand still on the rise for enterprise hardware, semiconductor companies with a focus on cloud and AI are poised to report healthy growth in Q2 and beyond. Three top TSMC customers that look like buys ahead of earnings are Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Here's why.
1. Marvell Technology: A first on Taiwan Semi's advanced manufacturing process
TSMC built itself into the largest chip fabrication company by developing world-class manufacturing technology. It is constantly pouring research dollars into more advanced fab processes. Its 3nm tech process -- representing the best combination of chip computing power, energy efficiency, and chip size -- is gearing up for mass production later this year.
Data management and networking leader Marvell Technology Group was the first chip company to introduce an entire platform of chip designs utilizing Taiwan Semi's 3nm process. It secured priority access to this new fab technology, which means Marvell could have some of the first chips on the market using the latest and greatest manufacturing tech. Marvell is already a leader in supplying data processing and networking equipment for cloud data centers and 5G mobile network infrastructure, so these new chips could help it extend its lead.
Paired with a couple of acquisitions last year that extended its portfolio of hardware into photonics and data center switching equipment, Marvell could be poised for a strong run of growth over the next few years. Marvell also has minimal exposure to consumer electronics, an area of the chip universe that has been exhibiting weakness as of late as households slow spending on PCs and smartphones. Instead, Marvell is primarily focused on secular growth trends like AI, advanced networking, and automotive technology.
Given this dynamic, I believe Marvell is a compelling buy ahead of earnings. Shares trade for 50 times trailing 12-month free cash flow (due to acquisition expenses), but only 22 times current year expected earnings. And with its outsized exposure to top trends in semiconductor technology, I think this will be an industry outperformer for years to come.
2. AMD: Only just beginning to unlock value from Xilinx
Speaking of acquisitions, early in 2022 AMD completed a massive merger with design peer Xilinx in the largest deal ever in the industry. AMD has been on a tear for a decade, going from a small thorn in the side of market leader Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) to a leading researcher and developer of silicon devices. Adding Xilinx to the mix will help AMD keep this epic run going.
But the beauty of getting Xilinx is it fulfills several needs for AMD. One is that it will help AMD lift its profit margins, simply because Xilinx itself had better profit margins than AMD did pre-merger. More importantly, though, AMD's growth has been propelled by cloud data center chips. However, over half of AMD's revenue is tied to far more cyclical consumer electronics sales. Xilinx and its focus on industrial and enterprise networking applications will diversify AMD away from more volatile consumer sales in a big way.
When AMD reports earnings on Aug. 2, I expect AMD's EPYC processors for data centers will continue to keep AMD in fast growth mode. As a TSMC customer, the chip fab giant's recent report indicates as much for AMD. But Xilinx was also a growing company before the merger, and its chip portfolio is also enjoying steady tailwinds from industrial applications. But as AMD stock has been punished as of late (share prices are down 42% so far this year), the market seems mostly focused on the risks with the consumer half of the business.
AMD stock now trades for 32 times trailing 12-month free cash flow and just 19 times current-year expected earnings. The bar is set lower than it has been for years for this chip design leader, and I think AMD is a top buy ahead of its Q2 earnings report in a couple weeks.
3. Nvidia: Everyone's fave chip stock goes on sale, sort of
If there was a chip company that TSMC's Q2 report lent a helping hand to, it's Nvidia. Nvidia's GPUs for high-end video game graphics, cloud computing, and AI make use of Taiwan Semi's fab expertise. But worry has been mounting that Nvidia's momentum over the last few years is about to hit a wall. As the cryptocurrency industry fallout continues, crypto mining companies aren't hoarding GPUs (many of them intended for video gamers) anymore. That could send the video game segment in reverse.
But Nvidia's largest segment is now data centers, and TSMC is a top manufacturer of high-end computing chips. If TSMC is still in growth mode, Nvidia's new bread-and-butter end market is likely to remain in growth mode too. That at least confirms the positive (but somewhat ambiguous) data center outlook Nvidia Cáº¸O Jensen Huang provided during the Q1 earnings call.
As a reminder, Nvidia's data center segment sales were up a sizzling 83% year over year in Q1. I don't expect that same expansion rate to continue in Q2, but it doesn't necessarily need to in order to keep Nvidia's overall revenue headed up and to the right. Besides data center chips, Nvidia has other irons in the fire too (automotive, software, etc.).
The question now is whether more modest growth is worth buying into. Nvidia shares trade for 53 times trailing 12-month free cash flow and 30 times current year expected earnings. It isn't a value. On the contrary, this is still a premium-priced stock that assumes Nvidia will keep growing for many years to come. But if you want a decade-long bet on a top AI computing platform, the stock could be a buy ahead of earnings anyways. Nvidia shares haven't been this ""cheap"" since early in the pandemic in 2020, and its position as a tech giant is stronger than ever. This remains a core holding in my portfolio.

2022-07-18 00:00:00+00:00,Congress deliberates a $52 billion semiconductor bill â Here are 2 stocks that could benefit,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/congress-deliberates-a-%2452-billion-semiconductor-bill-here-are-2-stocks-that-could-benefit,,,"In todayâs world, the markets cannot be separated from politics. Case in point â the semiconductor subsidy bill currently before Congress. The bill, which holds the promise of some $52 billion worth of subsidies for the US semiconductor industry, was stalled in the Congressional processes for several months but last week got a boost from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In a move not sees as particularly coincidental, Pelosiâs husband just last month exercised a call option to purchase more than $5 million worth of shares in Nvidia, a major chip maker.
Forget the appearances for a moment, no matter how bad that looks. The semiconductor chip bill has bipartisan support, and while itâs path through the Senate is rocky, itâs expected to pass â and that will mean an infusion of cash into the US semiconductor industry. While the chip segment is hurting now, $52 billion will open a lot of opportunities, up and down the semiconductor supply chain, and investors should be on the lookout accordingly.
Against this backdrop, we've used the TipRanks database to locate two semiconductor stocks that stand to gain from political chip subsidies. Both are Strong Buy options with plenty of upside potential, according to the analyst community. Let's take a closer look.
Marvell Technology (MRVL)
First up on the list is Marvell, one of the chip industryâs light heavyweights. Even after the stock has fallen 45% year-to-date, the company still boasts a market cap of more than $40 billion, and brought in $4.46 billion in revenues in its last fiscal year. Marvell produces chips and chipsets for a wide range of applications, including automotive systems, data centers, ethernet networks, storage accelerators, and SSD controllers.
On the subject of new products, Marvell recently announced the introduction of a generation of ethernet switches, the most advanced secure managed switch for automotive applications.
Heading into this year, Marvell was in a solid position regarding revenues and earnings. The companyâs fiscal 2022 revenue was solid, and both the top and bottom lines were trending upwards. That has continued in the companyâs current fiscal year. Fiscal 1Q23 results were released in May, and showed $1.45 billion at the top line, up 74% from the year-ago quarter. In earnings, Marvell brought in 52 cents per share in non-GAAP diluted EPS, up 79% year-over-year. 
Matthew Ramsay, 5-star analyst covering MRVL for Cowen, notes four key points driving the companyâs success: âWe believe Marvell continues to benefit from secular growth opportunities, including: 1) the bandwidth upgrade cycle of electro-optical links to PAM4 inside and between data centers, particularly as it just announced new 400G and 800G DSP platforms; 2) 5G infrastructure builds globally, ex-China; 3) ADAS-enabled and battery electric vehicles requiring faster Ethernet connections and more compute; and 4) the transformation and growth of system architectures toward tailored workloads rather than general-purpose workloads.â
To this end, Ramsay puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on MRVL shares, along with an $85 price target. Investors stand to pocket ~75% gain should the analyst's thesis play out. (To watch Ramsayâs track record, click here)
Cowen is hardly the only firm to take a bullish look at Marvell. Of the stockâs 20 recent analyst reviews, 18 are to Buy against just 2 to Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $48.62 and its $78.55 price target implies an upside of ~62% from current levels. (See Marvell stock forecast on TipRanks)
Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO)
Next up, Broadcom, is one of the chip industryâs leaders. In fact, Broadcom is the fifth largest chip company, globally, counting by total sales, with 2021 revenues exceeding $23.8 billion. The Irvine, California, company is heavily involved in a range of computing applications, including cybersecurity, mainframe and enterprise software, optical interconnects, wired and wireless networking systems, and storage and memory systems.
Like Marvell above, Broadcom has its hands in the automotive connection segment, and in May it announced a new product: the industryâs first 50G high bandwidth monolithic automotive Ethernet switch device. The key point here is not competition between Marvell and Broadcom, but rather, a rapidly growing segment that offers advantages to any chip company able to find an entry.
Also in May, Broadcom acquired VMware, a leader in enterprise cloud management. The acquisition was made for $61 billion in cash and stock combined, and Broadcom is currently rebranding its own software group, which will operate as VMware.
All of this leads into the May release of Broadcomâs earnings, from the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. The quarter, which ended on May 1, showed a total of $8.1 billion at the top line, up 23% year-over-year and the best top-line result of the past two years. The company also reported non-GAAP diluted EPS of $9.07, compared to $6.62 in the year-ago quarter.
These results supported Broadcomâs regular share dividend, which at $4.10 per share annualizes to $16.40 per common share and yields 3.3%. The company has a 12-year history of keeping up reliable dividend payments.
Harsh Kumar, 5-star analyst with Piper Sandler, had only positives to say about Broadcom in his recent note, writing: âWe think VMware can be transformative to the software business from both a fundamental and financial perspective. Post close, we expect roughly half of Broadcomâs revenue to be software. In addition, we expect Broadcom to maintain its capital returns policy post close, particularly related to the dividend.""
""On earnings, the core company continues to point to strong traction in all semiconductor segments except wireless. Networking is growing nicely, as Broadcom gains share and benefits from the move from custom ASICs to merchant silicon. Overall, Broadcomâs core business continues to do very well, and we view the VMware acquisition very positively. As noted previously, we see a path to EPS over $50 for the combined company once integration is complete,â Kumar added.
These comments provide solid support for Kumarâs Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on AVGO stock, and his $750 price target implies ~53% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Kumarâs track record, click here)
And now we can understand Broadcomâs unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating from the Streetâs analysts, based on 12 positive reviews. The stock has a trading price of $491.06 and an average target of $704.55, giving it an upside potential of ~43% on the one-year time frame. (See Broadcom stock forecast on TipRanks)

2022-07-18 00:00:00+00:00,Should iShares Russell MidCap ETF (IWR) Be on Your Investing Radar?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-ishares-russell-midcap-etf-iwr-be-on-your-investing-radar-3,,,"The iShares Russell MidCap ETF (IWR) was launched on 07/17/2001, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $26.03 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
Why Mid Cap Blend
Compared to large and small cap companies, mid cap businesses tend to have higher growth prospects and are less volatile, respectively, with market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.
Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.
Costs
Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.19%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.43%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 16.30% of the portfolio. Industrials and Financials round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Marvell Technology Inc (MRVL) accounts for about 0.52% of total assets, followed by Pioneer Natural Resource (PXD) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC).
The top 10 holdings account for about 4.42% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
IWR seeks to match the performance of the Russell MidCap Index before fees and expenses. The Russell Midcap Index measures the performance of the mid-capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market.
The ETF has lost about -20.11% so far this year and is down about -14.81% in the last one year (as of 07/18/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $62.75 and $85.28.

2022-07-13 00:00:00+00:00,2 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy Right Now for Less than $100,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-no-brainer-stocks-to-buy-right-now-for-less-than-%24100-0,,,"The stock market may not have been a happy hunting ground so far this year, but investors shouldn't forget that buying shares of solid companies is a tried and tested way of enhancing one's wealth.
The S&P 500, for instance, has averaged annual returns of 13.9% from 2011 through 2020. That's why investors looking to get started in the stock market -- even with a small amount such as $100 -- should focus on the bigger picture and consider buying some solid stocks that are trading at relatively attractive valuations following their slide in 2022.
Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT) and Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) are two stocks trading under $100 that investors can consider buying right now. Let's see why.
1. Fortinet
Fortinet provides firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion prevention systems, and other computer security products. So far in 2022, its shares are down nearly 13% despite the company's impressive growth. This could be an opportunity for investors to get their hands on this cybersecurity stock at a relatively cheap valuation.
Of course, Fortinet isn't all that cheap considering that it trades at 82 times earnings and 14 times sales, but the company is growing at a terrific pace to justify that valuation. In the first quarter of 2022, for instance, Fortinet's revenue shot up 34% year-over-year to $955 million.
More importantly, its bookings, which refers to the total value of orders it received during the quarter, increased at a faster pace of 50% year-over-year to $1.28 billion. What's more, Fortinet's order backlog, which refers to the orders that have been received but not yet fulfilled, shot up to $278 million last quarter from $162 million at the end of 2021.
The growth in these metrics indicates that Fortinet should be able to sustain its fast pace of growth. Not surprisingly, the company expects to finish the year with $4.37 billion in revenue and $5.54 billion in billings. These numbers would translate into top-line growth of 31% and billings growth of 32% compared to 2021.
The prospects of the cybersecurity market suggest that Fortinet could keep growing at a solid pace for years to come. For example, the company's total addressable market in the cloud security space is expected to go up to $31.2 billion by 2026, compared to $17.7 billion this year. Its overall addressable market, including multiple cybersecurity niches, is expected to jump to $199 billion in 2026, compared to an estimated $138 billion this year.
The healthy end-market prospects are the reason why Fortinet expects annual revenue to hit $8 billion in 2025, while billings could jump to $10 billion by then. As such, investors looking to buy a top cybersecurity stock trading for less than $100 a share should take a closer look at Fortinet as it seems built for long-term upside.
2. Marvell Technology Group
Shares of Marvell Technology have taken a big beating in the stock market recently, losing 46% of their value so far this year. But this has opened an opportunity for investors to buy this fast-growing chipmaker at a relatively attractive valuation. And its business is actually quite good. The company's earnings are expected to grow at an annual pace of 42% for the next five years.
It is easy to see why analysts are expecting Marvell's earnings to increase at such a terrific pace. Lucrative end markets such as data centers, 5G wireless infrastructure, automotive, and storage are driving impressive growth at Marvell. The chipmaker's fiscal 2023 first-quarter revenue shot up 74% year-over-year to $1.45 billion. The company's adjusted earnings soared to $0.52 per share, from $0.29 per share in the prior-year period.
Marvell's design wins -- which means its chips that have been selected for use by customers -- indicate that the chipmaker should be able to sustain its momentum. In the data center market, for example, the design wins secured by Marvell over the past year and a half could help it clock incremental revenue of $400 million next year and $800 million in the following year. That points toward a nice bump in the data center segment as it generated $640 million in revenue in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, or an annual revenue run rate of $2.5 billion.
It is worth noting that Marvell sells a wide range of data center chips ranging from data processing units (DPUs) to ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) to ethernet adapters to switches to networked storage for hyperscale data centers. Given that the demand for data center accelerators such as ASICs and data processing units is expected to grow at an annual pace of 44% through 2027, Marvell has a solid secular growth opportunity ahead of it.
All this makes Marvell a top semiconductor stock under $100 to buy right now. What's more, the stock is trading at 7.7 times sales now, which is significantly lower than last year's multiple of 16.8. And the forward earnings multiple of 20 is also attractive, sitting well below the five-year average of 26. Buying Marvell at these multiples looks like a no-brainer.

2022-07-13 00:00:00+00:00,Better Semiconductor Stock: AMD vs. Marvell Technology Group,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-semiconductor-stock%3A-amd-vs.-marvell-technology-group,,,"The semiconductor industry was hit hard in the first half of 2022. As measured by the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX), chip stocks are down an average of 35% so far this year, compared to a negative 27% return for the Nasdaq Composite index.
Investors are worried that the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes could send the economy into a recession. Though the global chip shortage is still keeping many semiconductor companies in growth mode, consumer spending on electronics is already easing up -- and some fear that business spending on chips could be next and that it could start happening as early as 2023.
Whether a big slowdown arrives or not, chip stocks have priced in a cyclical downturn anyway. Even top growth stories Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) have taken a hit. Both are busy integrating transformational acquisitions at the moment too. But given the long-term tech trends propelling these businesses higher, they could be a value right now. Is one of them a better buy?
AMD: Catapulting into new market opportunities
AMD is arguably the greatest semiconductor stock story of the last decade. The company made drastic changes to its business model in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008-09, and its sharp focus on chip design and research helped propel the stock to a 1,460% return over the last 10 years even when factoring in the 46% price drop so far in 2022.
AMD is selling off as of late because of the aforementioned slowdown in consumer electronics. In Q1 2022, about half of revenue came from consumer-facing devices. However, cloud computing and AI applications for business are (and have been) the primary growth driver here in the last couple of years. AMD's enterprise segment grew 88% year over year last quarter thanks to its EPYC processors for data centers.
Halfway through Q1, though, AMD completed its mega-merger with industrial chip designer Xilinx. Besides adding a highly profitable peer to its own operations, Xilinx brings a bunch of new markets to the table for AMD -- including access to the automotive, industrial equipment, and aerospace and defense industries. Xilinx did just over $1 billion in sales in Q1, so it will be a huge sales contributor to AMD. Shortly after Xilinx, AMD also announced it was purchasing cloud networking start-up Pensando for $1.9 billion in cash.
In early June, the chip designer raised $1 billion in fresh cash via a long-term debt offering. When adding this to its totals at the end of the last quarter, AMD would have $7.5 billion in cash and short-term investments offset by $2.8 billion in debt. Shares trade for 30 times trailing 12-month free cash flow. If the new AMD can use its arsenal of cloud computing and industrial chips to maintain its momentum (expected full-year 2022 growth of 31% before Xilinx was acquired, 61% with Xilinx), it could be a fantastic long-term value right now.
Marvell: A full suite of big data solutions
Marvell Technology Group stock has also taken a big hit this year on worries of a cyclical downturn, even though this company's end-markets have little to do with consumer spending these days. In Q1, only 12% of sales went to consumer electronics. Marvell derives most of its revenue from data centers, 5G mobile network infrastructure and other telecom deployments, and industrial and automotive equipment.
Though consumers are tapping the brakes, business spending on Marvell's end markets is in high demand right now. Cloud computing and AI, 5G mobile, and self-driving cars require the frequent movement of increasingly large amounts of digital data. Marvell is a top provider of DPUs (data processing units) that help with this task, and it has a complementary portfolio of networking and photonics circuitry it has been cross-selling with its DPU bread-and-butter.
Marvell got itself into this top position via acquisitions as well. However, unlike AMD's giant merger with Xilinx, Marvell has been patching together smaller chip designers for years. In 2018 and 2019 it purchased three small outfits focused on application-specific processors. And in 2021 it bought Inphi and Innovium to bolster its portfolio of optical networking and data switching components.
After its acquisition streak, Marvell's balance sheet isn't so neat and tidy. Cash and equivalents were $465 million at the end of April, and total debt was $4.5 billion. However, this should be mitigated over time as Marvell is a highly profitable chip designer that generates lots of free cash flow. The bottom line has been running lean for the last year as the company digests its purchases, but profits are quickly rebounding. The stock currently trades for 46 times trailing 12-month free cash flow, and management thinks revenue will continue to grow at a double-digit percentage pace for the rest of this year.
Which semiconductor stock is the better buy?
AMD and Marvell are both top chip stocks in my book. They are both riding multiple secular growth trends, and both have improved profit margins as well as successfully integrated recent acquisitions. Full disclosure -- I own both stocks.
At this juncture, though, I believe AMD is a slightly more compelling buy. It has net cash on its balance sheet, and it's already generating plenty of profit. Marvell has a bit more work to do in this department, so it could be a bit more volatile than AMD stock. Still, if you're looking for chip stocks that are quickly pivoting with current tech trends, both of these companies have a lot of potential in the next few years.

Coming into today, shares of the chipmaker had lost 7.4% in the past month. In that same time, the Business Services sector lost 1.18%, while the S&P 500 lost 1%.
Marvell Technology will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.56, up 64.71% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.51 billion, up 40.78% from the year-ago period.
Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.33 per share and revenue of $6.19 billion. These totals would mark changes of +48.41% and +38.61%, respectively, from last year.
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Marvell Technology. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.

It is also worth noting that MRVL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.27. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. MRVL's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.99 as of yesterday's close.
