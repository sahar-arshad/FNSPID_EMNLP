2022-08-24 00:00:00+00:00,Did Intel Just Get Saved?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/did-intel-just-get-saved,,,"In this video, I will be going over Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) new agreement that will see it and Brookfield Asset Management invest up to $30 billion in chip factories in Arizona.
We know that Intel has a long way back to the top if it manages to turn things around. That will require a lot of capital.
It could use all the help it can get because in the second quarter, Intel reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.29, a decrease of 79% year over year, and gross margin came in at 44.8%, down 15 percentage points YOY.
On top of that, Intel's current and future products face fierce competition from AMD and Nvidia.
The CHIPS Act certainly helps, but for a company that isn't becoming more profitable these days, more capital is always welcome.
Intel has signed an agreement with Brookfield to invest up to $30 billion in chip factories in Arizona. The agreement is a first in the Semiconductor Co-Investment Program (SCIP).

2022-08-24 00:00:00+00:00,Brookfield Pushes Its Chips Further Into Data Infrastructure,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/brookfield-pushes-its-chips-further-into-data-infrastructure,,,"Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) sees an enormous investment opportunity in data infrastructure. The digital economy is driving the need for more infrastructure to support surging data usage, which is on track to grow at a 30% annual clip through 2025. Overall, the company believes data infrastructure represents a 100-year investment opportunity.
That's leading the company to pour capital into expanding the world's data infrastructure. It recently unveiled one of its biggest splashes, partnering with chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) to help finance the construction of two semiconductor fabrication facilities in Arizona.
Writing a new scrip to drive growth
Brookfield Infrastructure's initial data investments have been to acquire critical backbone infrastructure supporting data usage, like cell towers, fiber optic networks, and data centers. The company leases capacity on this infrastructure to technology, telecom, and other customers under long-term contracts, enabling it to generate predictable cash flow to support its 3%-yielding dividend. It also invests in expanding its capacity by building additional towers, fiber capacity, and data centers to support growing data usage. Those investments help grow its cash flow, supporting its ability to continue increasing its dividend.
Its partnership with Intel is quite different. Brookfield and its institutional partners are investing up to $15 billion for a 49% stake in two semiconductor fabrication facilities the tech giant is building in Arizona. In exchange, it will get half the revenue produced from these facilities.
Meanwhile, Intel gets the first funding partner for its semiconductor co-investment program (SCIP). The partnership structure will enable Intel to maintain a strong financial profile as it invests to significantly expand its fabrication capacity. The deal is accretive to its adjusted free cash flow and earnings per share while allowing the company to protect its cash and debt capacity for future investments and to continue growing its dividend. Intel hopes to sign other SCIP deals to help it build additional factories elsewhere.
Leveraging its expertise and flexibility
Brookfield has a long history of working with companies to support their expansion. Its partnership with Intel will leverage its financial flexibility and ability to secure capital to help the company build out critical semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and support the digital economy's continued expansion.
Brookfield has already lined up financing for most of its capital commitment. As a result, the company expects to invest between $500 million and $750 million of equity capital to finance the construction. It will be a phased investment during the building period, with the majority funded closer to the plant's commissioning in 2024. Brookfield can easily handle that remaining equity commitment with retained operating cash flows after paying its dividend and the proceeds of its capital recycling program. That strategy entails selling mature assets and reinvesting the proceeds into more attractive opportunities.
This investment will help replenish the company's capital project backlog, which is nearing completion. It's currently working on finishing its Heartland Petrochemical Complex in Canada and the second phase of its electricity transmission line buildout in Brazil. With the Intel partnership, it has secured a potentially significant long-term growth driver. Semiconductor sales are on track to surge in the coming years, potentially doubling by the end of the decade to more than $1 trillion.
That should enable Brookfield to continue organically expanding its cash flows at a healthy rate in the coming years. It targets annual organic growth of 6% to 9% per share from inflationary price increases, volume growth as the global economy expands, and capital projects funded with retained cash flows. That growth rate supports its plan to grow its dividend by 5% to 9% per year. With another sizable capital project lined up, it provides greater visibility into Brookfield's ability to continue delivering attractive organic growth in the coming years.
Data-driven growth
Brookfield believes data is one of the biggest investment opportunities of our lifetime. That's leading the company to continue investing more capital into the sector by partnering with Intel to help build two more semiconductor plants. This investment will replenish the company's capital backlog while providing it with upside to the future growth of semiconductor sales. That will help drive continued strong organic growth for the company, helping support its ability to keep raising its dividend.

2022-08-24 00:00:00+00:00,Why AMD Is a Surefire Semiconductor Stock to Buy Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amd-is-a-surefire-semiconductor-stock-to-buy-right-now,,,"The semiconductor industry has enjoyed terrific growth over the past couple of years, thanks to the booming demand for chips from multiple areas such as data centers, personal computers (PCs), smartphones, factories, and vehicles, among others.
The semiconductor industry generated $582 billion in revenue last year, according to IDC. The industry's revenue is expected to increase 13.7% in 2022 as well to $661 billion. However, Wall Street is having concerns about the strength of the semiconductor industry following terrible reports from the likes of Nvidia and Micron Technology.
However, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is one semiconductor stock that could continue to thrive even if there is a downturn in the broader market. Let's see why that may be the case.
AMD is growing at a solid pace despite headwinds
When AMD released its second-quarter results on Aug. 2, it surprised Wall Street by delivering 70% year-over-year revenue growth to $6.6 billion despite the huge slowdown in sales of PCs. The chipmaker's impressive growth was aided by the data center business, but it is worth noting that it also witnessed robust growth in sales of chips used in PCs.
AMD's revenue from the client segment, which includes sales of processors used in desktops, notebooks, and workstations, increased 25% year over year to $2.2 billion last quarter. This is impressive considering that global PC shipments fell 15.3% in Q2. AMD's market share gains in both desktop and notebook processors played a key role in driving the client segment's growth.
According to Mercury Research, AMD exited Q2 with a 20.6% share of the desktop processor market, an increase of 3.5 percentage points over the prior year. Its share of the notebook processor market stood at 24.8% last quarter, an impressive jump of 4.8 percentage points over the year-ago period. So, AMD's technology lead over rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) helped it mitigate the softness in the PC market and increase the sales volumes of processors last quarter.
What's more, the average selling price (ASP) of AMD's client processors increased year over year, boosting the company's operating margin by one percentage point to 32%. The good part is that AMD expects its client processor business to keep improving despite the PC slowdown. That's because AMD's Ryzen processors are expected to power close to 300 notebook models this year.
Additionally, AMD will release its next-generation Ryzen processors based on the 5-nanometer manufacturing process in the current quarter. These new processors should help AMD take more share away from Intel as the latter's competing Raptor Lake processors, which are expected to hit the market in the fourth quarter, will be manufactured using a 10nm process.
The smaller die size of AMD's upcoming processors means that its chips could pack in more computing power while being more power-efficient at the same time. AMD's current lineup of Ryzen processors is made on a 7nm process, indicating that the company is set to widen the gap over Intel, and that could translate into stronger sales in the client business.
The data center business is taking off big time
AMD's data center revenue shot up 83% year over year in Q2 to $1.5 billion. The chipmaker witnessed record sales of its EPYC server processors last quarter, thanks to terrific demand from cloud and enterprise customers.
Mercury Research estimates that AMD controlled 13.9% of the server processor market in the second quarter, an increase of 4.4 percentage points over the prior year. AMD is set to push the envelope further in the server business with the launch of its next-generation Genoa processors later in 2022. Based on a 5nm process, these processors could steamroll Intel, as leaked benchmarks indicate.
So, AMD looks all set to corner a bigger share of the server processor market, and that could supercharge the company's growth as it sees a $42 billion revenue opportunity in this segment in the long run. Throw in other growth drivers such as console gaming, and it is easy to see why AMD could keep defying any potential weakness in the semiconductor market.
In all, AMD's market share gains and its secular growth opportunities indicate that it is a top semiconductor stock to buy right now, especially considering that it is trading at 22 times forward earnings as compared to a five-year average forward earnings multiple of 42.

2022-08-23 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel, Brookfield to invest up to $30 bln in Arizona chip factories",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-brookfield-to-invest-up-to-%2430-bln-in-arizona-chip-factories-0,,,"By Chavi Mehta and Krystal Hu
Aug 23 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O and Canada's Brookfield Asset Management BAMa.TO on Tuesday agreed to jointly fund up to $30 billion for the U.S. chipmaker's leading-edge chip factories in Arizona, fueling Intel's ambition to bring more chip production onshore without weighing on its balance sheet.
Brookfield's infrastructure affiliate will invest up to $15 billion for a 49% stake in the expansion project, while Intel will retain majority ownership and operating control of the two chip factories meant to make advanced chips in Chandler, Arizona.
The investment is an expansion of an agreement signed by Intel and Brookfield in February to explore finance options to help fund new Intel manufacturing sites.
The two companies didn't disclose specific terms. David Zinsner, Intel's finance chief, told analysts the interest rate was between 4.4% and 8.5%, which is more expensive than debt financing but cheaper than equity financing.
For private capital providers like Brookfield, foundries represent a cash-flow generating investment opportunity resembling private equity investments in infrastructure, such as data centers and fiber, signaling investors' long-term confidence in semiconductor demand.
Through the deal, Intel could preserve debt capacity for other priorities with financing commitment for a multi-year project, while maintaining operational control.
Zinsner expects this could be the first of many similar financing structures the semiconductor industry explores.
The deal also comes after U.S. President Joe Biden this month signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law, which included provision of $52.7 billion in subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production and research.
Zinsner said the arrangement between the companies ""builds on the momentum from the recent passage of the CHIPS Act in the U.S.""
After Pat Gelsinger took over the reins of Intel in early 2021, the company announced multibillion-dollar investments across Europe and in the United States.
They were aimed at increasing Intel's chip production after the industry went through an over two-year long supply crunch that derailed production of cars to computers.
Last month, Intel slashed its annual forecasts due to falling PC demand.
The transaction with Brookfield is expected to close by the end of 2022. Lazard Frères advised Intel on the deal.

2022-08-23 00:00:00+00:00,Investors Heavily Search Intel Corporation (INTC): Here is What You Need to Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investors-heavily-search-intel-corporation-intc%3A-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-0,,,"Intel (INTC) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Over the past month, shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -13.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Intel falls in, has lost 2.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.35 per share, indicating a change of -79.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -61% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.27 points to a change of -58.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -34.5%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.72 indicates a change of +20.2% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -23.6%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intel is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Intel, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.59 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -18.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $66.31 billion and $68.53 billion estimates indicate -15% and +3.3% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $15.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22%. EPS of $0.29 for the same period compares with $1.28 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -14.51%. The EPS surprise was -57.97%.
Over the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

2022-08-22 00:00:00+00:00,Bullish insiders bet US$6.0m on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bullish-insiders-bet-us%246.0m-on-intel-corporation-nasdaq%3Aintc,,,"Over the last year, a good number of insiders have significantly increased their holdings in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects.
While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.
Intel Insider Transactions Over The Last Year
The Independent Director James Goetz made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$995k worth of shares at a price of US$49.76 each. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$35.38 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.
While Intel insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!
NasdaqGS:INTC Insider Trading Volume August 22nd 2022
Intel is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.
Insider Ownership
For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Intel insiders own about US$73m worth of shares. That equates to 0.05% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.
So What Do The Intel Insider Transactions Indicate?
The fact that there have been no Intel insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Insiders own shares in Intel and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Intel (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) and we strongly recommend you look at them before investing.
But note: Intel may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.

2022-08-22 00:00:00+00:00,7 Chip Stocks to Buy That Are Better Than Nvidia,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-chip-stocks-to-buy-that-are-better-than-nvidia,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Finding the best chip stocks to buy isn’t as easy as it once was. After record demand in 2021, even the strongest chip stocks, such Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), continue to struggle as a result of supply chain constraints and severe macroeconomic headwinds.
For instance, the S&P 500 Semiconductors Select Industry index is down 21% year to date. Meanwhile, the iShares Semiconductors ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) has declined 22% over the same period. By comparison, the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index are down roughly 10% and 17% so far in 2022.
Yet, some chip stocks are riding out the tech selloff better than other sectors. Secular growth drivers such as artificial intelligence (“AI”), cloud computing, 5G, robotics, gaming and electric vehicles (EVs) are providing tailwinds for revenue growth as well as share price stability.
Analysts highlight digitalization means many items will have chips. As a result, the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry is bound to decrease.
In recent days, Congress passed the $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act, which President Biden signed into law. It includes $52.7 billion in subsidies to support fabrication plants stateside. It is one of the largest programs launched by the federal government to support an important domestic industry.
As a result, the pullback in the semiconductor space represents a compelling buying opportunity for long-term investors. However, given the current market volatility, the best chip stocks to buy will have strong competitive advantages and wide economic moats.
With that information, here are the seven best chip stocks to buy that are primed to gain traction in the coming months.
ASML ASML $545.26
GFS Globalfoundries $61.20
INTC Intel $35.38
MU Micron Technology $60.51

MELBOURNE (Reuters Breakingviews) - Get ready to hear rafts of executives blame “drought”, “flood” and “natural disaster” for poor earnings in the next few months. On some levels, that’s understandable: large swathes of the Americas, Europe, Asia and Oceania have been suffering from either too little or too much water, and sometimes both in quick succession. But it’s also tired old language that obfuscates how such financial pain is a consequence of long allowing water risk to play second fiddle to greenhouse-gas emissions in battling climate change. Now DWS, Fidelity International, CalPERS and some 60 other investors with almost $10 trillion in assets between them are trying to change that.
The group has just launched the Valuing Water Finance Initiative after more than two years https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.breakingviews.com%2Fconsidered-view%2Fan-ever-drier-world-will-unleash-investment-flood%2F&data=05%7C01%7CThomas.Shum%40thomsonreuters.com%7Cf83c3a4a2fd047333be308da83fb9691%7C62ccb8646a1a4b5d8e1c397dec1a8258%7C0%7C0%7C637967413838877179%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=2jreJ2umjytNd00kRJw%2BrEhEWhU7fxt2rh0vpf%2BR764%3D&reserved=0 of constructing the scientific case for action. Despite its somewhat airy name, the VWFI will target 72 food, beverage, technology and apparel companies from Microsoft to McDonalds to properly assess their exposure to the resource, as well as better manage and protect it. It’s modelled on the Climate Action 100+, a carbon-focused initiative led by 700 investors holding $68 trillion in assets; climate nonprofit organisation Ceres is a founding member of both.
It's not that water risk is completely ignored. A smaller Ceres-led investor campaign in the past targeted fast-food chains, while another nonprofit, CDP, has warned that the cost of ignoring water risks costs companies five times https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cdp.net%2Fcdp-production%2Fcms%2Freports%2Fdocuments%2F000%2F005%2F577%2Foriginal%2FCDP_Water_analysis_report_2020.pdf%3F1617987510&data=05%7C01%7CThomas.Shum%40thomsonreuters.com%7Cf83c3a4a2fd047333be308da83fb9691%7C62ccb8646a1a4b5d8e1c397dec1a8258%7C0%7C0%7C637967413839033403%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=SThVdh4r9ro4U%2FOGCBdf%2FKvVp%2FuZa298fnGLUVIBmZs%3D&reserved=0 as much as dealing with them.

But such resolutions are rare and infrequent.
There are good examples of corporate water action to draw on, including strategies from AB InBev, Coca-Cola and Intel; these range from making their plants water-efficient to helping their supply chains and the communities they operate in to be more water aware and secure. Some of these companies are on the VWFI’s initial target list – a smart move that should help more speedily develop best practices for the laggards. With recent global events showing yet again how the effects of the changing climate are felt most through water, it’s past time to pipe in a concerted investor solution.

CONTEXT NEWS
A group of 64 investment firms collectively managing almost $10 trillion in assets on Aug. 16 launched the Valuing Water Finance Initiative [VWFI] to push companies with a high water footprint to value the resource properly, to understand its potential to pose a financial risk and to adapt their strategy accordingly.
Among the 64 founding members of the VWFI are Fidelity International, Franklin Templeton, DWS, AustralianSuper and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System.
The group is initially targeting 72 companies in the food, beverage, apparel and technology sectors, including Coca Cola, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Adidas, Lululemon Athletica, Apple, Alphabet, Kraft Heinz and Unilever.
The initiative, which was spearheaded by U.S.-based climate nonprofit Ceres and the Government of the Netherlands, is based on six major targets for companies. These encompass: water quantity and quality; ecosystem protection; universal and equitable access to water and sanitation; proper board oversight; and ensuring policy lobbying is aligned with sustainable water resource management.

2022-08-21 00:00:00+00:00,Better Semiconductor Stock: Applied Materials vs. ASML,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-semiconductor-stock%3A-applied-materials-vs.-asml,,,"Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) and ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) are the two largest semiconductor equipment makers in the world. Applied Materials is an American company that provides a wide range of equipment, software, and services used to manufacture semiconductors, display panels, and solar products.
ASML is a Dutch producer of photolithography systems, which are used to etch circuit patterns into silicon wafers. It's also the only producer of EUV (extreme ultraviolet) photolithography systems, which are required to manufacture the world's smallest and densest chips.
Image source: Getty Images.
Applied Materials and ASML don't compete against each other, but they've both profited from the skyrocketing demand for chips worldwide. But over the past several months, shares of Applied Materials and ASML have both pulled back about 35% from their all-time highs.
Those declines were largely caused by concerns about a slowdown in the broader semiconductor market, but rising interest rates and other macro headwinds are exacerbating that pressure. So should investors take the contrarian view and invest in either linchpin of the semiconductor market today?
Applied Materials faces a near-term slowdown
Applied Materials suffered a slowdown in 2019 as a cyclical downturn in smartphone sales caused the memory chip market to stall out. Soft sales of TVs also throttled the growth of its display-oriented businesses. However, its growth subsequently accelerated over the following two years as new 5G phones and OLED devices hit the market. Stay-at-home trends throughout the pandemic also generated strong tailwinds for the PC, data center, and smart TV markets.
As a result, Applied Materials' revenue and adjusted earnings grew 18% and 37%, respectively, in fiscal 2020 (which ended in October of the calendar year), while its adjusted gross margin expanded from 44% to 45.1%. In fiscal 2021, its revenue and adjusted EPS rose 34% and 64%, respectively, as its adjusted gross margin expanded again to 47.5%.
But in the first nine months of fiscal 2022, Applied Materials' revenue only grew 12% year over year to $19.0 billion. Its adjusted gross margin fell 40 basis points to 46.8%, and its adjusted EPS increased just 16%. For the full year, it expects its revenue and adjusted EPS to rise 11% and 3%, respectively.
It blames that deceleration on supply chain constraints instead of a cyclical slowdown and says its backlog continues to grow as the market's demand for its products outstrips its available supply.
ASML faces the same challenges
ASML also suffered a slowdown in 2019 as it struggled with the same smartphone and memory-related headwinds as Applied Materials. But it quickly overcame those challenges as the world's top foundries -- including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel -- lined up to buy and install new EUV systems to manufacture smaller and denser chips.
As the world's only producer of EUV systems -- which cost about $200 million each and require several planes to ship -- ASML held the golden tickets to winning the ""process race"" between those top foundries. That monopoly also gave it a lot more pricing power than other equipment makers.
That's why the past two years were so kind to ASML. In 2020, ASML's revenue rose 18%, its gross margin jumped from 44.7% to 48.6%, and its EPS surged 38%. In 2021, its revenue grew 33%, its gross margin rose to 52.7%, and its EPS surged 69%.
But this year, ASML expects its revenue to only rise about 10% and for its gross margin to slip to 49% to 50%. Analysts expect its EPS to dip 3%.
Like Applied Materials, ASML attributes that slowdown to supply chain constraints instead of softer demand. During its latest conference call, CEO Peter Wennink said the market's demand for its systems still ""significantly exceeds"" its supply. It also didn't alter its long-term target of generating 24 billion to 30 billion euros ($30 billion) in revenue by 2025, which implies its revenue could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of up to 13% over the next four years.
Which stock is a better value?
Applied Materials and ASML face many of the same near-term headwinds, but they could both recover quickly as the supply chain constraints ease.

ASML's growth could experience a speedier recovery as it resumes its shipments of current-gen EUV systems and launches next-gen EUV for even smaller nodes. However, ASML's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 42 indicates a lot of that growth has already been priced in. Applied Materials only trades at 13 times forward earnings.
Both of these stocks are good long-term investments, but I'd still pick ASML over Applied Materials for three simple reasons: It monopolizes a cornerstone technology of the semiconductor sector, its business model is simpler, and its growth rates are higher.

2022-08-20 00:00:00+00:00,3 Hail Mary Plays to Bring Your Stock Portfolio Back From the Brink,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-hail-mary-plays-to-bring-your-stock-portfolio-back-from-the-brink-0,,,"Every investor's portfolio suffers a setback every now and then. Some investors' setbacks, however, are bigger than others. A few of them can even be downright punishing thanks to strategies that just didn't pan out.
If you're a part of this unlucky crowd, it's OK. While there's lost ground you may never fully make up and you'll have to invest aggressively to close some of the gap your losses left behind, you're not knocked out yet. Here's a rundown of three higher-risk but higher-reward prospects that just might put your portfolio back on track.
Advanced Micro Devices
In a market that includes powerhouses like Intel and Nvidia, it's tough for a third, smaller name like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) to find -- and keep -- a foothold. But AMD has carved out a nice niche for itself within the consumer market, while also doing a surprising amount of enterprise and data center business.
You may be more familiar with Advanced Micro Devices than you realize. This is the name behind Radeon graphics cards, Ryzen computer processors, and Epyc processors for servers. It also offers a robust suite of software that makes its hardware even more powerful, including artificial intelligence applications.
Investors keeping tabs on the computer-tech arena know it's been a tough road to travel of late, and things won't get any easier anytime soon. Not only has the worldwide chip shortage made it difficult to get all of the components needed to make hardware, but it also looks like an economic headwind is blowing. Mercury Research recently reported that second-quarter desktop computer-processor sales fell to a 30-year low, and Intel just lowered its full-year guidance due to waning PC demand. Advanced Micro Devices sort-of followed suit, as did Nvidia, with the red flags collectively working against all three of these stocks.
If it seems like AMD shares are holding up better than its key rivals' stocks though, you're not wrong. And there's a good reason. Even with all the industry's headaches, AMD found a way to grow its top line to the tune of 70% during its fiscal second quarter with each of its key operating segments showing progress of some sort.
The strong quarter underscores a couple of key ideas about the company's business, one of which is that Advanced Micro Devices can successfully navigate the complicated environment. The other idea is, value is always marketable. PC owners get more computing bang for their buck with AMD graphics processors and central processors, as do its enterprise-level and OEM customers. The stock's broad weakness since late last year doesn't make a lot of sense. Its recent strength suggests investors are starting to figure this out.
General Electric
It was already being viewed as a relic by the early 2000s when the world was becoming digitized. After billions of dollars' worth of accounting concerns were uncovered beginning in 2017 though, investors began to completely throw in the towel on General Electric (NYSE: GE). Shares currently sit nearly 70% below 2016's close and more than 80% under its 2000 high, remaining within sight of multi-year lows reached in mid-2020. Yikes.
What's largely been obscured by the pandemic, politics, the mainstreaming of electric vehicles, the explosion of on-demand streaming video, the continued collapse of brick-and-mortar retailing, and dozens of other distractions: This is not the GE of yesteryear. General Electric has steadily been shedding units that don't quite fit in anymore. It's out of the locomotive business, for instance, selling GE Transportation to Wabtec in early 2019. It also sold its aircraft leasing business last year.
After these and other divestitures, what shareholders are left with is a GE with a narrower focus on fewer -- but more relevant -- operating units. Healthcare equipment, power generation, renewable energy, and aviation are the only businesses left in its wheelhouse, and even then the company intends to become more focused. Before the end of 2024, General Electric plans on splitting itself up into three separate and distinct publicly-traded entities. This should unlock the pent-up value that's still not being fully priced into shares now.
It remains to be seen how much the market will collectively appreciate (and value) these three organizations. It's a reasonably safe bet, however, that the breakup will add net value -- if only because there's greater transparency.
Upstart Holdings
Finally, add Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ: UPST) to your list of Hail Mary prospects that could restore a big portion of your portfolio's value.
If you're not familiar, Upstart is a new kind of credit rating bureau. Rather than a formulaic approach based on an individual's bill-paying history, debt levels, and income, Upstart uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to determine a person's likelihood of paying on a loan. And the approach works! The company reports its lender clients see 75% fewer loan defaults than large U.S. banks do with no fewer loan approvals.
Investors watching this company may know this metric isn't necessarily convincing every lender that needs to regularly run credit checks. Its second-quarter results were less than thrilling, and guidance for the quarter now underway was even less impressive. The company's calling for third-quarter revenue of only $170 million, down from last quarter's $228 million, and below analysts' consensus of $179.4 million. Following the release of the report and outlook, this stock's now down more than 90% from its late-2021 high.
The brewing revenue lull isn't so much an indictment of Upstart's product, however, as it an indication of a weakening economy. Although that's a problem to be sure, it's also a temporary one. The same goes for the stock's pullback. While it looks ugly and has proven painful for patient shareholders, the underlying premise of the company's business model makes sense.
We're moving into an era where individuals are seen as more than a mere numerical formula (and rightfully so). Upstart's creditworthiness measures are a scalable, automated way for lenders to take a more thoughtful and lower-risk approach to approving loans. To this end, despite the current headwinds, analysts still expect top-line growth of more than 10% this year to accelerate by 16% next year, rekindling earnings growth in the process.

2022-08-18 00:00:00+00:00,How the U.S. Is Building Its Semiconductor Ecosystem,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-the-u.s.-is-building-its-semiconductor-ecosystem,,,"M
icrochips, often dubbed as the brain of any computing device, are core to devices all around us be it a smartphone, game console, MRI scanner or a defense system. The dynamics in the chip market are complex, and the damage that can be caused by a breakdown in the supply chain can extend much beyond economics. The chip shortage caused by the pandemic and geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China have awakened governments across the globe to the fact that localization of chip manufacturing is critical to national and economic security.
Here’s an overview of how the U.S. is working to reduce dependency for chip manufacturing from East Asia by strengthening its own ecosystem.
The chip market and its supply chain have many elements with different companies and nations dominating each one. The U.S. semiconductor industry has consistently accounted for 45% to 50% of global revenues. In 2021, the global semiconductor sales reached $556 billion, out of which the U.S. semiconductor companies accounted $258 billion or 46% of the global market.
The first segment is the electronic design automation (EDA) which “consists of software, hardware, and services with the collective goal of assisting in the definition, planning, design, implementation, verification, and subsequent manufacturing of semiconductor devices, or chips.” The U.S. remains the unchallenged leader in the electronic design automation (EDA) tools, controlling about 85% of the world market. Synopsys (SNPS) and Cadence (CDNS) together account for 62% of the total market share. The global EDA market is expected to reach $22.21 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.1% from 2022 to 2030.
Another layer of critical inputs in the semiconductor supply chain is the specialized equipment. In semiconductor manufacturing inputs, the U.S. retains a strong position with more than 50% of the market share as against 2% for China. Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX), KLA (KLAC) and Teradyne (TER) are some of the key U.S. players in this market. The global semiconductor manufacturing equipment market, valued at $95.3 billion in 2021, is projected to reach $175.0 billion by 2027.
The third important segment is specialized chemicals and materials. The global electronic chemicals and materials market valued at $62.51 billion in 2021 is expected to reach a value of $ 91.21 billion by 2027. Some of the prominent American companies operating in this sphere are Air Products (APD), Dow Chemical, DuPont (DD), CMC Materials (formally Cabot Microelectronics).
While the U.S. has held its dominance in these segments, there is a huge gap in the fourth part created by an erosion in its manufacturing capacity.
“America invented the semiconductor, but today produces about 10% of the world’s supply—and none of the most advanced chips. Instead, we rely on East Asia for 75% of global production,” as per a White House report.
The huge dependence of the U.S. on Taiwan is reflective in the region wise sales revenue of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TMC). The company’s revenue from the U.S. during 2021 stood at 64% vis-à-vis 61.07% in 2020 while China’s share declined from 17.46% in 2020 to 10.37% in 2021.
Back in 2020, a BCG report highlighted that, “only 6% of the new global capacity in development will be in the U.S. In contrast, it is projected that during the next decade China will add about 40% of the new capacity and become the largest semiconductor manufacturing location in the world.”
Efforts are being made to change such predications. Here’s an overview of the announcements and investments in 2022.
In January 2022, Intel (INTC) announced plans for an initial investment of more than $20 billion in the construction of two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio. The construction is expected to begin late in 2022 while production will go online in 2025. “Ohio will be home to Intel’s first new manufacturing site location in 40 years,” as per the company’s statement.
In February, Intel’s decision to acquire Tower Semiconductor (TSEM) to strengthen its global, end-to-end foundry business for approximately $5.4 billion was announced. TSEM, a leading foundry for analog semiconductor solutions, owns two manufacturing facilities in Israel, the U.S., Japan and Italy (some are via percentage stake and partnerships). 
In addition to investing in the U.S., companies are extending support to manufacturing units in Europe. Intel plans to invest €80 billion in the European Union over the next decade along the entire semiconductor value chain right from research and development (R&D) to manufacturing to state-of-the art packaging technologies. In March, Intel announced the initial investment €17 billion into a fab mega-site in Germany, R&D, and design hub in France, and to invest in R&D, manufacturing, and foundry services in Ireland, Italy, Poland and Spain. 
Texas Instruments (TXN) plans to spend around an average of $3.5 billion annually on Capex in the next four years from 2022 to 2025. During the earnings call in April, the company clarified that $3.5 billion is an average and they are likely to run below this in 2022 and would run higher in the next three years.
The Chip and Science Act of 2022 was passed by the Congress in July and Signed by President Biden this month. The Act provides $52.7 billion for American semiconductor R&D, manufacturing and workforce development. It also offers a 25% investment tax credit for capital expenses for manufacturing of semiconductors and related equipment. 
The passage of the Act has spurred companies to announce additional investments in American semiconductor manufacturing.
Micron (MU), the only U.S.-based manufacturer of memory, announced its plans to invest $40 billion through the end of the decade to build leading-edge memory manufacturing in multiple phases. The investment will create up to 40,000 American jobs. This investment aligns with the Micron’s plan of $150+ billion global investment in manufacturing and R&D over the next decade. Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO and President of Micron said that the CHIPS and Science Act “will enable Micron to grow domestic production of memory from less than 2% to up to 10% of the global market in the next decade, making the U.S. home to the most advanced memory manufacturing and R&D in the world.”
To secure long-term supply, Qualcomm (QCOM) will be buying an additional $4.2 billion in semiconductor chips from GlobalFoundries’ (GFS) upstate New York facility. This builds on a prior $3.2 billion purchasing agreement between the two companies taking the total commitment to $7.4 billion through 2028. Qualcomm plans to “increase semiconductor production in the U.S. by up to 50% over the next five years.” GlobalFoundries is the only American company to rank among the top five semiconductor foundries globally. In July, GlobalFoundries and STMicroelectronics (STM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to create a new, jointly operated 300-mm semiconductor manufacturing facility in France. 
In addition, TSMC recently celebrated placing the last beam which is the construction industry is known as a “topping” milestone in FAB 21’s fab building. Two years ago, TSMC announced its intention to invest $12 billions to build a 5-nanometer semiconductor fab in Arizona.

Although the Nasdaq Composite remains down 18.3% year to date, the tech barometer has gained 11.4% over the past month in light of better-than-expected inflation data for the month of July.
Still, many of big tech's finest businesses, such as Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), remain notably in the red. The chipmaker's stock has plummeted 39% since the beginning of the year, which should catch the attention of long-term tech investors. With that in mind, is now the right time to pounce on the tech giant's stock? Let's examine its current situation to discover why or why not.

Nvidia will face a bumpy road in the short run
Nvch is primarily known for designing and manufacturing graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming, cryptocurrency mining, and a wide range of other business applications, recently announced preliminary second-quarter results that were weaker than expected. The company, which will report its full earnings on Aug. 24, noted in a press release that its second-quarter revenue will likely finish around $6.7 billion, compared to the $8.1 billion it was initially projecting. The tech behemoth linked the shortcoming to weaker gaming revenue, which it generates predominantly through the sale of its best-in-class GPUs.
The downgraded revenue forecast for its gaming segment is likely connected to macroeconomic conditions like high inflation and rising interest rates, which have temporarily softened demand for its GPUs. As a result of management's adjusted guidance, Nvidia's gaming revenue, which made up roughly 46% of total sales last year, is expected to decline 30% year over year to $2.04 billion. Altogether, its newly guided total revenue forecast of $6.7 billion translates to just 3% growth from the same quarter a year ago.
At the moment, the tech giant pegs a price-to-earnings multiple of 51.0, which represents its lowest trading level since the initial March 2020 COVID-19 sell-off. To boot, it's also trading below its five-year mean price-to-earnings multiple of 59.0. Whenever a top-quality stock like Nvidia dips below its historical valuation levels, it's typically not a bad idea to give it a close look. While growth may be patchy for the foreseeable future, the long-term fundamental outlook of the company's business remains largely unchanged. Plus, Wall Street analysts still forecast the tech leader's top and bottom lines to grow 15.3% and 20.3% year over year for the full fiscal year, respectively. Those are still solid growth rates, so investors should think twice before overreacting to the fresh news.
But is the stock a good buy today?
Flaunting a 21% share of the GPU market, second only to Intel, Nvidia is poised to benefit from the sprouting industry. According to Allied Market Research, the global GPU market will be worth $201 billion by 2027, translating to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.6% from 2021. While runaway inflation and rising interest rates may have temporarily lessened demand, these headwinds are only short-term in nature and should not impact your long-term investment thesis on Nvidia. Thus, the recent tieback in the tech giant's stock price has introduced a terrific buying opportunity to savvy investors.

This video was recorded on August 12, 2022.
Chris Hill: Software, chipmakers, restaurants, inflation, entertainment, and more. It must be Friday. Motley Fool Money starts now.
It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me in studio, Motley Fool Senior Analyst, Emily Flippen and Jason Moser. Good to you see both.
Jason Moser: Hey.
Emily Flippen: Hey there.
Chris Hill: We've got another big week of earnings. We will dip into the Fool mailbag and as always, we got a couple of stocks on our radar. But we begin with the big macro. Inflation moving lower helped push the stock market higher. The national average for the price of gas is now below four dollars a gallon and Wednesday CPI report showed consumer prices up 8.5 percent in July, which is lower than Wall Street was expecting. Don't look now Emily, but the Nasdaq is officially in bull market territory.
Emily Flippen: Well, now that you've mentioned it, Chris, inevitably, next week we're looking at some horrendous news story that's going to push us back down. But for the time being, we can all head into the weekend probably feeling pretty good about ourselves and the economy. Although I will say you should take these numbers with a grain of salt. As you mentioned, that national average price for gas falling below four dollars a gallon that has an outsized impact on our inflation metrics. The majority of the pullback inflation did come from energy, while things like food and housing still remain pretty elevated for the average American consumer and that is certainly taking its toll on companies. When you look at the businesses that have reported earnings over this past quarter, while these are reflective of what's happened in the past, a ton of them have pulled back guidance on expectations for weakening consumer demand, a worst global economy. This is a step in the right direction, but we're certainly not out of the woods yet.
Jason Moser: You know what they say about bear markets, Chris, or just bull markets waiting to happen. Now we are right back to where we want to be at least in the near term. I agree with Emily. I think that this is a great narrative, a great story for the time being. I don't think it means that the rest of the year is just going to be sunshine and lollipops. Essentially the same thing is going on in the world right now that have put us in this position here that we're in right now. My suspicion is this back half of the year is going to be somewhat volatile. That'd be very interesting to see next earnings season how they frame how the holiday season coming up. It does still hurt to go to the grocery store, speaking as someone who goes to the grocery store a lot. I was listening to I think it might have been yesterday's show, maybe it was the day before, but Tim Beyers was talking about how before you could go to the store, he was witnessing this. Go to the store, you get two roast chickens for $10, and now he gets that one roast chicken for nine dollars. Those are real material costs that families are bearing every day. It is nice to see fuel prices take a little bit of a dip there, but it's worth remembering the consumer is still in a tough spot in a lot of ways.
Emily Flippen: Well, I'll tell you what I'm watching. Well, inflation is this a lagging indicator telling us what has happened. I like to look at hiring for businesses because that shows you their expectations for how their business is going to perform in the back half of the year and we've seen hiring actually increase and while a lot of this is for service industries, that's the metric I'm looking at to tell, OK, are businesses expecting things to get better or are they still expecting things to get worse?
Chris Hill: Shares of Disney up this week after a third-quarter report that featured the following headlines, Parks' revenue rose 72 percent, the total number of streaming subscribers to Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, and Hulu is now greater than the total number of Netflix subscribers. Yes, Jason, the price of those services is going higher, so what's the biggest news out of Disney for you?
Jason Moser: I think you summed it up quite nicely there, Chris, next story. [laughs] I think the main focus on Disney clearly has been the streaming operations here recently and that makes sense. It's the newest dynamic, but you said it. Don't sleep on the park side of this business. That's a massive driver that's such a differentiator, and then now it really does look like traffic is coming back and you look at the performance, their revenue up over 72 percent, operating income more than doubled. That really shows how they're able to leverage those massive properties and take advantage of that growing traffic and they're able to raise prices a little bit along the way there as well.
Per capita spending at the domestic Parks up 10 percent versus the third quarter of 2021 up over 40 percent from fiscal 2019 with occupancy rates at their property at 90 percent now. The property hotel is 90 percent. Those things are not cheap. I think it's astounding what they've done with the streaming services in such short order. To have a subscriber base, essentially the size of Netflix has now granted their spreading it across a number of different properties, but don't hate the player, hate the game because that's a big deal, but that's something we've always touted with Disney. All of that IP, those properties that makes a big difference unlike the parks, it's a tremendous differentiator for this business.
Chris Hill: Although they did also take the opportunity to lower their target for 2024, they did pull down that number of how many subscribers they think they're going to have by 2024. In part, I'm assuming because they are raising prices and they have to expect some drop-off.
Jason Moser: Yeah, part of that also was due to the Disney Plus Hotstar product over in India. I think it's an making some bids for content over there that leads them to be a little bit more conservative right now. Honestly, I don't think any of us were really surprised by that. We felt like that 230-260 goal was relatively high. They're pulling back on content, spend a little bit this year just going to spend $30 billion now as opposed to 32 billion. But hey, listen, it's nice to have a company where you can afford to write those checks. I think they're going to continue to do that for the foreseeable future and ultimately getting the streaming operation to profitability by 2024, which is the goal.
Chris Hill: Axon Enterprises reported record revenue in the second quarter. They raised full-year guidance and shares of the security tech company up 10 percent this week. Emily, it's been a challenging past 12 months for Axon, but it seems like they are riding the ship.
Emily Flippen: Well, Axon is in a really interesting position because what they're doing is still transforming what is largely a hardware based company to a subscription style cloud software-based solution and we saw that succeeding in this recent quarter. Part of the reason why the past year has been troubling for Axon is because they're not consistently profitable. They don't consistently generate a ton of cash flow. The market has been hammering these type of growth companies that grow at the sacrifice of their bottom-line profits, but this quarter was actually incredible, not just because they beat earnings guidance and revenue guidance, not just because they raise their guidance for the remainder of the year, but because they actually generated positive operating margin, the largest in their history up over seven percent. They're showing some level of scalability, which is going back to the success of creating these cloud-based solutions. It's no longer just a story about Tasers and body cameras, although those are still growing dramatically for this business, it's a global security suite that serves anybody who's working to protect public interests. That's records management, that's evidenced management, that's dispatch solutions, all of these things, even including VR training, they're getting a lot of traction in the market here.
Chris Hill: Assuming this evolution of the business goes the way they wanted to, will one of the results be the revenue and the profits become more predictable?
Emily Flippen: Exactly. In fact, you heard management for the first time in a while talking about that pathway to free cash flow and profitability and are really clear way in this most recent quarter because I think they're seeing that pathway for themselves clearer than ever. Although I will say this is a company that still wants to heavily invest in their product suite. They want to be the best-in-class and CEO Rick Smith is an eccentric CEO, but certainly a visionary in the sense that he wants Axon to be the best player to genuinely reduce the number of lethal desk that happened from things like police forces, and that's a big mission that's going to require massive capital investment. They see the pathways to profitability, but there are no means going to sacrifice long-term growth for the sake of their bottom-line.
Chris Hill: Marqeta CEO Jason Gardner said he's stepping down because he is not the best person to lead the payment processor through its next stage of growth. Gardner is going to stay on as Chairman of the Board, shares of Marqeta down more than 15 percent this week, Jason. What do you think?
Jason Moser: On the one hand, it does seem like it's a strong reaction to a business that really is performing very well. But by the same token, when you get big turnover in executive leadership in such a short span, we saw the CFO take off a little while back. CEO was leaving, CEO moving over to the Executive Chair. That is a big transition, so it's understandable, at least the concern but generally speaking, again, I'm not losing sleep over the report. Let's talk about the numbers here. Total processing volume of $40 billion was up 53 percent from a year ago. But interestingly, their total payment volume for the three months ending in June of this year, for the three months exceeded the total payment volume for the 12 months ending June 2020. These guys are growing. They're putting a lot of money through that network. Net revenue, $187 million.
That was also up 53 percent from a year ago, gross margin hanging in there at 42 percent. A big point of focus for investors with this company is their reliance or the relationship with block formerly square. Block accounted for 69 percent of net revenue that was up from 66 percent in the first-quarter just a tick there. But you also look at it was 72 percent a year ago. It is down slightly from a year ago and it's also worth remembering, they're going to succeed as block succeeds. When blocks succeeds, that's going to translate to more successful Marqeta. Something to keep an eye on there. The total payment volume from customers, block clearly in that top 5, outside of the top 5, the total payment volume grew at three times the pace of their top 5 customers.
It looks like they're really winning all our fronts there, which is nice to see. Guiding for a third-quarter revenue at 37 percent at the midpoint. They are being a little bit conservative there as new customers are being a little bit more deliberate in how they're investing in their payment programs there. But I mean, you go back to it, the big news there was the founder and CEO Jason Gardner stepping down soon. They're going to begin the search for the CEO and he's going to step over to the Executive Chair role and you said it. He was very transparent about this on the call. This was because he feels like he doesn't have the skill set to take this business to the next level in what is a very nuanced and complicated industry. Frankly, in my book, that's the self awareness you want to see from a CEO that has an opportunity to build a company really capitalize on such a massive market as this one.
Chris Hill: After the break, we've got the latest on software digital advertising, and the business of salad. This isn't one of those other shows. This is Motley Fool Money.
Chris Hill: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here in studio with Jason Moser and Emily Flippen. Unity software second-quarter results got overshadowed by the announcement from AppLovin, a gaming software company in which AppLovin announced an offer to buy Unity software in an all stock deal worth $17.5 billion. Complicating matters is the fact that Unity had previously announced plans to buy one of AppLovin's competitors a company called ironSource. Emily, what is going on here.
Emily Flippen: Honestly, Chris, your guess is as good as Unity's at this point. Although I will say after Unity reported what was a pretty disappointing quarter, they must be feeling like the bell of the ball because not only is there stock-up, but it seems like everybody wants to be Unity's partner. But this deal in particular, may be these strangest acquisition/merger that I've ever seen, which is to say that AppLovin came public with an offer to acquire a company that is effectively larger than them. Allow the CEO of that company to takeover, allow the board of that company to takeover, but to change the name to AppLovin. A good [laughs] way to summarize what's happened is AppLovin came to Unity and said, ""Hey, you want to change your name? You can keep everything else but change your name with us."" I think it's a pretty clear answer as Unity shareholder myself and as we've seen from the public reaction to this offer, it's doubtful that Unity moves forward with this, especially since they've already announced that nearly $4.5 billion deal to acquire ironSource.
What is interesting though is that Unity has made no public statement about this acquisition to date other than saying that the board is reviewing the deal. IronSource did come out and tell shareholders and employees in an internal memo that they think that their offer and their combination will be more competitive. But this whole situation is so odd. If I had to have my guess as to what's going on behind the scenes is AppLovin went to Unity and said, 'Hey, what do you think about this deal?"" Unity probably said, ""No we're not interested."" Then AppLovin said, ""Well, let's see what everyone else thinks."" Let's take it public and I think the market has answered that question for AppLovin. I doubt this moves anywhere. But it is certainly helping Unity shareholders this week.
Chris Hill: Shares of Upstart Holdings up nearly 15 percent this week after the FinTech lending platform got a boost from the better than expected news around inflation. Jason, it seems like that because after their second-quarter report and their conference call, seemed like a lot of investors are unsure of what strategy Upstart is trying to execute on.
Jason Moser: I mean, I think that's a fair concern. I think that investors really need the view the reception to this announcement as a tremendous win. I mean, it's a stock that's been taken to the woodshed here for very understandable reasons and we knew really the results coming in for this quarter because they pre-announced it, but the guidance that they offered for the current quarter. I mean, they're targeting $170 million in revenue versus the expectations of close to 250 million at the time. That's a significant downward guide. I think ultimately this is pretty much summed up, but the way that CEO David Gerard started the call. He said, I quote it, ""May be natural free to question whether Upstart's AI powered risk models aren't working as designed, but we're confident this isn't the case."" I mean, he's starting the call that way. There on the defensive because it's a company that's really lost control of the narrative, so to speak.
You look to a core ago where they were essentially started behaving more like a bank and taking loans onto their balance sheet. Fast-forward to this quarter, they've pivoted back taking action to convert those loans back into cash, puts them in a little bit of a desperate seller situation, ultimately impacted their revenue. I don't think that share repurchases are a wise use of capital at all for a business in this state. I mean, it sends a conflicting message, honestly. It's just a business with a ton of uncertainty right now. I think they need to make sure they keep their balance sheet in the best possible shape for the unknown. If this ends up working out, it ought to work out well for investors. I mean, there was a higher level of risk you're taking on with a company like this. I think it's also worth remembering. This is a little bit more difficult to understand this business. There are a lot of dots to connect with a business like this. Just make sure you feel comfortable connecting those dots in this value.
Chris Hill: As part of its second-quarter earnings announcements Sweetgreen also lowered its guidance for 2022 and said it's laying off five percent of employees. Shares of the salad chain initially fell more than 20 percent, but bounce back to finish the week just about even. Emily, they're trying to be the Chipotle of salad, but at the moment they don't have Chipotle's pricing power.
Emily Flippen: It certainly challenging for Sweetgreen, especially because Chipotle themselves had an incredible quarter. But what's so odd about this report is that the earnings itself, we're not bad at all. But they had to lower guidance pretty substantially and one of the comments management made was that there's a huge drop-off in same store sales. During April and May, same store sales growth was 21 percent. During June and July, it was seven percent. It fell off a cliff. The business is trying to be proactive with guidance here. But the big question mark is, do $15 salads really sell as well as $8 or $9 burritos. I'm not sure if I'm a buyer yet, but I will say just Sweetgreen stock looks a little bit more interesting to meet this week.
Chris Hill: Shares of The Trade Desk up more than 40 percent this week after strong second quarter results and guidance for the third quarter as well. Jason, this comes obviously against the backdrop of more services like Disney and Netflix looking to add advertising platforms.
Jason Moser: Absolutely connected TV for the win. I think this quarter in a nutshell, you look at revenue up 35 percent from a year ago and they saw meaningful growth across really all verticals have spend that the company serves. But it really, it's connected TV that is really driving this trains so to speak. I mean, you've got video representing low 40 percent of the overall business mix, but it continues to pick up more and more share of the overall business mix. They did see a healthy 45 percent boost in operating expenses, but that really is investing in the business and technology behind it. Macro factors that management called out specifically on the call really, it goes back to this ad-supported video on demand. It's this move toward ad-supported streaming. Then this idea that really is a new paradigm or [Alphabet's] Google isn't necessarily calling the shots when it comes to advertising. We've been really used to that narrative for a long time.
But Connected TV is changing at this UID 2.0, which is the alternative to cookies, offering up more personal experiences while protecting consumers, privacy and our data even more so. It really just puts Trade Desk in a very attractive position because they get to work with such a large base of customers. I mean, they just have essentially the largest base of customers in this market. The calling for 28 percent revenue growth this quarter. I think something to keep in mind too, there's some language in the call regarding Netflix and while Netflix partnered up with Microsoft, ultimately, green noted Jeffery Green on the call, noted that once they've done the work on the supply side in regard to Netflix, driving as much demand as possible toward those ad impressions will come next. Netflix is very well-positioned to open their ad inventory on the demand side, which is the Trade Desk, and that's something that really could play out through Trade Desk's financials further down the road.
Chris Hill: Guys, we'll see you later in the show. Up next, how to avoid the mental traps that can keep you from investing. Stay here. This is Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Chris Hill. Marsha Barnes is the founder and CEO of the Finance Bar, a company that helps women and couples achieve financial wellness. Motley Fool Senior Analyst Tim Beyers caught up with Barnes recently to talk about how to avoid the mindset traps that can keep people from investing.
Tim Beyers: You talk about, and we had a conversation before this interview, and I asked you a bit about some of the mindset traps that people get caught in when it comes to generating wealth of any kind. That includes things like stock market investing but may include also responsible use of credit. How you think about banking, how you think about credit overall, things like that. Can we talk a little bit about some of the most common mindset traps that you run into in doing this work?
Marsha Barnes: Yeah, absolutely. One of the most common is that oftentimes, let's say you get your first job Tim, or you're someone that you get promoted at work or you change careers, your so income is climbing. But many times the only thing that we're thinking about is, does this job help me to pay my bills? There's not many, emotionally, there's not this feeling of how does this job help me to generate wealth. One of the mindset traps is that just be glad that you have a job and you're able to survive and pay your bills. How many times there are conversation around when we go into different jobs, like how does this job help you build wealth? How will this job allow you to have more time with your family and friends? That's the number one trap that we hear the most of mindset trapping that just be glad that you have a job and you're surviving right now, like the time that we're currently and there's so much topple and news about a recession.
For the average individual, you're just going to freeze up. Stop spending money. Don't spend our money on things that you like, definitely don't invest right now. There's this scare-tactic that all wage drilled into our head, so it's really hard to move beyond this to just say that, just like I pay my bills every month, I should also be paying myself to help me build wealth and to make life a little bit easier for me and my family. That's one of the major mindset traps. Tim and the other is, as I mentioned before, that investing is just not for me. It's for the wealthy, is for the rich person is definitely not for me. I'm just a middle-class individual trying to pay my bills, helping my family out, my parents out, my grandparents out. That's a nice to have. We often look at investing as a nice to have, not a need to have in our life when absolutely, it is something that we need to have. It's just really hard to get beyond what we've heard many years ago. Like you have to have this amount of money to invest. Now at a time where it may not take you much to jump into this. Those are the biggest mindset traps that we really deal with at the Finance Bar.
Tim Beyers: Let's talk about some of the things personally you have learned in doing this work because, how many years has it been now since you founded the Finance Bar?
Marsha Barnes: Oh, that's been about almost seven years now.
Tim Beyers: It's been a while. I imagine there has been some interesting lessons you've learned in that time. Let's talk about that. What have you learned working with people, helping them get on firmer financial footing?
Marsha Barnes: I would say that the feeling really goes away, Tim. That has been the lesson for me, is that financial wellness, financial therapy, financial education, it never goes away. I view it as physically working out. Instead, one thing for money that's true is that it always follows us until the end of our lives. It does not go away. Our income can go up, our income can go down and there's always something to learn. That is what I personally learned. Something else that I've learned, Tim is that there are many ways to earn money that we hadn't been taught. We've been taught, as I've mentioned before, just get a job, be glad you have one and that's it. We often don't think about the many ways to earn money, the way that you want to invest and you still have a bit of fear about using your full-time check.
But what appears like a part-time gig that you have and it's only devoted to wealth generation or building wealth. That's another thing that I've learned it, and so you get beyond those roadblocks. Consider a different way to earn income does specifically, a lot easier for you to invest. There are just so many ways now. Those are two of the biggest lessons that I've learned, but also Tim, building the Finance Bar 100 percent changed my lives. Having an attachment to people, learning about their financial journeys has been both fulfilling. It has been a learning experience for me. You and I have talked about this before, what comes easy for one person mentally does not come easy for the other. That's something that I think it should be a learning lesson for all of us. What may be easy for you to do Tim, may not be easy for me. Those are the three biggest lessons that I've learned along the way personally.
Tim Beyers: Tell me if this is right because you drew a really interesting parallel earlier in this discussion Marsha, about financial management or financial wellness as similar or maybe analogous to working out. I wonder if maybe we could talk through that a little bit because I'm a 50-plus-year-old man, so my idea of working out is getting my steps in and if I do that, I'm good. But do you have, maybe it's habits or a routine when you teach some of this. I want you to fit everything into it because it seems like that's what you're saying is you want to have something that's holistic, that includes how you manage your checkbook, how you manage bills, how you manage your investing, group at all, talk us through some of that may be at a slightly more detailed level.
Marsha Barnes: Sure, so you just mentioned it, Tim. You said that I'm a 50-plus-year-old man and as long as I get my steps in, I'm good. But what you didn't say is that I'm a 50-year-old man and I just won't do anything. You said, as long as I get my steps in. Financial management is very similar if you are making sure that you can do your budget. Tim, if you're making sure that you're managing your debt if you make sure that I'm just giving you an example here that every month I'm committed to purchasing one stock. If I get to a certain point, let's say I have seven different stocks, I'm now committed to watching my portfolio. That is how you simplify financial management. Because as I mentioned, this is something that doesn't go away with money as you learn more, maybe you want to get more detailed into, should I buy more or what is this investment look like for me? That is the goal. Oftentimes we make investing as like this far away mystery land out in space somewhere.
But if we simplify it, my budget to make sure that I have guardrails around my finances a budget is not for deprivation, a budget is just to help you identify that I have everything like it, I'm not going up the road, Tim. My bills are paid, my needs are met. There are some loans in there that I have, I have savings in there. I need to still think for the future. I'm purchasing one stock per month. That's it. Then I'm just going to keep learning. Even if I learn more, maybe my method does not change until I feel like it needs to change. That is how it's very similar to working out. It's just the consistency and a rhythm, but you don't stop. That's the analogy that you mentioned earlier, as long as I get my steps in, so for me, as long as I've purchased the stock per month, I'm good. I don't need to get like it took fancy terms or like China build up this dictionary or an encyclopedia to sound smart. I need to keep it simple because simple plus actionable and taking action gets us results. It's not anything fancy. That is they can say, very similar comparison to physical activity and financial activity or financial management.
Chris Hill: Going up after the break, Domino's stopped selling pizza in the birthplace of pizza. Details next, so stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Marsha Barnes: Of course, my kid is in the right car seat, well, I think he is.
Chris Hill: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. Don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here in studio once again with Emily Flippen and Jason Moser. NVIDIA doesnt reportearnings until late August, but earlier this week, the graphics chip maker announced preliminary earnings showing second-quarter revenue will be solidly lower than they originally projected and not surprisingly, Jason. Shares of NVIDIA down a bit this week?
Jason Moser: Yes. To define solidly, we mean down 19 percent sequentially. To put some numbers around that, it's not that great of a look, but it is a risk that comes with a business like this when demand for a given sector slows down. We've talked a lot about companies that have pulled a lot of growth forward or the past couple of years. It seems like more and more, virtually every company did write some more than others. But gaming tailwinds of the past couple of years are normalizing a little bit and that's ultimately what this all boils down to. It's the second biggest revenue driver behind datacenter for NVIDIA. They're calling for revenue 2.04 billion.
It would be down 44 percent sequentially. The good thing for NVIDIA is that they are pursuing multiple large market opportunities beyond gaming. If you look at professional visualization, for example, yes, that's down 20 percent sequentially, but you look over a datacenter, which is the largest part of the business, that revenue is set to come in at $3.1 billion, up just 1 percent sequentially, but 61 percent from the year ago. Automotive as well up 59 percent sequentially up 45 percent from a year ago. All things considered to me, this is one of those situations. This isn't a long-term red flag unless you believe that gaming is in secular decline and I don't. To me, this stands out more as a timing thing than, than a fundamental issue that investors should expect to persist with the business, and often times those represent decent opportunities. NVIDIA is a high-quality business for sure.
Chris Hill: The business of Domino's Pizza has been fueled in large part by its international growth. Domino's is sold in more than 80 countries around the world. But this week, one of those countries got crossed off the list when the company announced it is closing each remaining stores in Italy. Emily, it's a pretty big swing for us pizza company to try and compete in the birthplace of pizza.
Emily Flippen: I'm going to entitle this commentary in defense of Domino's. Because I see a lot of news outlets running with this story laughing at Domino's Pizza and I take that personally as a Domino's fan [laughs]. I also spent a semester in foreign, so I'm qualified for my opinion on Italian pizza. I'm asserting, and I will say, I think that this story is being misrepresented. What killed Domino's in Italy was the pandemic. At the time, they are the only person who is really providing effective delivery service prior to COVID. Now once COVID has happened, all of these local mom-and-pop shops, the competition just increased exponentially, making it harder for them to compete for delivery of pizza. But here's what I'll say about Domino's Pizza versus Italian pizza, two different markets. It's like saying that you can have one market for New York style pizza and Chicago style pizza, it's a different consumer who's ordering one or the other. I'm convinced the person who is getting Domino's Pizza and Italy, I'm not quite sure that first and looks like, but I'm convinced that that person was probably not viewing the local mom-and-pop shop as a illegitimate substitute, especially considering that nice, garlicky, buttery crust.
Chris Hill: You can email questions to podcasts@fool.com or your comments on pizza, podcasts@fool.com is the email address to hit. Question from Jonathan, who writes, I've been looking at Intel recently as a buying opportunity. My problem is it's already one of my largest investments. It's currently about seven percent in my 401K portfolio. Personally, I'd be willing to go up to 10 percent. It seems so cheap with the current cost basis around $50 a share. I'm just worried I have blinders on as I love the long-term prospects of the company with their new plants and the government investing in chips, would love to hear your thoughts. Jonathan, thank you for the question. Jason, what do you think?
Jason Moser: Up to 10 percent for one shift companies sounds like an awful lot. I will say that. I mean, Intel certainly has the opportunity to benefit from tailwinds in the segment as we tried to invest more in our chip infrastructure you here domestically. But remember that they are the only player in town. A lot of other companies out there that present a lot of competition in chips, while they're the lifeblood of virtually everything that we do. Stilley, notoriously cyclical industry. I don't know to me, it just seems like a pretty big bet, perhaps unnecessarily.
Emily Flippen: I also think it's a big bet. I will say I like the chip industry, but diversification and a portfolio is key, as well as time horizon and risk tolerance. So all of those should be taken into an investor's portfolio. But I will say there's also a bit of interesting competition from AMD. If somebody is really interested in expanding Chip exposure, they really love this space. They're willing to wait it out and I guess whether the cyclicality of the space maybe consider adding AMD in addition to a business like Intel for maximum exposure.
Chris Hill: Let's get to the stocks on our radar. Our man behind-the-glass, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question. Jason Moser, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?
Jason Moser: Well, Masimo, ticker MASI, announced earnings this week as well. They're known primarily for healthcare technology in pulse oximetry, you're measuring the oxygen levels in the blood and inside note, Chris, I saw Masimo equipment in the wild here recently taking my daughters and for their annual checkups. I mean, I know our pediatrician probably thought them in total psycho nerding out at the fact that they had that equipment. But there you go. It was a good quarter consolidated revenue, $565 million, with healthcare revenue growing 17 percent or actually 19 percent in constant currency. The non-healthcare revenue, the consumer side of the business, $208 million. And that really comes back to the Sound United deal. That's the biggest question mark, I think with Masimo right now it was a big deal they made. They're ultimately trying to see exactly what they can do with it. They are making a foray into bio sensing watches, SmartStyle watches, which will learn about more as the year goes on as some interesting behind the scenes litigation there with Apple as well regarding that which could actually work out in Masimo's favor, but we'll learn more about that at our Investor Day in December.
Chris Hill: Dan, question about Masimo.
Dan Boyd: I'm pretty sure we talked about Masimo on the show. But I still always get excited, Chris, when I hear somebody talking about Masimo because I think erroneously that they're talking about Masimo, the fashion brand. I don't know if that's fashion. I just get excited about graphic tees.
Chris Hill: I mean, who doesn't? I'm onboard with graphic tees, if there was a rock solid publicly traded company selling graphic tees, I'd give that a closer look. Emily Flippen, what are you looking at this week?
Emily Flippen: I'm looking at Sonos this week, the ticker is SONO, but it's on my radar this week for a bad reason, the stock is actually down 25 percent after reporting earnings and which management had to dramatically cut its full-year revenue guidance is due to an anticipated pullback in consumer spending. They are, of course, the makers of an at-home sound devices. They do compete a lot with businesses like Amazon and Google in terms of their core products. But I liked their competitive positioning in terms of being built into the houses. They've constantly had above-average product. They did lose their CFO to Axon this week too, which is certainly hurting them as well. But I will say they're trading at around 15 times operating income right now. It's nothing to Scott bad for business that has managed to grow its top line every year since 2004.
Chris Hill: Dan, question about Sonos.
Dan Boyd: Are people still watching TV? I mean, maybe it's because I have a five month old baby at home. But the only time I am ever absorbing entertainment is like late at night on my computer alone. I don't know about Sonos, man. Seems like a bad bet to me.
Emily Flippen: Here's what I will say. It did just get back from Texas where I visited my parents and their new town home, which has this Sonos speakers built-in and they could not stop playing it. There are differing opinions out there Dan.
Chris Hill: Two very different businesses. Dan, you got a stock you want to add to your watchlist?
Dan Boyd: Well, I wish I could add Masimo, the graphic team made her, but so you got to pick between Masimo and Sonos I don't know, just because Jason saw it in the doctor's office. I'm going to go with Masimo.
Chris Hill: Boots on the ground research. There is no substitute people. Emily Flippen, Jason Moser. Thanks so much for being here.
Emily Flippen: Thanks Chris.
Chris Hill: That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money radio show. The show is mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Chris Hill. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next time.

2022-08-16 00:00:00+00:00,Cloud hangs over U.S. chipmakers on worries data center growth could slow,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cloud-hangs-over-u.s.-chipmakers-on-worries-data-center-growth-could-slow,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
Aug 16 (Reuters) - Cloud and data centers, the chip industry's strongest sector, may be its next problem: Signs are showing growth could slow in what has been a pillar during the COVID era as consumers signed up for cloud-based entertainment and companies retooled their offices.
Analysts say the cloud market has rarely had to weather a prolonged economic downturn since it rose to prominence in the last decade as more businesses adopted the technology, making it harder to predict if it's recession proof or it will be hit in an economic downtown.
As 40-year-high inflation weighs on consumers and economists debate recession signals, advertisers have been tightening their purse strings, say Big Tech companies.
“Investors are worried it's the next shoe to drop,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, adding that an advertising drought hurting the likes of Facebook META.O and Snapchat SNAP.N could spur cutbacks in data center investments.
Big Tech has reported slower annual cloud revenue growth rates this earnings season - Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Cloud dropped over 8 percentage points, Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Azure dropped 6 percentage points, and Amazon.com's AMZN.O AWS dropped over 3 percentage points compared with the previous quarter.
Nathaniel Harmon research director of YipitData said the revenue growth of the cloud market was still significant, although noted there were pockets of weakness in regions like Europe creeping in.
The three companies have also said during the pandemic they will keep data center equipment longer, in some cases up to six years, from three, to save money.
“If they're going to be cutting back their spending on data center capacity, well that's fewer chips from Intel or AMD,” said Glenn O'Donnell Research Director at Forrester Research.
That concern was heightened with Intel Corp's INTC.O data center and AI group business dropping 16% to $4.6 billion missing Wall Street estimates by nearly $2 billion in its latest quarterly earnings reported.
And last week Micron Technology Inc MU.O warned of an even worse than expected outlook, this time adding that there was trouble not just in PCs and smartphone, but also in the cloud.
But it's not as simple as slower growth of the cloud market that's causing trouble, Micron's chief business officer Sumit Sadana, told Reuters. Part of the problem was a shortage of some chips holding up servers from being built leading to a pile up of other chips - a situation similar to the auto chip shortage.
According to Richard Barnett, chief marketing officer at Supplyframe, inventories across the server supply chain are at record highs but key parts are missing. “Assume 500 components are needed for a server, and 10 or 20 unavailable parts are preventing its completion.”
Still Sadana warned that companies, worried about the economy, were also being more conservative about buying chips.
O'Donnell at Forrester said he's seeing this across the tech sector. “As we're talking with our clients about their spending plans, a lot of them are saying, well, you know, we're not going to turn off the faucet, but we're going to close it a bit,” he said. “You're going to see some of that reflected in earnings from companies like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise as well.”
While executives and analysts debate the impact of the slower growth in the cloud market, Super Micro Computer Inc .SMCI.O, which specializes in customized servers for new technology, said developments such as self-driving cars and the meta-verse are still bringing new waves of demand.
""There's a lot of pent up growth as projects go from lab projects to deployment,"" Michael McNerney, Super Micro's vice president of marketing and network security, said.

2022-08-16 00:00:00+00:00,See Which Of The Latest 13F Filers Holds Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/see-which-of-the-latest-13f-filers-holds-intel-1,,,"At Holdings Channel, we have reviewed the latest batch of the 78 most recent 13F filings for the 06/30/2022 reporting period, and noticed that Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) was held by 20 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.
Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.
Having given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in INTC positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:

In terms of shares owned, we count 7 of the above funds having increased existing INTC positions from 03/31/2022 to 06/30/2022, with 9 having decreased their positions and 2 new positions. Worth noting is that PDT Partners LLC, Kolinsky Wealth Management LLC, Winning Points Advisors LLC, DCM Advisors LLC, Greenlight Capital Inc., and Gateway Advisory LLC, included in this recent batch of 13F filers, exited INTC common stock as of 06/30/2022.
Looking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the INTC share count in the aggregate among all of the funds which held INTC at the 06/30/2022 reporting period (out of the 4,731 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of INTC shares those same funds held back at the 03/31/2022 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for INTC. We found that between these two periods, funds increased their holdings by 36,182,873 shares in the aggregate, from 1,716,512,284 up to 1,752,695,157 for a share count increase of approximately 2.11%. The overall top three funds holding INTC on 06/30/2022 were:

2022-08-16 00:00:00+00:00,"2 Top Dow Stocks to Buy on the Dip, and 1 to Brush Aside",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-top-dow-stocks-to-buy-on-the-dip-and-1-to-brush-aside,,,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is among the oldest stock market averages in the world. The index comprises 30 large-cap American companies, stocks like Walmart, American Express, and Microsoft.
The index is price-weighted, meaning that higher-priced stocks make up a larger percentage of the index than lower-priced stocks. For example, UnitedHealth, with a stock price near $540, makes up more than 10% of the index, while Coca-Cola, which trades near $63, makes up less than 1.3%.
Although the index is a fairly narrow measure of the U.S. stock market, it is often cited by media organizations to track market sentiment owing to its longevity and prominence. This year, the DJIA has come under pressure and is down about 7% year to date.
But for long-term investors, this sub-par year could offer opportunity. Many excellent companies now find their stocks below where they were at the start of 2022. So let's examine two companies worth buying on the dip and one to avoid.
Image source: Getty Images.
One to buy: Chevron
Many people associate the Dow with blue-chip stocks -- well-established companies with massive profits and impressive longevity -- and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) certainly fits that bill.
This fully integrated oil and gas major is only a few years away from the 150th anniversary of its founding. It's been a member of the Dow since 2008, and it comprises 3.1% of the overall index. The company operates in both the upstream (exploration and production) and downstream (refining, transportation, retail sales) areas of the energy market.
This sprawling infrastructure allows Chevron to produce huge results. The company recorded $206 billion of revenue over the last 12 months, helped by high prices for oil and natural gas.
While oil prices have somewhat leveled off near $90 a barrel, Chevron remains highly profitable at current prices. The company's break-even price for oil (the price at which it recoups its operating costs) is around $50. This means that at current prices, Chevron will continue to have a flood of free cash flow (FCF).
The company generated $24.1 billion of FCF over the last 12 months and returned much of it to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. It increased its share buyback program from $10 billion to $15 billion after reporting record profits at the end of July. And its dividend yield stands at a plump 4.2%.
All told, Chevron offers investors what they should expect from a Dow component: undeniable value, solid execution, and steady shareholder returns.
One to buy: Visa
My second pick to buy on the dip is Visa (NYSE: V), with its worldwide network that facilitates payment transactions. Visa was added to the Dow in 2013, and it is the seventh-largest component -- around 4.1% of the overall index.
In its most recent quarter, the company processed over $2.9 trillion in payments globally, resulting in 8% nominal year-over-year growth or 12% on a constant currency basis.
Owning shares of Visa is a great way to benefit from global economic growth. The company estimates that over 100 million businesses accept Visa-branded debit and credit cards worldwide. With over 3.8 billion cards in circulation and 232 billion annual transactions, its scale is enormous.
The company generates revenue by collecting a small fee for each of the millions of transactions completed daily. During the last 12 months, Visa generated $28 billion and an impressive $14.3 billion in net profit, good for a stout 52% profit margin.
Wall Street thinks the stock remains undervalued. Of the 39 analysts who cover the company, 35 rate it a buy or a strong buy, with none rating it lower than a hold.
Investors looking for a Dow component with a little bit of growth-stock flavor would be wise to sprinkle some Visa into their portfolio.
One to avoid: Intel
A blue-chip company may have been great, but that doesn't mean it will stay great -- and that might be the problem for Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) today. Added to the Dow back in 1999, Intel is now the smallest component of the Dow and makes up only 0.7% of the index.
The company was on the rise during the personal computing (PC) boom of the 1990s. But declining PC sales and a streak of disappointing earnings results have left Intel a shadow of its former self.
CEO Patrick Gelsinger went so far as to say that the company's recent results were ""below the standards we have set for the company and below the commitments we have made to [our] shareholders.""
If Intel were a sports franchise, it would be going through a rebuild. And while the company has a long-term strategy to reinvent itself, including plans to invest up to $20 billion in two new factories in Ohio, it will take time to right itself.
Its dividend yield of 4.1% and slim price-to-earnings ratio of 7.7 might entice some, but I worry the stock could become a value trap. Investors looking for the typical stability and shareholder returns that Dow components offer would be wise to pass on Intel for the time being.

2022-08-15 00:00:00+00:00,3 Semiconductor Stocks That Will Benefit From the CHIPS Act ,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-semiconductor-stocks-that-will-benefit-from-the-chips-act,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Semiconductor stocks have been in focus ever since President Joe Biden signed the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act into law on Aug. 9. The PHLX Semiconductor index is up around 5% since then. Of course, not all chip companies will benefit equally.
Before we get to which semiconductor stocks are likely to benefit most, it’s important to understand what the legislation aims to do. According to the White House:
The CHIPS and Science Act will boost American semiconductor research, development, and production, ensuring U.S. leadership in the technology that forms the foundation of everything from automobiles to household appliances to defense systems. America invented the semiconductor, but today produces about 10 percent of the world’s supply—and none of the most advanced chips…
The CHIPS and Science Act will unlock hundreds of billions more in private sector semiconductor investment across the country, including production essential to national defense and critical sectors.
In terms of actual numbers, the CHIPS and Science Act allocates $52.7 billion for semiconductor research, development, manufacturing and workforce development. That’s a lot of dough. So, let’s take a look at the semiconductor stocks likely to get a longer-term boost from the legislation.
INTC Intel $36.34
MU Micron Technology $64.70
TXN Texas Instruments $185.40
Intel (INTC)

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is not my favorite semiconductor stock, especially when you compare it to high-growth names like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which I like much better. But, in this case, we’re looking at semiconductor stocks that will benefit the most from the new CHIPS Act — and Intel is certainly on that list.
A Bank of America analyst estimates that Intel could receive $10 billion to $15 billion from the CHIPS Act over the next five years. While the analyst noted that it won’t be a “silver bullet” for Intel, the large amount of funds will certainly be a positive for the company. With any luck, it will help Intel develop more advanced chips, which it’s currently lacking.
Analysts expect an 11.3% decline in revenue this year and a whopping 37.5% decline in earnings. However, in 2023, estimates call for revenue and earnings growth of roughly 3% and 1%, respectively. That’s hardly impressive, but keep in mind that Intel is a mature company. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14.5 is well below that of AMD.
INTC stock is down 32% in the past 12 months. If shares have hit bottom, they could prove to be a steal for investors at these levels. Plus, there is the semiconductor stock’s 4%-plus dividend yield to consider.
Micron Technology (MU)

Following the passage of the CHIPS Act, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) said it will invest $40 billion in memory chip manufacturing through 2030, creating up to 40,000 jobs in the United States. The resultant additional capacity will take Micron’s U.S. market share from 2% to 10%, the company said.
Micron’s plans could include building a mega fabrication plant in the United States. Rob Beard, the company’s senior vice president and general counsel, said Micron has been eyeing a mega fab “for a long time.”
MU stock topped out in January and is down around 34% from its high. The company recently reported disappointing quarterly results and slashed its outlook. However, since hitting a 52-week low in early July, MU is up 26%.
Citi analysts say the stock has bottomed. If that’s the case, investors may still have a good entry opportunity with shares trading at just 6.3 times forward earnings.
Texas Instruments (TXN)

Last but certainly not least is Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). The stock has held up much better than many of its peers this year and the broader tech sector. MU is down just 2% year to date and only 9% below its all-time high.
The company already planned to make some sizable investments in its U.S. manufacturing capacity regardless of the CHIPS Act. CEO Rich Templeton called the recent legislation “gravy on top.” Any subsidies the company receives will mean less of a financial burden for Texas Instruments to shoulder.
Shares trade at roughly 20 times forward earnings with revenue forecast to grow about 10% this year. A 2.5% dividend yield offers a little more gravy for investors.
