2022-01-11 00:00:00+00:00,Why Shares of Intel Stock Rose Just 3.4% in 2021,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-shares-of-intel-stock-rose-just-3.4-in-2021,,,"What happened
While many semiconductor stocks surged along with the broader market in 2021, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) was notably left behind. The chip giant's stock gained just 3.4% last year, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, while the S&P 500 registered a 27% gain.
Intel has been struggling with manufacturing delays for years. The company finally acted in early 2021, luring Intel veteran Pat Gelsinger back from VMware to right the ship. Intel's squandered manufacturing lead led some to push for the company to spin off its manufacturing arm and focus on design.
Gelsinger took the exact opposite route. Intel is dramatically ramping up its capital spending, with plans to pour as much as $28 billion into its factories in 2022 alone. The company is aiming to win back its manufacturing edge while building out a world-class foundry business that makes chips for other companies.
The cost of this plan and the multiyear time frame of a turnaround weighed on the stock throughout 2021.

So what
Intel's manufacturing ambitions are going to reduce earnings until the company's investments pay off. Analysts are expecting earnings per share to plummet 30% in 2022. This expected earnings decline is part of the reason the market cooled on the stock in 2021.
Intel needs to make these investments for two reasons. First, the company must prevent rival Advanced Micro Devices from winning too much market share. AMD has combined solid designs with cutting-edge manufacturing from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to produce chips for both PCs and servers that go toe-to-toe with Intel's best. Intel's stumbles have enabled AMD to stage an incredible comeback.
Second, the semiconductor industry has expanded well beyond PCs and servers. Foundries are a $100 billion industry, making chips for automobiles, smartphones, and a wide variety of other devices and products. The only way Intel can tap into much of that demand is to tackle manufacturing.
The market is clearly not sold on Intel's strategy. A company that has been plagued by manufacturing problems for years doubling down on manufacturing at great cost is not a story that's resonating with investors.
Now what
While 2021 was a rough year for Intel, the company has a compelling long-term growth story. Beyond building out a foundry business that could eventually bring in billions in revenue each year, Intel is going after the graphics card market. The first of its Arc graphics cards is expected to launch early this year into a market that is dealing with short supply and high prices. If Intel can put out a decent product, it could scoop up meaningful market share.
Intel's dominance in the PC and server chip markets remains intact, albeit diminished. The company is still putting out good products. Its latest Alder Lake desktop CPUs are the king of the hill when it comes to PC gaming, for example. That dominance will help fund the company's heavy investments in manufacturing over the next few years.
Intel's turnaround is going to take time, and it's going to be expensive. But the market doesn't appear to be pricing in Intel's growth prospects.

2022-01-11 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Stock Gives Investors Plenty of Ways to Play It,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-stock-gives-investors-plenty-of-ways-to-play-it,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Investors in chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock have seen strong returns in the past 12 months.
Source: Fabio Alcini / Shutterstock.com
AMD stock is up 44%, and in late November hit a record high of $164.46. By comparison, the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index returned around 30% in the past 52 weeks.
However, since that peak, AMD shares have come under pressure and lost about 20%, now trading around $132. The chip darling’s 52-week range has been $72.50 – $164.46, and the market capitalization (cap) stands at $160.5 billion.
AMD is well-known for its central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), competing with peers Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Its chips power a range of electronics items.
Given the recent decline in price, AMD shareholders now wonder what might be in stock for the chip designer.
Therefore, today’s article will look at what to expect from Advanced Micro Devices in the new year.
How Q3 Earnings Came
AMD announced its Q3 financials on Oct. 26. Total net revenue increased by 54% year-over-year (YOY) and hit $4.31 billion, beating the group’s previous outlook.
Non-GAAP net income was $893 million for the third quarter compared to $501 million a year ago. As a result, adjusted EPS was 73 cents.
7 High Risk Stocks That Are Worth The Volatile Vibes
“AMD had another record quarter as revenue grew 54% and operating income doubled year-over-year,” CEO Dr. Lisa Su said. “Third Gen EPYC processor shipments ramped significantly in the quarter as our data center sales more than doubled year-over-year.”
In Q4, management expects revenue to be approximately $4.5 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 39% YOY. Wall Street was pleased with these robust Q3 metrics as well as the outlook.
This will be the year when Advanced Micro Devices completes the Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) acquisition.
InvestorPlace.com contributor Vandita Jadeja has recently written in-depth about how this transaction could help AMD create further shareholder value in the coming quarters.
Prior to the release of the quarterly results, AMD stock was around $123. Then, in a matter of weeks, it hit a record high shy of $165.
Now it is around $132. The company will next report Q4 earnings in late January.
Adding AMD Stock To Portfolios
Among 40 analysts polled, AMD stock has a “buy” rating. Also, the consensus of 34 analysts for the 12-month median price target stands at $142.50, implying an upside potential of over 7.5% from current levels.
The 12-month price estimates currently range between $80 and $180.
Advanced Micro Devices shares trade at 42.2 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and 11.4x times trailing sales. These valuation metrics imply that despite the decline in price, AMD stock is not necessarily cheap.
By comparison, these numbers for Intel are 13.9x and 2.6x, and the comparable metrics for Nvidia stand at 58.8x and 31.5x.
Long-term investors who are not concerned about short-term choppiness in AMD stock could consider investing around $125. Their price target should be analysts’ estimate of $142.50.
Others who are interested in Advanced Micro Device stock but want to diversify some of the risks away could buy an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds AMD as well.
Examples include the Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXQ), the VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF (NASDAQ:ESPO), the Viridi Cleaner Energy Crypto Mining & Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:RIGZ), the ProShares Nanotechnology ETF (NYSEARCA:TINY) or the Esoterica NextG Economy ETF (BATS:WUGI).
Cash-Secured Puts on AMD Stock
Finally, those readers who are experienced in options could also consider selling cash-secured puts. This strategy may be appropriate if you are slightly bullish or neutral on AMD stock at this time.
Selling cash-secured put options generates income as the seller receives a premium. Recently, Advanced Micro Device stock has been trading around $132.
If you sold the $120 strike put that expires on Feb. 18, you could collect about $4.90 in premium. Therefore, the maximum return for the seller on the day of expiry would be $490, excluding trading commissions and costs, if the option expires worthless.
If the put option is in the money (meaning AMD stock is lower than the strike price of $120) any time before or at expiration on Feb. 18, this put option can be assigned.
The seller would then be obligated to buy 100 shares of Advanced Micro Devices stock at the put option strike price of $120 for a total of $12,000 per contract. In that case, the trader ends up owning AMD stock for $120 per share, about 9% below the current price.
If the put seller gets assigned shares, the maximum risk is similar to that of stock ownership (the stock could theoretically fall to zero) but partially offset by the premium received ($490 for 100 shares).
The Bottom Line
Advanced Micro Devices has become one of the most important chip names. However, along with many other hot tech names, AMD stock is currently under pressure.
As Wall Street gets ready to hear quarterly metrics from the chipmaker, shares will likely stay volatile in the rest of the month.
Yet, if you are a long-term investor whose portfolio can handle short-term choppiness, then any further decline in AMD stock would mean an opportunity to buy into this growth name.

2022-01-10 00:00:00+00:00,Intel deletes reference to Xinjiang after backlash in China,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-deletes-reference-to-xinjiang-after-backlash-in-china,,,"BEIJING, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Intel has deleted references to Xinjiang from an annual letter to suppliers after the company faced a backlash in China for asking suppliers to avoid the sanctions-hit region.
Last month, Intel was slammed on Chinese social media for a letter to suppliers published on its website. The Dec. 23 letter said Intel had been ""required to ensure that its supply chain does not use any labour or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region"" following restrictions imposed by ""multiple governments"".
This paragraph, or any reference to Xinjiang or China, was no longer in the letter, according to a Reuters review of the same page on Tuesday. The letter now reads that the company prohibits ""any human trafficked or involuntary labour such as forced, debt bonded, prison, indentured, or slave labour throughout your extended supply chains.""
Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It apologised last month for the ""trouble"" it had caused, saying that its commitment to avoid supply chains from Xinjiang was an expression of compliance with U.S. law, rather than a statement of its position on the issue.
Multinational companies have come under pressure as they aim to comply with Xinjiang-related trade sanctions while continuing to operate in China, one of their biggest markets.
The United States has accused China of widespread human rights abuses in Xinjiang, home to the country's predominantly Muslim Uyghurs, including forced labour. Beijing has repeatedly denied the claims.
Intel's deletion of any reference to Xinjiang in its annual letter to suppliers, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, was criticised by U.S. Senator Marco Rubio.
“Intel’s cowardice is yet another predictable consequence of economic reliance on China,” Rubio said in a statement on Monday.
“Instead of humiliating apologies and self-censorship, companies should move their supply chains to countries that do not use slave labour or commit genocide.”
Rubio was one of four U.S. politicians who introduced the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act last month calling for a ban on imports from Xinjiang over allegations of forced labour there. On Dec. 23, U.S. President Joe Biden signed the act into law.

The markets started off with a bang on Monday, and not the good kind. However, bulls stepped up to the plate in the afternoon and helped erase almost all of the session’s losses. Now, let’s look at a few top stock trades as we kick off the week.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Roku (ROKU)

Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) has been buried from its highs and has been encapsulated in a painful bear market. There’s no denying that, but there’s also no denying that bulls can still trade this stock.
This morning, shares undercut Friday’s low and last week’s low at $178.61. That’s also as it traded down toward the 200-week moving average.
Earlier on Monday it regained that level, giving the stock a bullish reversal. From here, bulls will want to see if the stock can gain steam. Specifically, they are likely looking for a test of the December low near $190.
Above that, and the $200 level is in play along with the declining 10-day moving average.

On the downside, however, keep an eye on this week’s low. A break of it likely puts the 200-week moving average in play.

Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) has never impressed me very much, likely on account of how it got started in the public markets. Regardless, the stock is trying to find a bottom and Monday’s burst will help.
Shares reclaimed the 10-day moving average and cleared downtrend resistance (blue line), although the stock faded hard from Monday’s high and the 21-day moving average.
Both of those measures — this week’s high and the 21-day — are now the upside objective. If Tilray stock can clear those marks, then the 50-day moving average and $10 level are in play.
On the downside, though, keep an eye on the December low at $6.97, Monday’s low at $6.95 and the 10-day moving average. A break of this area could put the lows back in play.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is another stock I had my eye on earlier on Monday. While it was once a stock market darling, the selling pressure finally caught up to it.
In any regard, Monday morning’s gap down allowed it to — ironically — fill the gap from November near $267. Nvidia also tested the 21-week moving average on the dip. Bouncing now, let’s see if this one can gain some steam over $267.
Using Monday’s low as the stop, many bulls are looking for a rebound here. Specifically, let’s see if Nvidia can bounce back to the $284 area and the declining 10-day moving average.
Above that could put the 50-day moving average and $300 mark on the table.

On the downside, however, a break of Monday’s low is not a good look.
Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Intel (INTC)

Last but not least is Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), a stock that has had quite a bit of trouble over the years — especially compared to Nvidia.
Shares are holding the 10-day and 200-week moving averages, but struggling with the 200-day moving average and the December high at $55. If it can push through $55, the $56 mark will be the next hurdle.
There it finds the weekly VWAP measure and the fourth-quarter high.
Above that, and Intel has some breathing room, potentially up toward $60, then $62.25. That said, it’s not the cleanest chart I’ve ever seen. A break of $53 is a concern for me.

CES 2022 — the consumer electronics industry’s most important annual event — has just wrapped up in Las Vegas. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock announced new mobile GPUs as well as the eagerly anticipated Ryzen 6000 series laptop processors.

AMD has been trouncing rival Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in recent years, gaining computer processor market share at Intel’s expense as that company floundered. AMD has hit an all-time high share of laptop processor market share and the Ryzen 6000 CPUs have been seen as the key to accelerating that growth. However, AMD stock slumped by over 7% during the week.
In contrast, INTC stock has popped. What’s going on here? Did AMD drop the ball with its new Ryzen chips? Here’s an overview of what went down at CES 2022, why Intel is suddenly in the spotlight, and why there’s no need for AMD investors to panic.
Intel Fights Back
Going back to 2016, Intel dominated the market for computer processors. Globally, 82.5% of computers sold were equipped with Intel CPUs. AMD had just 17.5% of the market. 2016 was a critical year for AMD.

However, that December, the company announced a new series of processors called Ryzen. AMD’s new chips slowly began to eat away at Intel’s lead. AMD relentlessly improved and moved forward with advanced chips while Intel began to fall behind in its release schedule. As Ryzen chips got better, Intel suffered a corporate meltdown, chewing through CEOs and delaying new processor releases.
By last November, AMD had capitalized on Intel’s flailing to the point that its computer CPU market share reached the highest level since 2006. Worse for Intel, AMD was now making big inroads in the laptop market. Powered by the Ryzen 5000 mobile processors revealed at last year’s CES 2021, AMD’s share hit 22% — an all-time high — at a time when remote working has goosed laptop sales. The Ryzen 6000 series made its debut at CES 2022. However, this time Intel had an answer.
Intel unveiled 12th generation Intel Core mobile processors that employ a new hybrid architecture. Intel claims this is the biggest leap forward for its chips in a decade. The company immediately laid claim to having the world’s fastest laptop processor in the Core i9-12900HK.
The market reacted by punishing AMD stock, and giving INTC a bump.
CES Innovation Awards Chose AMD, Not Intel 
Where things get interesting are the CES Innovation awards. Every year, the Consumer Technology Association announces Innovation awards for “outstanding” products shown at that year’s CES. The judges include consumer technology engineers, designers, and media representatives.
At CES 2022, the AMD Ryzen 6000 series mobile processors received an Innovation award. Among the reasons listed for the recognition was the fact that the Ryzen 6000 series laptop chips are the first to be equipped with integrated graphics that are powerful enough to play demanding PC game titles without the need for a standalone GPU.
Intel’s new hybrid 12th generation Core processors failed to score a mention. It’s possible that Intel chose not to enter them in the competition. However, Intel did win a CES 2022 Innovation award for its Thunderbolt 4 connectivity standard. So the company was participating.
Is there a takeaway here? Intel’s dramatic mobile processor reveal made headlines, but the tech insiders are still looking at AMD’s Ryzen laptop chips as the horse to beat. 
Intel Will Take on AMD and Nvidia
Adding to the pro-Intel sentiment was news at CES 2022 that computer OEMs now have access to Intel’s new Arc GPUs.
For decades, the computer graphics card market has been split between AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Now Intel is entering the fray. Of the two GPU makers, Nvidia should probably be the most worried about this development. AMD and Intel both make computer CPUs, so they can integrate their own GPUs in their processors. They also have an opportunity to bundle their processors and graphics cards with OEMs.
Not surprisingly, NVDA stock was also down through CES 2022.   
Bottom Line
AMD stock has performed spectacularly since the company began its resurgence in late 2016. Over the past five years, it’s delivered a return of 1,187%. 
That being said, Intel is showing signs of finally getting its act together, and that is likely to mean challenging times ahead. I don’t think anyone’s expecting Intel to start pulling market share from AMD on the computer processor front. AMD’s Ryzen chips are extremely popular these days. However, Intel’s turnaround efforts are likely to slow AMD’s heady gains in recent years. 
As for Intel’s entry into the graphics card market, that’s a wait and see situation. The first generation Arc GPUs are going to have a hard time competing against the best from AMD and Nvidia. They’ll also have a battle winning over consumers and software developers who need to write drivers to optimize their performance.
The bottom line is this Portfolio Grader “B” rated stock is still positioned for long-term growth. The qualifier is that Intel is shaping up to be a serious competitor once again. If it succeeds, Intel’s recovery could well have the effect of keeping AMD stock growth at lower rates than the numbers investors have been enjoying in recent years.

For instance, Intel's latest Alder Lake central processing units (CPUs) are reportedly gaining market share against Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), as they are based on a competitive manufacturing process, are priced aggressively, and can deliver solid performance. And now, Intel is looking to turn up the heat with the launch of its Arc (codenamed Alchemist) discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) that could help it seize a lucrative market that is currently dominated by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).
Let's take a closer look at Intel's latest move in the multi-billion-dollar graphics cards market and check how this could be a big deal for the chip giant's comeback efforts.

Intel enters the discrete graphics cards market with a bang
On Jan. 4, Intel announced that it has begun shipments of its Arc discrete graphics cards. What's worth noting is that Chipzilla's discrete GPU designs have been selected by 50 laptop and desktop OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) that include the likes of ""Acer, ASUS, Clevo, Dell, Gigabyte, Haier, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, MSI, and NEC.""
The likes of Lenovo have already started making devices powered by Intel's discrete GPUs. Meanwhile, Acer is reportedly going to launch the world's first laptop powered by the chipmaker's discrete graphics cards. More importantly, it won't be surprising to see more OEMs select Intel's Arc chips, as the company is striking partnerships with game studios so that their titles support the technology its GPUs are packing.

Intel's Arc GPUs are equipped with ray-tracing technology. They also sport artificial intelligence-powered resolution upscaling and a proprietary Deep Link technology that Intel says can accelerate many workloads if the computer also features a compatible Intel processor. These features indicate that Intel is serious about making a dent in the discrete GPU market, as its cards are packed with technology on par with rivals.
For instance, Nvidia has been offering ray-tracing on its graphics cards for quite some time now, with more than 150 gaming titles supporting the technology that gives gamers an immersive experience. Meanwhile, Nvidia's cards are also equipped with deep learning super sampling (DLSS), a feature that improves the games' image quality and resolution.
So, Intel is looking to get into the GPU market with all guns blazing, and that could substantially boost the company's revenue in the long run. Here's why.
Chipzilla can seize a massive opportunity
Intel will be the third player in the discrete GPU market after Nvidia and AMD. According to Jon Peddie Research, Nvidia commanded 83% of this space in the third quarter of 2021, while AMD was left with the remaining 17%. Nvidia has dominated the graphics card market with an iron hand thanks to its robust supply chain and competitive RTX 30 series cards.
So, going after Nvidia would be an ambitious target for Intel right now, but it can mint big money even if it manages to take some share away from AMD. After all, Jon Peddie Research estimates that the discrete GPU market could be worth $54 billion in 2025 as compared to $23.6 billion in 2020. Now, it won't be surprising to see Intel eat into AMD's market share for a couple of reasons.
First, Intel's Arc GPUs are manufactured using TSMC's N6 process that's based on a 6-nanometer (nm) manufacturing node. That makes it smaller than AMD's current generation of graphics cards that are based on a 7nm manufacturing process.
A smaller manufacturing node means that the transistors on Intel's graphics cards will be packed more closely together. As a result, they should ideally be more powerful since they can carry out more calculations thanks to closely packed transistors while generating less heat, making them more power-efficient. This power-sipping profile could boost the adoption of Intel's discrete graphics cards and help the chipmaker take share away from AMD.
The second reason Intel's graphics cards pose a threat to AMD is the former's dominant share in the CPU market. Mercury Research estimates that Intel controls 75% of the global PC (personal computer) processor market. Now that Chipzilla is offering a Deep Link technology that promises to boost the performance of machines that will be powered by a combination of Intel CPUs and GPUs, customers may be enticed to opt for an Intel GPU to generate stronger performance from their devices.
Of course, it remains to be seen how Intel's GPUs will perform in the real world, but leaks indicate that the company's entry-level graphics card can hold its own against Nvidia's mid-range offerings such as the RTX 3050 Ti laptop graphics card.
In all, Intel seems to be entering the GPU market on a promising note. If the chipmaker can corner even 10% of this market in the next couple of years, it could add billions of dollars to its revenue that may act as a catalyst for the tech stock in the long run.

2022-01-07 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Stock: It’s Not Time to Give Up,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-stock%3A-its-not-time-to-give-up,,,"It's been a pretty good year for chip stocks -- even with the recent sell-off in the markets. Just look at the performances of companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM).
However, one notable company has been left out of the party: Intel (INTC). The shares were mostly flat for 2021. Although there was a promising rally early in the year, this quickly fizzled out.
Yet investors should not give up on Intel. The prospects for the company are starting to look better. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has put together a solid turnaround plan.
So I'm bullish on the stock, and let's see why.
What Went Wrong?
The poor performance for Intel stock is not a recent trend. The shares have treaded water since early 2018.
Though this should be no surprise. The fact is that Intel has lagged with innovation. There have also been nagging issues with product quality. Oh, and then there have been the supply-chain problems because of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, these dented the latest quarterly results, as sales for notebook chips plunged by 10%.
As a result, companies like Nvidia and AMD have capitalized on the problems. Note that Nvidia is now the largest chip company (in terms of market capitalization).
The Catalysts
Perhaps the most important positive for Intel is the company's new CEO, Pat Gelsinger. He worked at the company for 30 years and then moved over to run VMWare (VMW). Basically, he has a blend of strong technical chops and senior-level experience. While at Intel, he helped with the development of breakthrough chips like the 386 and 486.
The good news is that Gelsinger has wasted little time since becoming CEO of Intel. A big part of the turnaround strategy is to aggressively ramp chip production. The plan is to invest over $100 billion in new facilities in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
A key to the strategy will be to become a supplier to other chip companies. As seen with the success of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), it can be a lucrative business. The company's market cap is $650 billion versus Intel's $220 billion.
In the meantime, Gelsinger will be focused on the innovation of its chips. He wants to launch a new CPU (Central Processing Unit) each year through 2025.
Next, Gelsinger plans to take its Mobileye division public by the first half of 2022. Mobileye develops software and sophisticated cameras for auto safety and autonomous capabilities. In 2017, Intel acquired the company for $17 billion. Since then, the growth has continued to be strong. In the latest quarter, its revenues jumped by 39% to $326 million.
Intel estimates the value of Mobileye at $50 billion, and the company plans to retain a majority stake. With the IPO, the company is likely to get more visibility, which should help with growth. The proceeds from the IPO will also be helpful for funding Intel's production efforts.
Wall Street's Take
Turning to Wall Street, Intel earns a Hold consensus rating based on six Buys, 11 Holds, and 7 Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. Additionally, the average Intel price target of $55.29 puts the upside potential at 2.1%.
Summary and Conclusions
Intel's valuation is definitely at attractive levels. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at only 16x. There is also a nice dividend yield of 2.6%.
Now, a turnaround will take time. Gelsinger says it could take five years. Nonetheless, given the low valuation, the stock price could react quicker as the results improve. The fact is that expectations remain quite low.

2022-01-07 00:00:00+00:00,3 High-Yield Tech Stocks to Buy in January,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-high-yield-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-january-0,,,"If someone's headed closer to retirement, it is probably smart for them to assess their portfolio and switch out some riskier stocks for more durable, dependable companies. One way to do this is by finding some higher-yielding dividend stocks, which I identify as stocks with dividend yields above the market average. Currently, the S&P 500 has a dividend yield of 1.24%, which is near the all-time low looking back to 1900. The bar is not high to become a high-yield stock now, and even companies paying out 2% or more of their market cap as dividends are few and far between these days.
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) are three high-yielding tech stocks investors should consider buying in January. Here's why.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Intel Corporation: 2.56% yield
Intel is one of the dominant semiconductor (computer chip) manufacturers worldwide. It used to be the largest in the world back in the '90s and early 2000s but has since given up that crown to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC). This company manufactures chips for third parties like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. TSMC has eaten into Intel's business in the last decade and is now ahead of them technologically. However, with new CEO Pat Gelsinger at the helm, Intel is trying to rise to the challenge and regain some of the dominance it lost in semiconductor manufacturing in the past decade-plus.
In 2022, Intel plans on spending $22 billion to $25 billion in capital expenditures, according to its latest quarterly report. This will be up significantly from the $18 billion to $19 billion it spent in 2021 -- we won't know the exact number until the fourth-quarter earnings report comes out. A lot of this spending will go to two new factories in Arizona, which are estimated to cost $20 billion to build. Making capital expenditures is not necessarily a good thing. A company needs to get a good return on that capital investment to provide value to its shareholders.
Luckily for semiconductor companies, the end demand for the products is seeing a huge tailwind that should continue over the next decade-plus. Analysts predict that the industry will grow at a rate of 5% or more through 2030, which will provide a strong demand tailwind if Intel can execute in bringing technologically relevant products to market.
In 2021, management expected Intel to bring in $73.5 billion in revenue and $12.5 billion in free cash flow. It currently has a dividend yield of 2.56% and has raised its dividend almost every year since it instituted the dividend back in 2004. If Intel can continue generating cash while also growing its top line over the next decade, the stock should provide strong total returns for shareholders as well.
2. Texas Instruments: 2.44% yield
Speaking of semiconductors, Texas Instruments is another company in this durable and growing industry that should provide investors with solid returns over the next decade and beyond. Unlike Intel and TSMC, which focus on the fastest and most cutting-edge technology, Texas Instruments provides basic semiconductor chips to the industrial and automotive industries. It has tens of thousands of patents worldwide, which gives it a defensible position and little competition in selling specific semiconductor products.
Texas Instruments' model requires fewer capital expenditures than Intel and TSMC. Over the last 12 months, Texas Instruments has only spent $1.4 billion in capex, allowing a free cash flow of $7.1 billion and a free cash flow margin of 40%. It is returning a lot of this cash flow to shareholders in dividends, with a current yield of 2.44%. Management has grown its dividend per share every year since 2012.
This is not an exciting investment, but with minimal competition in a growing industry with minimal capital requirements, Texas Instruments can provide strong total returns for investors looking for a safer investment in their portfolios.
3. Cisco Systems: 2.44% yield
Cisco Systems used to be a darling of the dot-com bubble, reaching one of the largest market caps in the world back in 1999-2000. It has taken 20 years for the company to regain its stock price from the height of the bubble, but now it is doing so at a much more reasonable valuation.
Cisco's business is widespread, with tons of products. These include networking, the internet of things (IoT), wireless, security, and data center equipment and software that it sells to corporations and small businesses. It has been able to ride the computing and internet tailwind over the past few decades and now does $51 billion in revenue a year and generates around $14 billion in free cash flow. Given its size, Cisco is not expecting to grow rapidly in the coming decades, with revenue growth guidance of only 5% to 7% this fiscal year.
However, as with Intel and Texas Instruments, Cisco pays out a steady dividend that is currently yielding 2.44% a year and has grown its dividend payout every year since 2012. If you think the internet, computing, and all the associated products that come with it will stay in demand, Cisco should generate durable cash flow over the next decade that it can pay to shareholders. This makes it a perfect pick for any retiree looking for growing quarterly income payments.

2022-01-07 00:00:00+00:00,"FOCUS-At CES, tech alliances firm up in the self-driving car wars",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/focus-at-ces-tech-alliances-firm-up-in-the-self-driving-car-wars,,,"By Stephen Nellis and Joseph White
Jan 7 (Reuters) - Major automakers like General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N and Volvo Cars VOLCARb.ST deepened ties with key technology partners this week to gird for the fight against electric car challenger Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Apple Inc AAPL.Oas it revs up to enter the market.
Three chip firms - Intel Corp's INTC.O Mobileye, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O - have emerged from a raft of announcements at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas as the leaders in locking down the brains of self-driving cars for the next decade.
The deals involve consolidating scores of older, slower chips into more powerful centralized computers. But to win them, the chip firms have had to consent to letting automakers control key parts of the technology.
Reuters has previously reported that Apple plans an electric car. Bloomberg reported last year that the iPhone maker is aiming for full self-driving capabilities as early as 2025.
For automakers facing Apple and Tesla, the stakes are high. In addition to electrifying their models, automakers are essentially designing computers with increasing self-driving capabilities.
That means a big opportunity for automakers to make money off software and services in cars long after vehicles roll off a dealer's lot, but only if they can keep the customer relationships and data for themselves, the way that Tesla and Apple do.
Automakers ""that haven't been the pioneers are finally realizing they're going to be left in the dust if they don't change their approach,"" said Danny Shapiro, vice president, automotive for Nvidia, a maker of high-powered chips.
Nvidia this week announced deals to supply the electronic brains for future models from several Chinese electric vehicle startups, and is working with other automakers including Mercedes, Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, Volvo and Audi AUDVF.PK.
Control of technology and data are areas of tension between automakers and technology companies, Shapiro said. ""Control and customization, and who owns the data?""
The answer is complex because of the staggering amount of technology required to make cars drive themselves.
These include computer vision algorithms to help cameras recognize pedestrians, sprawling high-definition maps of the world's roads, and ""drive policy"" software to make millisecond decisions about how the car should behave when confronted with the unexpected.
For chipmakers, this means they need to have every aspect of the technology ready, but be willing to let customers pick and choose.
Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, for example, spent $4.5 billion last year to purchase Veoneer Inc VNE.N to round out all the pieces of software needed to complement its self-driving car chips. But after winning its first major self-driving chip contract with GM this week, those software assets will not be included because GM has its own.
""Our software stack is all internally developed. So we're not taking their pieces,"" said Jason Ditman, chief engineer for GM's forthcoming ""Ultra Cruise"" hands-free driving product.
But for other carmakers, Qualcomm needs to have all the pieces of a self-driving system ready, said Nakul Duggal, senior vice president and general manager of automotive at the chip firm.
""Different automakers find themselves at different points of readiness,"" he said. ""What is critical for the automaker is that they have to be able to build a relationship with the customer that they're trying to acquire.""
A similar dynamic is at play in Mobileye's relationship with Ford, which was deepened this week. Mobileye used to deliver its camera, chip and self-driving software as an all-in-one product. Now Mobileye will start separating out some of its system's functions and allowing Ford to build its own technology on top of them.
""We provide all the outputs to Ford, and they'll run their own algorithms on top of our outputs,"" Mobileye Chief Executive Amnon Shashua told Reuters.
The chip companies have little choice but to be more flexible as they face significant competitors of their own.
Automakers had relied on three main suppliers for the simpler semiconductors that controlled combustion engines – Infineon, Renesas and NXP, said Phil Amsrud, a senior principal analyst with IHS Markit.
But the market of chip firms supplying high-powered computing to vehicle makers is comparatively crowded, including Chinese companies such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd HWT.UL and computer vision company Ambarella Inc AMBA.O moving into the auto sector.
""We're at a point where we might be getting too many suppliers,"" Amsrud said. ""If you look at automotive traditionally there's never been more than a handful.""

2022-01-06 00:00:00+00:00,Got $500? 2 Dirt-Cheap Stocks to Buy Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/got-%24500-2-dirt-cheap-stocks-to-buy-right-now-0,,,"Although growth-oriented stocks have seen price pullbacks in recent weeks, a perception may remain that too few cheap stocks still exist in the tech sector. And even when investors encounter cheap tech stocks such as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) or Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), they may perceive them as poor investments -- despite a low cost.
These perceptions may be outdated though because both companies have made changes to their business in recent years that could significantly boost revenue over time. That suggests potential investors might want to consider taking a closer look at Intel and Verizon before the markets bid these stocks higher. Let's find out a bit more about these two dirt-cheap stocks worth making a $500 investment in.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Intel
Intel's price-to-earnings ratio of 10 comes in far below that of competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia, which sell for 44 and 88 times earnings, respectively. Despite this low multiple, investors apparently have not seen many good reasons to buy Intel. With its lost technical lead and lackluster growth, investors have understandably bypassed the chip stock in favor of faster-growing peers.
However, since Pat Gelsinger took the CEO job in early 2021, Intel has made meaningful changes to enhance its competitiveness. One example is the company's $20 billion investment to add foundry capacity in Arizona.
One purpose of this decision is to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), Samsung, and others in the chip manufacturing business by founding Intel Foundry Services. This is a welcome relief to investors who feel nervous about the semiconductor industry's concentrated presence in Taiwan, a country that has always faced geopolitical threats from China. Taiwanese companies claim about two-thirds of the world's foundry capacity, according to TrendForce.
Additionally, Intel has made efforts to regain its industry lead. For now, it has contracted with TSMC for some of its production. Longer-term, Intel has also implemented process improvements that Gelsinger says can return the chipmaker to a manufacturing leadership position in 2025 and beyond.
Chip development cycles take three to five years. Hence, investors who buy now can only speculate as to whether Gelsinger will reach this goal. Moreover, Intel's prediction of $78 billion in 2021 revenue according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) may represent a slight decrease from year-ago levels. Furthermore, the fact that the stock rose only 3% in 2021 may reflect red flags for Intel's future.
However, Intel still produces more revenue than both AMD and Nvidia combined. If Intel can regain its technical lead or attract a significant market share in the foundry business, its stock could experience considerable multiple expansion.
2. Verizon Communications
Like Intel, Verizon has appeared cheap for a reason for many years. Its subscriber growth lags that of T-Mobile US, and with T-Mobile also placing pricing pressure on it and AT&T, investors may perceive Verizon's 10 P/E ratio as deserved rather than cheap. Unless investors own Verizon for the 5% yield on the $2.56-per-share annual dividend, stockholders seemingly have few reasons to take an interest in the company.
Nonetheless, Verizon has won the most J.D. Power awards for network quality, receiving the nod for 27 straight years. It also invested $53 billion in C-band spectrum last year, more than its two peers combined, to maintain this edge.
This could become increasingly important as its massive 5G investment has not only sped up its service but also spawned a new business that few investors appear to appreciate. Verizon has actively begun to promote its network-as-a-service (NaaS) offerings. NaaS is a data subscription service that gives customers access to network infrastructure on demand.
For example, in retail, NaaS can help retailers move network infrastructure between their physical and online operations as needed, much like a homeowner might adjust a thermostat. This is an opportunity that did not exist under the 4G environment and could bring an additional source of income even if pricing pressure for services remains intense. The benefit extends to other industries as well. Honda Motor has utilized this to help operate autonomous vehicles, and Arizona State University has applied NaaS to immersive learning applications.
With 5G, Verizon may already have begun to experience improvements. Revenue in the first nine months of 2021 rose to just under $100 billion, climbing 6% compared with the first three quarters of 2020. Lower operating expense growth, falling interest costs, and rising income from finance-related operations help offset a higher income tax expense. Consequently, its net income for the first nine months of 2021 came in at $18 billion, 32% more than in the same period in 2020.
Admittedly, with its stock price down 12% in 2021, Verizon has attracted little interest. Nonetheless, the aforementioned 10 P/E ratio is far below T-Mobile's earnings multiple of 42. As NaaS becomes an increasingly essential service, Verizon could receive long-overdue appreciation.

2022-01-06 00:00:00+00:00,5 Reasons to Buy Intel Stock Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-reasons-to-buy-intel-stock-right-now,,,"The start of a new year is a good time to search for underperforming stocks that could be on the verge of a rebound. One cheap tech stock that stands out is Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
Intel has lost considerable market share to rivals in recent years, but it still commands the lion's share of chip sales, and CEO Pat Gelsinger has a clear strategy to retake the throne. Here are five reasons why Intel stock is a bargain.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Don't underestimate the market share leader
Advanced Micro Devices has outmaneuvered Intel by outsourcing chip manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which helped AMD speed up innovation. Over the last five years, Intel's share of the CPU market has fallen from over 80% to 60%, according to data from PassMark.
But that means Intel is still in command of a $425 billion semiconductor industry. It is a trusted brand going back decades and possesses a superior manufacturing scale, which can't be discounted. One bright spot in 2021 was the strong demand for the Tiger Lake laptop processors, with 70 million units shipped. Tiger Lake is Intel's fastest-ramping notebook processor ever. Indeed, Intel is still alive and capable of much better performance.
2. Stable performance with room for improvement
Intel reported strong demand across all segments for the third quarter, with record results from data centers, autonomous driving solutions (Mobileye), and the Internet of Things. Revenue grew 5% year over year, with earnings per share advancing by 64%.
During the Q3earnings call CEO Pat Gelsinger said, ""Demand remains strong across all of our segments, and I continue to believe that we're just starting a cycle of sustained growth, which we are well-positioned to capture.""
3. Growth catalysts
Intel announced in December plans to take Mobileye public, which could unlock $50 billion in value. Intel will maintain majority ownership of the driverless solutions unit. That's just the beginning of upcoming strategic moves that could send the stock higher.
To regain industry leadership by 2025, Intel is changing how it manufactures chips. Intel has moved slower than AMD because it does everything in-house, including the design and manufacture of its products.
Going forward, Intel plans to source some components from TSMC, which should speed up its chip development. Intel is spending $20 billion to build new chip plants in Arizona. It also plans to set up its own foundry service to compete with TSMC in making chips for other companies.
Moreover, management has laid out a clear roadmap for its chip technology over the next four years. The current production schedule calls for moving from 10-nanometer (Intel 7) process nodes to 7-nanometer (Intel 4) production by late 2022. Intel 20A, previously known as 5-nanometer, will go into production by late 2024.
These announcements are not going unnoticed by investors. If Intel executes along this timeline, the market will likely reward the stock with a higher valuation.
4. Returns on capital are improving
Intel is loaded with plenty of cash resources to reinvest in new technologies. Over the last four quarters, it generated $17 billion in free cash flow, and that's after spending $15 billion on research and development.
Free cash flow has increased 51% in total over the last five years, and Intel's return on invested capital -- a key measure of profitability -- has also improved from 12% to 18%.
5. Attractive valuation and dividend yield
Intel's consistent free cash flow funds a growing dividend to shareholders. The dividend per share has increased 32% over the last five years to a current quarterly payment of $0.3475 per share. That brings the dividend yield to 2.6%, more than twice the yield of the S&P 500 index. Plus, Intel only pays out 32% of its free cash flow in dividends, providing ample room to continue increasing it.
What's more, the market is not giving Intel any credit for its growth plans. The shares trade for just 10 times management's adjusted earnings guidance for 2021.
As it speeds up innovation and gets back on track, there's a good chance Intel will outperform the broader market from these levels.

2022-01-05 00:00:00+00:00,What’s Going on Inside Intel?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/whats-going-on-inside-intel,,,"Leading chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) specializes in supplying microprocessors, chipsets, and flash memory to various industries. The company is slowly shifting its focus from PC-centric business to data-centric businesses like artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and autonomous driving assistance systems (ADAS).
Despite facing various challenges such as processor shortages and intensifying competition, Intel stock has managed to return 6.69% to investors over the past year.
Foundry Expansion Efforts Bode Well
The semiconductor giant is pouring consistent and meaningful capital into the development of new processors and enhancement of production capabilities. In fact, Intel is all set to invest $25-$28 billion towards the acceleration of semiconductor production and foundry capacity expansion.
Importantly, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger’s new foundry initiative includes a separate business division, Intel Foundry Services, which will provide adequate foundry capacity to address the burgeoning worldwide demand for semiconductor manufacturing.
Gelsinger expects to generate $100 billion in revenues from the new foundry business by 2025, which does not seem too ambitious considering the global chip shortages that continue to grip most of the industries indefinitely.
The Upcoming Mobileye IPO Brings New Hope
Interestingly, in December, Intel announced that it is on track to bring its automated driving segment Mobileye to the public markets. Importantly, the Mobileye unit is expecting to raise $50 billion in valuation in its upcoming IPO in the summer of 2022.
Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth expects this initiative to “unlock potentially tremendous shareholder value,"" pull in more capital for a focused approach at expanding Intel’s footing in a key area, and nurture more autonomous driving technology development partnerships.
Experts Display Mixed Sentiments
Feinseth is also upbeat about Intel’s Data Center business. “INTC’s Data Center growth drives increasing operating margins and Return on Capital, driving greater Economic Profit and increasing shareholder value creation,” said the analyst.
Moreover, Feinseth believes that strategic acquisitions have enabled the company to make the most of new opportunities in cloud computing, enterprise storage, data center processing, and IoT connectivity.
The analyst reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $72 from $68.
However, the general analyst consensus seems to be cautious of the stock, with a Hold rating based on 5 Buys, 12 Holds, and 7 Sells. The Intel stock price prediction shows $54.67, indicating an upside of 2.88% from current price levels.

2022-01-05 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Intel Popped, but AMD and Nvidia Dropped Today",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-popped-but-amd-and-nvidia-dropped-today,,,"What happened
It's Jan. 5 and at long last, the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2022) is underway in Las Vegas.
In contrast to last year's fully virtual event, this year's CES is going the hybrid route, with some exhibitors coming in person while others appearing only virtually. One thing that is definitely not virtual -- but real -- is the effect that the CES presentations seem to be having on tech stock prices, and semiconductor stocks in particular.
As chipmakers demo their wares today, shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) (a ""featured exhibitor"" at CES 2022) are enjoying a nice 2.4% pop in afternoon trading, as of 2:22 p.m. ET. In contrast, Intel rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are moving in the opposite direction -- down 4.3% and 4.6%, respectively.

So what
So did Intel buy itself a pass on the chipmaker stock price declines, along with its ""featured exhibitor"" status at CES?
Not exactly. But investors do seem to be taking a shine to Intel's products unveiled at the show, and seem to be thinking that they position Intel's stock (if not necessarily Intel's business) to outperform its rivals in the coming year. As IGN Entertainment reported yesterday, ""Intel is planning to take on AMD and Nvidia in the GPU market this year, with its first generation of Arc series GPUs codenamed Alchemist slated to release sometime early this year.""
Granted, AMD and Nvidia are also focusing heavily on graphics this year (graphics being the historical roots of each of these companies). Yesterday, for example, data analytics company Lynx highlighted the more than two dozen new chips that AMD will bring to market in 2022, with emphasis on the Radeon RX 6000S and RX 6000M chips for gaming laptops. And IGN seemed particularly impressed by the prospect of Nvidia bringing to market a new ""RTX 3090 Ti"" chip with ""24GB of GDDR6X VRAM and 40 teraflops of GPU performance.""
Translating the tech-speak into English, IGN helpfully explained that this chip, when it comes to market, will be ""roughly 11% faster than its non-Ti RTX 3090 variant.""
Now what
At least one analyst still thinks the advantage lies with Intel, however. In a note out this morning, Northland Capital Markets said it is upgrading Intel stock to outperform based on its view that Intel has laid out for investors a coherent strategy to reverse its decline ""for the first time in many years,"" reports StreetInsider.com.
Beyond just Intel's efforts to compete with AMD and Nvidia in graphics, Northland believes that Intel is upping its game in basic chip technology, to the point that it could ""significantly reduce the AMD/INTC performance gap if not eliminate it in 2023."" Northland sees Intel collaborating with Taiwan Semiconductor on production of next generation 3 nm and even 2 nm semiconductors, and refocusing its internal efforts on ""manufacturing [static random access memory chips] which dominate modern CPU die area.""
More significant for investors, Northland simply thinks that Intel stock at less than 10 times earnings is a better bargain than ""high multiple stocks"" such as AMD (which costs 43 times earnings today) and Nvidia (which costs 93 times earnings). In contrast to its pricier rivals, which may suffer from ""multiple compression"" this year (i.e., investors may not want to pay high multiples of earnings to own the stocks, resulting in falling stock prices), low-priced Intel stock could rise as much as 14% in value over the course of the next year.
Investors who watched their Intel shares underperform the market all year long in 2021 can only hope that Northland is right about that, and that Intel will finally reverse its slump in 2022.
