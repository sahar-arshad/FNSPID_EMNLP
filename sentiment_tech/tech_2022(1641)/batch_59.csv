2022-10-07 00:00:00+00:00,"Chip stocks slide as Samsung, AMD expect steep fall in demand",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chip-stocks-slide-as-samsung-amd-expect-steep-fall-in-demand,,,"Oct 7 (Reuters) - Dire forecasts from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O sent chip-related shares lower on Friday, sparking fears that a slump in demand for semiconductors could be much worse than expected.
AMD, Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, Intel Corp INTC.O, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Micron Technology Inc MU.O were down between 1.2% and 6.0%, weighing on smaller peers such as Marvell Technology Inc MRVL.O and Applied Materials Inc AMAT.O.
Samsung, the world's top maker of memory chips, smartphones and televisions, is a bellwether for global consumer demand and its disappointing preliminary results add to a flurry of earnings downgrades and gloomy forecasts.
The chip sector has been grappling with weak demand, spurred by decades-high inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions and pandemic-related lockdowns in China, hitting the PC and smartphone market as businesses and consumers rein in expenses.
Nearly a dozen analysts cut their price targets on AMD's shares by as much as $50 after the U.S.-based chipmaker slashed its third-quarter revenue outlook by about a billion dollars.
""We believe AMD's warning will have the most negative read-across for PC peer Intel, but also somewhat for Nvidia and related memory and data center peers,"" BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya said.
Memory chip buyers such as smartphone and PC makers are holding off on new purchases and using up existing inventory, leading to lower shipments and ushering in an industry downcycle.
""We still think the industry is heading for its deepest downcycle in a decade, thanks to high supply chain inventories and falling end demand,"" Jefferies analysts said.
Global chip sales grew just 0.1% in August, making it the 15th month of a downcycle since June 2021, when sales rose more than 30%, according to Jefferies.
Shares of major U.S. chipmakers have already lost between a third and half of their value so far this year, following huge gains last year when Nvidia was inching closer to a trillion-dollar valuation.

2022-10-06 00:00:00+00:00,November 25th Options Now Available For Marvell Technology (MRVL),MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/november-25th-options-now-available-for-marvell-technology-mrvl,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options begin trading today, for the November 25th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new November 25th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $48.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.55. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $48.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $44.45 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $48.26/share today.
Because the $48.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.40% return on the cash commitment, or 53.94% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $48.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $49.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.55. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $48.26/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $49.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.89% if the stock gets called away at the November 25th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $49.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $49.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.36% boost of extra return to the investor, or 53.65% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $48.26) to be 59%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-10-05 00:00:00+00:00,Chips Are Down but Not Out; Here Are 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Semiconductor Stocks From a Top Analyst,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chips-are-down-but-not-out-here-are-2-strong-buy-semiconductor-stocks-from-a-top-analyst,,,"Chip stocks have had a brutal ride in 2022. The tables have turned on a sector particularly sensitive to cycles; after seeing outsized growth during the pandemic, and despite the global chip shortage, waning demand has seen many in the segment hit hard. Factor in some lofty valuations, a slowing economy and fears of a full-blown recession and the result is the SOX (the main Semiconductor index) is down by 38% year-to-date.
That said, there are many good companies operating in the space whose shares are now at very depressed levels. In fact, Rosenblatt Securities’ Hans Mosesmann, one of Wall Street’s top analysts and an expert on all chip matters, thinks some names in the sector are due to push much higher over the coming months.   
So, let’s take a look at two of this 5-star analyst’s picks and see why he finds them so appealing right now. With help from the TipRanks database, we can see that Mosesmann is certainly not alone in his bullish stance; both are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus too.
Marvell Technology, Inc. (MRVL)
We'll start with one of the semiconductor sector’s heavyweights, Marvell, a maker of integrated circuits. This large-cap caters to numerous end markets such as data centers, enterprise, automotive, cloud, consumer and carrier infrastructure. While several years ago most of the firm’s business came from the consumer electronics segment, following several acquisitions, the majority is now generated from data infrastructure (data center, industrial, automotive, mobile network). Seeing out 2021, the company had a 6,000+ workforce, more than 10,000 global patents, and annual revenue of $4.5 billion.
Despite being affected by ongoing supply constraints, the revenue haul has continued its growth trajectory in 2022, as was evident in the company's latest quarterly report – for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (July quarter). Revenue increased by 41% year-over-year to a record $1.52 billion, while adj. EPS of $0.57 was up from the $0.34 delivered in the same period last year.
However, supply chain snags were cited as the main reason behind a disappointing outlook. For the October quarter, Marvell guided for revenue of $1.56 billion, below the $1.585 billion expected on Wall Street. Likewise, the adj. EPS of $0.59 at the midpoint, fell short of consensus at $0.61.
The market did what the market does in such situations and sent shares down subsequently. All in all, in 2022’s bear market, MRVL shares have shaved off 45% of their value.
That is not a concern for Mosesmann, who remains “bullish” on the company’s prospects.
“CEO Matt Murphy articulated a strong acceleration into the January quarter and remains incrementally more bullish on calendar 2023 as supply constraints ease somewhat (they will not go away completely), and multiple new products and custom ASIC ramp inflect (incremental $400 million plus, and $800 million plus in 2024),” Mosesmann explained. “Matt Murphy’s team has put together a world class execution machine that is strategically positioned to increase dollar content and customer engagement over the long term.”
Mosesmann is bullish, indeed; along with a Buy rating, the analyst’s $125 price target makes room for 12-month gains of 162%. (To watch Mosesmann’s track record, click here)
Most are echoing Mosesmann’s sentiment; barring 3 fencesitters, all 17 other recent analyst reviews are positive, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. The average target stands at $71.20 and could generate returns of ~49% in the year ahead. (See Marvell stock forecast on TipRanks)
Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC)
Next up, we have Lattice Semiconductor, a maker of low power, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Given they are reconfigurable and can be programmed to execute any digital logic, FPGAs are well-suited for adaptive systems. After focusing on several other products too, over the past few years, Lattice has made a conscious decision to focus its energies on the low-power FPGA market, with a mission statement of becoming the low power programmable leader.
Looking at the constant upwards movement of the revenue haul, it's a plan that appears to be working. Sales have been steadily growing over the past few years. The latest set of results - for F2Q22 - showed $161.37 million at the top-line, a 28.2% year-over-year increase. At the bottom-line, the company delivered adj. EPS of $0.42, also up from the $0.25 delivered in the same quarter last year. Both results were also above analysts’ expectations.
Even better, bucking the trend for warnings of a slowdown, revenue for Q3 is expected to be in the range between $161 million and $171 million; the consensus estimate stood at just $161.43 million.
The shares, though, have not been immune to the overall market conditions, and have retreated ~29% since the turn of the year.
Nevertheless, it’s the sort of performance which has Mosesmann singing the company’s praises.
“Lattice delivered another strong beat and raise for 2Q22 despite weakness in Consumer (8% of sales), driven by momentum in Communications/Computing and Industrial/ Automotive. A much richer mix of Nexus products, higher S/W attach rates, and share gains in small FPGAs are driving topline and gross margins,” the analyst said. “FCF now at an impressive 28% is a testament to the success of the A-team Jim Anderson recruited in 2017/18. We see Lattice as uniquely positioned as the only FPGA player innovating in small, and upcoming mid-tier, FPGA's in a new era of AI disruption that requires a combination of programmability, low power, high parallel data-centric workloads, and faster time to market requirements.”
Unsurprisingly, then, Mosesmann rates Lattice shares a Buy, backed by a $95 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of 73% from current levels.
And what about the rest of the Street? Most are on board too; the ratings break down as 6 to 1 in favor of Buys over Holds, all culminating in a Strong Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for one-year gains of ~37%, considering the average target stands at $75.17. (See Lattice Semiconductor stock forecast on TipRanks)

2022-09-23 00:00:00+00:00,Should Vanguard Extended Market ETF (VXF) Be on Your Investing Radar?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-vanguard-extended-market-etf-vxf-be-on-your-investing-radar-3,,,"If you're interested in broad exposure to the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market, look no further than the Vanguard Extended Market ETF (VXF), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/27/2001.
The fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $12.71 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
Why Mid Cap Blend
With market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion, mid cap companies usually contain higher growth prospects than large cap companies, and are considered less risky than their small cap counterparts. These types of companies, then, have a good balance of stability and growth potential.
Typically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.
Costs
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.06%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.08%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
It is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 18.50% of the portfolio. Financials and Industrials round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Blackstone Inc. (BX) accounts for about 1.14% of total assets, followed by Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) and Marvell Technology Inc. (MRVL).

Selling at an average price of US$62.69, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best move for these insiders because their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.
While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.
Marvell Technology Insider Transactions Over The Last Year
Notably, that recent purchase by Michael Strachan is the biggest insider purchase of Marvell Technology shares that we've seen in the last year. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$48.15 per share to be enticing. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. The good news for Marvell Technology share holders is that an insider was buying at near the current price. Michael Strachan was the only individual insider to buy during the last year. We note that Michael Strachan was also the biggest seller.
In total, Marvell Technology insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!

Marvell Technology Insiders Bought Stock Recently
Over the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Marvell Technology. Independent Director Michael Strachan spent US$314k on stock, and there wasn't any selling. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.
Does Marvell Technology Boast High Insider Ownership?
For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Marvell Technology insiders own about US$229m worth of shares (which is 0.6% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.
What Might The Insider Transactions At Marvell Technology Tell Us?
It is good to see the recent insider purchase. However, the longer term transactions are not so encouraging. Overall, we'd prefer see a more sustained buying from directors, but with a significant insider holding and more recent purchases, Marvell Technology insiders are reasonably well aligned, and optimistic for the future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Marvell Technology. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Marvell Technology and understanding this should be part of your investment process.
Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.

2022-09-08 00:00:00+00:00,4 Best 5G Stocks to Buy Now,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-best-5g-stocks-to-buy-now,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Editor’s note: This article is regularly updated with the latest information.
Fifth generation (5G) wireless technology is exploding in terms of adoption and growth around the world. According to market research firm Precedence Research, the global 5G market is forecast to reach $1.87 trillion by 2030 for a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 44.63% between 2022 and the start of the next decade. Because of this rampant growth, I have selected four of the best 5G stocks to buy now.
5G is expected to not only make internet and communication speeds exponentially faster, but also to advance cutting-edge technologies that hold enough promise to transform our world — from artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing to self-driving vehicles. With so much potential and money to be made, it should come as no surprise that companies large and small are pushing into the 5G space. However, there are a handful that have an edge on the competition, leading the charge into 5G.
7 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next Decade
Here are four of the best 5G stocks investors can buy now:
Best 5G Stocks to Buy: Qualcomm (QCOM)
Source: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com
Based in California, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leader in the 5G sector, owning several critically important patents related to the tech and manufacturing many of the semiconductors that enable 5G wireless on smartphones and other devices.
Qualcomm had a banner year in 2021 as demand for 5G accelerated around the world. The company’s revenue increased 55% to $33.5 billion last year. Its chipmaking and licensing revenues climbed 64% and 26%, respectively. Earnings per share (EPS) also soared 104% on an annualized basis. Plus, Qualcomm is working hard to diversify its business, expanding into Internet of Things (IoT) technologies as well as the automotive sector.
Despite its success, however, QCOM stock is down about 30% so far this year as investors broadly sell off technology securities — and especially shares of fast-growing semiconductor companies. However, QCOM also looks comparatively cheap at 9.85 times forward earnings. The company also pays a quarterly dividend that yields 2.33%. Strong 5G demand plus a low valuation and decent dividend should be enough to attract investors to shares. The median price target among analysts is currently $180, suggesting 40% upside from current levels.
Verizon (VZ)

Next up on this list of best 5G stocks to buy, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is a leading telecommunications company that is also heavily involved in the rollout of 5G wireless. VZ stock has also managed to outperform the market this year, down 20% year-to-date (YTD) compared to a 24% decline for the Nasdaq. The outperformance of VZ stock is largely due to the fact it pays a quarterly dividend yielding 6.12%. The company has raised its dividend for 18 consecutive years and proven to be a reliable payout for shareholders, making VZ a solid defensive stock during turbulent times.
7 REITs to Buy for a Bear Market
Since the smartphone market in the U.S. is saturated, Verizon’s revenue growth has averaged only about 2% over the past 10 years. However, VZ stock looks dirt cheap at current valuations. The company’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio sits at 7.76, down about 30% from its five-year average. At around $41 per share as of this writing, the stock is affordable for most retail investors, too. And, like Qualcomm, Verizon seeks to grow its earnings and boost shares through diversification, pushing into IoT technologies and automotive connectivity as vehicles become more autonomous. The median price target on VZ stock is $50, suggesting 21% upside.
Best 5G Stocks to Buy: American Tower (AMT)
Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock
American Tower (NYSE:AMT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that operates the wireless communications infrastructure on which 5G networks rely. The company is essential to the growth of 5G wireless with more than 200,000 communications sites worldwide. Investors looking to play the 5G rollout should consider taking a position in AMT stock, which is down 10% this year. The median price target on AMT is $300, nearly 15% higher than where shares currently trade.
Like the other stocks on this list, AMT stock pays a decent quarterly dividend of 2.26%. With a forward P/E ratio of 50, AMT stock is more expensive than the other names listed here. However, it still offers a great way for investors to get exposure to the fast-growing 5G sector. Plus, American Tower’s business in Europe continues to grow at a strong clip thanks to partnerships with governments of countries like Germany, Spain and Frances. Long-term, American Tower shares should continue to grow amid the rollout of 5G services.
Marvell Technologies (MRVL)

Down almost 45% YTD, Marvell Technologies (NASDAQ:MRVL) is another semiconductor company whose shares have been knocked lower in the current bear market. However, the company’s technology is an essential component of the high-speed 5G connectivity used across computing, networking, data storage and smartphones. In fact, it’s especially important for 5G wireless infrastructure and networks. As such, MRVL stock is a great option for investors seeking out 5G wireless plays. Plus, the company also develops technologies widely used in artificial intelligence (AI), drones and cloud computing.
7 Growth Stocks to Buy for a Rich Retirement
At less than $50 per share, analysts see plenty of upside potential with MRVL stock. The median price target is currently $72, which is nearly 50% higher than where the shares currently trade. What’s more, the low estimate on Marvell is $58, still 20% higher than current levels.
Unfortunately, Marvell Technologies does pay a dividend that only yields 0.5%. However, investors can still make up for the small dividend through the company’s explosive growth over coming years as 5G wireless expands globally. The decline in MRVL stock this year represents a great opportunity for investors to buy the dip.

2022-09-08 00:00:00+00:00,October 28th Options Now Available For Marvell Technology,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/october-28th-options-now-available-for-marvell-technology,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available today, for the October 28th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new October 28th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $48.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.25. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $48.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $44.75 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $48.34/share today.
Because the $48.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.77% return on the cash commitment, or 49.43% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $48.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $49.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.30. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $48.34/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $49.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.19% if the stock gets called away at the October 28th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $49.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $49.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.83% boost of extra return to the investor, or 49.83% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $48.34) to be 59%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-09-04 00:00:00+00:00,Worried About Nvidia? Buy This Tech Stock Right Now,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/worried-about-nvidia-buy-this-tech-stock-right-now,,,"Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) fiscal 2022 second-quarter results (for the three months ending July 31, 2022) sent shockwaves through the tech industry, as its tepid year-over-year growth, shrinking margins, and terrible outlook suggested that robust semiconductor demand may have come to an end.
However, a closer look at Nvidia's quarterly results indicates that its downturn is limited to one niche: Video gaming. The 33% decline in revenue from sales of gaming graphics cards weighed heavily on Nvidia's quarterly results. The company had to contend with an oversupply of GPUs (graphics processing units) as cryptocurrency miners sold off their chips and demand from gamers weakened.
As a result, Nvidia has been forced to reduce the price of its GPUs to move more units, and the partners that sell its goods are placing lower orders. That's part of an ongoing inventory correction caused by weak demand and high supply.
However, not all semiconductor stocks are in the same boat. Advanced Micro Devices recently delivered solid results and sunny guidance despite being a Nvidia rival. And now Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) has shown that the purported slowdown in semiconductor demand may indeed be a myth. Let's see why.
Marvell Technology delivers terrific results
Marvell Technology released fiscal 2023 second-quarter results (for the three months ending July 30) on Aug. 25. The chipmaker's revenue shot up 41% year-over-year to a record $1.52 billion. The company reported adjusted earnings of $0.57 per share for the quarter, up from $0.34 per share in the year-ago period.
What's impressive is that the chipmaker recorded this growth despite supply constraints. Marvell's CEO pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that it expects to ""see healthy demand for our products with the exception of consumer HDD, and our overall demand is outpacing supply.""
The company serves multiple end markets such as data centers, automotive, enterprise networking, carrier infrastructure, and consumer. This diversity allows Marvell to overcome any weakness in certain pockets of the semiconductor industry. Additionally, the company's presence in fast-growing semiconductor markets such as data centers, carrier infrastructure, and automotive explains why it is in a better position than peers like Nvidia.
Marvell's data center business, for instance, grew 48% year-over-year last quarter to $643 million. The company believes that the data center will be its ""single biggest long-term growth driver,"" which is not surprising as Marvell sells a host of chips -- data processing units (DPUs), ethernet controllers, storage accelerators, and others -- that power data centers. The demand for data center chips is expected to grow at an annual pace of 21% through 2027, so it wouldn't be surprising to see Marvell sustain its impressive growth in the long run.
Similarly, the automotive market has started gaining impressive traction. The segment's revenue was up 46% year-over-year last quarter to $84 million. While this business currently accounts for just 6% of the company's overall revenue, it could move the needle in a bigger way for Marvell in the long run. That's because Marvell is witnessing solid design win momentum in the automotive business, which means that its chips are being selected for deployment by OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and component suppliers.
For example, Marvell says that its automotive ethernet chips have been selected by ""eight of the 10 largest OEMs worldwide and 36 OEMs in total."" This puts Marvell on track to take advantage of another terrific opportunity, as the automotive ethernet market is expected to clock annual growth of 21% through 2026.
Why Marvell stock is a better bet than Nvidia right now
It is worth noting that the automotive and data center markets delivered impressive growth for Nvidia last quarter. But the company's reliance on the gaming business for 30% of its top line weighed on its performance. Marvell, on the other hand, got 42% of its revenue from the data center business. The automotive, carrier infrastructure, and enterprise networking markets accounted for 6%, 19%, and 22% of its top line last quarter.
These secular, fast-growing opportunities should help Marvell sustain its impressive growth in the long run. This explains why analysts expect its bottom line to grow at an annual pace of 42% for the next five years. Nvidia's earnings, on the other hand, are expected to grow at an annual pace of 23% over the next five years.
However, Nvidia trades at more than 13 times sales and over 45 times forward earnings. Marvell, on the other hand, trades at seven times sales, and has a forward earnings multiple of 21.
More importantly, the company is insulated from the headwinds that Nvidia faces right now. This is evident from the company's impressive growth last quarter, and a solid outlook that calls for $1.56 billion in revenue this quarter, which would be an increase of 29% over the prior year. Nvidia, for comparison, issued a terrible outlook that points toward a significant contraction in its top and bottom lines in the current quarter.
So investors looking to buy a top semiconductor stock right now may want to turn their attention toward Marvell Technology -- it is not only cheaper than Nvidia, but its business is in healthier shape.

2022-09-01 00:00:00+00:00,Are Options Traders Betting on a Big Move in Marvell (MRVL) Stock?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-options-traders-betting-on-a-big-move-in-marvell-mrvl-stock,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology, Inc. MRVL need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 2, 2022 $30.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.
What is Implied Volatility?
Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.
What do the Analysts Think?
Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Marvell shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Marvell is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Technology Services industry that ranks in the Bottom 46% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while 11 analysts have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 60 cents per share to 59 cents in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about Marvell right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

2022-08-31 00:00:00+00:00,MRVL December 2023 Options Begin Trading,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mrvl-december-2023-options-begin-trading,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available today, for the December 2023 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 471 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new December 2023 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.45. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $36.55 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $46.98/share today.
Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 18.78% return on the cash commitment, or 14.55% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $45.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $47.50 strike price has a current bid of $11.30. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $46.98/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $47.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 25.16% if the stock gets called away at the December 2023 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $47.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $47.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 24.05% boost of extra return to the investor, or 18.64% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $46.98) to be 59%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-08-31 00:00:00+00:00,Marvell Technology Group Is Still a Buy on Data Center and AI Development,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/marvell-technology-group-is-still-a-buy-on-data-center-and-ai-development,,,"Earnings season has not been kind to semiconductor stocks. After two years of heavy spending driven by work-from-home updates, consumer electronics have reached a state of oversupply. Companies with outsized exposure to this area of tech hardware are in for some pain as a new cyclical downturn begins.
But that's not the case for Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL).The company's top end markets -- infrastructure for data centers, 5G mobile networks, and AI -- are very much still in growth mode. Shares got clobbered anyways after the company released its last earnings report, but for a very different reason: supply chain constraints. Here's why the stock is a buy right now.
Slowing growth ... for now
2021 was an eventful year for Marvell. It made two acquisitions to top off a pivot in its business toward data infrastructure (data center, mobile network, and industrial and automotive equipment). Today, 89% of the business is focused on data infrastructure. Just six years ago, nearly two-thirds of Marvell's sales came from consumer electronics. After its takeovers last autumn, Marvell management outlined its two-year goal to reach annualized revenue of $6 billion (based on an assumption of 15% to 20% revenue growth). Less than a year later, that two-year goal has been achieved.
Q2 fiscal 2023 (the three months ended July 30, 2022) revenue was $1.52 billion, or just over $6 billion on an annualized basis. Q2 revenue was up 41% year over year, or up 5% sequentially. Adjusted operating income was up 67% from a year ago to $554 million, or up 8% from Q1 as the company benefits from efficiency gains after its acquisitions last year.
So why did the stock drop after releasing quarterly earnings? The chip shortage is still hurting companies like Marvell that focus on enterprise solutions. Because of supply chain issues, especially in its data center products, Marvell and its manufacturing partners can't keep up with demand. As a result, Q3 revenue is expected to be just 29% year over year and 3% sequentially at the midpoint of guidance of $1.56 billion. It's still strong growth, but far below the annualized rate of sales outperformance the company has been reporting as of late.
The good news is CEO Matt Murphy sees some of these constraints easing by the fourth quarter this year, and revenue growth should accelerate again from there. Nevertheless, with investors already pricing in rapid expansion of sales and profitability (the stock currently trades for 52 times enterprise value to trailing 12-month free cash flow), shares sold off hard in response to the immediate-term outlook.
A great buying opportunity if you believe in data centers and AI
Marvell may trade at a premium based on the last year of results, but this is still a growth business with a head of steam. Data centers are undergoing a massive upgrade cycle as companies around the world start to adopt AI-powered applications. AI needs massive amounts of data, and Marvell's components are integral pieces of the solution. It also has a small but burgeoning automotive segment that is benefiting from advanced driver-assist systems (essentially robotics systems for cars).
Free cash flow is rapidly scaling up as Marvell puts in the work to fully integrate those acquisitions from last year. Free cash flow was $256 million in Q2, a margin of nearly 17% that will continue to improve with time as supply chain issues abate and Marvell further unlocks synergies from its transformation efforts. Expect shares to remain highly volatile, but this is a top chip stock if you want to invest in data center, AI, 5G network, and related tech developments over the next decade. I remain a buyer.

2022-08-26 00:00:00+00:00,Daily Markets: Investors Turn Attention to Powell’s Jackson Hole Speech,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/daily-markets%3A-investors-turn-attention-to-powells-jackson-hole-speech,,,"Today’s Big Picture
Asia-Pacific equity indexes ended today’s session in positive territory in anticipation of today’s comments from Jackson Hole except for China’s Shanghai Composite, which declined 0.31%. India’s Sensex eked out a 0.10% gain, South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.15%, Taiwan’s TAIEX and Japan’s Nikkei advanced 0.52% and 0.57% respectively and Australia’s ASX All Ordinaries closed up 0.74%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng led the way, rising 1.01% with all sectors except Basic Materials gaining. By mid-day trading, European equity indices are generally trading off and US futures point to a lower open later this morning.  
Today, we will hear from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at the annual economic policy conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming at 10:00 AM ET. While a stronger than expected GDP coupled with a potentially upbeat PCE deflator and continued signs that inventories are starting to normalize are good signs, we don’t expect any explicit guidance from Chair Powell regarding September’s rate setting meeting. The closest thing we have to a crystal ball would be the market's reaction to recent (including today’s) economic releases and of course, the Fed Futures curve. The current CME FedWatch tool shows a 60/40 split in favor of a 75 basis point move in September but it will be worthwhile to keep an eye on Fed Futures as we wind down the summer. As it has been during the past quarter or so, all eyes continue to be on the Fed and the forthcoming data to be had ahead of its September meeting. Should that data point to a more resilient economy, meaning one that can easily absorb larger rate hikes to get inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target sooner than later, then that’s the potential reality markets will have to wrap their heads around.

International Economy
Last night saw Japanese August CPI print at 2.90% which was higher than the previous 2.50% figure. The last time inflation was this high in Japan was in 2014. This is not the 30- or 40-year peak the west has been experiencing but uncomfortable all the same. 
The GfK Consumer Climate Indicator in Germany fell to a new record low of -36.5 heading into September vs. a revised August figure of -30.9, missing the market forecast of -31.8. Persistent recession fears and mounting concerns over higher energy costs were cited as root causes for the decline.
The Consumer Confidence index in France unexpectedly edged higher to 82 in August from July’s reading of 80 which marked the lowest level since June of 2013. 
While August Italian Consumer Confidence rose by 3.5 points to 98.3, topping market expectations of 92.5, the metric is still well below its year ago figures amid surging energy bills and political uncertainties. 
British energy regulator Ofgem lifts gas, electricity price cap by 80% to £3,549 ($4,189.64) per year from its current level of £1,971, as a result of a continued rise in wholesale gas prices and warns that prices could get significantly worse next year. 
Domestic Economy
At 8:30 AM E, we will see the latest release of Personal Income and Expenditure (PCE) figures as well as a YoY July update on the PCE Deflator which measures spending by households and non-profit groups serving households. Expectations are for a decline to 6.3% from the previous 6.8% release. Our take is that any downside surprise here will set the stage for a strong rally to close out the week.
We will also get a July update on Wholesale Inventories (ex-autos), which on a MoM basis are expected to show slowing growth of 1.3%, down from the previous 1.8% figure. 
Just as Fed Chair Powell is expected to speak at Jackson Hole this morning, we’ll also get the final August reading for the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, which is expected to rebound to 55.1 from 51.5 in July. In addition to the headline figure, market watchers are likely to key on the latest reading for Consumer Inflation Expectations. The consensus view has it falling to 5% in August from July’s 5.2%. 
Markets
Yesterday, we saw markets rally as Q2 GDP came in better than expected at -0.60%. Investors saw a silver lining in Nvidia’s (NVDA) earnings miss as a signal that supply chain and inventory issues are starting to ease. All sectors posted healthy gains as the Dow rose 0.98%, the S&P 500 gained 1.41%, the Russell 2000 advanced 1.52% and the Nasdaq Composite closed up 1.67%. Other highlights across sectors included Costco (COST) and Estee Lauder (EL) which combined to account for just over 60% of returns in Consumer Staples names while Meta Platforms (META) drove 35% of the returns for Communication Services.
Here’s how the major market indicators stack up year-to-date:
Dow Jones Industrial Average: -8.38%
S&P 500: -11.90%
Nasdaq Composite: -19.21% 
Russell 2000: -12.50%
Bitcoin (BTC-USD): -53.40%
Ether (ETH-USD): -53.97%
Stocks to Watch
Before trading kicks off for U.S.-listed equities, JinkoSolar (JKS) will be among the companies issuing their latest quarterly results and guidance. 
Shares of Dell Technologies (DELL) were under pressure last night following a mixed July quarter earnings report that confirmed PC demand declined throughout the quarter which led the company to revise its outlook. The company now sees revenue for the current quarter in the range of $23.8-$25 billion vs. $28.4 billion in the year ago quarter and the $26.4 billion consensus. While the company confirmed the slowdown in consumer PC demand, its comments about the slowdown in Enterprise customer spending is likely to raise questions over enterprise spending in the back half of 2022. 
Semiconductor company Marvell (MRVL) reported solid results for its July quarter with double digit growth at its Data Center, Carrier, Automotive/Industrial and Enterprise networking segments, which more than offset the year-over-year drop at its Consumer segment. For the current quarter, the company issued in-line guidance but shared that it expects sequential revenue growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter as supply constraints begin to ease.  
Ulta Beauty (ULTA) did it again, reporting results for its July quarter that topped expectations and boosted its outlook for its current year. July quarter revenue rose 16.8% YoY to $2.3 billion beating the $2.2 billion consensus as comp sales for the quarter climbed 14.4%. For its fiscal 2023, Ulta is now calling for revenue between $9.65-9.75 billion vs. its prior guidance of $9.35-9.55 billion and the $9.53 billion consensus. Digging into that upped outlook, Ulta also raised its comp outlook to +9.5-10.5% from +6.0-8.0%.
Despite revenue that fell 8.4% YoY, Gap (GPS) reported better than expected July quarter results. By brand, Old Navy sales fell 13% YoY to $2.1 billion in the quarter, Gap sales fell 10% YoYm, Banana Republic sales grew 9% YoY and Athleta sales grew 1% YoY leading overall comp sales for the three-month period to be down 10% YoY. Citing company actions to right size its product offering and inventories, its CEO transition, and the uncertain economic environment, Gap withdrew its prior guidance for the fiscal year. 
Buy now, pay later (BNPL) company Affirm (AFRM) delivered June quarter results that surprised to the upside with stronger than expected revenue and a smaller than consensus bottom line loss. Despite favorable growth for active consumer active merchants metrics during the quarter, Affirm now sees its revenue for the current quarter in the range of $345-$365 million vs. the $391 million consensus. The company also lowered revenue expectations for its fiscal 2023 to $1.625-$1.725 billion vs. the $1.9 billion consensus. 
Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) confirmed it will hold a business and strategic update call on August 31.

Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Marvell team drove another record level of revenue at $1.52 billion, growing 41% year over year and 5% sequentially. Revenue on an annualized run rate exceeded $6 billion, a significant achievement for Marvell. Revenue collectively from our four data infrastructure-focused end markets grew 49% year over year and 7% sequentially, reaching a new high of 89% of our total revenue.
Moving on to the rest of the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin was 51.8%, GAAP operating margin was 2.6%, and GAAP EPS was $0.01. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 65%, and our non-GAAP operating margin hit a new record at 36.5% of revenue. Disciplined opex management helped drive our non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.57, above the midpoint of guidance.
Earnings per share grew 68% year over year, much faster than our revenue growth as we continue to drive operating leverage. Now let me provide a brief update on the outlook for demand and supply. We continue to see healthy demand for our products with the exception of consumer HDD, and our overall demand is outpacing supply. The very successful adoption of our new products and strong end market demand has enabled Marvell to grow revenue significantly above our long-term target model.
As a reminder, at our last Investor Day in October 2021, we had updated our long-term model for revenue growth to a target range of 15% to 20% from an annualized revenue run rate at that time of $4.3 billion. At the midpoint of the target, it would have taken us two years to achieve $6 billion in annualized revenue run rate. We are very pleased that we were able to cross this milestone this quarter, a full year ahead of our target. As we look forward, we are confident that our long-term growth opportunity is consistent with our target model even off this higher base of revenue.
Let me now turn to supply. Despite a choppy supply environment, the strength of our business model and diversity in end markets enabled us to achieve our overall revenue guidance in the second quarter. We expect our revenue mix by end market will continue to be influenced more by supply than demand in the near term. As we continue to secure capacity to support our long-term growth, we are encouraged to see some pockets of additional supply starting to open up on certain nodes and simple package technologies.
In contrast, for our high complexity products with long manufacturing cycle times, such as in our data center end market, the supply chain for leading-edge technology and advanced packaging remains very tight. Our operations team continues to execute our strategy to deeply engage with partners to support our long-term growth. Let me now move on to discussing our five end markets, starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the second quarter was $643 million.
On a year-on-year basis, our data center revenue grew 48%, with our cloud business growing significantly faster. The year-over-year growth was very broad-based with multiple product lines contributing to strong results. On a sequential basis, the continued growth from our cloud business was offset by a decline in our on-premise business flattening our data center revenue. In the on-premise business, the sequential decline was driven primarily from our fiber channel and Ethernet adapters.
We believe the overall demand picture in cloud data centers remains healthy, and that this market represents the single biggest long-term growth driver for Marvell. We expect growth to continue from a number of exciting areas, including electrooptics, cloud-optimized custom solutions, cloud switching, and our broad data center storage portfolio. At the Flash Memory Summit earlier this month, Marvell showcased many state-of-the-art data center storage solutions, including our Brevera PCIe Gen 5 SSD controller, and Ethernet Bunch of Flash solution for AI and ML, and CXL. As you recall from our discussion last quarter, we see CXL as the next big evolution in cloud data centers that will enable us to increase our reach into the memory ecosystem and presents a multibillion-dollar SAM expansion opportunity for Marvell.
This includes a host of new products such as CXL expanders, cooling devices, switches, and accelerators and the potential to embed CXL IP and a broad range of our data center products. Events and presentations at FMS strongly validated our excitement around CXL. This is the hottest topic at FMS with standing room-only presentations by many leading industry participants. The Marvell booth, we demonstrated the industry's first CXL memory pooling solution, addressing the challenges related to memory scaling and cloud data centers.
While the industry is still in the early stages of CXL adoption, we are working on closing significant opportunities right in front of us at key customers and envision a strong design win pipeline. Turning now to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. In data center, year over year, we are expecting revenue growth of over 20%, driven by our cloud end market. Due to the complex nature of products for this end market, we expect supply challenges in the third quarter to impact our ability to fully meet the demand on a sequential basis.
As a result, we expect revenue from cloud customers to be flat sequentially and revenue in the on-premise market to decline. Therefore, for our overall data center end market, we project revenue in the third quarter to decline sequentially in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis. However, we expect our data center revenue in the fourth quarter to increase on a sequential basis, anticipating an improvement in supply and new product ramps in cloud. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market.
Revenue for the second quarter was well above our forecast at $285 million and growing 45% year over year and 13% sequentially. We benefited from a strong performance from both our wireless and wired end markets. Our wireless business continued to advance in the second quarter, benefiting from the growth in 5G adoption. With an annualized revenue run rate crossing $600 million, we are thrilled to have achieved an important milestone.
We expect to see an extended period of growth for our 5G business with multiple regions such as Europe and India yet to launch 5G in a meaningful fashion. We expect to see further growth in other large geographies such as the U.S., which are only in their first year of mainstream deployment. In addition, we have significant content growth in the next generation of base stations still in front of us. In wired, we saw stronger-than-expected shipments of our coherent DSPs and accompanying TIAs and drivers to wired customers.
We are seeing strong demand in the metro and long-haul carrier markets driven by a rapid adoption of our 400-gig coherent electro-optics portfolio. We are pleased with the strong launch of these products.Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 for our carrier end market. We are expecting year-over-year revenue growth in the mid-20% range, driven primarily by our wireless end market. On a sequential basis, we expect wireless revenue to continue to grow, driven by 5G deployments.
However, after a very strong second quarter, we expect a sequential decline in revenue from wire to more than offset the growth from wireless. As a result, we project revenue from the overall carrier end market to decline in the mid-single digits sequentially on a percentage basis. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $340 million, growing 53% year over year and 19% sequentially, better than our guidance driven by improvements in supply.
Our strong growth in enterprise networking is primarily a result of our own unique product cycles. Our revenue growth has accelerated as our customers have started shipping their new platforms where we have the dual benefits of share gains and an increase in content, driven by the adoption of higher-value products such as our multigigabit Fis. In the second quarter, we see ongoing growth from our refreshed Ethernet switch and Fi portfolio. We also benefited from a ramp in our custom silicon products for enterprise networking, which is a new growth vector in this end market for Marvell.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect a continuation of strong demand for our products from the enterprise networking end market. As you heard earlier, we are seeing pockets of supply opening up, which should enable us to begin to catch up to demand. As a result, we are projecting revenue from enterprise networking to grow approximately 70% year over year and over 20% sequentially. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market.
Revenue for the second quarter was $84 million, growing 46% year over year. Our auto business continued to grow sequentially, but this was more than offset by a supply impacted industrial business. As a result, overall revenue from the combined end market declined 6% quarter over quarter. Year over year, our auto business, driven by higher adoption of Marvell's Ethernet technology continued its strong growth trajectory with revenue doubling.
Last quarter, I discussed our growing list of Ethernet design wins in our auto business, which expanded to eight of the 10 largest OEMs worldwide and 36 OEMs in total. I would highlight that the lifetime revenue from these new design wins is substantially larger than prior wins. At large auto OEMs, we are winning in their highest volume internal combustion engine segments, along with their higher content in their EVs and hybrids. These wins tend to be multi-platform in nature, covering many models simultaneously.
Overall, content is continuing to grow, driven by an increase in the number of Ethernet-connected endpoints, coupled with the need for more bandwidth. Looking to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We are projecting revenue growth to remain over 40% year over year and grow in the mid-teens sequentially on a percentage basis for the combined auto and industrial end market. We project all of the sequential growth to be driven by our automotive products where we are experiencing strong demand and continuing improvements in supply.
Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $164 million, declining 1% year over year and 8% sequentially. Results were below guidance as demand from the HDD market weakened. In contrast to Consumer HDD products, revenue in the second quarter from our consumer SSD controllers continue to grow both sequentially and year over year.
Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 for our consumer end market, we are forecasting revenue to be flattish sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, we expect revenue from the consumer end market to decline by approximately 10% due to softness in consumer HDD demand, partially offset by continued growth in our SSD business. In closing, we delivered record results for the second quarter and are guiding for continued growth in the third quarter. Our strategy to focus on a diversified portfolio and data infrastructure is playing out very well as we continue to deliver strong results.
We have limited exposure to the headwinds that consumer-exposed companies are now facing. In the third quarter, at the midpoint of the range, we are guiding our revenue to grow by 29% year over year, and we expect operating leverage in our business model to drive non-GAAP EPS at the midpoint of guidance to grow by 37% year over year. Looking forward, we are projecting our revenue growth to accelerate on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter on the back of more supply and new product ramps. As we wrap up the first half of fiscal 2023, I'm very pleased with the trajectory for full year revenue, which is well above the target we established last December.
At that time, we had discussed our target for fiscal 2023 annual revenue growth in the low 30% range. I'm very pleased to note that we are running well ahead of that target with full year revenue growth now tracking toward the high 30% range. Over the last six years, through organic investments and strategic M&A, we have significantly transformed the company pivoting to data infrastructure, accelerating our technology road map, and driving a tremendous increase in design wins. We are now seeing the benefits of these efforts in our revenue growth, operating margin expansion, and increased exposure to the critical cloud, 5G, and auto end markets.
As we look at next fiscal year, despite economic and semiconductor cycle concerns, we are optimistic about our prospects. We expect to benefit from our favorable end market exposure and significant revenue contributions from a number of Marvell-specific product cycles, which we have discussed in detail over the last several quarters. Before I hand off to Jean, let me provide an update on our Board and ESG. Earlier this week, we announced the addition of Rebecca House to the Marvell Board of Directors.
She currently serves as senior vice president, chief people, and legal officer and corporate secretary at Rockwell Automation, a global leader in industrial automation with 25,000 employees worldwide. She was selected for her extensive background in the areas of talent management, legal, ethics and compliance, public affairs, security and sustainability. I'm excited to have Becky join our already strong group of directors and I am looking forward to working with her. Finally, I'm pleased to announce the publication of Marvell's inaugural sustainability report.
I encourage you to review the report on our website to learn more about our ESG performance and future goals. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the second quarter and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue in the second quarter was $1.517 billion, growing 5% sequentially and 41% year over year. Data center was our largest end market, accounting for 42% of consolidated revenue.
Enterprise networking was next largest with 22% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 19%. Consumer at 11%, and auto industrial at 6%. GAAP gross margin was 51.8%. Non-GAAP gross profit was $986 million, increasing 41% year over year.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 65% of revenue, slightly below the middle point due to product mix. GAAP operating expenses were $747 million, and included the cost of share-based compensation expenses of $135 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $88 million, and $85 million charge of contractual legal disputes segment, and $7 million in other acquisition and divestiture-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $432 million, below the midpoint of our guidance. Opex increased by 18% year over year as we added headcount to deliver the marketable new design we have won with key customers.
We continue to drive strong operating leverage to grow opex to significantly less than top-line revenue growth. GAAP operating income was $39 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit was $554 million, increasing by 67% from a year ago and non-GAAP operating margin was 36.5%, a record for Marvell. For the second quarter, GAAP income per diluted share was $0.01.
Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.57, increasing by 68% year over year. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $332 million in cash from operations, reflecting our strong earnings offset by continued working capital investments to support our top-line revenue growth. We have increased our inventory by $78 million to better address demand from our customers in a very tight supply chain environment and to help ensure a smooth ramp for a number of new design wins that we expect to start shipping in the next few quarters.
The majority of this increase was in raw materials and with -- looking longer term, as the supply chain start to show improvement, we expect our DOI will start to decline. Consistent with our strategy to secure longer-term supply, we have increased our long-term purchase commitment for capacity to support the number of high-volume source of the design wins. Purchase commitments increased by $447 million in the second quarter to a total of approximately $3.4 billion. Please note, this commitment are over a multiyear time period.
At the end of the second fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents was $617 million. We intend to maintain a higher cash balance compared to the last few years as our business has significantly increased in scale. Our total debt was $4.6 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was two times and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times.
We returned $101 million to shareholders through $51 million in cash dividends and $50 million of share repurchase. Now turning to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We expect the following: revenue will be in the range of $1.56 billion, plus or minus 3%. GAAP to gross margin will be in the range of 51.1%, plus or minus 1.1%.
Non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 65%, plus or minus 0.25%. GAAP operating expenses will be in the range of $667 million to $677 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses will be in the range of $435 million to $440 million. At the middle point of our guidance, we expect to deliver 37% non-GAAP operating margin.
We continue to make significant progress toward our long-term target of 38% to 40% non-GAAP operating margin. Other income and expense, including interest expense, will be approximately $38 million. For the third quarter, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 6%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 854 million.
And our diluted weighted shares outstanding will be 862 million. As a result, we expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.05 to $0.13. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.56 to $0.62. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions.

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Hi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Matt, I wanted to ask a question on calendar '23 or fiscal '24. You gave some brief comments as it pertains to some of the big growth drivers that you've talked about in the past.
I was hoping you could remind us perhaps the top three drivers that are idiosyncratic to Marvell as you look out into fiscal '24. And how you're thinking about the supply side of the equation. Do you think by fiscal '24, you'll be shipping to demand or you'll still be constrained, whether it be wafers or substrates? And the third part of my question, I think consensus has you growing top line by about 17%. Is that a fair number to start off with? Or is that too high, too low? Any comments on where Street consensus is today would be helpful.
Thanks so much.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Toshi. We'll go ahead and do the trifecta of questions here. No problem.
So on the first one, for next year, as you point out, there are a number of Marvell-specific growth drivers, which we're very excited about. I'll cover three of them. And then, of course, there's other things going on as well. So, the three biggest buckets and then the No.
1 of all three is our cloud-optimized silicon ramp. What we've talked about in the last few quarters and even year is a number of new design wins that we achieved over the last couple of years in this cloud-optimized silicon area. And we sized it, for those of you on the call that haven't been following it, at about $400 million of incremental revenue for next year and then $800 million the year after. And that's still tracking extremely well.
We have good line of sight on those programs. They're quite diverse in nature, by the way. So there's a number of them that are going to have to ramp, and that's all tracking well. The second is, and you saw even in the most current quarter, again, another strong performance out of our 5G business in wireless, and the adoption of 5G will absolutely continue next year.
And really, on top of that, which is more specific to Marvell is we have incremental content gains and SAM expansion coming as well. So that's also in front of us. And then on the third, our automotive business, which in general, has been about doubling on a year-on-year basis, if you go back over the last few quarters. This is automotive Ethernet.
That also has a very strong outlook as well for next year. And again, this is really based on the breadth of design wins, Toshiya, we have across almost all the major top OEMs, as well as virtually all the emerging next-generation car companies. And by the way, it's proliferating both in the ICE vehicles, as well as electric vehicles. So those three, I think, are good buckets to think about.
On the follow-up on the constraint side, we are seeing some loosening of supply, as I said in my prepared remarks, which we believe will begin to benefit us, some of which will be in Q4. When you -- as you think about next year, when you look at the broader supply chain and you actually focus in on the bleeding edge technology types of components that are required, whether that's advanced packaging and substrates, some of the advanced node process technology and just some of the complex nature of the products we're dealing with, those we have to manage very carefully. They have long manufacturing cycle times, and we need to plan appropriately. But currently, we feel very good about our line of sight to be able to ramp up these programs in line with what our customers need, and we're having those discussions as we speak.
And then the final part is with respect to the outlook next year, I think the biggest thing to take away really is at the highest level, we're ahead of plan on where we thought we were. If I went back to our Analyst Day back at the end of 2021, we're on the $6 billion annualized revenue run rate. Now our current year looks like it's going to be above where we thought it would be back at the end of last year. So that's all positive.
And as we look forward, we do see the long-term target model being achievable even off this higher revenue run rate. So that's more of a long-term comment. But certainly, if you add up our growth drivers and you look at where we are today, we feel very good about fiscal '24 or calendar '23 next year. Thanks.

The next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess a question around data center, particularly as it relates to the October quarter guide. I'm surprised that cloud is tracking only flat.
And I guess, is that kind of a supply constraint that caught you by surprise? Or otherwise, less than 3% sequential growth seems a little bit light. I would love to hear your thoughts around that.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, no problem, C.J. Yeah, a couple of things. One is, I said some of this in the prepared remarks. As we've battled through on the supply side, like a lot of other companies this year, it's been quite lumpy in terms of when the supply comes in and by what end market.
And so on an average quarter, we're not exactly even over the last few quarters, able to perfectly forecast how much we can deliver. Now that said, in data center just for perspective, we had a huge step up starting in our Q1 of this year. We were constrained last year. We made a lot of great progress.
Our Q1, I believe, was up something like 12% sequentially from our Q4 with -- and then we've sort of held at that level, maybe slightly increased a little bit through that time frame. And on a year-over-year basis, cloud has been absolutely on fire. And the final point would be in the fourth quarter, we see a step up again both on a sequential basis. So, I wouldn't say it necessarily surprised us.
I think we've known these programs, and we're doing our best. But at this -- and we're going to try to do better for this quarter, by the way. But at this point, this is how we see it. The cloud business for us has been extremely strong and overall for Marvell remains healthy.
I would say it's more of a supply timing issue, and our operations team is all over it to try to obviously make sure we meet what our customers need and ramp when they want to ramp.
C.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

The next question is from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Matt, I want to talk about the cloud optimized side. I know you answered to a previous question that, that should be an idiosyncratic driver for you next year.
But how do I blend together, frankly, the answers to the first and the second question that was already asked where the cloud side is lumpy, have ups and downs, but the good part is it's idiosyncratic, and you expect it to grow? So, I guess the net of it all is, do you see risk to that $400 million over the next year and then another $400 million the year after there if macro and/or supply stays lumpy? Or do you think the customer-specific very customized aspect of those businesses will allow that to grow and deliver those numbers even in a more choppy environment?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Sure, Ross. Great question. Maybe just before I answer it, I'll just give a higher-level view.
And your question is cloud-specific, but if I just frame the overall Marvell strategy that we've put together and the business model we've put together, it's been one where diversification and breadth of product offering and technology and obviously, the financial model to go with it has been our North Star, right, since I joined the company and since this management team has driven this transformation. So you can even see it in the short term where like, for example, we've got constraints in cloud this quarter, but enterprise and automotive, when you look out to next quarter are doing extremely well, and that's because of our diversification of our model, all focused around data infrastructure, by the way. So, while there may be lumpy ""parts"" of our business from time to time, that is by design, how we've architected the business model of Marvell. And it's taken a long time to get here.
And I think it's actually proving to be very resilient when you look at our Q3 being up and then our Q4 actually accelerating. So that's the bigger picture around how we think about it and managing lumpiness. Now with respect to the cloud, I might want to put a little asterisk by the 400, 800, and that we've actually talked about it being 400-plus and 800-plus in prior calls, which means the 400, 800 was identified last year. And then subsequently, in our communications with investors, including earnings calls, we've said we've actually won more business since then with incremental revenue both in fiscal '24 and fiscal '25.
So next year and the year after. So think of it as kind of 400-plus, 800-plus diversified across a number of programs. So the bottom line is we feel very good about that ramp. Some of them, I'm sure, will require a lot more than we're planning for at this point.
And I'm sure a few of them will require less than we're planning. But in aggregate, when we judge the outlook, and we just did a refresh of this just very recently, not only internally, but even with my key customers in terms of planning for next year, that ramp looks very solid in both of those years.

The next question is from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Thanks a lot, Matt. I also wanted to ask about data center. And last quarter, I think the expectation was that you were going to see some reacceleration as the supply was going to improve into the back half of the fiscal year. So, I know that the enterprise portion of that business is weak.
But maybe can you help us understand sort of what's going on there? Maybe tell us how much cloud is as a portion of the total data center business? And then also into fiscal Q4, it sounds like total revenue is going to be close to $1.7 billion for you to be up high 30s, and that's up nearly 10% Q on Q. But I'm wondering how much data center will be up. I mean you said it's going to be up Q on Q, but I would think it should easily be up double digits with more supply, you have the five-nanometer products ramping. So, I wonder if you can help with that.
Thanks.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Yeah, a couple of things. So, on the first part on the data center, what we've said is that our -- the larger portion of the total is in cloud. So, the exact number, we haven't quite disclosed it, but call it closer to 60%, 60-plus percent versus 40%.
So that's been -- and that's why we said even in this prior quarter on the year on year, cloud grew much faster than the total just because of the enterprise of the mix. Now reminder, a little bit on the enterprise side. It's not a great proxy of what I would call enterprise data center from the standpoint that those products we sell into that market are fiber channel and Ethernet adapters, which are somewhat of a legacy type of business for Marvell. So that one we feel we've been pretty upfront about this.
That doesn't have a lot of growth per se ahead. And so really, it's been all about the cloud. The -- in Q4, as we said, the overall company revenue, we expect to accelerate off of Q3. We haven't pegged the number.
I think the range you're discussing looks a little on the high side. But if you just back into the high 30s comment we made and you take the two quarters we've already produced, we take our Q3 guide, and look at Q4, you'll get to a range that seems to make sense. So, yeah, I guess bottom line is we do -- and I think the acceleration we thought we would get in the second half on cloud is more a Q4 type of story than Q3, and that's how it's playing out primarily on the basis of supply.

The next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst
Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the demand part of the equation. I thought you said in the beginning, consumer HDDs were the only thing weak, but you have two segments that are down. So just maybe just revisit that even in the areas like enterprise that are up a bit, it sounds like supply.
So, I just wondered if you could revisit the demand outlook and I think you said data center is kind of lumpy, but I mean is it all lumping in timing and supply even for the businesses that are down? Or have you seen any broader downticks on that demand side?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Blayne, I think when I look at your question there, the enterprise side and particularly the on-prem, I do think that that has been more lumpy in terms of the supply we've gotten and how we've delivered it. We haven't really seen a lot of demand changes there per se. But we certainly, in our first quarter and a little bit of our second quarter, we're able to produce more supply than we had hoped. So when we talk to customers, the demand signals there don't look anything out of the ordinary versus what we have seen historically.
This is because it kind of feels like we're going back to a little bit of where we were before this huge upcycle. But it's all within the normal range. I think the comment on Consumer HDD was really -- it's down, it's pronounced. We can quantify it.
But the other part you mentioned is it's more around the lumpiness of our supply delivery rather than demand being down.

The next question is from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Matt Ramsay -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Yeah. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I don't know, just for a change of pace, maybe something not in data center.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
You can go there, Matt, no problem.
Matt Ramsay -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
I wanted to ask about the enterprise networking segment. The big upside there and guiding for almost 25% growth or 70% year over year. Is that -- maybe you could talk about the specific product cycles that are going on there? Or is it, in fact, that's where you're able to upside in supply and just sort of disaggregate what's driving that to be the fastest-growing segment right now? Thanks.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Actually, it's a combination of both where we have very strong demand for our products.
I'll cover that in a second on why that's a little bit unique to us. But then also, I would say, we're -- we have been -- we called this out a couple of quarters ago. This had been one of our more pronounced areas of delinquency, and we're starting to finally catch up. So it's a combination of both, Matt, which I think is producing a very strong result, obviously, as we guide out not only in the Q3 guide but also the quarter we just finished.
So on the demand side, I mean, we've -- I think a couple of things, right? In our sort of classic Marvell portfolio, we've had very consistent share gains and new product introductions with a lot of success in the enterprise-class Ethernet switch and Fi area. In some of those cases, we sell the two products together as part of a total solution. And one trend that I think we had talked about for quite a while, and it's actually here, and it's right in front of us, and it's showing up in our numbers is the adoption of multi-gig PHY technology. The large enterprise OEMs, and you can listen to their commentary, they're seeing a big uptick.
A lot of that is driven by Wi-Fi 6, which at some point, the wireless rate, line rate was going faster than the wired rate. So that's driven a pretty big adoption. And the content and the per port has gone up dramatically as you switch to multi-gig. And it's not like 10%, 20%, 30%.
It's sort of multiples on a per port basis of where it was before. And that's hitting, OK? So, you've got increased PHY content, new products ramping. We've won new customers over the last few years and we've gained share. So that's been a good story, and it's been pretty consistent, by the way, although it's accelerated in the last few quarters.
And then on top of that, a lot of the constraints we had, had in this area, we finally started seeing the supply improvements based on our own partnerships that we've struck with our various suppliers. And so that's starting to benefit as well. And we're finally sort of getting more caught up here. So all in all, I think a great performance, obviously, out of enterprise.
It's at a much higher run rate than I think certainly, people were planning or we were even thinking back at our Investor Day a year ago, but we're pleased that I think the designs we won actually have ramped up, and we still have a bright outlook from here. The final one I would say, Matt, is that we also had some new incremental business on custom-silicon and ASIC in the enterprise, which was not an area where we historically played. And those are also going to production as well, both starting this year, but even reaching full volume or not -- let's call it, run rate volume next year. So I think a lot of new product stuff and good supply improvements.

The next question is from Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Gary Mobley -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple of questions on the -- some of your foundry relationships. Jean, I believe you mentioned that your purchase obligations with your foundry partners ticked up about 15% sequentially.
It sits in about a half year's worth of revenue. I'm wondering if given that capacity seems to be freeing up a bit, might we see that those purchase obligations level off? And what are the risks thereof maybe not being able to take all that commitment in the future? And then as well, have you -- or do you anticipate any additional price increases from your foundry partners that you may eventually have to pass on to customers?
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Hey, Gary, thanks for the question. First, on the long-term purchase commitment. As Matt mentioned, right, we focus on data infrastructure.
Our products tend to have a very long product cycle and most of our products were so soft. So based on the design wins we have and the product ramp and the business planning, we struck strategic relationships with our suppliers to ensure we can secure the capacity in the longer term. So when you look at the purchase commitment, those are very long-term commitments like two, three, five to seven, or even beyond the year. Our team has done a great job to really analyze what we need and what we should strike as a long-term purchase agreement.
Typically, it's only a very small portion of our overall supply needs. So we actually feel very comfortable by analyzing the need, the product ramp or the customer relationship, and what we are committing. If you look at it each year, it's actually very small month, right, it's spread into seven years and beyond. So, we feel pretty good about that.
On your second question about supply chain input cost. It's still very tight supply chain environment. We continue to believe in the next year we are going to continue to face challenges in complex substrate and some of the component and even older generation wafer side. So for us, we definitely -- if there's input cost increase because of supply/demand imbalance, our strategy and our approach has been really working with our suppliers and the customers to make sure we share the cost to increase overall.
So that's our current expectation.

Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the cloud optical connectivity business, this is both inside and between data centers, the upgrade cycles have been this really great multiyear tailwind for the team. And if I look into next year, I believe that there's still at least one of the top four U.S.
hyperscale titans that's going to start the 400-gig PAM4 transition. You still have China CSPs that need to fire. You've got multiple customers on DR that's going to fire as well. Historically, like these transitions, I don't think have been impacted by a slowing macro demand environment.
They're viewed as, I think, very strategic. But is that how your cloud customers are thinking about these upgrades and your views on continued upgrade momentum in this segment for next year? And just relatedly, is the Innovium team on track to drive $150 million in revenues this year?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Hey, thanks, Harlan. Yeah, I think the first part of it, you got pretty well in terms of the transition on 200 and 400 gig PAM4 inside the data center. And then the new ramps we're seeing in 400 gig ZR for DCI between data centers. What I'd add on top of that is -- which has been extremely strong and also, in some ways, a little bit of a constraint we've seen in terms of being able to keep up is the demand on 800 gig, which is happening right now really around, obviously, very advanced AI workloads.
That is an area where if we could obviously produce more material, we would be shipping it in Q3. So that's also a positive trend. So you've got sort of the transition going on all the way up to 800 gig, and that continues to look pretty good. On the data center switching side, we are on track for the $150 million of data center switching this year.
And we see very good traction in the market to -- in the solutions we're talking about now at 51 2 with our PAM4 DSPs as kind of a total solution. So that's also going well. The team has been integrated very well into the company. The road map looks very strong.
It's pretty exciting. So that was another growth vector that I did not mention upfront, but I guess you could lump -- it's not part of our 400, 800 cloud, the $1 million ramp. But that's also incremental opportunity for us in cloud switching.
Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst

The next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Yes. Congrats on another record quarter. Just kind of staying a little bit on what's to come, especially in the next few years. You talked quite a bit about CXL.
I was just wondering when will that business start to ramp. I mean we're talking about more than $1 billion SAM here. And when could that business sort of become bigger than the Consumer HDD business? Just to kind of put into perspective, unique growth drivers versus market drivers? Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, Tore, that would be a great day. We can crack the champagne if we can get CXL up to where the consumer -- or the HDD business used to be. But in all seriousness, this is new.
This is a new technology transition that's happening. It's actually very exciting for the team to look at now really enabling these solutions to -- in the memory ecosystem. The -- we have a full road map that's well underway in terms of product development but it's still early. So we're still a couple of years out.
And by the way, just to be clear on the opportunity, that's the SAM we said was over time. The $1 billion-plus or multibillion. So it's still a ways out. We're not ready to sort of talk about when the timing exactly of that, but we're very encouraged.
It's an absolute real trend. We intend to be a leader here. We're investing ahead of the curve. Tremendous traction on our road map and the breadth of what we can do in CXL.
So it's an exciting one, and we just thought it was appropriate to flag that for investors is yet another opportunity to leverage a lot of the great technology we have into the same set of accounts. And in the case of CXL actually helped enable them, right, to architect these solutions for the future. So I think it's going to be a pretty exciting one, but it's a little ways out. And none of that is sort of in the -- like the $400 million next year, as an example.
That's not part of it. That would all be incremental a few years out.

Srini Pajjuri -- SMBC Nikko Securities -- Analyst
Thank you. Hi, Matt. My question is on 5G, in particular. Now that India 5G auctions are behind us, I'm just curious as to how we should think about that opportunity, Matt.
I think you have a pretty strong position there, but could you put that into perspective versus a U.S. opportunity or Europe opportunity? And then the second half strength, is that what's driving it? I think you're guiding 5G to be up even in the third quarter. So I'm just curious if you're seeing any action from India as yet. Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And Jean, you can chime in, but I think India for us is still -- I think that's still a next year type of event, although the -- as you mentioned, the tenders have gone through. We're well positioned for that. I think we've historically through our partners, had a strong position there.
But I would say it's -- the way to think about our 5G business now is more broader, diversified, and kind of a consistent performer. So I don't think you're going to see it take some enormous leap in a given quarter as an example. I mean it's been performing extremely well. If you go all the way back to kind of the initial ramps two-plus years ago, we basically had sequential growth, I think about every quarter, except one, maybe, I don't know, seven quarters ago where we were flat or something, right? So it's -- I think, again, it's a good example maybe at a smaller scale of the diversification strategy we've tried to drive whereas we go into these markets, we do try to find a number of key partners to line up with such that we're -- we try to reduce volatility and perform well in any environment.
So I think India is just another example. But I think there's also other geographies that are going to be laying in as well. And I think maybe even the bigger tailwind is just sort of increased content as new systems roll out with more and more Marvell silicon per base station. I think that's really where we'll be a bigger impact than a particular geography ramping up in a given quarter.
But Jean, any thoughts on that to add?
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Matt, to just add to what you just said is this year, we have seen significant growth, and the run rate is already over $600 million now. And that's actually largely benefited by North America, right? And the North American adoption of 5G has been really strong this year. Going forward, India definitely maybe next year or beyond.
But Matt is right, is our 5G business will continue to be a very significant growth driver next year for us. It has a really long product cycle and the visibility actually is pretty good in this market.
Srini Pajjuri -- SMBC Nikko Securities -- Analyst
Got it. Thanks, Jean. Thanks, Matt.

The next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Yeah. Hey, Matt, I had a question for you. So if I layer in your thoughts on the $400 million odd of custom cloud silicon, that's about 15% growth by itself to your cloud business. And then I assume your business will grow at least that much, if not more, organically.
So is it fair for us to think for January 2024 for that data center business to be somewhere in the 30-something odd percent range or even better than that? Yeah.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think I'd have to probably get out a spreadsheet to go figure that one out, Harsh. But I think directionally, I think you're right in that. You have an estimate of what our cloud revenues are and certainly layering in the $400 million would get you to a certain number. And then you're absolutely right, what I didn't bring up is that the base business, right, which doesn't include the new wins is also ramping up.
So we haven't sized that piece of it exactly, but clearly, that's going to grow as well next year, the kind of existing run rate portfolio because some of those programs whether it's in cloud switching, whether it's in electro-optics, some of the things we've already talked about today that are already in the run rate are certainly going to grow. So yeah, I think that's -- I think from there, you'll have to kind of -- I think when you say 2024, I got a -- I don't know that exact number off the top of my head, so.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
No, very helpful. Thank you, Matt. Appreciate it.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer

The next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham. Please go ahead.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
Hey, Matt. I wanted to follow up on Matt Ramsay's question on enterprise networking. If I look at the business in the October quarter, it looks like you'll be over $400 million, and that's up probably two and a half times over two years. So phenomenal growth, but clearly well ahead of the market.
I know some of that is content gains, some of its market share. But if you look at inventory in the networking space, OEM inventory levels are probably up 2x over that two-year period. And so, do you guys have any way of knowing whether there's any inventory that's accumulated in that channel? Do you think you can sort of sustain this $400 million quarterly run rate into next year? Or do you think you may see some ebb and flows especially after a very strong October levels looking beyond October?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. OK, Quinn, it's a great question. And certainly, we're very aware of kind of the broader inventory growth that's gone on in a number of the end markets that we serve. And this one, in particular, I think a couple of things give us a lot of comfort.
The first is we've still been ramping into some of these new designs. So they're not -- it's not business we had two years ago and it was at x run rate, and now it's at x times two run rate. I mean almost all of this is effectively new programs that have ramped up. I guess the silver lining is on the supply constraint so far is that we haven't been able to get over our skis on over shipping.
And so -- and we continue to have escalations by the way, even within enterprise networking today, in terms of trying to meet the demand. And again, as I said, because we're in the new systems and the new programs, those are the ones typically our OEMs are the most short on, and they're trying to sell. So I think it's a very fair question. And certainly, for somebody that's got a lot of market share in a given end market that had a run rate business, that had been going on for a while and it got inflated because of inventory growth over the last few years, one would get concerned.
But that's not as much of a concern for us overall in enterprise networking today. And so, I think we feel pretty good about the run rate we're on and the fact that we're running a lot farther ahead than we thought, and we still have some growth ahead of us, but we're watching it closely for sure, Quinn. No question.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
Great. And just as a quick follow-up, can you comment about how much of your cloud business or hyperscale business may be driven by the Chinese hyperscalers? I know some of the -- your peers in the industry have commented that they've seen a recent weakening demand out of the China hyperscalers. Thanks.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. We're -- go ahead, Jean.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Quinn. This is Jean. I'll answer. Matt can add.
Our cloud business are primarily U.S. hyperscale data centers. So, we actually have a very limited revenue exposure with the Chinese hyperscale data centers today.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
Great. Thank you.

The next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the supply constraints. I think a quarter or so ago, probably your biggest problem was analog parts. I know substrates have also been an issue, trailing-edge wafers.
Are those priorities shifting? You talked about a little bit at the sort of more complicated parts that are giving you trouble. Can you just talk a little bit about where is supply getting better? What supply chain is getting better and what's getting worse? Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Great. Thanks, Joe. No, I think you're right.
I think certainly, I mean, there's -- independent of us, right, there's been broader constraints within the analog peer group that have caused sort of golden screw issues and things like that with -- and remains to be seen when all those sort themselves out. For our purposes -- and again, some of those constraints overlap because we do -- in some of our mixed signal technology, we do have a pretty broad usage of some of the older nodes relative to CMOS or by CMOS technology, which would be 28-nanometer, 40-nanometer, 55/65. Those have been historically over the last two years, very constrained. They continue to be constrained.
We've -- but it's gotten better for sure. It's gotten better. And some of that -- some of those older nodes have been where the lumpiness of our supply has come in. You can see actually even when you look at our guide for the automotive business, those -- the five portions of that business uses some of this older technology.
And you can see we're very strong sequential guide there. So that is starting to work itself out. There's still constraints. Where we're having a little bit more trouble, and I think some of the peers are, too, is just when you get into these larger, more complex packages, Joe, that use flip-chip BGAs and large complex substrates, that's still in very rough shape.
And you have to plan way in advance even now for the capacity that's going to be required there. That trend on ABF especially is only going to go up. And so, I think the more complex products is where it continues to be a pain point. And I do think over time, as the cycle plays itself out, probably some of the legacy nodes and the analog stuff probably lighten up.
But I think for high complexity, there's just such a move in the industry, companies like Marvell and a lot of our large peers who more and more are just producing tremendous amounts of compute power and high-performance computing broadly, whether it's in networking or custom-silicon or CPUs or GPUs, you name it, it's all going to this complex technology, and that's where we have to just continue to be tactical and keep our heads down and match supply and demand and get what we need.

2022-08-25 00:00:00+00:00,MORNING BID-Bond quake,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/morning-bid-bond-quake,,,"A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan
With everyone watching Wyoming, global bond markets have shuddered again this week even as stock markets stabilised.
Whatever signals are sent by Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell or the long list of overseas central bankers at the Jackson Hole conference starting on Thursday, upward pressure on bond yields has intensified regardless.
Energy-driven inflation fears are mounting again, especially in Europe, as natural gas and power prices continue to soar and crude oil prices rebound.
And even though central banks will be forced to keep lifting interest rates, looming recessions this winter are raising doubts about whether monetary authorities will have the scope or willingness to get price rises back to target any time soon.
On top of that, estimates of the bill for governments in easing the household and business energy shocks is mounting - with some reports this week it could cost the British government up to 100 billion pounds ($118.4 billion), most of which would have to be borrowed on bill and bond markets.
While governments have successfully managed such crisis borrowing over the past 15 years, it was done when the cost of that borrowing was falling. With inflation now back in the mix, those borrowing rates are rising sharply while central banks' 'quantitative easing' programmes are being reversed as they unwind balance sheet bond holdings and lean against the bond markets rather than supporting them.
That makes for a potentially bruising further repricing of bonds and questions whether government debt pressures will allow central banks to put inflation back in the bottle.
U.S. 2- and 10-year Treasury yields climbed to their highest levels since June on Wednesday and have held those moves today. Much of the gains were driven by higher 2-, 5- and 10-year inflation expectations, with some citing President Joe Biden's student debt forgiveness plan as aggravating the price outlook.
But the bond yield surge was global and arguably driven by a rise in British gilts, where 2-year yields hit their highest since the crash of 2008 and the 2-10 year yield curve was more inverted than at any time since then too.
German 10-year yields also hit their highest since June, with better-than-expected German second-quarter GDP and August business surveys on Thursday. . European Central Bank policy meeting minutes are due later.
Stocks continued to hold up despite the bond jolt and U.S. futures are up before the open on Thursday, with China's latest $44 billion fiscal stimulus helping the mood in Asia too.
The dollar retreated from recent highs too, with many citing reports that China's FX regulator warned banks against selling yuan.
South Korea's central bank raised its benchmark policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.50%, resuming normal-sized 25 basis point increments after delivering an unprecedented 50-basis point hike in July.
Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:
* U.S. Q2 revision of GDP, core PCE; weekly jobless claims; August Kansas City Fed Manufacturing Activity index
* Annual Jackson Hole central bank forum begins
* ECB minutes of July policy meeting * Earnings: Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Peloton, Affirm, Workday, Marvell Technology
* U.S. Treasury auctions 7-year notes; UK auctions 2025 gilts

Marvell Technology MRVL, a company within the sector, is on deck to unveil Q2 earnings on Thursday, August 25th, after market close.
Marvell Technology is a fabless designer, developer, and marketer of analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing integrated circuits.
The company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with an overall VGM Score of a C.
How are things shaping up for the company? Let’s take a closer look.
Share Performance & Valuation
It’s been a harsh and challenging road for Marvell shares in 2022, down more than 40% and coming nowhere near the general market’s performance.

Over the last month, MRVL shares have continued to lag the S&P 500, tacking on 3% in value.

In addition, MRVL shares trade at steep valuation levels, further displayed by its Style Score of a D for Value. The company’s 30.5X forward P/E ratio is undoubtedly on the higher side, representing a slight 4% premium relative to its Zacks Sector.
Still, the value is below its five-year median of 44.2X.

Quarterly Estimates
Analysts have been silent for the quarter to be reported over the last 60 days, with zero estimate revisions hitting the tape. Still, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.56 reflects a stellar 64% Y/Y uptick in quarterly earnings.

Marvell’s top-line appears to be in exceptional health as well – the company is forecasted to have generated $1.5 billion in quarterly revenue, reflecting Y/Y growth of a remarkable 41%.
Quarterly Performance & Market Reactions
Marvell has been on an inspiring earnings streak, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in five consecutive quarters. Just in its latest print, the company penciled in a marginal 2% bottom-line beat.
Top-line results have also been noteworthy; MRVL has chained together six consecutive revenue beats. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.

The market has primarily reacted favorably in response to the company’s quarterly results as of late, with shares moving upwards following two of its previous three prints. Following the latest release, shares soared nearly 13%.
Putting Everything Together
Marvell Technology shares have lagged the general market year-to-date and over the last month, indicating that sellers have had a tough grip.
In addition, shares trade at steep valuation multiples but are well below their five-year median value.
Analysts haven’t had anything to say for the quarter to be reported, but estimates allude to serious top and bottom-line growth.
Furthermore, the company has consistently exceeded quarterly estimates, and the market has reacted favorably as of late following the majority of its previous three prints.
Heading into the release, Marvell Technology MRVL carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with an overall VGM Score of a C.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-08-24 00:00:00+00:00,This Week's 5 Hot Tech Earnings Charts,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-weeks-5-hot-tech-earnings-charts,,,"We’re getting to the end of earnings season but that means there will be retailers, and some technology companies.
Included among those technology companies are several that haven’t missed, or have only missed once or twice, in the last 5 years.
While that has always been an impressive track record, with the pandemic restrictions and shutdowns causing chaos across the global economy the last 2 years, it’s even more impressive. Few companies that have come through earnings seasons unscathed.
Will these technology companies continue with their hot earnings streaks?
5 Hot Tech Earnings Charts
1.    NVIDIA, Inc. NVDA
NVIDIA has only missed once in the last 5 years and it was in 2018. However, NVIDIA has already warned on this quarter’s earnings.
Analysts have cut the Zacks Consensus down to $0.59 from $1.27.
Shares are down 41% year-to-date but they’re not cheap, with a forward P/E of 44.
Is more bad news yet to come from NVIDIA?
2.    Salesforce, Inc. CRM
Salesforce has a perfect earnings surprise record. It hasn’t missed in 5 years. Impressive.
But that hasn’t stopped the shares from falling 31% this year. Over the last 5 years, Salesforce is up 115% versus the NASDAQ up 102%.
Salesforce is not cheap, trading with a forward P/E of 39.
Does another Salesforce beat matter for the shares?
3.    Snowflake Inc. SNOW
Snowflake has beat 4 quarters in a row, including a big beat last quarter.
Snowflake only went public in 2020. Shares are down big in 2022, falling 55%, and have hit new all-time lows.
It does have a P/E but it’s 1,145.
Will another beat finally light a fire under Snowflake’s shares?
4.    Autodesk, Inc. ADSK
Autodesk has only missed once in 5 years and it was in 2019. That’s 12 earnings beats in a row, including during the pandemic.
Autodesk shares have fallen 24% year-to-date but they have bounced higher this summer, adding 16% over the last 3 months.
Shares aren’t cheap. They trade with a forward P/E of 34.
Should Autodesk be on your shortlist?
5.    Marvell Technology MRVL
Marvell Technology has only missed twice in the last 5 years. The last miss was all the way back in 2019. It has beat 13 quarters in a row. That’s impressive.
But Marvell Technology shares have still fallen 41% year-to-date.
It’s the cheapest out of these five companies, with a forward P/E of just 23.
Marvell Technology also pays a dividend, currently yielding 0.5%.

Marvell Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
Marvell Technology, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Marvell Technology, Inc. Quote
Factors to Note
Marvell’s second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the solid demand for its networking products, primarily across the data center and 5G infrastructure end markets.
On its first-quarter conference call, Marvell stated that it anticipates strong sequential revenue growth in the second quarter, driven by the substantial contribution from the cloud data center end market, enterprise networking end market, and combined auto & industrial end market in the United States and other regions.
Additionally, 5G and cloud product ramp-ups and revenues from the last year’s Inphi Corporation acquisition might have favored MRVL’s overall performance during the quarter under review.
Record bookings from data infrastructure end markets and the ramp-up of multiple Ethernet design win in upcoming vehicles are anticipated to have driven revenues significantly in the fiscal second quarter. The consumer and industrial businesses are likely to have put up an impressive show in the quarter under review.
However, certain ongoing supply-chain-related impacts might act as headwinds, which are likely to curb Marvell’s ability to fully meet the increase in demand for some of its product offerings.
Marvell expects a second-quarter non-GAAP gross margin of 65-65.5%, while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $435 million.

2022-08-22 00:00:00+00:00,Analysts Predict 17% Upside For MGK,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-predict-17-upside-for-mgk,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (Symbol: MGK), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $247.27 per unit.
With MGK trading at a recent price near $211.44 per unit, that means that analysts see 16.94% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of MGK's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Zoom Video Communications Inc (Symbol: ZM), Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL), and NVIDIA Corp (Symbol: NVDA). Although ZM has traded at a recent price of $99.50/share, the average analyst target is 58.93% higher at $158.14/share. Similarly, MRVL has 53.57% upside from the recent share price of $53.14 if the average analyst target price of $81.61/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting NVDA to reach a target price of $236.74/share, which is 32.63% above the recent price of $178.49. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ZM, MRVL, and NVDA:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK $211.44 $247.27 16.94%
Zoom Video Communications Inc ZM $99.50 $158.14 58.93%
Marvell Technology Inc MRVL $53.14 $81.61 53.57%
NVIDIA Corp NVDA $178.49 $236.74 32.63%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.
