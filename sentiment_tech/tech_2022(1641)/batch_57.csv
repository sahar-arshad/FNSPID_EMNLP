2022-12-29 00:00:00+00:00,Top Analysts Cheer for These 5 Tech Stocks Heading Into 2023,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-analysts-cheer-for-these-5-tech-stocks-heading-into-2023,,,"It won’t be wrong to call 2022 a bad year for equity investors. The slump in the prices of several top stocks eroded investors’ wealth. However, this decline has also created an excellent buying opportunity. With several stocks trading at a significant discount, choosing the right stock becomes difficult. Leveraging TipRanks’ Experts Center, we have zeroed in on five stocks that have received the maximum number of Buy recommendations (in the last three months) from the top Wall Street analysts. 
The data below shows that semiconductor and tech giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has received the maximum number of Buy ratings (20 Buys) from five-star analysts in the last three months. NVDA stock is followed by its semiconductor peers, Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). 
Shares of the beaten-down social media giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock has received 17 Buy recommendations from five-star analysts. Meanwhile, e-commerce leader Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has received 16 Buys during the same period.
Against this background, let’s examine why these five-star analysts are bullish about these stocks. 
Is NVDA Stock a Buy or Sell?
The slowdown in the end market, demand uncertainty, and inventory issues weighed on NVDA stock, which is down over 52% year-to-date. However, five-star analyst Matt Ramsay of Cowen & Co. stated that NVDA’s problems are a thing of the past. Citing NVDA’s solid fundamentals and technological moats, Ramsay reiterates his buy recommendation on the stock. He raised the price target to $220 from $200, implying a 56.74% upside potential based on its closing price of $140.36 on December 28. 
What’s the Prediction for MRVL Stock?
Industry-wide inventory corrections and weaker-than-expected January quarter guidance dragged MRVL stock down. This has led five-star analyst Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler to lower his price target from $80 to $55. However, Kumar maintained his bullish stance and recommended a Buy on MRVL stock. The analyst also highlighted the strength of the U.S. cloud segment. 
Is AMD a Buy, Sell, or Hold?   
According to five-star analyst Chris Caso from Credit Suisse, AMD is a Buy. The analyst assumed coverage of AMD stock with a Buy recommendation and expects the company to benefit from growing market share gains in the server market and strength in the cloud market.
What Is the Price Target for Meta Stock?
Increased competition, a slowdown in ad spending amid macro headwinds, and regulatory challenges weighed on Meta Platforms' stock. However, five-star analyst Brian White from Monness recommends a Buy on META stock with a price target of $150, implying 29.74% upside potential based on its closing price on December 28. White expects META to face challenges in the short term but expects it to benefit from the “secular digital ad trend and innovate in the metaverse” in the long term. 
Is AMZN Stock a Buy or Sell?
Amazon's stock is trading close to its 52-week low of $81.69, reflecting a slowdown in its growth and increased cost pressure. Five-star analyst Doug Anmuth from J.P. Morgan expects macro headwinds to continue to impact its consumer and cloud businesses. He maintains a buy rating on AMZN stock and expects it to benefit from the long-term shift toward online and cloud computing. Anmuth also cited AMZN's low valuation as a reason for his bullish outlook. 
Ending Thoughts
These five-star analysts have generated significant returns from their recommendations in the past and have a high success rate. Investors could follow their views to make informed investment decisions and maximize their returns. 
Meanwhile, using TipRanks’ stock comparison tool, let’s find out how these five stocks stack up against each other.

2022-12-22 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Chip Stocks Taiwan Semi, Qualcomm, NXP, and Marvell All Fell Today",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-chip-stocks-taiwan-semi-qualcomm-nxp-and-marvell-all-fell-today,,,"What happened
Chip stocks were falling across the board today after Micron (NASDAQ: MU) said it would lay off 10% of its staff and offered weak guidance for its fiscal second quarter.
The update was the latest data point out of the semiconductor sector to show prices falling as demand pulls back after a boom during the pandemic. Unsurprisingly, the news weighed on several of Micron's peers, as the semiconductor industry tends to be cyclical and companies are subject to the same market forces.
As of 1:06 p.m., Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) was down 3.7%, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) was off 5%, NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI) had fallen 5.1%, and Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) had given up 5.6%. At the same time, Micron was down 5.1% and the Nasdaq fell 3.5% as broader economic data also seemed to weigh on the market.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Micron's first-quarter results were mostly in line with estimates, though the layoffs and weak second-quarter guidance seemed to spook the market. For the current quarter, the company expects an adjusted loss per share of $0.52 to $0.72, compared to the consensus at a per-share loss of $0.30, as it's plagued by excess inventory, falling demand, and lower prices.
Micron makes DRAM and NAND chips, which are used primarily for memory in computers, smartphones, and other devices. The company said that both DRAM shipments and prices declined in the low-to-mid-20% range, while NAND shipments fell in the mid-teens range and prices declined in the low-20% range.
The implications for the rest of the industry seem straightforward, as demand is falling and the industry is oversupplied, which is weighing on prices.
As a foundry or the company that actually manufactures most of the world's semiconductors, Taiwan Semi may be more insulated than the designers that make up its customers. CEO C.C. Wei said on the company's recent earnings call that the company's pricing is consistent and unaffected by the economic cycle, which should help it resist lower end prices for chips. However, falling end demand will have an impact on Taiwan Semi, as ultimately it's paid based on volume.
For now, the company seems unaffected by the industry headwinds, as monthly sales in November jumped 50% from the prior year.
Qualcomm is a diversified chipmaker that designs semiconductors for everything from 5G to AI to mobile devices and laptops. While Qualcomm isn't a direct competitor to Micron, it is subject to some of the same industry trends.
Qualcomm, which is more focused on telecommunications and wireless technology, posted strong growth in its most recent quarter, with revenue up 22%, though it lowered its guidance, forecasting a low-double-digit decline in mobile handsets for calendar 2022. It also said elevated inventory levels are impacting profitability and called for revenue and profits to decline in the current quarter.
NXP Semiconductors is another diversified chip company that makes microprocessors as well as chips used for networking, security, and wireless communication. Its biggest segment is automotive. Like Qualcomm, NXP reported strong results in its most recent quarter, but the company's guidance called for a slowdown in revenue growth and some slight margin compression. However, NXP looks better positioned than its peers, especially as demand from its automotive and industrial customers has been strong.
Finally, Marvell has a similar business to NXP and is coming off strong growth in the third quarter. However, the company is also experiencing inventory-related headwinds and is calling for a slight decline in adjusted EPS in the current quarter. Management also noted a decline in demand from its Chinese customers due to a changing macroeconomic situation. In October, Marvell also cut research jobs in China due to new restrictions on U.S. semiconductor companies selling chips to China or operating there in some cases.
Now what
Micron is seen as a bellwether in the semiconductor industry, as its memory and storage products are widely used. With fears of a global recession rising heading into 2023, things could get worse for the chip sector before they get better. However, the industry should eventually recover.
Qualcomm, NXP, and Marvell are all vulnerable to a downturn to a varying degree, while Taiwan Semi looks to be the most stable of the bunch here.
Given Micron's status and influence over the industry, investors should pay attention to its results going forward as an indicator of the industry's health.

2022-12-22 00:00:00+00:00,Marvell (MRVL) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/marvell-mrvl-is-considered-a-good-investment-by-brokers%3A-is-that-true,,,"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?
Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Marvell Technology (MRVL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.
Marvell currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.32, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 25 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.32 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 25 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 80% and 8% of all recommendations.
Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MRVL


Check price target & stock forecast for Marvell here>>>

While the ABR calls for buying Marvell, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.
Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.
This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.
ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank
In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.
The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.
On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.
There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.
Should You Invest in MRVL?
In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Marvell, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 9.5% over the past month to $2.12.
Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Marvell. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Marvell with a grain of salt.

2022-12-15 00:00:00+00:00,"Investors Heavily Search Marvell Technology, Inc. (MRVL): Here is What You Need to Know",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investors-heavily-search-marvell-technology-inc.-mrvl%3A-here-is-what-you-need-to-know,,,"Marvell Technology (MRVL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Shares of this chipmaker have returned +1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Technology Services industry, to which Marvell belongs, has gained 0.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Marvell is expected to post earnings of $0.47 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -33.2%.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.13 points to a change of +35.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -9.1%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.04 indicates a change of -4.1% from what Marvell is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -23.3%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Marvell is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Marvell, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.4 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $5.93 billion and $6.11 billion estimates indicate +32.8% and +3.1% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Marvell reported revenues of $1.54 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +26.9%. EPS of $0.57 for the same period compares with $0.43 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.33%. The EPS surprise was -3.39%.
Over the last four quarters, Marvell surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Marvell is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marvell. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

2022-12-12 00:00:00+00:00,Marvell (MRVL) Launches Alaska C X9340P Ethernet Transceiver,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/marvell-mrvl-launches-alaska-c-x9340p-ethernet-transceiver,,,"Marvell Technology MRVL recently launched the industry’s highest-performance and lowest-power single-chip 800 GbE PAM4 Physical Layer (“PHY”) device, Alaska C X9340P. The device features built-in Media Access Control security (“MACsec”) and full support for Precision Time Protocol (“PTP”).
The new 5-nanometer (nm) 1.6T Ethernet PHY, with 100 G input-output capability, is developed on the 112-gigabyte per second SerDes technology. It delivers 40% lower power per bit compared to previous-generation PHYs.
The device performs IEEE 802.1AE MACsec encryption functionality for two ports of 800 GbE, four ports of 400 GbE, eight ports of 200 GbE or sixteen ports of 100 GbE. This enables flexible encryption deployment while avoiding the cost and power burden of including this functionality in the application-specific integrated circuit switch. It gives a vendor-independent, hardware-based link-layer security control of networking equipment elements to cloud data center customers.
Available for sampling to selective customers at present, the Marvell Alaska C X9340P supports Class C PTP timestamping functionality, which allows the support of sub-microsecond end-to-end clock synchronization accuracy required for 5G Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication services.
 Marvell Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus

Marvell’s new Ethernet solution is built for the cloud data center and high-density communication network applications based on 100G serial electrical signaling that requires MACsec, IPsec, PTP or Hitless Mux functionalities. It supports a variety of gear boxing modes to translate among the 10G/25G NRZ, 50G PAM4 and 100G PAM4 modes for 800 GbE, 400 GbE, 200 GbE and 100 GbE.
Marvell is benefiting from the solid demand for its storage and networking chips from the 5G infrastructure and data center end markets. Last week, MRVL commenced the sampling of Marvell Spica Gen2 800Gbps PAM4 DSP, which is a next-generation solution for the cloud data center, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence optical transceivers.
The new electro-optics platform is designed on advanced 5 nm process technology with companion transimpedance amplifiers and a linear driver that delivers industry-leading power efficiency, resulting in greater than 25% power savings compared to the previous versions of Spica PAM4 DSPs. The PAM4 DSP platform enables less than 12-watt 800G QSFP-DD800/OSFP optical transceiver modules.
In October, Marvell unveiled a comprehensive 3 nm silicon technology platform to enhance its solution portfolio across the cloud data center, carrier, enterprise and automotive markets. The 3 nm silicon platform is currently in fabrication with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on its 3 nm shuttle.
In May, the company introduced its third-generation Marvell Brightlane Ethernet Switch, the industry’s most advanced automotive securely managed switch. It is the first with lockstep dual-core arm processing redundancy to enable high reliability for mission-critical applications that support vehicle safety and performance.
Nonetheless, organizations are pushing back their investments in big and expensive technology products due to global economic slowdown concerns. These can undermine Marvell’s near-term growth prospects.

In the last reported results for the third quarter of 2023, the company’s top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, Marvell’s fourth-quarter revenue guidance depicts around 4% year-over-year growth, which is way lower than the more than 20% increase it has witnessed in the past seven quarters.

2022-12-08 00:00:00+00:00,January 2023 Options Now Available For Marvell Technology (MRVL),MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/january-2023-options-now-available-for-marvell-technology-mrvl,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available today, for the January 2023 expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new January 2023 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.37. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $40.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $37.63 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $41.51/share today.
Because the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.93% return on the cash commitment, or 43.25% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $40.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $42.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.15. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $41.51/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $42.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.77% if the stock gets called away at the January 2023 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $42.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $42.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.59% boost of extra return to the investor, or 55.40% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $41.51) to be 63%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-12-08 00:00:00+00:00,1 Top Stock Down 53% to Buy Hand Over Fist Before 2022 Ends,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-top-stock-down-53-to-buy-hand-over-fist-before-2022-ends,,,"Shares of Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) have been heading lower following the release of the company's fiscal 2023 third-quarter earnings report (for the three months ending Oct. 29, 2022) on Dec. 1. The chipmaker failed to offer solid guidance, leading investors to press the panic button.
Marvell reported impressive year-over-year growth last quarter, but is contending with soft demand in certain areas. More specifically, Marvell's storage customers are reducing inventories, reflecting the weak demand environment. Savvy investors, however, may want to take a closer look at this semiconductor stock, as its diversified business should allow it to tide over the near-term headwinds and soar higher in the new year and beyond.
Marvell Technology is about to hit a speed bump
Marvell reported fiscal Q3 revenue of about $1.54 billion, an increase of 27% over the prior-year period. The company's adjusted net income jumped 32% year over year to $0.57 per share. On the latest earnings conference call, Marvell management attributed the healthy growth to cloud computing, 5G infrastructure, and automotive businesses.
But the chipmaker's outlook was the fly in the ointment. Marvell guided for adjusted earnings of $0.46 per share and revenue of about $1.4 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter. These numbers point toward a slowdown. In comparison, Marvell reported $1.34 billion in revenue in the year-ago period. The company's earnings are on track to contract from $0.50 per share in the same quarter last year.
Explaining the reason why Marvell is about to lose its wheels, Marvell CEO Matt Murphy said:
Late in the quarter, customers started requesting to push out shipments and reschedule orders to manage their inventory in a changing demand environment. In the third quarter, these inventory reductions started to manifest, and we are expecting an even greater impact in the fourth quarter. The largest impact is from our storage customers and has been widely communicated by that set of OEMs.
It is not surprising to see that Marvell's storage business is under stress right now. The sharp decline in sales of personal computers this year has hurt sales of storage chips such as hard-disk drives and solid-state drives.
The bad news is that Marvell is witnessing weak demand for its storage controllers in the data center segment as well. The weakness in data center storage can be attributed to the opening up of workplaces and educational institutions after pandemic restrictions, which has reduced the need for rapid data center expansion.
However, analysts are anticipating healthy double-digit earnings growth from Marvell in the long run. Consensus estimates suggest that the chipmaker's bottom line could clock annual growth of nearly 19% over the next five years.
A closer look at the company's growth opportunities tells us why Wall Street is upbeat about its prospects in the long run.
Don't miss these long-term catalysts
Marvell Technology sells chips that are used in multiple fast-growing niches such as cloud computing, 5G infrastructure, and automotive. The company has been gaining traction and building up its revenue pipeline for the long run.
For instance, Marvell and Nokia recently strengthened their collaboration in 5G infrastructure. Nokia will be using Marvell's data processing units in its 5G chipsets to deploy faster networks. Given that Nokia is a key player in the global base station market, with a share of 21.5%, and it has been winning a large chunk of 5G contracts in emerging markets such as India, Marvell's stronger relationship with the Finnish company bodes well for the long run.
Meanwhile, Vodafone and Samsung are also partnering with Marvell and using the latter's Octeon chipset in the deployment of 5G open radio access networks (RAN) across Europe. It is worth noting that the open RAN market is expected to see an impressive 42% annual growth rate through 2030, which means that Marvell is on track to take advantage of a solid growth opportunity.
Moreover, Marvell's design win momentum in the cloud computing space hasn't been diluted by the near-term slowdown in demand. The company scored a ""significant design at a Tier 1 hyperscaler projected to drive a substantial amount of revenue in aggregate over the program's lifetime."" It wouldn't be surprising to see Marvell score further design wins in the hyperscale cloud computing market, as this space is anticipated to post nearly 30% annual growth through 2026.
Coming to the automotive business, Marvell witnessed healthy growth in this segment last quarter. The company's revenue from the automotive and industrial segment increased 26% year over year last quarter to $84 million thanks to the growing adoption of automotive ethernet technology. While this segment is still a small part of Marvell's top line, the company points out that it has ""been accumulating platform design wins across a broad spectrum of auto OEMs. And we have generated a substantial pipeline of lifetime revenue that will benefit us over many years.""
Not surprisingly, Marvell's automotive and industrial revenue is estimated to increase nearly 30% year over year in the current quarter. The company's automotive revenue should head higher in the long run as it is operating in fast-growing areas such as automotive ethernet, a niche that's expected to enjoy annual growth of nearly 21% through 2026.
All these potential growth drivers suggest that opportunistic investors should consider grabbing this semiconductor stock right away, as it is trading at a relatively attractive 6.2 times sales, compared to last year's sales multiple of almost 17. Also, the forward earnings multiple of 18 indicates that Marvell stock is cheaper than the Nasdaq-100 index, which sports a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.
In all, Marvell Technology has several catalysts that should help it regain its mojo in 2023 and beyond, and that could send the stock price soaring.

2022-12-06 00:00:00+00:00,Wall Street Analysts See Marvell (MRVL) as a Buy: Should You Invest?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-street-analysts-see-marvell-mrvl-as-a-buy%3A-should-you-invest,,,"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?
Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Marvell Technology (MRVL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.
Marvell currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.33, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 24 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.33 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 24 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 79.2% and 8.3% of all recommendations.

While the ABR calls for buying Marvell, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.
Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.
In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.
Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.
ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank
In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.
The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.
In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.
In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.
There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.
Is MRVL a Good Investment?
Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Marvell, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 2.2% over the past month to $2.26.
Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Marvell. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Marvell with a grain of salt.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.

2022-12-02 00:00:00+00:00,These 2 Stocks Weighed the Nasdaq Down Friday,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-2-stocks-weighed-the-nasdaq-down-friday,,,"Investors looked ready to start the weekend early on Friday, as the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) moved lower by more than 1% as of 11 a.m. ET. The Nasdaq and other indexes fell after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported strong jobs growth for the month of November, raising fears that the Fed wouldn't loosen its monetary policy stance as quickly as some had begun hoping.
Some Nasdaq stocks posted even sharper losses. Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) was down significantly after the semiconductor company reported its latest financial results, while the declines for restaurant favorite Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (NASDAQ: CBRL) were even steeper. Read on to learn more about both stocks and why investors are looking at them closely on Friday.
Marvell deals with a semiconductor slowdown
Shares of Marvell Technology fell 6% in late morning trading on Friday. The semiconductor company's third-quarter financial report for the period ending Oct. 29 left investors worried that the industry's slowdown could be worse than previously expected.
Marvell's numbers for the quarter didn't seem to justify a big decline in the stock price. Revenue of $1.54 billion was up 27% year over year, with the company pointing to its cloud computing, 5G wireless network upgrade, and automotive sector products in leading growth. However, the figure was at the lower end of the guidance that Marvell had given back in August, and CEO Matt Murphy noted that its customers took the opportunity to reduce their inventory levels during the quarter. That hit near-term results, despite the company seeing adjusted net income of $492 million for the period, or $0.57 per share.
Investors also had to digest fiscal fourth-quarter guidance from Marvell. The company expects sales to fall back to between $1.33 billion and $1.47 billion, with adjusted earnings of between $0.41 and $0.51 per share. Those figures would be considerably below what most of those following Marvell had anticipated seeing to close the current fiscal year.
Marvell's stock has lost roughly half its value since the beginning of 2022, as investors across the semiconductor industry fear that economic headwinds will cause a cyclical downturn for the business. Marvell will have to outpace its downbeat guidance in order to reassure shareholders of its ability to weather tough conditions and come out a long-term winner.
Cracker Barrel stock gets pegged
Shares of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store didn't look too appetizing on Friday, with the price slumping 11%. The restaurant chain saw its profits fall substantially, and investors weren't pleased with a downbeat forecast for the near future, either.
Cracker Barrel reported $839.5 million in revenue in the fiscal first quarter ending Oct. 28, which was 7% higher from year-ago levels. The restaurant side of the business outperformed its retail operations, with restaurant comps rising 7.1% and retail comps up 4.3% year over year. However, inflation took its toll on Cracker Barrel's expenses, as the company said that higher wage and commodity costs hurt its operating income. Adjusted earnings came in at $0.99 per share, down 35% from the same period a year ago.
Moreover, Cracker Barrel sees challenging conditions continuing throughout fiscal 2023. The company adjusted its outlook to expect revenue growth of 6% to 8%, with commodity inflation remaining between 8% and 9% and wage inflation of 5% to 6%. That won't stop Cracker Barrel from investing in new stores and business model improvements, but it nevertheless paints a grim picture for what the macroeconomic climate might look like well into 2023.
Cracker Barrel has also had its stock come under pressure in 2022. If it can succeed in efforts to broaden its customer base, though, then it might be able to get itself moving back in the right direction.

2022-12-02 00:00:00+00:00,US STOCKS-Nasdaq leads Wall St lower after robust November jobs data,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-nasdaq-leads-wall-st-lower-after-robust-november-jobs-data,,,"By Bansari Mayur Kamdar, Ankika Biswas and Medha Singh
Dec 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes fell sharply on Friday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq leading losses, as higher-than-expected job additions in November reignited investor concerns about the Federal Reserve continuing on its path of aggressive monetary policy tightening.
The Labor Department's jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls rose by 263,000, compared with an estimated 200,000, as U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in November and raised wages despite mounting worries of a recession.
The U.S. unemployment rate remained unchanged, as expected.
""Strong job creation and a big increase in wages underscore the Fed's argument that a lot more work needs to be done to get inflation under control,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.
""Adding to the Fed's problems, monetary conditions have loosened in recent weeks as the dollar and longer-dated Treasury yields have fallen and credit spreads have narrowed. This is undoing the tightening effects of the Fed's recent rate rises.""
Knightley forecast further 50-basis point rate hikes in December and in February, with the potential for tightening needing to go on for longer, he added.
The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets on Dec. 13-14, capping a volatile year that saw the central bank respond to the fastest outbreak of inflation since the 1980s, with the fastest increase in interest rates since then to try to offset it.
Investors now see an 87% chance that the Fed will increase interest rates by 50 basis points in December, down from 91% before the jobs data was published on Friday. FEDWATCH
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are on track to end the week higher following a sharp rally on Wednesday sparked by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments on scaling back interest rates hikes as early as December.
At 09:47 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 313.86 points, or 0.91%, at 34,081.15, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 46.49 points, or 1.14%, at 4,030.08, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 162.01 points, or 1.41%, at 11,320.44.
All of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors declined in early trading.
Growth and technology companies such as Apple Inc AAPL.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O fell 1.4% and 3.1%, respectively, as Treasury yields recovered from multi-week lows pressuring the rate-sensitive megacap stocks.

Dec 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell sharply on Friday as higher-than-expected job additions in November poured cold water on investor expectations of the Federal Reserve easing its aggressive monetary policy tightening.
The Labor Department's jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls rose by 263,000, compared with an estimated 200,000, as U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in November and raised wages despite mounting worries of a recession.
The U.S. unemployment rate remained unchanged, as expected.
""This is an employment market that continues to remain hot and the wage gains are going to be out of their comfort zones,"" said Jason Pride, chief investment officer for private wealth at Glenmede in Philadelphia.
""Hotter labor market means the Fed is going to stay on their tightening campaign or remain higher for longer which is not going to be taken well by the overall economy or the markets.""
Wall Street indexes closed mixed on Thursday following a sharp rally the day before sparked by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments on scaling back interest rates hikes as early as December.
Thursday's moves followed a mixed bag of economic data, including the personal consumption expenditure index, the Fed's preferred inflation metric, which was better than expected, while manufacturing activity shrank in November for the first time in 2-1/2 years.
Investors now see an 87% chance that the U.S. central bank will increase interest rates by 50 basis points in December, down from 91% before the jobs data was published on Friday. FEDWATCH
The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets on Dec. 13-14, capping a volatile year that saw the central bank respond to the fastest outbreak of inflation since the 1980s, with the fastest increase in interest rates since then to try to offset it.
Growth and technology companies such as Apple Inc AAPL.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O fell 1.6% and 3.2%, respectively, in trading before the bell, as rising Treasury yields pressured the rate-sensitive megacap stocks.
At 08:51 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were down 411 points, or 1.19%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 59.75 points, or 1.46%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 251 points, or 2.08%.

Dec 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged lower on Friday as investors await the monthly jobs report for November, which would provide more clues on the Federal Reserve's path of monetary tightening.
The Labor Department's jobs report due at 8:30 a.m. ET is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rose by 200,000 in November, less than the increase in October, while the U.S. unemployment rate is likely to remain at 3.7% in the last month.
Job growth for the last month was likely the smallest in nearly two years as mounting worries of a recession cooled demand for labor, which could give the Fed confidence to start slowing the pace of its interest rate hikes this month.
Wall Street indexes closed mixed on Thursday following a sharp rally the day before sparked by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments on scaling back interest rates hikes as early as December.
Thursday's moves followed a mixed bag of economic data, including the personal consumption expenditure index, the Fed's preferred inflation metric, which was better than expected, while manufacturing activity shrank in November for the first time in 2-1/2 years.
Investors now see a 91% chance that the U.S. central bank will increase interest rates by 50 basis points in December, with the rates peaking under 5% in May 2023. FEDWATCH
""The market is looking for the Goldilocks scenario for U.S. jobs numbers on Friday,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
""Ideally the labor market would neither be so hot that it suggests the Fed needs to stay aggressive on rates nor so cold that it implies the world's largest economy is headed for a severe downturn.""
Semiconductor company Marvell Technology Inc MRVL.O tumbled 6.9% in premarket trading after quarterly earnings and revenue missed expectations.
Automation software firm UiPath Inc PATH.N jumped 10.2% on upbeat quarterly earnings.
At 05:42 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were down 23 points, or 0.07%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 1 point, or 0.02%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 8.25 points, or 0.07%.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields US10YT=RR fell to 10-week lows and the two-year note US2YT=RR, which often indicates interest rate expectations, slipped to early October lows.

Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Marvell team drove revenue to $1.54 billion, a record for the company, growing 27% year over year and 1% sequentially. This year-over-year growth was driven by our cloud, 5G, and auto business, as well as share and content gains in our enterprise networking end market. Our third-quarter revenue came in toward the lower end of our guidance range, and we are forecasting a sequential decline in our fourth quarter.
Early in the third quarter, we were still dealing with supply escalations. Late in the quarter, customers started requesting to push out shipments and reschedule orders to manage their inventory in a changing demand environment. In the third quarter, these inventory reductions started to manifest, and we are expecting an even greater impact in the fourth quarter. The largest impact is from our storage customers and has been widely communicated by that set of OEMs.
In addition, as our Chinese customers deal with a changing macroeconomic situation, their demand for our products has come down significantly. Just to give you a sense of the magnitude of that change, we estimate that our revenue in the fourth quarter from our OEM customers based in China will decrease by over one-third compared to the second quarter. We expect revenue from China OEMs will account for less than 10% of our total company revenue in the fourth quarter. I would note that to date, the restrictions of the U.S.
Department of Commerce announced in October on shipments of U.S. chip technology to China has not meaningfully impacted our revenue. While the inventory correction at our customers is challenging in the near term, we believe it's prudent to work closely with them to manage the change in an orderly fashion and clear the path to a resumption of growth. Let me now move on to discussing our end markets, starting with data center.
In our data center end market, revenue for the third quarter was $627 million, exceeding guidance with better-than-expected results from our cloud business. On a year-on-year basis, our data center revenue grew 26% with our cloud business driving all the growth with multiple product lines contributing to strong results. On a sequential basis, our data center revenue declined by 3% due to softness in our on-premise business. Our storage products, including fiber channel, HDD, and SSD, all saw demand decline during the quarter.
However, our cloud business continued to grow sequentially, driven by strength in our electro-optics and switch products. We are seeing the growth rate of the data center end market decelerate and customers have started adjusting their inventory to address the changing demand picture. As a result, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting our data center revenue to decline year over year approximately in the mid- to high teens on a percentage basis and sequentially decline in the mid-20% range. The biggest change in demand is in product lines where we are one step removed from the end customer.
So, when demand changes quickly, we are more exposed to the supply chain bullwhip effect. As a result, we expect the impact to be the most pronounced in our storage business, which we project will be responsible for the bulk of the overall sequential decline in our data center revenue. In particular, we are projecting a very large reduction in shipments of our HDD controllers and preamps, as HDD OEMs deal with a broad-based inventory correction. The rest of our data center business is also expected to deal with inventory adjustments by our customers but to a much lesser extent compared to our storage business.
While we work through the near-term situation in the data center end market, we remain confident in our multiple long-term growth drivers. In the third quarter, we started ramping our cloud-optimized silicon design wins into production and are planning to launch multiple additional products in fiscal year 2024 and 2025. Our successful execution on the first group of projects, coupled with our ongoing investments in data infrastructure, silicon IP, and advanced process and packaging technologies is opening up an even larger set of opportunities with cloud customers. In the third quarter, we launched our next-generation cloud security solution, Marvell's LiquidSecurity 2 HSM adapter, the industry's most advanced solution for enabling encryption, key management, and authentication in the cloud.
Powered by Marvell's cloud-optimized OCTEON DPU, LS 2 is a converged security platform for payment, privacy compliance, and general-purpose applications. We are also making progress on two of our longer-term growth initiatives in the cloud, CXL, and ADCs. In the third quarter, we announced availability of our CXL development platform for cloud data center operators and server OEMs, enabling two key use cases: memory expansion and memory pooling. The platform pairs Marvell's advanced CXL technology with the latest CXL capable CPUs, including the new fourth-gen AMD EPYC processors demonstrating multi-host memory pooling.
With this platform, cloud operators can begin to advance their infrastructure and enable their applications to take advantage of this cutting-edge technology. I'm very excited to announce that we have recently won a significant design at a Tier 1 hyperscaler projected to drive a substantial amount of revenue in aggregate over the program's lifetime. Product development activities are in full swing, and our team is driving a large and growing pipeline of CXL opportunities. In the AC market, multiple cable manufacturers have started sampling 100-gig per lane active electrical cables powered by Marvell PAM4 DSPs to cloud data center operators, which we expect to pave the way to broader adoption and expand our addressable market.
Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue was $271 million, growing 26% year over year and declining 5% sequentially. On a year-on-year basis, the vast majority of our growth was driven by our wireless business, which continued to benefit from the growth in 5G adoption. As you recall, the annualized revenue run rate for our wireless business crossed $600 million in the second quarter of this fiscal year.
We are excited to see growth continue from that milestone. Our wired business also grew year on year in the third quarter, driven by solid demand from metro and long-haul carrier for our market-leading coherent DSPs and accompanying TIAs and drivers. On a sequential basis, our wired business came down as expected from a very strong second quarter and more than offset growth from our wireless business. We are excited to see our 5G business continuing to flourish and are looking forward to broader deployment of 5G in multiple geographies, including the U.S., Europe, and India.
In addition, we anticipate significant share in content growth ahead and new opportunities in ORAN and DRAM architectures. As you will recall, in March 2020, Nokia and Marvell announced that our companies have started working together to develop a leading 5G silicon including multiple generations of custom silicon and infrastructure processors to further expand the range of Nokia's ReefShark chipsets. Earlier this week, we announced an extension of our collaboration with Nokia to further advance their 5G chipset portfolio. Nokia will be using our new OCTEON 10 DPU, the industry's leading 5G transport processor built on Marvell's cutting-edge five-nanometer platform and hardware acceleration technology.
These high-performance and highly efficient processors will allow operators to scale rapidly and manage the dramatic increase in data traffic and performance demanded by 5G's innovative service-based architecture while reducing cost and energy consumption. We continue to expand our collaboration with Nokia and look forward to enabling their next-generation 5G platforms. There are also two key announcements from the Open RAN ecosystem. Vodafone and Nokia announced that they have agreed to work on a fully compliant Open RAN solution with Marvell.
Developing cooperation with us, Nokia's ReefShark SoC boosts Layer-1 processing capability to enable Open RAN systems to reach full functionality and performance parity with traditional mobile radio networks. In another development, Vodafone and Samsung recently announced that they are jointly cooperating with Marvell to accelerate the performance and adoption of 5G Open RAN across Europe. They plan on incorporating Marvell's advanced OCTEON Fusion processor specifically designed for Open RAN into the latest off-the-shelf servers. The specialized accelerator chip also enables massive MIMO technology developed to serve many subscribers in dense urban areas.
Moving on to our outlook for next quarter. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting revenue from our carrier end market to grow slightly on a sequential basis and grow year over year approximately in the mid-teens on a percentage basis. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $376 million, growing 52% year over year and 10% sequentially.
As the quarter progressed, our Chinese customers started to turn cautious due to an evolving macroeconomic environment. In response, we work with customers realigning shipments to reflect their reduced demand. As a result, despite the strong sequential and year-over-year growth, revenue was lower than our guidance. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting revenue from the enterprise networking end market to decline sequentially in the low single digits on a percentage basis.
However, we expect growth to continue year over year at close to 40%, reflecting our higher content and growing share. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $84 million, growing 26% year over year and 1% sequentially. Revenue was lower than our forecast in industrial, as well as automotive where we continue to experience supply challenges in certain legacy notes.
We expect these supply challenges to start to improve in our fourth quarter. On a sequential basis, our auto business continued to grow, partially offset by a decline in our industrial business. On a year-over-year basis in this end market, Marvell's growth was primarily from our auto business, driven by continuing adoption of our Ethernet technology. Our auto business achieved another milestone in the third quarter with annualized revenues exceeding $200 million.
As you recall, we have been accumulating platform design wins across a broad spectrum of auto OEMs. And we have generated a substantial pipeline of lifetime revenue that will benefit us over many years. Looking to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are projecting strong growth for our overall auto and industrial end market, expecting revenue to grow approximately 30% year over year and in the mid-20% range sequentially. Moving to our consumer end market.
Revenue for the third quarter was $178 million, declining 2% year over year and growing 9% sequentially. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are forecasting revenue to be flat sequentially and decline in the low to mid-single digits year over year on a percentage basis. In summary, Marvell delivered record results in the third quarter despite the macroeconomic uncertainty in the world and inventory corrections in some of our end markets. Taking stock of our progress this fiscal year, at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, we are projecting full fiscal year revenue growth in the low 30% range.
While we are not immune to the global slowdown impacting the semiconductor sector, we expect to finish this year growing revenue well above the industry and our long-term model, reflecting our continued focus on data infrastructure. Looking forward to the next fiscal year, we remain confident in our key growth drivers of cloud, 5G, and auto. We expect that our cloud-optimized silicon programs will build from the initial ramp that started in the second half of this fiscal year and continue to grow approximately $400 million in aggregate revenue in fiscal 2024 and $800 million in fiscal 2025. Our cloud customers are relying on these chips to build incredibly efficient and optimized custom hardware to enable their key growth drivers.
In addition to our cloud-optimized programs, we expect that our 5G products in our automotive business will drive strong year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2024. Offsetting this growth to an extent, we expect a few quarters of inventory adjustments in some of our businesses as customers realign their demand. We continue to be disciplined on operating expenses. We have tightened spending and slowed our pace of hiring, focusing on critical hires for future success.
At the same time, we continue to invest in our long-term growth initiatives including our three-nanometer silicon platform, which is now available for new product designs. In addition, we are committed to executing on a number of new products, which our customers have designed into their mission-critical applications. Over the last few years, we have significantly transformed the company, creating a diversified business with growing exposure to multiple infrastructure end markets with strong secular growth drivers. Our businesses at scale, we have a growing design win funnel, leadership products, and strong customer engagement.
We've built an extraordinary team at Marvell with a track record of execution excellence, and we believe we are well-positioned to navigate the current environment to continue to deliver strong top- and bottom-line results over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue in the third quarter was $1.537 billion, within our guidance range, growing 1% sequentially and 27% year over year, driven by growth from our data infrastructure end market. Data center accounted for 41% of revenue, enterprise networking was 24% of revenue, carrier infrastructure at 18%, consumer at 12%, and auto industrial at 5%.
GAAP gross margin was 50.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64% of revenue, below our guidance range primarily due to product mix. Our enterprise and auto industrial end market revenue was lower than expected, and the consumer revenue was higher than our forecast. GAAP operating expenses were $672 million.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $420 million, declining by 3% sequentially. Year over year, opex increased by 13%, growing at less than half the rate of the top-line revenue growth. Opex was lower than guidance due to lower bonus accrual and better-than-expected NRE. Our GAAP operating income was $106 million.
Non-GAAP operating profit was $564 million or 36.7% of revenue, another all-time record, demonstrating the strong leverage in our operating model. Other income expense, including interest on our debt, was $41 million, higher than guidance primarily due to higher interest rate on our outstanding debt. For the third quarter, GAAP income per diluted share was $0.02. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.57 within our guidance range.
Earnings per share grew 33% year over year, faster than top-line revenue growth. Now, turning to our balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $411 million in cash from operations, reflecting our strong earnings, offset by continued working capital investments to support our top-line revenue growth, including $94 million in payments for long-term back-end and substrate capacity agreements. These agreements are critical to ramping our complex products in data infrastructure market, including the call to optimize the silicon solutions Matt discussed earlier.
In the third quarter, we increased our inventory by $44 million or 5% sequentially. Looking at the change in demand we are forecasting in the fourth quarter, we expect our inventory level to continue to be elevated. We are focused on prioritizing new product ramps to support our customers. These -- most of our products have long product cycles of three to five years or even longer.
We are comfortable carrying higher inventory in a dynamic supply chain environment and we plan on reducing inventory starting next fiscal year. As of the end of the third fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalent was $723 million, increasing by $106 million from the prior quarter. Our total debt was $4.5 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9 times, and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6 times.
During the third quarter, we returned $101 million to shareholders through $51 million in cash dividends and $50 million of share repurchases. In summary, in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the Marvell team executed very well, delivering top-line revenue growth and earnings expansion much faster than revenue growth. Now, turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.4 billion, plus or minus 5%.
We expect our GAAP gross margin in the range of 48.2% to 50.2%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 64%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $646 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $430 million.
As Matt mentioned earlier, we have proactively slowed down our pace of hiring and tightened the discretionary spending to manage our operating expenses. We have a proven track record of executing through economic and the market cycles to maintain strong profitability while we continue to invest in long-term growth initiatives. As a reminder, looking ahead to the first fiscal quarter of 2024, due to the typical seasonality in payroll taxes and employee merit increase, our opex tends to increase from the fourth fiscal quarter in the high single digits sequentially on a percentage basis. Following the step-up in the first fiscal quarter, we are currently planning on holding our opex approximately flat at that level for the next few quarters.
Other income and expense, including interest on our debt, is expected to be approximately $44 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 6% for the fourth quarter and currently expect this to increase slightly to 7% next fiscal year. We expect our basic weighted share outstanding will be 855 million. And our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be 861 million.
As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of breakeven to $0.05 per diluted share. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.46, plus or minus $0.05. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst
Hey, thanks for taking my question. Matt, maybe just on the data center, I want to understand the moving pieces a little bit better. I think storage has been weak for a bit. I think nearline, I think you've been pretty open that that was weak.
I guess it's implied a big move in storage. And I guess what I'm struggling with is trying to figure out how to put the comment on the Chinese weakness as well because that's a big number. And I guess maybe that overlaps. So, can you just parse those two pieces a little bit more for me? What -- when you say China is weak, what kind of products are we talking about? Is there a way you kind of give any better color on that within the data center for January?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Gotcha, Blayne. Yeah. So, on the first one on nearline, as you mentioned, there's been a lot of reports out there about the weakness there.
We really hadn't seen that when we guided the quarter. In Q3, we started to see some weakness, but the impact is very pronounced in the fourth quarter, and that nearline weakness obviously flows into the data center end market into that bucket. When you go to China and the weakness we've seen there, that's really in the enterprise area. So, while overall enterprise is hanging in there, it was slightly below in Q3.
We've had some offsets to that from strength elsewhere. But the main impact of the Chinese customers has really been an enterprise for the most part.
Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst
Thanks. And then if I could just follow up, you mentioned in terms of the cloud, you said it was actually strong in October, both optical, as well as switching. I'm kind of -- but you also made a comment that I think data center is decelerating. So, can you just put those two together? Are you still seeing strength in U.S.
cloud and weakness elsewhere? Does the comment on data center weakening just on-prem? What did you mean by that?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yep. Great question. So, let me take it from the top. So, first point would be that if you look over the last few years, cloud capex has been on fire.
It's been growing 30% kind of plus for the last few years. This year, if you look at reports and kind of what we see is probably something in the 15% range for '22 and then it depends on who you talk to, but probably down in the low to mid-single digits or maybe mid-single digits for next year. So, that's the deceleration that we're talking about. And as the macro has started to catch up even with these large cloud companies, you see them very publicly tightening their capex, tightening their opex.
And they've had this supply chain built in the data center, which was geared up for a lot of growth. And so, as they reset those expectations, it's not a real smooth process. Storage is the most pronounced, as I mentioned earlier. That's the majority reason code for the sequential decline.
But we are seeing inventory adjustment as well to a much lesser extent, and I'd say the broader set of product lines outside of storage that we sell into data center. And so, that is not a China-specific thing. That is a global comment, including U.S. cloud, seeing inventory adjustment a bit more broadly.
And that's a change, certainly from where we were, say, a quarter ago when we were mired in supply escalations and expedites to an environment where it's now how do we work together to manage the inventory and manage the new reality. And so, that's what you see in the guide for Q4. Hopefully, that was helpful to give you the perspective you were looking for.
Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst
Thanks for the color.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yep.

Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. Matt, I'm trying to see what is the range of kind of scenarios for fiscal '24 sales growth. I understand you're not giving a specific number. It would be helpful if you give us at least kind of a range.
Can Marvell grow next year? Because when I look at the three areas, cloud and 5G, and autos, I believe it's about 35%, 40% of business. Can those three areas collectively grow fast enough to offset the inventory correction in other areas? Like, so should we be thinking about flat or mid-single digit? What's the kind of range of scenarios of growth that we should be thinking about for fiscal '24?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Great question, Vivek. And certainly, I'd frame all this by saying it's still a very dynamic environment. So, we'll give you the best view we can.
I'd say the first point is we feel very good about the new products that are ramping up and the growth drivers that we've articulated, whether it's cloud-optimized silicon, switching, electro-optics, things like that in the data center, 5G, obviously, continued momentum there with additional regions like India ramping next year plus content gain rolling through and then automotive continuing to grow. So, those are all the positives. What we don't know completely, but I'll give you the best color I can is on the base business and how much of the inventory correction we're going to be dealing with and the magnitude of that. We anticipate, first of all, that that's like typical cycles.
It's probably a couple of quarters to work its way through. And the three areas I would call out that probably are some offsets next year are, one, would be in consumer. That's an area where we just haven't put a lot of investment. We've been typically running that business for cash.
You'll probably see some decline there. I think on-premise data center is another area. The on-prem stuff probably has work to do next year. And then maybe a little bit in our wired infrastructure business.
If you look, actually, it's kind of interesting, if you go back to our fiscal '22 and you look at those three areas, they all grew pretty dramatically in fiscal '23, the current year we're in. And so, at a high level, I think some of those are probably going to trend back to where they were before this big upcycle. And again, from a sort of a timing perspective, think of it as a lot of that headwind or weakness more in the first half, inventory works itself through, and then you have growth back off of that, plus you have the growth drivers kicking in. So, I think it's a very different story, most likely first half versus second half.
But those are some of the moving pieces in terms of how you think about the growth drivers versus some of the offsets. But we do see -- we still believe we can drive positive year-over-year growth. It just certainly isn't going to be as high as we had been hoping for if you went back even three months ago, just given the magnitude of some of the inventory adjustments.
Operator
Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Thanks a lot. Matt, just along the same lines of that question. I'm just kind of wondering if you can help us figure out what a reasonable baseline is in the data center business headed into next year. If you look at storage, I mean, it must be down about 50% sequentially in January, and you were obviously over-shipping the past few quarters and you're really under-shipping now.
But it seems like if you net all that out, maybe it's kind of the $600 million per quarter baseline in data center, and then you can add the $400 million for the cloud-optimized silicon next year. Can you sort of help us handicap what a normalized run rate might be in that business? Thanks.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. First, I think you're in the ballpark on storage. And just for a little context, the magnitude of that decline, we can't find a data point that shows it declining that quickly. Even when we look back to the reset in 2019, this is down a lot more than that in the same time frame.
So, you're right, a lot has come out, and so that needs to normalize. I think you've probably got the math about right if you think about sort of where is the base business at. But just to be clear, we're still in a little bit of a dynamic environment figuring out where this is going to bottom out. But if you look at how fast it's coming down, and that's kind of what we're doing, by the way, we're effectively working with our customers to make sure we deal with this quickly and efficiently and minimize any risk of building excess inventory.
And that's the path we're on. So, sometime in the Q4, Q1 timeframe, we think that works itself through, and then you start to kind of grow from there. But that's probably reasonable. Probably is an annualized type of run rate, maybe a little bit lower in the first half and certainly higher in the second half as the new designs really ramp up.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Yeah, got it. I guess just maybe trying to -- I was just trying to get -- to hold people's hands a little bit on the nonstorage stuff because people will say, well, the issue is not just storage. The issue is the other stuff, too, but it sounds like it's not.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
It's -- there is some. I mean, just to be very, very clear, right? The major reason code for the sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 in the data center line is storage, but there is inventory adjustment going on in digestion given that slope of the capex curve has just come down. There is some realignment. But that is not as pronounced, and it's very manageable.
But I just -- I want to be very clear, it's not 100% storage issue. There's just a broader digestion.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Of course. Yeah. Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah.

Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Matt, if we take your guidance for the carrier infrastructure business in Q4, I think you'll be doing about $1.1 billion in revenue in the full year, maybe a little bit below that.
To level set us, how much of that is wireless? How much of that is wired? And as you look forward into fiscal year '24, how are you thinking about the 5G business? I think the market, overall, you're seeing some spots of softness potentially, but obviously, you've got idiosyncratic design wins. So, how are you thinking about your business there? And then on the wired side, just given the cyclical dynamics, what sort of decline should we be expecting into fiscal '24? Thank you.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Toshiya, this is Jean. I'll start to answer this question, and then Matt can add. So, first, on the carrier infrastructure, wireless is already more than half. We talk about the wireless revenues already running, had more than $600 million annualized run rate.
So, wireless is definitely small than half. Going into next year, as Matt mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong 5G adoption and our customers continue to do very well in the marketplace. So, we do expect the wireless part of the business will continue to have a very strong growth into next year. Of course, the wireline side is what Matt discussed.
We are going to see some headwinds on wireline side. But overall, we do expect the carrier infrastructure to continue to grow. Matt, anything you want to add?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
No, I think that was perfect. I mean, I just put a pin on it that the wireless opportunity continues to be very exciting, and I think it's going to be a very good year for wireless next year.
Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Thank you.

Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Karl Ackerman -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you. Two questions if I may. Matt or Jean, I wanted to first discuss enterprise networking.
You spoke about how China impacts that a little bit. But ex-China, are you still seeing growth? And I know some of your networking OEMs have spoken about some moderating orders. But I think last quarter, you said that this segment was an area that was most constrained. And so, I want to get -- clarify if that's still true.
And if you could kind of tie in the amount of inventory that some of those customers have to get a better sense of the demand dynamic of enterprise networking going into fiscal '24? Thanks.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. I'll make a few comments. And then, Jean, why don't you add as well? Yes, a couple of things are going on. One is the supply environment has definitely improved.
Now some of that is because of the weakness in the China market that's opened up supply, we can give to other customers. Because generally, outside of a few select cases, our enterprise business is mostly merchant products. These would be Ethernet switches, gigabit, multi-gigabit PHYs, embedded processors, Karl, things like that. So, when you would have a demand softness in one region, you know, that helps things.
So, the supply situation has improved, which is a good thing. We do have some of our own growth drivers as well. We've highlighted this over the last few quarters. We have some new custom silicon wins that are ramping up.
That's offsetting some of that weakness as well. But in general, the non-China piece has done OK. It probably -- we're being cautious about how we think about it for next year. So, I think the run rate that we've guided to in Q4 is probably a safe run rate to think about for next year.
Even if there's a little bit of weakness or there is some inventory digestion that goes on. We do have content gains still rolling through. And so, those are some of the moving pieces. You basically have China going down, U.S.
customers where we've got either new design wins or share gain or content gain. And so, it sort of all aligns to the numbers where we've guided for Q4. Jean, anything you want to add?
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
No.
Karl Ackerman -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Got it. No, that's helpful, Matt. Maybe just as a quick follow-up. I was wondering as you think about some of the inventory digestion that needs to occur across some end markets, as you contemplate that and plan with your foundry suppliers for next year, is there -- could you just maybe just talk about some of the discussions you're having in terms of the ability to perhaps limit some of the cost inflation from the foundry side and whether that -- if they can share that cost with you going forward such that perhaps less of an onerous task for you to pass it along to your end customers.
Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I would say if you -- without getting into the specifics of each of the input costs that we deal with, I would say that in general, with supply loosening up, that's going to be a positive. I'd say that being said, we have -- there are areas that are still constrained. There's still inflationary aspects inside our supply chain that sort of are coming toward us.
We're doing what we can to mitigate those. And to the extent we can't mitigate those, we're going to continue to do what we've been doing for the last few years, which is basically pass it on in a generally margin-neutral type of manner. And we found a way to do that, and we'll continue to do that. But certainly, the Marvell team and the operations team has worked aggressively over the last few years, particularly on the packaging back end, etc., to enable more sources to set up more strategic agreements.
And so, we're kind of working on both sides. One is to just do our job as a good supplier and manage the cost base. But to the extent we can't, there will be probably a little bit of inflation still in the system. That's sort of how we're looking at it.
We formed really strategic partnerships with these companies. We have a very transparent communication with them on the demand environment. And, you know, I'd say that we're counting on them to work with us as partners as we manage through what looks like an overall, you know, semiconductor down cycle.

Our next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Gary Mobley -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question that kind of picks up on the last topic, and that is your purchase obligations. I know you haven't filed your 10-Q yet, but as I looked at the last your purchase obligations are expected to be about 25% of your cost of goods sold next year.
And so, given the current market softness, do you anticipate being able to utilize all that? Do you anticipate the possibility of any sort of inventory write-down? Thank you.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Gary, this is Jean. Thank you for the question. So, yeah, the purchasing obligation we have this quarter will not change much from the last 10-Q we filed. It's about $3.2 billion.
But just remember, those purchase agreement, it's really for long term. On average, it's between four to 10 years. And also, our products are very complex and a lot of them have a very long manufacturing cycle. So, we actually need a dedicated capacity for those complex products to support our customers, single cells, the customer, large volume, last long time.
Regardless of the economic environment, we need those dedicated capacity. And frankly, our team has been very thoughtful. We only secure the capacity largely in back end and the substrate for portion of what we need. So, we feel quite comfortable.
We don't have the issues on the purchase agreement obligations or have to write off any capacity. That's not something we anticipate at all.
Gary Mobley -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
And, Gary, I would just add. I'd say that if you look at the bundle of the different obligations we have, some of them are in the shorter term, which are in the form of things like prepays and others, where, as we take the capacity, we actually get it back. The LTA take-or-pay portion is actually not very large relative to the total. And as Jean said, the most strategic aspect of this is really in the most advanced technologies, especially in complex substrates and high-end packaging, which we absolutely need to secure because of the volume that we're going to be ramping in the next few years.
I mean, just take the -- as one example, the $800 million of incremental cloud-optimized silicon wins. That all is five-nanometer technology using advanced ABS substrates, very customized packaging. Those agreements to get that capacity from really the best vendors, you need to put that in place literally years in advance. And so, we've done those types of things, and we feel good about that because they're tied directly to committed programs.
So, as Jean said, overall, while we have obligations, we think they're actually a benefit to us, and it certainly helps us underwrite our future success. And we're able to send a strong message to our customers about how we're able to provide the necessary capacity and supply chain for them -- for their future.

Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess kind of a two-parter going back to the data center side, Matt. Could you just level set us, what percentage of the third quarter data center business was storage? And then looking forward on the more kind of constructive side of things, what's your confidence level on that $400 million in incremental cloud-optimized revenue growth next year? Given the fact that you talked about a deceleration in what's happening at the cloud customers themselves, are you at all worried about that $400 million being something less than that or being pushed out? Is that at all a level of conservatism that we should consider?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Yeah. Let me answer the second one first. The answer is we feel very good about that revenue stream.
Part of it is, if you remember, Ross, we went from talking about the $400 million and $800 million to actually talking about, call it, $400-plus million $800-plus million because we had gotten additional design wins that created a little bit of a buffer as well because I think even if we hedge it for next year and the volumes don't quite achieve what we would have thought, we actually had one additional business that gives us some comfort around that. But I would say all the programs are on track. We are fortunate that despite the changing environment, I would say we are absolutely head down in trying to take out multiple new products right now that need to ramp up in very significant volume next year. And I'm personally involved in these with our customers to ensure we're meeting their schedule, and we're doing everything possible to get there.
So, that's the good news that the programs are still on track. And I think that's a good thing. The percentage -- I think your other question was, what was the percentage of data center revenue that's in storage?
Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Well, other way around, if storage falling is the headwind for data center, just to level set people, you had 30% roughly of your business in storage or in data center?
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Ross, maybe I can help you. Yeah, I can help you with that. In general, the way to think about this, our storage business, it's probably about one-third of the data center -- total data center business; average, right, not a particular quarter.
But of course, when we go through the inventory correction, as Matt mentioned earlier, that's going to be the largest drop piece for the inventory correction.
Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Thank you.

Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Matt, you talked about the impact on a more muted cloud capex spend on your overall data center business. Most pronounced in storage, but you do have compute, you've got networking, you've got optical products as well.
And looking specifically at your cloud optical connectivity segment, which obviously is PAM4 DSP, your color solution. If I look back at the last cloud spending slowdown, which was in 2019, both of these segments combined grew about 35%, 40%, right? Granted, this was still in the early innings of the 200, 400 gig upgrade cycle. But part of it is also very strategic in nature because your customers are still trying to enable better performance through higher networking speeds. So, I guess kind of two questions.
Near term, is the team dealing with inventory issues in these particular optical products? And then looking into next year and the team see continued growth in cloud optical?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Great. Thanks, Harlan, for the question. And you're right, it is a little bit of a different situation than a few years ago where that was fairly nascent technology, really ramping up hard in an inflection curve.
That being said, we still see strong adoption of 800 gig. We've seen strong momentum in 400ZR in the new platform. And we expect that, you know, overall optics is going to grow, you know, next year. That being said, I would say, you know, in the fourth quarter, part of the adjustment would be in that area.
But I think that's a shorter-term thing. And again, because to your point, it's so strategic, we anticipate that optics is going to continue to grow. And by the way, we're heads down on new product development there as well because, for the next generation of high-end 51.2T switches, you're going to need the associated optics with that, which then moves from 800 gigabits per second to 1.6 terabits per second. And so, that's an ongoing new product development activity we have.
So, lots of activity in that area. Super exciting, but it's a little bit of a different environment than 2019 just because there has been more broad adoption, but we do feel good about it.
Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst

Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Yeah. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. I guess, Matt, I was hoping to spend a little bit of time on the enterprise networking side of the house, roughly $1.4 billion business for the fiscal year. And you talked about a China slowdown.
Is there a way to kind of parse between China and non-China and how you're thinking about the trajectory into January and all of calendar '23?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. That's a good question. The -- as we indicated, China is down a lot, right, in Q4 from where it was just two quarters ago. That may end up being a little bit a little bit of an overcorrection.
It's hard to tell, quite frankly, on what's going on there and how long that's going to last and how that ripples through. The non-China has been holding up very well. Again, I'd say based on the content gains we have, as well as the -- just the new products that are ramping up with higher ASPs. And so, that's sort of offsetting it to some extent.
What we are guiding for Q4, enterprise networking overall, it's still down just because of the China factor. But I'd say if I had to handicap it for next year, non-China will be a bigger percentage of the total in fiscal '24 than China. But I don't have the exact numbers at the tip of my fingers here. A lot of this goes through the channel and other -- it's -- yeah, I just don't have those numbers in front of me.

Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Christopher Rolland -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to follow up on carrier infrastructure as well. So, a couple of things.
I guess, first of all, your agreement with Nokia and the extension there. I was wondering if there's any economics associated with that. And then secondly, looking out into next year, there's a lot more talk about India, 5G, Nokia winning, Samsung winning there as well. What does the opportunity look like there for growth? Is this going to be sizable overall? Thanks.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Chris. On the Nokia front, again, it was great to see us being able to announce with them our Layer-2 transport processor. Recall the initial engagement with them, which was very successful, and it's great to see how well they did was on the Layer-1 baseband processor.
And that -- I think that partnership has led to now a broader engagement. And so, as you probably know, you followed the space, the Layer-2 transport or CPU is a critical component, right, with fairly meaningful content as you sort of roll forward. So, I think that's all very positive. And on India, that -- they seem to be gearing up for a very aggressive rollout next year.
And I think, to your point, a few of our key customers are well-positioned to take advantage of that ramp. And so, that's why we said earlier, we feel really good about wireless next year, I think both on sort of our content gains, as well as our -- but probably, even more, the regional deployments. And I think India probably will be sizable would be my guess.

Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you. And if you don't mind, I'm going to ask a question that's not related to the next two quarters. And it does have two parts.
So, first of all, the UCI-Express standard is that something that could potentially accelerate the adoption of CXL. The reason I'm asking is because, last time on the call, you talked about maybe CXL not contributing to revenues probably for the few years, but there does seem to be a lot of activity here that could potentially pull that timeline in a little bit.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think the CXL timing, a lot of that is going to be gated tory by the server CPU cycle. And I think companies are gearing up for that. It may have gotten lost in the noise, but we did call out and I called out in my prepared remarks that we had received a pretty significant design win in this area, which we're now well underway in terms of product development.
And then I'd say there's a very large pipeline of semi-custom products behind that, as well as a merchant product. So, I think that activity is still -- level of activity is very high with our customers. But I wouldn't -- I don't have visibility to any sort of change in terms of when those products would ramp necessarily. But it's a very strategic new area for us.
And I'd say we continue to be focused on building a leadership position there. A lot of these products, especially as you get into the larger pooling devices, accelerators, these are, in some cases, have multicore CPU. They're in five-nanometer. They have security features.
There's quite a few things that we're adding. And so, these are looking more and more like very customized SoCs, which then enable these customers to really take advantage of completely new architectures relative to how they interface their CPU, GPU, XPU, whatever you want to call it, ASIC with memory. And so, I think that's going to continue to be a very strategic area of focus. And getting a large win committed and underway is a really good thing.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Great. And the second part of the question was related to your new product, and you did mention this earlier. So, AEC, when should we expect Marvell to get some revenue contribution from AEC? Is that also sort of a few years out? Or could you already start to see some revenues next year?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
I think we need to let that one play out a little bit, Tore. We're taking that one step at a time. I think the milestone really was lining over the last year, really getting our solution designed in across a broad array of high-volume proven cable suppliers to the largest hyperscale companies, and we've done a great job there. And we've now started sampling those, and we have a very high level of interest.
But at this juncture, we haven't really sized exactly our opportunity and the timing. But we'll do that in due course as we get better visibility to the take up of our customers that are competing in this market. But that trend is very real. The AEC trend is anyway.
And we hope to be an important part of it.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst

Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Thank you. I just wanted to come back to the clarification for Jean. Looking at the data center business and the storage component in the last quarter that you reported that segment before changing the reporting, I see $300 million without Inphi and then you had given a number of $340 million with Inphi. And the number you just cited, a third of the recent quarter, it seems really low.
That would mean $190 million, $200 million number rounding up. Is there something I'm missing there or a large chunk of that is now in some other business?
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. Let me just recap and clarify.
I think before we change the reporting, our storage business annualized run rate is about $1.4 billion. So, that's what you are mentioning before we change the reporting by end market. That's what our overall storage business. Just as a reminder, it includes flash controller preamp and also fiber channel.
So, it's all the different storage product lines included there. And over time, the storage has come down. The number I mentioned, one-third, is not a particular last quarter. You know, generally, when you look at several quarters, on average, it's one-third.
The first half definitely is much higher and now it's much lower, right? When you think about $1.4 billion storage revenue I'm talking about, about 60% is in data center. That's what we told investors during our Investor Day. So, hope that's how you clarify different pieces.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Yeah. No, it does. So, that means it's come down from $1.4 billion annual run rate to $800 million, right?
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
I don't think the way you can think about that. It's $1.4 billion. The first half of this year, it probably was much higher than $1.4 billion annualized run rate. And now it's dropping much lower, right? The second half of the run rate probably is very low.
Yeah.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Got it. OK. OK. That is very helpful.
Then I had a follow-up for you, Matt. Looking at storage, and I don't follow the disk drive guys, but Seagate consensus has been down three quarters in a row WD, two quarters for the mass storage business. And then you throw in the bullwhip effect. So, you're seeing a much bigger impact than consensus has those guys modeled.
Is that the right way in terms of timing a couple of quarters before this business comes back? And then the other businesses within data center that -- thanks for the clarification earlier, and that it's not just storage. When do those businesses -- because that magnitude is less, right, in terms of no real bullwhip effect yet. So, if you combine all that, should we be modeling past December, a couple of quarters of sequential declines?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, let me break that into two pieces. I think you absolutely nailed it when you talked about the end customer kind of dynamics and their trajectory versus ours, that is exactly the bullwhip effect. I mean, you could actually just draw the bullwhip, and you can kind of slap where we would be on that.
And that's why -- and we've seen this historically in any business where you're kind of one additional step removed, you tend to have more volatility, right? It's just the way it works. So, that, I think, you can expect. And again, we don't know exactly, but we anticipate just on past experience, it's probably a couple of quarters to work through that. And then on the other piece, which was the nonstorage piece, yes, it's inventory digestion.
I mean, we've kind of taken a view, Ambrish, which is -- and I've been through different scenarios in my career here on how you manage when volume -- when demand drops, and you can kind of work with people and manage a soft landing or you can keep shipping and then you pay the price later in a very hard way. And so, our view has been, let's get through this and get it behind us. And also get to a point where, as you can -- as you get your visibility up and inventory goes down and lead times turn to normal, your forecast accuracy improves. I mean, I think, you know, that old adage is, well, you know, the worst forecast you're going to get is if somebody gives you 52 weeks of orders, you're actually better off having a more normalized environment.
So, that's really what we're striving to do there. And so, while there is some inventory adjustment, it's fairly normal given the shift in slope in the capex trajectory. And we have new products ramping. And so, that probably works its way through fairly quickly as well.
But we'll have to see the exact timeframe. Like I said, it's still a little bit of a dynamic environment.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Yeah. Thank you for being super transparent about it.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
No problem. Ashish, do we have time for one more? Should I just wrap it up with some closing comments?
Ashish Saran -- Vice President, Investor Relations
Yeah. Go ahead. Wrap it up, Matt. Thanks.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Perfect. Yeah. Well, thanks, everybody, for all the questions. Just a little bit of a few comments as we close here.
Look, first, I think Q3 was a great quarter for us. I mean, we're in the middle of a pretty severe macroeconomic environment. A lot of other companies have obviously seen some of this inventory digestion and impact earlier. But in Q3, we delivered record revenue, very strong operating margins.
Even if you look at the fourth quarter guide and you kind of compare our second half of this year to a year ago, we're up about 15%. And when you look at sort of the rest of the market, take sort of large digital peers, that peer group is down about 5%. So, we still think even with a softer Q4 guide, we continue to perform very well from a top-line perspective. I'd say also we've been disciplined on managing expenses.
The pro forma FY '23 will grow about 28%. And if you look at our opex increase, it's about 14%. So, we've been basically growing operating expenses at about half the rate of revenue growth. And we've been able to put together a world-class team, as a result, to execute on these massive design wins we've gotten over the last few years.
And so, while we're going to be disciplined in our spending, and Jean sort of gave you the model on opex. We feel very good about the size of the team, the resources we have, and the ability to execute, which our customers are counting on. And I believe if we do that, there's even more to come. So, in conclusion, we continue to have the right strategy with really strong partnerships with key customers.
We think we're in the right markets. And the growth drivers of cloud, 5G wireless communications, and automotive continue to be three of the largest growth opportunities in the semiconductor industry, and Marvell is extremely well positioned there. So, thanks for all the questions. I'm sure we can be more helpful in the callbacks as well.
There's a lot of moving pieces. But thank you so much for your time today.

2022-12-01 00:00:00+00:00,Marvell Technology (MRVL) Lags Q3 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/marvell-technology-mrvl-lags-q3-earnings-and-revenue-estimates,,,"Marvell Technology (MRVL) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.57 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.59 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.43 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -3.39%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $0.56 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.57, delivering a surprise of 1.79%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.
Marvell, which belongs to the Zacks Technology Services industry, posted revenues of $1.54 billion for the quarter ended October 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.33%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.21 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Marvell shares have lost about 46.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -14.4%.
What's Next for Marvell?
While Marvell has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Marvell: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.62 on $1.61 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.29 on $6.13 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Technology Services is currently in the bottom 43% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
KWESST Micro Systems Inc. (KWEMF), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022.
This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.40 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +60%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
KWESST Micro Systems Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $0.37 million, up 184.6% from the year-ago quarter.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.
