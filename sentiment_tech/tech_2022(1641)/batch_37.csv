TAIPEI, April 21 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Unimicron Technology Corp 3037.TW said on Thursday that one of its two plants in eastern China's Kunshan would remain closed to comply with COVID-19 curbs but the other would resume production.
Unimicron, a chip substrate and printed circuit board maker that supplies Apple Inc AAPL.O and Intel Corp INTC.O, said in a statement one plant had resumed some production under a ""closed loop management"" system that keeps workers isolated inside.
A company representative said it was difficult to estimate current production capacity but it was ""not high"".
Unimicron plans to keep one plant closed and the other running under the closed-loop system until next Wednesday.
Most of Unimicron's manufacturing capacity is located in Taiwan but it also has plants in other parts of China as well as in Germany and Japan.
China has put Shanghai under a tight lockdown since late March and neighbouring Kunshan has also tightened curbs to control the country's biggest COVID-19 outbreak since the coronavirus was discovered in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan.
That had caused dozens of Taiwanese firms, many making parts for the semiconductor and electronics industries, to suspend operations.
Unimicron's shares closed flat on Thursday, recovering earlier losses, while the broader index ended down 0.1% .TWII.

ASML, which sells equipment to TSMC 2330.TW, Samsung 005930.KS, Intel INTC.O and others, earlier reported better than expected first quarter earnings.
""Currently we see no signs of any weakening in our customer base. Zero,"" Peter Wennink said on a call with analysts. ""And even if demand weakens, there is a big gap between the demand and our capacity.""
Wennink dismissed questions about possible slack in the industry, saying that in addition to a waiting period of more than a year for the company's cutting edge products, ""almost every customer we have ever sold a machine to"" is currently trying to acquire older chip manufacturing equipment.
ASML makes lithography systems, used to create the circuitry of computer chips.
Wennink told an anecdote about an unnamed major industrial company that he said was buying old washing machines in order to salvage the chips in them, adding that the story was not unique.
He also noted that utilisation rates of ASML's machines were at all-time highs, suggesting that customers are buying more not to stockpile but because they cannot keep up with demand.
""You tell me whether we're too optimistic,"" he said in answer to one question. ""We're just looking at the data points, they just point to a market that is significantly short of semiconductor manufacturing capacity. This year and next year.""

2022-04-20 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Intel vs. Micron Technology,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-intel-vs.-micron-technology,,,"The PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index has shed more than 23% of its value in 2022, which is a tad surprising as the booming demand for chips has led to sharp growth in the semiconductor industry's revenue.
In 2021, the global semiconductor industry recorded $556 billion in revenue, an increase of 26% over the prior year. The strong sales trend has continued in 2022, with monthly sales exceeding $50 billion in both January and February. But the broader sell-off in tech stocks has kept semiconductor stocks from exploding on the market. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) stock is down 11% this year, while Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) has suffered a bigger drop of 25%.

Intel, whose processors are used in computers and data centers, has shown some resilience on the market this year thanks to its cheap valuation and a potential turnaround in its fortunes. Micron, however, has fallen out of favor on the market despite an attractive valuation and its terrific growth thanks to the booming demand for memory chips.
But the common thread between both companies is that they are operating in markets that are built for long-term growth. So, which one of these two semiconductor stocks should you be buying following their pullbacks? Let's find out.
The case for Intel
Intel is the dominant player in the server and client CPU (central processing unit) markets. According to Mercury Research, it controlled nearly 84% of the desktop CPU market, 78% of the notebook CPU market, and 89% of the server CPU market at the end of 2021. Advanced Micro Devices has been a resurgent force in these markets, but Intel has finally started turning the tide in its favor with its product development moves.
Intel's Alder Lake CPUs have been giving AMD a run for its money. More importantly, Intel has an aggressive product roadmap that includes the launch of new, more powerful processors later this year such as Raptor Lake CPUs, followed by a more advanced lineup in the form of Meteor Lake in 2023. Chipzilla is also intent on maintaining its grip over the server CPU market with the launch of the Sapphire Rapids processors this year that will be based on a 7-nanometer process. This would put the company in a solid position to compete against AMD's next-generation Epyc processors, which will be based on a 5-nm process.
It is worth noting that Intel's 7-nm process is reportedly denser than AMD's 5-nm process, which means chips made using Chipzilla's process are packed with more transistors. As a result, Intel's chips should ideally be more powerful and consume less power compared to AMD's offerings. Alder Lake has already shown that Intel can make powerful processors and price them aggressively, indicating the company is on its way to turning its fortunes around.
Intel believes the launch of new chips based on competitive manufacturing processes should help it recapture its manufacturing lead from rivals by 2025. This explains why Intel expects its revenue growth to pick up the pace in long run. The chip giant anticipates mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth in 2023 and 2024. By 2026, it expects to clock year-over-year revenue growth of 10% to 12%. It also forecasts an adjusted gross margin of 54% to 58% by 2026.
For comparison, the chip giant anticipates $76 billion in revenue this year along with 52% in adjusted gross margin. The top line would be a slight improvement over last year's figure of $74.7 billion, while the gross margin would be lower than the 57.5% Intel reported in 2021. All this indicates Intel could turn out to be a turnaround play in the long run if it continues to execute well on its product roadmap.
The case for Micron Technology
Unlike Intel, Micron Technology has been clocking outstanding revenue and earnings growth on account of the robust demand for memory chips that are used in computers, smartphones, data centers, and even vehicles nowadays.
MU Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
The company has been in fine form in fiscal 2022. Its revenue for the first six months of the fiscal year (which ended on March 3) increased 29% over the prior-year period to $15.5 billion. Adjusted earnings have shot up to $4.30 per share during this period from $1.76 per share in the same period last year.
Analysts expect Micron to finish fiscal 2022 with $33.7 billion in revenue, an increase of 21.7% over last year, followed by a 20% revenue increase in fiscal 2023. The company's bottom line is also expected to head higher after last fiscal year's adjusted earnings of $6.06 per share.
MU EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts
More importantly, Micron is expected to sustain its impressive earnings growth in the long run. Analysts are forecasting 30% annual earnings growth for the next five years, indicating that it has the potential to turn into a growth stock after a terrible performance so far in 2022. It is not surprising analysts are so upbeat about Micron's growth.
The memory chip industry has hit a purple patch, with 2021 revenue reportedly growing 32% to nearly $153.8 billion. The industry is expected to clock $155.5 billion in revenue this year. By 2027, the global memory semiconductor market is anticipated to hit $180 billion in revenue, though it won't be surprising to see it become bigger than that thanks to emerging tech trends such as the metaverse that would require faster computing.
What's more, Micron is looking to take away market share from its rivals in the industry on the back of its product development moves, which should allow the company to corner a bigger share of the huge end-market opportunity it is sitting on. Micron is in a solid position to sustain its eye-popping growth for a long time to come.
Which semiconductor specialist is the better buy?
While Intel is gunning for a turnaround, Micron is already delivering the goods for investors as far as financial growth is concerned. What's more, Micron stock's trailing earnings multiple of 8.8 is slightly lower than Intel's 9.4. Micron's forward earnings multiple of 7.5 shows that its earnings are anticipated to increase, while Intel's multiple of 13.2 indicates otherwise.
So, investors looking to buy a value stock right now may be better off choosing Micron Technology as it is not just growing at a fast pace, but is also trading at an attractive valuation.

But just because a stock's price has fallen doesn't mean it has become inexpensive.
To determine that, you need to look closer at the company's sales and earnings prospects while considering the valuation. One popular metric is the company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). Then you can make an apples-to-apples comparison when looking at different companies.
These three companies have become richly valued -- even after two of them have fallen in price this year. That means exercising caution before buying shares.

Sysco (NYSE: SYY) distributes food, mostly to restaurants, a segment that accounted for two-thirds of fiscal 2021's revenue. That period ended on July 3, 2021.
With restaurants and other food-service places open to the public again and continued market share gains, revenue in the fiscal second-quarter (ended Jan. 1) grew by better than 41% to $16.3 billion. The company was able to pass along most of the higher costs to customers, and its gross margin shrunk by less than one-half a percentage point to 17.7%.
While the company continues to execute well, the stock price appears to have gotten ahead of itself. This year, the shares have risen by 10%.
What's more, it has a trailing P/E of 57 compared to a range of 25 to 30 from 2017 to 2019, before the pandemic wreaked havoc on people's health and the economy. By way of contrast, competitor U.S. Foods (NYSE: USFD) trades at a P/E of 24.
2. Kroger
Kroger (NYSE: KR) has been in the grocery business for nearly 140 years. This has proved to be a good, stable business that does well no matter what's going on with the economy. People still need to buy food, along with its other offerings like prescription drugs and gasoline.
Pushing fresh food and digital options (like ordering online and in-store pickup), Kroger continues to draw shoppers. You can see this by looking at the results. For its fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 29, same-store sales (excluding gasoline) rose by 4%. This came about despite a difficult comparison to the prior year when the pandemic increased people's supermarket spending. On a two-year basis, such sales were 14.6% higher.
The market certainly liked the news and the direction in which Kroger is headed. The stock price has gained 29% since the start of the year, including nearly 6% since the company reported quarterly results in early March.
That has made the stock more expensive, however. Kroger's trailing P/E stands at 27 vs. about 21 before it reported quarterly earnings. Other large supermarkets trade at significantly lower earnings multiples. For instance, Albertsons (NYSE: ACI) has a trailing P/E of 11.
3. Nvidia
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the leading producer of graphics processing units (GPUs). Then there's its role in artificial intelligence (AI), which should grow quickly as AI expands.
Fiscal fourth-quarter revenue grew by 53% to $7.6 billion in the period ended Jan. 30. For the first quarter, management anticipates revenue to increase by 43% to $8.1 billion.
But you'll have to pay up for this type of growth. The current P/E is 55. Although that's down from more than 72 earlier this month, it remains high. Other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have P/Es of 36 and 9, respectively. Notably, all three semiconductor stocks have been hit by analyst downgrades and target price reductions.
Sysco, Kroger, and Nvidia have become leaders in their sectors, which explains their higher valuations. But since they've become increasingly expensive, you might wish to wait until the stocks become less expensive. With high growth expectations, you could see prices falter should they disappoint.

2022-04-19 00:00:00+00:00,Taiwan's Unimicron says Kunshan plant gradually resuming production,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/taiwans-unimicron-says-kunshan-plant-gradually-resuming-production,,,"Adds stock price movement
TAIPEI, April 20 (Reuters) - Taiwanese chip substrate and printed circuit board maker Unimicron Technology Corp 3037.TW said on Wednesday its plant in the eastern Chinese city of Kunshan is gradually resuming operations after halting them to comply with COVID-19 rules.
China has put Shanghai under a tight lockdown since late March and neighbouring Kunshan has also tightened curbs to control the country's biggest COVID-19 outbreak since the coronavirus was discovered in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan.
That had caused dozens of Taiwanese firms, many making components for the chip and electronics industries, to suspend operations.
Global companies, from mobile phone to chip makers, are highly dependent on China and Southeast Asia for production and have been diversifying their supply chains after the pandemic caused havoc.
Unimicron, which supplies Apple Inc AAPL.O and Intel INTC.O, said in a statement to the Taipei stock exchange that the factory had suspended production from April 2 to 19.
It added it was ""gradually resuming work depending on local personnel and logistics conditions"".
Unimicron's shares rose more than 3% in morning trade, outperforming the broader index .TWII which was up around 0.7%.
However, Asia Electronic Material Co Ltd 4939.TWO, which makes parts for laptops, mobile phones and digital cameras, said its plant in Kunshan would continue to be closed, having originally reported the suspension would last until Tuesday.
It added it had applied for government permission to be allowed to resume work and had been given permission to deliver goods and would do so from current stocks.
""It is estimated that some orders will be postponed until May,"" the company added in its stock exchange statement.

2022-04-19 00:00:00+00:00,"In shift to new era, Wave Computing adopts RISC-V chip architecture",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/in-shift-to-new-era-wave-computing-adopts-risc-v-chip-architecture,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
April 19 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley's Wave Computing said on Tuesday it is launching designs for two new microprocessors this year using RISC-V architecture as it sunsets its once-popular MIPS architecture.
The move adds to growing momentum for RISC-V, an open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) and emerging rival to proprietary architecture from Britain's Arm, the semiconductor technology firm owned by SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T.
RISC-V's nascent but growing popularity owes much to its free and open-standard nature. It is also in focus due to its potential to help China build up its own semiconductor industry as Chinese companies developing technology based on the architecture could be shielded from U.S. export controls.
Wave's MIPS architecture, developed in the lab of Stanford University professor John Hennessy, the current chairman of Alphabet Inc, is now over 35 years old.
It has fallen behind Arm's architecture, which rules in the mobile chip world, and x86 - initially developed by Intel Corp INTC.O - which dominated laptop and data center chips. After being owned by a string of companies, MIPS was bought by Wave which ended up in bankruptcy in 2020 and emerged from it early last year.
""In order for the company to continue to exist, it needed to find another way to be able to fight this ecosystem battle that it lost,"" Desi Banatao, who took over as CEO of Wave after its bankruptcy, told Reuters in an interview.
He added that the company has already inked a contract to supply one of the new processor designs to an automotive tech firm.
Sanjai Kohli, Wave's former CEO, said the MIPS and RISC-V instruction sets are close enough that the company was able to easily modify many of the MIPS processors it owns.
Intel has backed RISC-V, investing in the ecosystem as part of the launch of a $1 billion fund to support companies with disruptive technologies as it builds up its foundry business.
RISC-V also gained more attention after Nvidia Corp's NVDA.O bid to buy Arm heightened concern about the potential for the chipmaker to control Arm's architecture. The bid has since failed after being rejected by regulators.

The semiconductor industry is among the most discussed sectors over the past few years. For various reasons, there has been a shortage of semiconductor chips and its impact should not be understated. Thus, investors in the stock market are always showing great interest in semiconductor stocks. Last week, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) announced its first-quarter earnings. The company’s quarterly revenue grew by 36% to $17.57 billion on the back of strong demand from car and smartphone manufacturers.
Moving forward, Taiwan Semiconductor expects its capacity to remain tight until the end of the year. It appears that the global crunch has kept its order books full and this has also led the chipmaker to charge premium prices. Meanwhile, Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) recently announced that it has more than doubled its year-over-year growth in cloud data center Ethernet switch port shipments. The company has shipped more than 3 million 400G switch ports and this is a testament to its strong growth in cloud networking. In conclusion, the demand for semiconductor chips is still strong. With that said, here are some of the top semiconductor stocks to check out in thestock market today

Here are some highlights from the video.
Gartner reported that the semiconductor industry grew revenue by 26% in 2021. Gartner also showed some significant changes to the top 10 semiconductor vendors by revenue compared to last year. The first significant change is the shift in the No. 1 position. Samsung Electronics has moved to the top, pushing Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) to No. 2. The second significant change is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) entering the top 10.
Intel is the only company in the top 10 that did not grow year over year. Intel saw a decline of 0.3% in revenue while others grew by double digits. Some positive news for Intel appeared on April 15 as reports emerged that Intel's 18A node is ahead of schedule by roughly six months.
Numerous articles have reported that graphics card prices are decreasing. While these prices have dropped from their peak levels, they are still above MSRP. Some investors might be fearful that this will create a slowdown for companies like AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). It might be too early to fear, as graphics cards are still selling for more than their suggested prices.

2022-04-18 00:00:00+00:00,What Lies Ahead for Semiconductor ETFs in Q1 Earnings?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-lies-ahead-for-semiconductor-etfs-in-q1-earnings,,,"The semiconductor space has been seeing huge investor interest this year amid the weakness in stock prices. Investors are betting that the industry will rebound from the supply-chain hitches and chip shortages that have dragged the stocks lower.

As such, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH and First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL have plunged nearly 23% each this year. The weak trend might reverse in the weeks ahead, in the earnings season.

Even though semiconductor stocks have been beaten down this year, the industry fundamentals have remained strong as supply chains are being reorganized and demand for chips remains solid. Global chip sales hit a record of $555.9 billion, up 26.2% year over year, in 2021 and are expected to grow 8.8% in 2022, per the Semiconductor Industry Association (read: Semiconductor ETFs Enjoying Huge Investors Love).

Some well-known players in the space like Texas Instruments TXN, Intel INTC, Qualcomm QCOM, NVIDIA NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD will report earnings in the coming days. Let’s delve into the financial picture of the companies that have a higher allocation in the above-mentioned ETFs and the power to move the funds up or down as Q1 earnings unfold. SOXX is largely concentrated on five firms with a combined share of 31.2%, followed by 29.8% for SMH and 25.6% for FTXL.

2022-04-14 00:00:00+00:00,Keep an Eye Out for Ampere Computing After It Files for IPO,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/keep-an-eye-out-for-ampere-computing-after-it-files-for-ipo,,,"Startup chip designer Ampere Computing recently filed for an initial public offering (IPO). The company was founded in 2017 but is experiencing rapid growth as data center operators adopt its cloud-native processors. Founded and led by Silicon Valley native Renée James, this is an exciting computing technologist to follow closely ahead of its public debut.
Image source: Getty Images.
Ampere Computing could be a really big deal
Ampere Computing was founded in late 2017 by Renée James, who also serves as the company's CEO. James was an early believer that the data center would be a primary computing unit as cloud services were dawning 20 years ago. Ampere was started to address this specific market.
The company designs chips based on an architecture licensed from ARM Holdings (the company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was attempting to acquire last year) -- specifically, processors that are ""cloud-native.""
Ampere announced its 128-core data center processor (more cores means a CPU can handle more tasks, which makes it more efficient) back in 2020. That's a notable achievement.
Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) EPYC Zen4 ""Bergamo"" will have up to 128 cores and will be available later in 2022. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has yet to reveal when its 128-core data center CPUs will come out. NVIDIA just announced its Grace CPU with up to 144 cores, but it pulls it off by pairing two Grace CPUs to create a ""superchip.""
Sounds cool, but why is this important? Data centers are the foundation for all things cloud computing -- be it a basic app used on your smartphone or a work service you access via an internet connection. AI software is being put to work at the data center level too, and before long, most apps will likely have at least some basic AI functionality built-in.
That's where Ampere's processors come in. While it encompasses more than just processors, Intel's Data Center Group hauled in $25.8 billion in sales in 2021. Likewise, AMD's Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment brought in nearly $7.1 billion in revenue last year.
Suffice to say, Ampere could be a big deal, given the large and fast-growing market it plays in. Early customers include Oracle, Microsoft Azure, and China's Tencent Cloud.
Deep roots in cloud computing
Thus far, we know little about Ampere's financials until the company files its prospectus with the SEC. Stay tuned for details on that.
But here's what we do know: In its short history, Ampere has raised some $426 million in investment funding, most of it from Oracle. ARM Holdings also invested during a venture capital raise led by private equity firm The Carlyle Group a few years ago.
Founder and CEO James has an impressive resume. She is on the board of directors at Oracle and Citigroup and is an operating executive at Carlyle Group. Prior to that, James was at Intel for 28 years, last serving as President of the chip giant.
In an interview on Fortt Knox last year, James talked about her time as COO of Intel's Online Services segment in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This was Intel's early data center services business when cloud computing was still more of a concept than a fully fleshed-out business model. The idea was ""prescient, but a decade too soon."" Intel ended up closing the unit in the aftermath of the dot-com era.
Fast forward to today, the cloud is in its prime days of growth and expansion. Cloud services and AI are proliferating. Even smaller businesses are bringing high-end servers into their private data centers to run complex computing tasks. There are looming challenges, though.
According to James in the same interview mentioned above, semiconductors are ""the most challenging ... cheap thing in the world."" They are incredibly complex to design and produce, and customers want lots of them at a low price, but the costs to make them are going up.
Plus, as computing power increases, energy consumption also rises, so the semiconductor industry will need to grapple with engineering circuitry with lower power requirements in the years ahead as data centers grow in use and complexity.
This likely explains the IPO filing. Though it's reportedly growing fast, Ampere is probably still a very small company at this stage. It's going to need cash to keep designing powerful but efficient chips for the cloud. And it appears to have sprung ahead of its competition, but semiconductor design demands never-ending innovation to stay ahead of the pack.
I have my eye out for Ampere Computing's prospectus (usually filed as an S-1 with the SEC) ahead of its IPO. There's still a lot to learn, but Renée James' upstart computing company has my attention.

Today's video focuses on another recent downgrade to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), global PC shipment numbers for the first quarter of 2022, Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) recent expansion of its research and development (R&D) facilities, and a new consumer processor by Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). Here are some highlights from the video.
On April 12, Keybanc lowered its price target on Nvidia to $310, down from $350. Some of the critical points of the price reduction are concerns about the supply chain due to lockdowns in China and geopolitical concerns about the European economy due to the Russia/Ukraine war.
On April 11, Intel celebrated the grand opening of the latest expansion of its D1X factory. The expansion is needed as Intel has announced a strong roadmap through 2025 that requires providing its engineers with the best equipment to develop and innovate. The D1X is one of its leading-edge factories in Oregon, serving numerous purposes and is highly important for its R&D department.
AMD will release its newest consumer processor, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, on April 20. It will be interesting to see how this processor is adopted in the market as fears of a decrease in consumer spending continue to be an essential topic of discussion. The processor is also the first AMD consumer desktop CPU to include AMD's 3D V-Cache technology.

2022-04-13 00:00:00+00:00,Intel's Smart Move Could Give Rivals a Run for Their Money,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-smart-move-could-give-rivals-a-run-for-their-money,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has finally entered the market for discrete graphics processing units (GPU) that has so far been the playground of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). And the good part is that Chipzilla (as Intel is known) has made a smart move to tap this lucrative space that could help take share away from its rivals.
Intel officially launched the first batch of its Intel Arc A-series mobile graphics cards for laptops and notebooks on March 30 -- the Arc A370M and the Arc A350M. These Arc 3 graphics cards are the entry-level models in the company's stable that are meant to enhance the gaming experience for those on a budget. So Intel appears to be going after the low-hanging fruit first in the discrete graphics card market, and it seems like the right strategy. Let's see why.
Graphics cards. Image source: Getty Images
Laptops and notebooks could give Intel's GPU business a good start
Intel points out that the Arc 3 graphics cards can run popular AAA games such as Doom Eternal, Hitman 3, The Witcher, and Destiny 2 among others, at more than 60 frames per second at 1080p resolution -- a big jump compared to laptops with Intel's own integrated graphics cards. What's more, the chipmaker says that its new cards can run competitive esports games such as Fortnite, Rocket League, and Valorant at more than 90 frames per second at 1080p resolution, which is again a huge increase over laptops equipped with integrated cards.
It is worth noting that Intel didn't benchmark its cards against AMD's and Nvidia's laptop-centric GPUs. Instead, the company focused on the gains that the Arc 3 GPUs can score over Intel's Iris integrated graphics cards. This looks like a smart thing to do for a few reasons.
For instance, the gaming laptop market has gained impressive momentum in recent years. Nearly a quarter of the laptops sold last year were in the gaming category, up from around 10% in 2017. So laptops are witnessing an increase in discrete GPU adoption, and there is a lot of room for growth on this front. According to a third-party estimate, the gaming laptop market is expected to generate nearly $18 billion in revenue by 2026 as compared to $11 billion in 2020.
Intel, therefore, is looking to make the most of the growing demand for gaming laptops. That's possibly why it is focusing on the gains that its Arc 3 GPUs are likely to bring over the usual laptops with integrated cards: so that it can bring the first-time buyer of a gaming laptop into its fold.
Moreover, with Arc 3-equipped laptops starting at a price of $899, they could attract consumers looking to buy a gaming laptop without breaking the bank. All this could help make Intel a viable third player in the gaming laptop market, especially considering that its Arc GPUs are expected to power at least 50 designs of laptops and desktops from several original equipment manufacturers such as Acer, ASUS, Clevo, Dell, Gigabyte, Haier, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, MSI, and NEC.
Going all-in on the GPU opportunity
The Intel Arc 3 graphics cards will be followed by the Arc 5 and Arc 7 series cards in early summer. The upcoming cards will pack more cores, have better ray-tracing capability, and will be equipped with more memory to support advanced and high-performance gaming. Additionally, Intel plans to release desktop GPUs this summer as well.
It remains to be seen how Intel's cards will fare against the likes of Nvidia and AMD in independent testing. But the chipmaker's top line could get a nice boost in the coming years if it is able to carve even a small portion of the discrete GPU market. Jon Peddie Research estimates that discrete GPU sales could hit $54 billion in 2025.
A 10% share of this market could result in more than $5 billion in annual revenue for Intel and help accelerate the company's turnaround. Chipzilla has started taking share away from AMD in the CPU (central processing unit) market already, and success in GPUs could further accelerate its growth. That's why investors looking to buy a semiconductor stock on the cheap can consider Intel as it makes the right moves to regain its mojo and is trading at just 9.7 times earnings.

TAIPEI, April 13 (Reuters) - Around 30 Taiwanese companies, many making parts for electronics, said on Wednesday that government COVID-19 control measures in eastern China had led them to suspend production until next week, as disruption from the measures spreads.
China has put Shanghai under a tight lockdown since late March and neighbouring Kunshan has also tightened curbs to control the country's biggest COVID-19 outbreak since the coronavirus was discovered in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan.
Global companies, from mobile phone to chip makers, are highly dependent on China and Southeast Asia for production and have been diversifying their supply chains after the pandemic caused havoc.
The Taiwanese companies making announcements to the stock exchange included Asia Electronic Material Co Ltd 4939.TWO, which makes parts for laptops, mobile phones and digital cameras.
It said its plant in Kunshan would be closed until next Tuesday, adding it was ""hard to estimate"" the financial impact.
EFUN Technology Co Ltd 3523.TWO, which makes parts for liquid crystal displays, said its plant in nearby Suzhou would also be closed until Tuesday, and would resume operations when the government gave the go-ahead, though added it did not foresee a financial impact for the time being.
Chip substrate and printed circuit board maker Unimicron Technology Corp 3037.TW, which also supplies Apple Inc AAPL.O and Intel INTC.O, said late on Tuesday its Kunshan operations closure would also extend to next Tuesday.
It said it was ""integrating"" its resources and manufacturing to lessen the impact on customers, adding its two Kunshan subsidiaries accounted for around 13% of consolidated revenue in the first quarter of this year.
Taiwan's Pegatron Corp 4938.TW, which assembles iPhones for Apple, said earlier on Tuesday it had suspended operations at its Shanghai and Kunshan plants due to the government's strict COVID-19 protocols.

2022-04-12 00:00:00+00:00,Can Q1 Earnings Bring Strength in Dow ETF?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-q1-earnings-bring-strength-in-dow-etf,,,"After logging in the worst quarterly performance in two years, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued its weak trading on bets over a more aggressive Fed rate hike. The combination of factors such as concerns over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, surging oil prices, widespread inflationary pressures, and lingering worries about the ongoing pandemic added to the chaos.

The blue-chip index has declined 5.6% so far this year and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust DIA, which tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, is down 4%.

While rising yields are taking a toll on the growth sector, especially technology, an improving economy is fueling growth in the cyclical sectors. Notably, the Dow Jones has significant exposure to the cyclical sectors. Additionally, optimism over the earnings season, which will kick start this week, will rekindle investors’ confidence in the Dow Jones stocks and ETFs (read: These Q1 ETF Winners Have More Upside Left).

Total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up 3.2% from the same period last year on 10% higher revenues. This would follow the 32.5% rise in earnings in Q4 and 41.4% growth in Q3. The earnings estimates have come down by 0.3% since the start of the period, with revisions to the energy and finance sectors moving in opposite directions to each other. Of the 16 Zacks sectors, 10 are expected to earn more than the year-ago quarter.

Transportation & aerospace will likely see huge earnings growth as both incurred losses in the corresponding quarter of last year. The other eight sectors are expected to witness positive year-over-year earnings growth. Energy is expected to be the biggest contributor to S&P 500 earnings with 199.7% growth. This is likely to be followed by basic materials (44.2%) and construction (15.8%).
DIA in Focus
SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust is one of the largest and most-popular ETFs in the large-cap space with AUM of $30 billion and an average daily volume of 5.8 million shares. Holding 30 blue-chip stocks, the fund is widely spread across components with each holding less than 10.4% share. Information technology (21.1%), healthcare (20.3%), financials (15.6%), industrials (13.9%) and consumer discretionary (13.1%) are the top five sectors.

SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF charges 16 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Medium risk.   

Nearly one-fourth of the blue-chip firms are expected to announce results this week and in the next. JPMorgan Chase JPM is expected to report on Apr 13 while Goldman GS and UnitedHealth UNH will announce earnings on April 14 each. Both International Business Machines IBM and Johnson & Johnson JNJ are scheduled to report on Apr 19. Dow Inc. DOW and Intel INTC will release earnings on Apr 21 and Apr 28, respectively (read: 5 ETFs to Bet on the Favorite Sectors of Q1 Earnings).

Let’s delve deeper into the first-quarter earnings picture that will likely aid the fund in the coming days.
Earnings Whispers
According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

JPMorgan has a Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of -0.59%. The company saw negative earnings estimate revision of 5 cents over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Analysts declining estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a bad indicator for the stock. JPMorgan delivered a positive earnings surprise of 26.47%, on average, in the last four quarters.

Goldman has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -1.69%. The company witnessed negative earnings estimate revision of 66 cents over the past seven days for the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Goldman’s earnings surprise track over the preceding four quarters has also been robust, the average beat being 45.93%.

UnitedHealth has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of -0.58%. The stock witnessed negative earnings estimate revision of couple of cents over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter and delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.35%, on average, over the last four quarters.

International Business Machines has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. It saw no earnings estimate revision in the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. International Business Machines delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2.39% in the last four quarters.

2022-04-11 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-to-buy-right-now-1,,,"The artificial intelligence (AI) market has grown like a weed in recent years as organizations gather and process more data to make smarter decisions. However, it can be difficult for investors to filter out the noise and recognize the best investments across this sprawling and fragmented market.
So today, I'll tune out that noise and highlight three stocks that offer investors a balanced approach to investing in the growing AI market: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX).
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Nvidia
Nvidia is the world's largest producer of discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) for PCs. It also provides higher-end GPUs for data centers, where they help process complex machine learning and AI tasks more efficiently. GPUs can process a wide range of integers and floating-point numbers simultaneously, while traditional central processing units (or CPUs) only process a single piece of data at a time.
Many data centers now pair Nvidia's top-tier Tesla GPUs with Intel's Xeon server CPUs to crunch massive amounts of data for high-performance computing (HPC) applications. That trend, which is being driven by the growth of cloud-based services and mobile applications, has lit a fire under Nvidia's data center business.
In its latest quarter, Nvidia's data center revenue soared 71% year over year to $3.26 billion and accounted for 43% of its top line. It also grew at a much faster rate than its gaming revenue, which rose 37% to $3.42 billion. Nvidia attributed the growth of its data center business to the accelerating adoption of its GPUs across the hyperscale and cloud computing markets.
Nvidia's gaming GPU business faces concerns of a near-term slowdown as consumer demand for new PCs cools off in a post-lockdown market. Those near-term headwinds, along with the broader sell-off in tech stocks, caused Nvidia's stock to decline more than 20% this year.
However, I believe that pullback represents a good buying opportunity for patient investors who can look past Nvidia's near-term challenges and focus on its long-term growth potential in the AI market.
2. Salesforce
Salesforce is the world's largest customer relationship management (CRM) service provider. With its streamlined cloud-based platform, the company initially disrupted the industry for on-premise CRM software, which was difficult to scale as an organization expanded.
It has subsequently leveraged its dominance of the CRM market to launch additional cloud-based sales, marketing, e-commerce, and analytics services. Salesforce has made 20 major acquisitions over the past 14 years to expand that ecosystem and has launched additional features to lock in its customers.
One of those key features is Salesforce Einstein, an AI engine that processes a company's sales, service, and marketing data to deliver ""more personalized and predictive"" customer experiences. Salesforce has also integrated Einstein into its own app store, which enabled developers to build AI-powered apps that ""get smarter"" with every interaction.
Einstein directly complements its data visualization platform, Tableau, which it acquired back in 2019. While speaking about Moderna's usage of Einstein with Tableau in its latest conference call, Salesforce President and Chief Revenue Officer Gavin Patterson said the combination enables the pharmaceutical company to ""analyze data across all departments and use predictive analytics to make better decisions.""
Salesforce expects its annual revenue to nearly double from $26.5 billion in fiscal 2022 (which ended this January) to over $50 billion in fiscal 2026. That bullish outlook suggests Salesforce will remain one of the best ways to profit from the simultaneous growth of the cloud and AI markets.
3. Netflix
Netflix isn't frequently mentioned in conversations about AI stocks, but its entire streaming video ecosystem runs on complex AI algorithms. It uses AI to personalize video recommendations for its viewers, green-light the production of new content, and even choose the ideal thumbnail images for videos to encourage users to click on more videos.
This massive AI fabric enables Netflix to launch original hit shows like Stranger Things, Squid Game, and Bridgerton without relying on big, established franchises. By comparison, Disney still relies heavily on its massive portfolio of properties -- which spans the Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar cinematic universes -- to draw more viewers to Disney+.
Netflix's stock has declined by more than 40% this year amid concerns about its decelerating growth in a post-lockdown market and competitive headwinds. However, its shows are still dominating the streaming charts, according to Nielsen, while big institutional investors like Bill Ackman's Pershing Square remain bullish on the stock.
The next few quarters will likely be bumpy for Netflix, but I believe the streaming video leader will prove the bears wrong again as it taps its AI algorithms to create a new slate of hit shows. It also won't fade away anytime soon: It ended last quarter with 221.8 million paid subscribers, and it expects to add another 2.5 million subscribers in the current quarter.

Make no mistake about it, equity markets are still near all-time highs. This means that the opportunity for corrections from here remains very significant. There is plenty of room to fall should a correction really kicks in. Meanwhile, there’s no evidence of particular imminent trigger. But there is no shortage of potential culprits. Hence there’s reason to bet on one of these three tech stocks to buy this week.
The focus this week will likely be on banks stocks. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) will kick off its earning season midweek. They don’t have the best of records in upside follow through after their earning season. Money will need to go somewhere else, maybe into tech. However, this doesn’t alleviate the risk. All three of my tech stocks to buy have similar risks below their current prices. This makes them liable even for sympathy pains from other companies reporting. Small hiccups, even if in sympathy to banks, can turn into bigger debacles.
A symptom of this concern is visible in the Nasdaq. If it loses its footing this week, it is likely to drop at least 2% to 4% quickly. This may be enough to trigger a more serious drop in the three tech stocks I am proposing today.

This highlights the importance of treating these stocks like tactical trades rather than investments. Conviction is medium at best for that reason, even if none of them are bad. These are extremely successful companies that will be successful with what they do. The discussions today is about how to profit from their price action in the near term.
Ticker Company Current Price
AMD Advanced Micro Devices $97.78
INTC Intel $47.01
XLK Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund $149.52
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Source: Charts by TradingView
I will start with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) because it’s my favorite. Under the current leadership it has accomplished so much. Its financial statements have improved to a point that one can consider them cheap. This is a relative term of course, because it is a high-growth company. You can’t accomplish what it has been doing for years by pinching pennies. But it’s all relative to its competitors and AMD stock is solid on that front.
On the other hand, it technically teetered above a sharp line of support last week. Losing that today will carry it lower but the thing to do is buy the dip near support. The potential target can extend $25 lower, but there are support lines at $95 and $90. The bounce should be enough time for the bulls to regain their footing at least for now.
This may upset the fans, but my intention is to merely point out the potential for it. I’m not guaranteeing a $25 drop, in fact, I am betting on the opposite happening. It’s almost a case of a “so bad it’s good” trade. Once a stock falls into a hard line of support like this, I can get bullish on the assumption that it could flush out the short-term weak hands. But I must also place tight stop rules in place in case I’m wrong. Fundamentally, AMD stock is on rails for the long term. If the stock markets are higher in the future, then I am confident it will be leading too. This is a tactical trading opportunity independent of investment decisions.
Intel (INTC)

The opportunity Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) now is slightly different than AMD. INTC stock is also falling, but not into as sharp a line as AMD. Intel has a habit of bouncing off of a wide zone that lies directly beneath current prices. Therefore, this tactical trade could also work for a longer-term investor. However, it needs to only take partial positions to start.
When we talk of growth, INTC stock doesn’t come to mind. However, it is the king of value, especially in the semiconductors sector. Make no mistake about it, Intel is the behemoth here, but it doesn’t get the respect it deserves from traders. It is larger than its two other major competitors in total and twice over.

At some point that position of dominance will come back into play. If that’s the case, then in the future INTC stock will attract more attention. Until then, I would prefer to use options to sell puts into the support zone below. This way I can collect some premium for being bullish without outlays (all while leaving room for error). Owning a few shares for the long term would also make for a good starting position for investors.
Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)
Source: Charts by TradingView
The opportunity in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK) is not exactly representative of the one in pure chip stocks. The two main XLK components are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). They account for 40% of the XLK fund. This makes the opportunity in the XLK similar to that of tech stocks more broadly.
The difference is clearly visible in the chart of the XLK versus the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH). Opting for the SMH now would be too similar to AMD. It also needs an immediate bounce or it will trigger a bearish pattern. The XLK on the other hand, simply shows a mild retracement after a strong rally. Therefore, there might be a bit of room to give back still without cause machines to chase it lower.
The fundamentals of the XLK components are beyond reproach. The list is of the top tech global companies, including fintechs like MasterCard (NYSE:MA). Technically, it failed at $164, where there now lies a potential catalyst. It will be resistance until the bulls gather enough steam to punch through. Conversely, there isn’t much of a hard floor of support until closer to $146 per share. There will be willing buyers below these levels, but not a fine line. Nevertheless, $146 has played a major pivotal role since the Jan. 24 crash. I expect it will remain relevant for a bit longer. XLK bulls will do well to not test the theory of what lies below.

2022-04-11 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Stock: Bear vs. Bull,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-stock%3A-bear-vs.-bull,,,"As the world's largest producer of central processing units (CPUs) for PCs and servers, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is often considered a stable investment for conservative investors. But over the past four years, its stock has declined about 6% even as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index more than doubled.
Manufacturing missteps, production delays, and tough competition from AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) all curbed Intel's growth. It also prioritized buybacks and cost-cutting measures when it should have focused on fresh investments, and a rotation of three different CEOs over the past four years raised red flags.
Should investors consider Intel to be dead money and move on to more promising chip stocks instead? Or should they still consider it to be an undervalued turnaround play at just 14 times forward earnings? Let's look at both sides of that question.

What the bears will tell you about Intel
The bears will tell you that Intel grew complacent over the years and didn't properly upgrade its own chipmaking plants. Unlike ""fabless"" chipmakers like AMD, which outsource its manufacturing to third-party foundries, Intel still manufactures most of its chips at its internal foundries.
As a result, Intel fell behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), also known as TSMC, in the ""process race"" to create smaller, denser, and more power-efficient chips. AMD, which used TSMC foundries, then pulled ahead of Intel in that race, with smaller and more cost-efficient CPUs. Intel's ongoing foundry problems also resulted in constant delays, which frustrated its longtime customers.
Those mistakes, which mainly occurred under former CEO Brian Krzanich's watch from 2013 to 2018, handed a big slice of the CPU market to AMD. Between the second quarters of 2016 and 2022, Intel's global share of the x86 CPU market shrank from 80.6% to 64.1%, according to PassMark Software, as AMD's rose from 19.4% to 35.6%.
After Krzanich abruptly resigned in 2018, his successor, Bob Swan, immediately focused on wasteful buybacks and cost-cutting measures instead of aggressively chasing TSMC. Swan even briefly considered following AMD's lead and becoming a fabless chipmaker before he was ousted and replaced by Intel's current CEO, Pat Gelsinger, in early 2021.
Instead of going fabless, Gelsinger doubled down on expanding and upgrading Intel's foundries to surpass TSMC in the process race by 2025. It expects that ambitious plan to boost its annual capex from $18.7 billion in 2021 to $27 billion (36% of its estimated revenue) in 2022 and for those expenses to ""increase above historical levels for the next several years.""
Intel expects that aggressive spending to reduce its adjusted free cash flow to negative levels this year -- so its buybacks could grind to a halt, and its dividend hikes might be suspended. If the situation gets worse, Intel could potentially eliminate its dividend altogether to save nearly $6 billion each year.
Yet, Intel will still struggle to keep pace with TSMC, which plans to boost its capex to a record range of $40 billion to $44 billion this year. Gelsinger has been desperately pleading for big government subsidies to fill that gap.
Intel still expects its adjusted revenue to rise 2% in 2022, even as it faces slowing PC sales in a post-lockdown market, but it's also bracing for a 31% drop in its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) as it ramps up its spending.
What the bulls will tell you about Intel
The bulls will acknowledge that Intel faces a lot of near-term problems, but they also believe Gelsinger's turnaround plans will pay off.
They'll point out that Intel is streamlining its business with the divestment of its NAND memory business and an upcoming initial public offering (IPO) for its automotive chip unit Mobileye. It's also quietly outsourcing the production of some of its chips (including its discrete GPUs) to TSMC to free up more capacity for the production of its higher-end CPUs. All those moves could free up billions of dollars in cash for the long-term expansion of its first-party foundries.
The bulls also believe Intel will secure government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe, where many companies have grown wary of the industry's overwhelming dependence on TSMC and Samsung for new, top-tier chips.
To address those concerns, Intel plans to open up its foundries to external customers in the future -- which could potentially pull orders away from TSMC, Samsung, and other third-party contract chipmakers. That expansion could also enable its foundries to generate a lot more revenues on their own.
Lastly, Intel is striking back at AMD with new chips, such as its new ""Alder Lake"" CPUs, which roughly match the performance of AMD's smaller Ryzen CPUs by consuming more power. That's not an ideal or permanent solution for countering AMD, but it could help Intel tread water for now in the PC market.
The bearish case is still stronger
Intel isn't doomed, but its stock isn't undervalued. Its low price-to-earnings ratio reflects its sluggish growth rates and murky outlook, and it will likely continue to trade at a discount until it secures more government support and shows that it can actually catch up to TSMC.
Intel's downside potential might be limited at these levels, but investors should stick with more resilient chip stocks in this challenging market.
