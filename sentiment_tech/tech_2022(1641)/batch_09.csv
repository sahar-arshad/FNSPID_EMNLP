2022-10-28 00:00:00+00:00,Amazon slumps as tech selloff worsens,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-slumps-as-tech-selloff-worsens,,,"Oct 28 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O shares tumbled about 13% in premarket trading, with the online retailer coming close to losing its spot in the trillion-dollar company club, after forecasting holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates.
The dour outlook worsened this week's tech selloff amid fears of a looming recession, weighing on shares of Meta Platforms Inc META.O, Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O.
Amazon's shares, which were down 12.8% at $96.77, were trading at their lowest since March 2020.
However, Apple Inc AAPL.O shone bright amid a crowd of dimming lights in the Big Tech space, as the iPhone maker said it expects holiday-quarter revenue to grow by under 8%, compared with estimates of 3%.
Many view the megacap companies as bellwethers for how corporate America is faring during a year in which inflation has soared, pushing the U.S. Federal Reserve to enact a series of jumbo-sized rate hikes that have bruised markets.
Analysts fear macroeconomic factors, including a strong dollar, will continue to hit Amazon in the near term, however, over a longer period of time, the retailer should be able to bounce back.
""Despite accelerating revenues, Amazon has been cut down to size by the market after missing expectations. Efficiency has yet to return to the e-commerce business,"" Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said.
While the cloud services segment has been one of high and sustained growth for tech companies, indications for Amazon, Microsoft and Intel Corp INTC.O this week point to lower investments as costs rise.
Intel's shares rose about 5% premarket after the chipmaker said its cost-reduction plan includes layoffs and is expected to reduce costs by $3 billion next year.
However, analysts are cautious of how the company plans to reduce costs.
Cost reductions are necessary, but Intel needs to focus on cutting spending in the right places and keep research and development investments high, Glenn O'Donnell, research director at Forrester, said.

2022-10-28 00:00:00+00:00,Intel's Raptor Lake Is a Big Problem for AMD,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-raptor-lake-is-a-big-problem-for-amd,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has made a stunning comeback over the past five years. Through multiple generations of Ryzen PC CPUs, the company has steadily gained market share from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) while growing revenue and profit considerably. Even after being pummeled this year, AMD stock is up nearly 400% over the past five years.
AMD is now facing two major problems. The first is largely out of its control: Demand for PCs is plunging, leading to inventory corrections across the supply chain. AMD now expects its organic revenue to essentially flatline in the third quarter.
The second problem is Intel's new Raptor Lake CPUs. With Intel boosting core counts and pricing aggressively, AMD's latest Ryzen CPUs are simply overpriced. In a tough PC market, that's not going to go well.
Good at more than just games
Intel's chips have always been strong when it comes to single-threaded performance, which is extremely important for PC games. Modern games can make use of multiple CPU cores, but only to a point, and it varies widely depending on the game. For the most part, going beyond six or eight cores yields no benefit for PC gaming.
Other types of applications can scale across a far larger number of cores. One part of AMD's strategy with Ryzen has been to offer more cores for less money than Intel. For anyone doing video editing, 3D rendering, or using any other type of productivity or creative application that scales well with core counts, Ryzen has been a boon.
Intel's Raptor Lake puts an end to AMD's advantage in multithreaded workloads. AMD's latest Ryzen 7000 series chips still perform well overall, but Intel's pricing gives Raptor Lake a meaningful advantage.
A review from Tom's Hardware of Intel's i7-13700K, a $409 CPU, puts Intel's advantages on display. Intel has been able to boost core counts by using a mixed core architecture.
The 13700K features eight powerful cores and eight weaker cores, which together deliver 24 threads. The comparable product on the AMD side is the Ryzen 7 7700X, which goes for $399. The 7700X has eight cores, all the same, and 16 threads.
In gaming benchmarks, the 13700K beats all Ryzen 7000 series chips at stock settings, and that lead grows when the chip is overclocked. In multithreaded applications, those extra cores deliver a massive advantage. Across all the multithreaded benchmarks run by Tom's Hardware, Intel's 13700K was 35% faster than AMD's 7700X.
AMD's pricier chips with more cores deliver greater performance, but they're also far more expensive. The 13700K just barely loses out to AMD's $549 7900X in multithreaded tests, so it delivers vastly better performance per dollar.
A deeper pricing problem
Tom's Hardware didn't mince words toward the end of its review: ""AMD will need to reduce pricing on its Ryzen 7000 models now to stay competitive with Raptor Lake.""
AMD's pricing problem is actually worse than it looks. Not only are its Ryzen 7000 chips overpriced, relative to Raptor Lake, but building a system around them is more expensive. Ryzen 7000 chips aren't compatible with motherboards that support previous generations of Ryzen chips, and those new motherboards are expensive. On top of higher motherboard costs, Ryzen 7000 chips require DDR5 memory, while Raptor Lake supports both DDR5 and cheaper DDR4.
AMD expects sales in its client segment, which includes PC CPUs, to tumble 40% year over year in the third quarter as customers work to reduce inventories amid sluggish demand. Given that backdrop, AMD probably won't have much of a choice but to drop prices for its Ryzen 7000 CPUs if it wants to hold onto the market share it's won from Intel.

Oct 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rose on Friday as a jump in shares of Apple on upbeat results provided enough of a boost to outweigh a dour warning from Amazon.com.
Apple Inc AAPL.O shares jumped 6.2% as the iPhone maker's fourth-quarter results showed some resilience, but it cautioned revenue growth could see some pressure in the December quarter.
Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O joined other Big Tech firms that have disappointed investors this week by predicting a slowdown in sales growth for the holiday season amid a hit to purchasing power of consumers. Shares tumbled 10.7%.
The online retailer is now on the brink of losing its spot in the trillion-dollar company club.
Shares of other megacap tech companies such as Microsoft MSFT.O, Meta Platforms Inc META.O and Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL.O, which reported downbeat earnings earlier this week, were trading higher.
Big Tech earnings are viewed as a major test of the strength of corporate America in the face of decades-high inflation, with only Apple's report being perceived as the only positive outlier.
""Apple has not cracked like the other tech firms and shows how it can be done,"" said Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot.
""While we should expect a slowdown in the next earnings report, the company continues to hold up well, unlike its big tech rivals.""
Bank of America Global Research said investors took advantage of a recent wipeout in U.S. tech stocks this week to snap up shares despite their vulnerability to higher interest rates.
Data showed underlying inflation pressures continued to bubble, even as U.S. consumer spending increased more than expected in September.
The Commerce Department's core Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, climbed 5.1% in September compared to an expected 5.2% rise year-on-year when stripped of volatile food and energy costs.
The Federal Reserve is still expected to deliver another jumbo-sized 75 basis-point increase in November. For December, traders are largely expecting a 50 basis-point increase. FEDWATCH

2022-10-28 00:00:00+00:00,"Amazon Falls, but This Long-Struggling Nasdaq Stock Is on the Mend",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-falls-but-this-long-struggling-nasdaq-stock-is-on-the-mend,,,"The stock market has been volatile all week, as major companies have released their latest earnings results and shown the impact that current economic conditions are having on businesses. That volatility looked poised to continue for the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) on Friday morning, with futures contracts on the tech-heavy index down nearly 1% in premarket trading.
The biggest drag on the Nasdaq on Friday morning came from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which issued a financial report that created concern among investors across the sector. Meanwhile, though, another company in tech that has gotten beaten down a lot more over the years showed some signs of recovery. Below, you'll see more about what made Amazon stock lose ground, as well as why investors are taking a closer look at Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
Amazon sees tough times ahead
Shares of Amazon were down almost 14% in premarket trading on Friday morning. The e-commerce and cloud computing giant's third-quarter results showed the pressure that the retail sector is feeling right now, and things look like they could get worse entering the key holiday quarter.
Amazon's financial numbers were mixed. Revenue was up 15% year over year to $127.1 billion, even after accounting for 4 percentage points of downward pressure from the strong U.S. dollar. However, net income fell 9% from year-ago levels to $2.87 billion, resulting in earnings of just $0.28 per share. Moreover, that figure actually included a valuation gain of $1.1 billion from Amazon's stake in EV manufacturer Rivian Automotive, and operating income was down by nearly half as losses in the e-commerce business offset healthy profits from Amazon Web Services.
Moreover, Amazon projected an even bigger slowdown in the coming quarter. Fourth-quarter guidance called for Amazon to see revenue of $140 billion to $148 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of just 2% to 8%. Operating income projections were in a range of $0 to $4 billion, suggesting substantial deterioration from year-earlier levels is likely once again.
If the decline in the stock sticks, it would bring Amazon's share price to its lowest levels since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. Moreover, if the holiday season truly does go as poorly as Amazon's guidance suggests, it could spell trouble for the entire retail sector.
Intel makes a comeback
On a more positive note, shares of Intel were up more than 7% in the premarket trading session on Wall Street. The chipmaker has had plenty of challenges to face over the years, but its latest financial report showed some optimism within the business even though conditions remained tough.
Intel's financial numbers weren't pretty. Revenue of $15.3 billion was down 15% year over year on an adjusted basis. Adjusted net income plunged almost 60% from year-ago levels to $2.4 billion, working out to $0.59 per share. However, as big a drop on the bottom line as Intel suffered, most investors had expected even worse, so the figures came as good news in the eyes of many.
Intel is working hard to boost its efficiency, aiming to achieve $3 billion in cost reductions in 2023. That in turn could be just the beginning of broader efforts that could eventually bring annual savings of $8 billion to $10 billion by the end of 2025.
Even though the stock has been under pressure, Intel has taken steps to make shareholders happier, including this week's listing of shares of its Mobileye Global autonomous driving technology unit. Yet even after today's gains, the stock remains at levels seen consistently in the early 2010s, and it'll take a lot of work to get Intel shares back in the good graces of investors across the stock market again.

    By Stephen Culp
       NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq
posted losses on Thursday, as investors contended with solid
economic data and a mixed bag of corporate earnings.
    The price-weighted Dow advanced, held aloft by industrials
<.SPLRCI>, while weakness in market-moving tech and
tech-adjacent megacaps depressed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in the
wake of downbeat quarterly results and dour guidance.
    ""It’s very much a bifurcated market, a tale of two cities,""
said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist Ingalls & Snyder
in New York.
    ""There's lot of pressure on tech and tech-plus names, higher
growth names,"" Ghriskey added. ""On the flipside you’re seeing a
lot of strength in other sectors, in particular consumer
staples, energy, financials, industrials and utilities."" 
    Meta Platforms  plunged 24.6% after the Facebook
parent followed the trend set by Microsoft Corp  and
Alphabet Inc  by providing gloomy forward guidance.
    But heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc  reported
better-than-expected quarterly profit, sending its shares
jumping 7.7% and providing the most muscle to the Dow's advance.
    A third-quarter GDP reading showing the U.S. economy
returned to growth in the July-Sept period, along with steady
quarterly core inflation helped take the sting out of earnings.
    Investors continue to scan the economic horizon for evidence
that the barrage of aggressive interest rate hikes from the
Federal Reserve, begun in March, are beginning to have the
desired effect by cooling down the economy.
    While a 75 basis point rate hike at the conclusion of its
Nov. 1-2 policy meeting is all but assured, the likelihood of a
smaller, 50 basis point hike in December was 55%, according to
CME's FedWatch tool. 
    ""The overriding theme is really the Fed. The Fed is going to
control the direction of this market over the coming months,""
Ghriskey added. 
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 194.17 points,
or 0.61%, to 32,033.28, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 23.3 points, or
0.61%, to 3,807.3 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped
178.32 points, or 1.63%, to 10,792.68.
    Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, industrials had
the biggest percentage gain, with communication services
<.SPLRCL>, weighed by Meta, down the most.
    Third-quarter reporting season forges ahead at full speed,
with 227 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of
those, 74% have beaten consensus estimates.
    Analysts now see aggregate S&P earnings growth of 2.5%, down
from 4.5% at the beginning of October.
    ""In general we’ve seen earnings come in at or slightly above
expectations,"" Ghriskey said. ""But those expectations have been
lowered throughout the quarter."" 
    McDonald's Corp  gained 3.3% after the fast food
chain beat quarterly same-store sales estimates. 
        Shares of Southwest Airlines Co  rose 2.7% after
the carrier's quarterly profit topped consensus estimates. 
    Shares of Amazon.com  dropped more than 19% in
post-market trading after the company provided a disappointing
sales forecast.
        Shares of Apple Inc  slid more than 5% in
after-hours trading after the gadget maker beat revenue and
profit estimates, but reported light iPhone sales.
    Intel Corp  rose as much 7% before paring gains post
market, even after cutting its annual revenue forecast.
    Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a
1.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.10-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
    The S&P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows; the
Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 119 new lows.  
    Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.36 billion shares, compared
with the 11.59 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

SINGAPORE, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Friday and were set to snap a three-day winning streak, while the Japanese yen was squeezed lower after the Bank of Japan held on to its dovish policy and maintained ultra-low interest rates.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was 1% lower. The index is down 3.6% for the month and 30% for the year.
As widely expected, the BOJ kept unchanged its -0.1% target for short-term interest rates, and 0% for the 10-year government bond yield by an unanimous vote.
It also maintained its dovish policy guidance that pledges to ramp up stimulus as needed, and projecting that short- and long-term interest rates will move at ""current or lower levels.""
BOJ raised its inflation target, saying it expects core consumer inflation to hit 2.9% in the current fiscal year ending in March 2023 and 1.6% the following year.
Earlier on Friday, core consumer inflation in Japan's capital Tokyo, considered a leading indicator of nationwide figures, hit a 33-year high of 3.4% in October, data showed on Friday. Inflation in the Tokyo area thus exceeded the central bank's 2% target for five straight months.
The BOJ policy decision comes after the European Central Bank on Thursday raised interest rates again, but said ""substantial"" progress had already been made in its bid to fight off a surge in inflation.
The less hawkish comments from the ECB added to expectations that central banks are likely to slow the pace of monetary tightening, especially after the Bank of Canada surprised the market by delivering a smaller-than-anticipated rate hike on Wednesday.
Rodrigo Catril, senior currency strategist at National Australia Bank, said the ECB delivered a 75 bps hike as expected, but it sounded less committal on future rate hikes.
Rates markets are cheering the idea of a potential slowdown from central banks in terms of the pace of interest rate hikes, Catril added.
Over in China, the stock market .SSEC fell 2%, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index .HSI down 1.7%, rounding up a rough week as investors were left reeling from Monday's brutal sell-off. Bleak industrial profit figures and widening COVID-19 outbreaks have also weighed on sentiment.
Elsewhere, Japan's Nikkei .N225 fell 0.35%, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index .AXJO lost 0.85%.
The BOJ's ultra-easy policy has helped trigger sharp yen JPY=EBS declines that inflate the cost of importing already expensive fuel and raw material, and this has prompted the government to intervene in the market to prop up the currency.
The Japanese yen weakened 0.18% versus the greenback at 146.53 per dollar. /FRX
The euro EUR=EBS was 0.2% to $0.9982, threatening to rise above parity again, following a more than 1% slide overnight, after the dovish tone from ECB.
The U.S. dollar index =USD, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 0.109%, after gaining nearly 0.8% overnight.
Meanwhile, Amazon.comAMZN.O predicted a slowdown in sales growth for the holiday season, while IntelINTC.O cut its full-year profit and revenue forecast, stoking more fears of an economic slowdown.
The downbeat results from Amazon on Thursday added to a string of dismal reports from Big Tech companies, with over $200 billion in U.S. stock market value up in smoke in extended trade on the day.

We have also provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures this quarter, and we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings release and earnings presentation include full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Despite growing economic headwinds, Q3 revenue was flat sequentially and only modestly below the midpoint of our guidance. In June, we were one of the first companies to highlight an abrupt and pronounced slowdown in demand, which has brought and beyond our initial expectations and is now having an industrywide impact across the electronic supply chain. We are adjusting our Q4 outlook, and we are planning for the economic uncertainty to persist into 2023.
While we are not satisfied with our results, we remain laser-focused on controlling what we can, and we are pleased that our PC share stabilized in Q2 and is now showing meaningful improvement in Q3. Our service share, while not where we want it to be, is tracking in line with our expectations, and we are encouraged by good execution in the quarter against our product road map. In addition, we are intensifying our cost reduction and efficiency efforts, and we are aggressively moving into the next phase of IDM 2.0 geared to unlocking the full potential of the IDM advantage. This afternoon, I will focus my comments in three areas: one, the key trends and dynamics that shape Q3 and are informing our outlook; two, the progress we are making on IDM 2.0, including our momentum on process and product road maps and our recent announcement that we are implementing an internal foundry model; and three, the actions underway to drive cost savings and efficiency gains aimed at accelerating our transformation.
Specific to trends we are seeing, along with further deterioration in consumer PC demand in Q3, enterprise demand has begun to slow. We expect PC units to decline mid- to high teens to approximately 295 million units in calendar year '22. Our own Q3 results reflect a strong product portfolio with Raptor Lake building on Alder Lake's momentum, as well as working closely with customers to optimize their inventory, our market share and business objectives. We are still shipping below PC consumption and the inventory correction continued in Q3, but not as quickly as we forecasted.
Importantly, however, PC usage remains strong, demonstrating the increased utility and value of the PC and ultimately supporting a TAM well above pre-pandemic levels. We are targeting a calendar year '23 PC unit TAM of between 270 million and 295 million units with a strong brand and product line driving additional share, especially at premium ASPs. The data center TAM is holding up better, although enterprise in China continue to show signs of weakness as to some but not all cloud customers. Across our infrastructure and industrial exposed businesses, NEX demand was very solid, though not immune from the weakening economy.
PSG continues to be a true standout with record Q3 revenue, up over 25% year over year. PSG backlog is robust, and it continues to be an area where we are supply chain-limited. Despite the challenging business environment, we made solid progress toward our long-term transformation in Q3, and we remain fully committed to using the macro uncertainty to accelerate our efforts. Each quarter, our confidence grows in achieving our goal of five nodes in four years.
On Intel 4, we are progressing toward a high-volume manufacturing and will tape out the production stepping at Meteor Lake in Q4. The first stepping of Granite Rapids is out of the fab, yielding well with Intel 3 continuing to progress on schedule. Intel 4 and 3 are our first nodes deploying EUV and will represent a major step forward in terms of transistor performance per watt and density. On Intel 20A and 18A, the first nodes to benefit from RibbonFET and PowerVia our first internal test chips, and those of a major potential foundry customer have taped out with silicon running in the fab.
We continue to be on track to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. IFS is a major beneficiary of our TD progress, and we are excited to welcome NVIDIA to the RAMP-C program, which enables both commercial foundry customers and the U.S. Department of Defense to take advantage of Intel's at scale investments in leading-edge technologies. Since Q2, IFS has expanded engagements to seven out of the 10 largest foundry customers, coupled with consistent pipeline growth to include 35 customer test chips.
In addition, IFS increased qualified opportunities by $1 billion to over $7 billion in deal value, all before we welcome the Tower team with the expected completion of the merger in Q1 '23. On the product front, we had a busy quarter. Within client, as mentioned earlier, we added to the strong Alder Lake momentum with the launch of Raptor Lake desktop in Q3, driving a more than a 40% improvement in multi-thread performance, unquestioned leadership in gaming, six gigahertz out of the box and record-setting overclocking. We currently have over 500 OEM design wins.
We launched Intel Unison to deliver best-in-industry multidevice user experience. In addition, we saw a meaningful development progress across multiple OEM designs on Intel four-based Meteor Lake with volume ramps in 2023. We now have all elements of the AXG portfolio in production with A770 giving our discrete graphics efforts a strong boost. The Flex family is building a strong pipeline of data center use cases, and Ponte Vecchio is now production of four HPC offerings and production blades deployed for lead customers.
Combined with Sapphire Rapids and Sapphire Rapids HBM, PBC is the basis for strong traction with HPC customers like Argonne National Laboratory and Germany's Leibniz Supercomputing Centre. CSPs and telcos alike continue to move to software-based 5G, vRAN and O-RAN deployments. We announced Sapphire Rapids EE with vRAN Boost for in-line acceleration of 5G and network workloads. Edge and AI are proving a powerful combination for us with OpenVINO momentum building with customers like Chipotle, and we launched the Intel Geti computer vision software platform for RapidAI training with early customers such as Braven, Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals.
Further evidence of our AI portfolio taking shape was seen by Red Hat announcing support for Gaudi, Cnvrg.io and OpenVINO. Inspur announced Gaudi 2 with Sapphire Rapids for advanced AI use cases. Amazon will be accelerating large transform models with Gaudi instances in EC2. This was also a very strong quarter for DCAI execution.
Sapphire Rapids volume SKUs have now PRQed with a high-quality leadership product and a very strong volume ramp expected. Google gave the first preview of its C3 instances showing Sapphire Rapids capabilities, as well as our leadership IPU, the E3200 or Mount Evans. We also saw strong milestones in the next three generations of server products. Emerald Rapids is showing good progress and is on track for calendar year '23.
Granite Rapids is very healthy running multiple operating systems across many configurations. And with Sierra Forest, our first E-core product providing world-class performance per watt are both solidly on track for '24. It's obvious, but we're stating our strategy is only as good as our execution. We have been taking aggressive action to rebuild our execution engine, driving execution excellence across our people, design and development and operations.
In Q1, I discussed our return to OKRs and their importance to our culture. Last quarter, I touched upon the next evolution of our tick-tock model, or tick-tock 2, as a disciplined approach to consistent, predictable product execution. This quarter, I wanted to spend a bit of time on operational excellence and discuss our recently announced IDM 2.0 Acceleration Office, or IAO, ushering in the next phase of our IDM 2.0 strategy. During the first phase of IDM 2.0, we aggressively focus on making the needed investments to approve our TD road map to regain transistor leadership and to ensure we have at scale manufacturing capacity by building ahead on shelves.
Improvements in both areas now enables us to move forward with our next set of priorities, evolving our systems, business practices and culture to embrace an internal foundry model and establish a leadership cost structure. This means we will create what I like to call a new and clean API for the company by establishing consistent processes, systems and guardrails between our manufacturing teams and our business units. This will place our BUs on the same economic footing as external IFS customers and will allow our manufacturing group and BUs to be more agile, make better decisions and uncover efficiency and cost savings. We have already identified nine different subcategories for operational improvement that our teams will aggressively pursue.
For example, product teams will be heavily incented to drive the high-quality A0 steppings, as they see the full cost of steppings, validation cycles, hot lots and capacity changes. Factories will move to rigorous capacity loading cycles, transparency of cost for loading changes and efficiency of capital utilization, structural and variable wafer costs. In addition to establishing better incentives, this new approach will provide transparency on our financial execution, allowing us to better benchmark ourselves against other foundries and drive to best-in-class performance. It will also provide improved transparency to our owners as we expect to share full internal foundry P&L into calendar year '24, ultimately, allowing you to better judge how we are creating value and allocating your capital.
A key benefit of IDM 2.0 is to unlock our full financial potential by capturing multiple profit pools not available to any one of our peers across architecture, design, wafer manufacturing, advanced packaging, supply chain and software. These pools were only partially long-term margin targets we established at Investor Day in February. Simple math would suggest there is meaningful upside to those targets as we execute and exploit the margin-stacking potential IDM 2.0 provides best-in-class semiconductor companies achieved gross margin in the 60s and operating margins in the 40s. And we aim to be best-in-class.
This next phase of IDM 2.0 is a significant evolution in how we think and operate as a company. But just as we optimize to drive outside returns in the IDM 1.0 era, we will optimize to achieve best-in-class returns in the IDM 2.0 era. It's what engineers do, and we have the best engineers on the planet. Complementing and augmenting these efforts will be an intensified focus to reduce costs and drive efficiencies in everything we do.
As we stated during Q2 earnings, we have an obligation to our owners to be good stewards of your capital. We are responding to the current environment by taking aggressive actions to reduce costs across COGS and opex while mindfully protecting the investments needed to accelerate our transformation, ensure we are well-positioned for long-term market growth. In addition to reducing near-term costs, we have also identified structural cost reductions and efficiency drivers, which Dave will outline a bit later. In aggregate, our efforts should drive $3 billion in annual savings in the near term and $8 billion to $10 billion by the end of 2025.
Not captured in these estimates are the start-up costs to support five nodes in four years which will begin to subside beyond calendar year '26, adding an additional $2 billion in COGS savings. Inclusive in our efforts will be steps to optimize our headcount. These are difficult decisions affecting our loyal Intel family, but we need to balance increased investment in areas like leadership and TD product and capacity in Ohio and Germany with efficiency measures elsewhere as we drive to have best-in-class structures. We will also continue to use our smart capital approach to support and inform our capital spending aspirations, aggressively building ahead on shells while aligning equipment purchases and installs with customer demand.
We continue to see skips like our partnership with Brookfield as an innovative financial structure to more closely align fab build-out costs with fab output returns. Likewise, we see U.S. and EU chips as vital to enable us to establish a geographically diverse and secure supply chain for the semiconductor industry. We are confident in reaccelerating free cash flow growth and driving industry-leading free cash flow margins, which we get through this period of economic uncertainty affecting the entire industry and our own elevated investments to accelerate our transformation.
Lastly, I was particularly pleased to join the Mobileye team earlier this week in New York to witness firsthand the successful completion of their IPO, especially in a difficult market. We believe that this will help unlock Mobileye's full operational and financial potential and is an additional avenue to create value for our owners. We remain committed to optimizing our value creation efforts through portfolio honing, reallocation of resources to higher returns, higher-growth businesses, M&A and where applicable, divestitures. Before turning it over to Dave, I want to close by saying I continue to be heartened and impressed by the dedication and commitment of all of our employees by far, the most important owners of this great company.
They are passionately committed like me to reestablish Intel as a dominant driver of innovation and by the opportunity to improve the lives of everyone on the planet. It was also rewarding to see that same drive and dedication in the faces of our broader developer community at Intel Innovation, the rebirth of Intel IDF in September. We are the building blocks, an enabler of their vision and aspirations, and it is our commitment to them to be great partners and collaborators. Our ambitions are equal by our passions and our efforts across manufacturing, design, products and foundry are well on their way to driving our transformation and creating the flywheel, which is IDM 2.0.
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid third quarter despite the macroeconomic headwinds impacting the semiconductor industry. We expect these headwinds to persist and as a result, we're lowering our expectations for the fourth quarter. We will continue to be laser-focused on the things that we can control and use economic uncertainty to accelerate our transformation and drive cost cutting and efficiency gains.
Moving to Q3 results. Revenue was $15.3 billion, flat sequentially and only modestly below the midpoint of our guide. Q3 revenue benefited from CCG's strength, offset by declining TAMs in DCAI and NEX. Gross margin for the quarter was 46%, below our guide, but largely in line relative to lower Q3 revenue.
Q3 gross margin increased 100 basis points sequentially on lower inventory reserves. EPS was $0.59, $0.24 above our guide largely on lower-than-forecasted taxes. Adjusting for the lower tax rate, EPS would have been $0.37, $0.02 above our guide on better expense management. Operational cash flow for the quarter was $1 billion.
Net capex for the quarter was $7.3 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $6.3 billion. And we paid dividends of $1.5 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash balances of $23 billion, modest leverage and a strong investment-grade credit profile. Turning to our business unit results.
CCG revenue was $8.1 billion, up 6% sequentially, driven by higher ASPs on better mix and also benefiting from our efforts to work with customers to maximize our share position ahead of Q4 price increases. CCG revenue was down 17% year over year as customers continue to reduce inventory and we continue to under ship demand. Demand weakness year over year was most pronounced in the consumer, education and small medium business markets. Operating profit was $1.7 billion, up $570 million sequentially and down 54% year over year on lower revenue, increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and increased spending to further strengthen our product road map.
DCAI revenue was $4.2 billion, down 27% year over year on TAM reductions and continued competitive pressures even as market share continues to track in line with our expectations. Operating profit was $17 million, below expectations and down significantly year over year. Profitability was impacted by lower revenue, higher advanced node start-up costs and higher product costs on transition to 10 nanometers. We also continue to invest aggressively in the product road map.
NEX revenue was $2.3 billion, up 14% year over year on increased demand for 5G, Ethernet and edge products, partially offset by lower network Xeon demand. In Q3, we started to see macro-driven demand softness and customer inventory management impact NEX. Operating profit was $75 million, down 85% year over year due to the impact of softer demand on inventory valuation and increased road map investment. AXG revenue was $185 million, up 8% year over year on the ramp of our Blockscale products.
Operating loss was $378 million, $129 million better sequentially, but $156 million worse than year over year due to softer demand and product readiness impacting inventory valuation, as well as increased investment to deliver the visual, supercompute and custom accelerated graphics road maps. Mobileye revenue was $450 million, up $124 million from Q3 2021, primarily driven by higher demand for EyeQ products. Operating income was $142 million, up $15 million from Q3 2021, primarily due to higher revenue. IFS revenue was $171 million, down 2% year over year, driven by automotive weakness with customers citing third-party component shortages, partially offset by growth in core foundry and IMS businesses.
Operating loss was $103 million versus an operating loss of $44 million in Q3 '21 on increased spending to enable our foundry growth strategy. Turning to Q4 guidance. Given the deteriorating macro environment and based on input from our customers, we're now guiding Q4 revenue in a range of $14 billion to $15 billion with sequential decline driven by lower CCG revenue as customers reduced inventory lower NEX TAM and continued DCAI headwinds. We're forecasting gross margin of 45%, a tax rate of 14% and EPS of $0.20 at the midpoint of revenue guidance.
For Q4 adjusted free cash flow, we expect to see a meaningful sequential increase driven by working capital improvements and a $2 billion reduction in net capex, adjusting for a lower demand environment. These benefits will be partially offset by lower revenue. And as a result, we're reducing our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance to negative $2 billion to negative $4 billion. There is also a possibility that a portion of expected capital offsets could move from Q4 to Q1, shifting the cash flow benefit into next year.
Consistent with our short-term financial model discussed at our Investor Day in February, our continued intent is to manage adjust this free cash flow at approximately breakeven as we go through this period of accelerated and elevated investments supported by our smart capital approach and the multiple pools of capital available to finance our strategy. Now turning to our long-term outlook and the changes we're making to transform the business. Beyond Q4, there's a high degree of macroeconomic uncertainty, and it appears that the current challenging market environment will extend well into 2023 with the potential for a global recession. Further, as I discussed in Q2 earnings, it's imperative that we drive for world-class product cost and operational efficiency to achieve our long-term financial model.
As Pat detailed earlier, to accelerate this transformation, we're forming the IDM 2.0 Acceleration Office and doubling down on our efforts to reduce costs and find efficiencies across the organization. We'll start with a focus on driving $3 billion of cost reduction in 2023, one-third in cost of sales and two-thirds in operating expenses. Note that our Q3 results include GAAP restructuring charges of $664 million that reflect initial efforts to rightsize our business and deliver these savings. In Q4, we expect to have additional restructuring charges of similar magnitude as we further rationalize our 2023 financial plan.
Longer term, we will execute on continued structural cost savings and efficiency gains, which we expect to drive $8 billion to $10 billion in annual savings by the end of 2025, split roughly two-thirds in cost of sales and one-third in operating expense. These savings will be realized through multiple initiatives to optimize the business, including portfolio cuts, rightsizing of our support organizations, more stringent cost controls in all aspects of our spending and improved sales and marketing efficiency. As Pat outlined, also critical to driving this transformation is the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, dramatically increasing financial accountability and transparency, enabling all organizations to drive to world-class product cost and efficiency benchmarks. In addition, as we emerge from five nodes in four years and slower technology development cadence, we expect an additional approximately 200 basis points of gross margin after 2026.
We expect these efforts to provide potential upside to the financial targets we provided at the February Investor Day. This will be a multiyear journey, but as Pat said earlier, best-in-class semiconductor companies have a financial profile that includes gross margins in the 60s and operating margins in the 40s, and we aim to be best-in-class. In the short term, we will continue to manage to the opex, net capital intensity and adjusted free cash flow guardrails established and drive back to a gross margin percentage range of 51% to 53% once economic conditions improve and revenue growth returns. In closing, we remain committed to the strategy and financial model communicated at Investor Day.
The compelling long-term financial opportunity of strong revenue growth across our six business units and free cash flow at 20% of revenue remains. And I believe this downturn represents an opportunity to more quickly make the transformation necessary to achieve these goals. With that, let me turn it back over to John and get to your questions.
John Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Dave. As move into the Q&A session, we would ask each participant ask one question, and where appropriate, a brief follow-up question. Operator, please go ahead and introduce the first caller.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Certainly. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. You mentioned, both Dave and Pat, many times about the macroeconomic weakness, likely persisting into next year. So if you're willing to talk a little bit about the puts and takes in the market.
You talked about the PC market being down about 5%, Pat. But overall, from your segments, where do you see either market headwinds or tailwinds or individual Intel-specific areas for market share gains or still challenges into 2023?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thank you, Ross. I'll start off on that. And like we said, it's just the macroeconomic, unpredictable, tough market outlook.
And inside of that, it's just hard to see any points of good news on the horizon, inflation in the U.S., the situation in Europe with energy and the war and in Asia. So against that backdrop, we're still looking to have economic headwinds as we go into next year. And with that in mind, obviously, lowering our guide for Q4. As we think about it, at the industry level, obviously, some of that helps to accelerate some of the rebalancing of the supply chain, and some of that will help our business like lowering of DDR memory costs will decrease the premiums on DDR5 that makes Sapphire Rapids a more compelling platform.
In other areas, we still have a rebalancing of the supply chain in front of us on some of the older nodes. When we look at our business units, the PC, more critical device than ever. And as Sacha talked about yesterday on hisearnings call 20% more active devices usage increasing. That said, we do expect that the TAM, as I indicated in my formal comments, is going to be a bit lower next year.
We've given a range aligned with the industry. For servers, we have seen the slowdown in enterprise and to a lesser degree, in the cloud market, decreasing the TAM outlook there. We do, in our modeling, look at that as we're building our capacity. Obviously, our cost efforts have been very specific to give us flexibility for lowering the structural rate cost even as we stay true to the strategic investments that we're making and driving our transformation and disciplined cost modeling more quickly.
So it really is a challenging environment, unpredictable environment, and we're staying true to the strategy, making cost adjustments and trying to balance market outlooks as we gain share, right, in some segments, and we fight for share in other segments. And I was very pleased with how the team executed in improving our execution in an environment that really was quite tough. Thank you.
John Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
Ross, do you have a brief follow-up?
Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Yeah. Just following up to that last part that you said, Pat, about some of the areas of share gains or share losses. Where do you think those will be most acute in both directions, the good and the bad?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And we'd say we saw no -- if we go to the areas, we're just entering in the AXG business and IFS. So everything there is gaining share. In the NEX business, we saw our businesses entirely driven by the macro.
And our market share seemed to have no real shift whatsoever, and we continue to be a grower in that segment. In PC, we had very market share gains this quarter, very strong product lines, so we think we're well-positioned. And in data center, we grew slower than the market. And as the product line gets stronger, we will be in a position to regain share, regain ASP, obviously, ramp the Sapphire Rapids.
But we still see ourselves not in a position that we're gaining share yet and expect that will be the case for a couple of more quarters.
John Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Ross. Jonathan, could we have the next question, please?
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.
Tim Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Thanks a lot. Pat, I had a question on the internal foundry. It seems sort of like the first step in basically splitting the company into an external foundry and a fabless company. Can you sort of play that out? Is that the idea? And sort of how does this create value? I guess, I mean, obviously, if you look at GlobalFoundries' market cap, that's like 30% of your market cap.
But how does it play out functionally, how it creates value?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. When we definitely view that there are efficiencies for us to gain as we go through this internal foundry model, where we see numerous areas in the company that were not as rigorous as we need to be. In factory loading, where we make lots of change in factory loadings and we would run the factories more efficiently or stepping aren't accountable, right, through cost modeling back to the business units, and thus, driving the high-quality A0 stepping. And stepping changes being fully reflected internally and the cost of those will make us more efficient.
Leveraging third-party IP more aggressively will make us more efficient. And the combination of that is a big piece of why we're stepping to this internal foundry model, and we expect that we're going to start giving more financial transparency that way so that you can start to see the benefits in the margin stacking being realized of both being a product company, as well as a fab foundry company. And that's what we're out to get with the structure that we're laying out. That said, we think that this tight coupling of the IDM 2.0 model is a powerful value generator for us, at least the three areas.
One, the technology benefits that we get to have a rapid pace of technology innovation and co-optimization between product and process. The second is the cash flows and balance sheet benefits that we get by having these internal to be able to drive the large investments required in the manufacturing network. And third is in the supply chain efficiency and flexibility being able to balance across the foundry and business unit structure. So these three areas for us are ones that we see that tight coupling bringing long-term meaningful value generation to the company and to our shareholders.
But we're going to do it against the backdrop that we are going to be benchmarking ourselves against the best-in-class in each area and that transparency, right? We'll provide more visibility to you, our shareholders, but also drive our teams internally. And an engineering, manufacturing team when they see benchmark that you're holding up against them, it just unleashes energy into the future. And that's the excitement that we are working to create with this internal foundry model. And as we've launched it this quarter, we're already starting to see the roots of that permeate through our teams.
John Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
Tim, do you have a brief follow-up?
Tim Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
I do just quickly. I guess just a follow-up on that. So like what's the line in the sand, Dave? I guess, it's a question more on cash flow. What is the line in the sand? I think before, you said that 2024 was going to be free cash flow neutral.
Is that still the line in the sand where whatever you have to do, you'll do -- you'll cut capex as much as you can to be free cash flow neutral in 2024? Is that still the free cash flow line on the sand?
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean we expect to manage in the near term, while we're in this investment phase to kind of a neutral free cash flow over the course of '23, '24 combined. Obviously, our long-term goal is to is actually significantly improve cash flow, and we still feel like the model we gave at Investor Day is the right model that we can generate 20% free cash flow, as a percent of revenue. And obviously, this year, I think we showed very good discipline on the capex side.
We brought our capex -- I think when we started the year, we thought capex would be in the $27 billion range on a net basis. We've adjusted that down to $21 billion. But we still preserved what Pat thought was the most important things to invest in to make sure that we're ready to go as we launch new nodes, as we bring out the IFS business and gain more customer traction in that space. And then next year, the real protection on the cash flow now will be around these spending reductions.
We have $3 billion of spending reductions we're going out to achieve in '23. No guidance yet on capex, but I would just say the model in the near term was to run essentially at 35% of revenue. And as Pat, I think, even mentioned on the investor -- at the Investor Day, we will manage to the model, and that's quite important to us. So we think we can manage both aspects of this protect cash flow, be smart around spending, but continue to operate our strategy and our road map to get to leadership on process and product, to bring out these emerging businesses like the foundry business and like graphics.
John Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
Tim, thank you for the question. Jonathan, could we have the next question, please?
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question, please.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. Pat, isn't it risky to plan for a $270 million to $290 million PC TAM. Then clearly, the market seems to be reverting back to pre-pandemic levels of $260 million or so. And since that time before the pandemic, one large customer has moved away from x86, and there have been share shift.
So what is the TAM next year is more like $250 million to $260 million? What impact will it have on your cost and fab loading assumptions? Thank you.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So first, the premise of the question, we clearly, over a number of quarters, we're above market forecast. That range that I described is exactly in line with the various forecast, our OEM feedback, the feedback from key software providers as well. So I'd say our range is now aligned with that industry range.
Second point being that ranges larger than and well above pre-pandemic levels at that point. It is a structurally larger market. There's lots of units out there waiting to be replaced that are aging in the footprint, clear markets that are yet to have the PC penetration. So we feel quite comfortable.
And as I noted in the earlier question, PC usage is high, as seen by Microsoft and their metrics, and our product line is positioned to gain share. So somewhat independent of the size of the TAM, we have a great product line, and our product line is also in our brand is well suited with a higher margin segments of the market that have been more resilient, right, to the market effects, low-end consumers where you've seen the biggest issues and our product line is very strong. Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, stunning numbers that we're getting and well on track with Meteor Lake. All of that said, obviously, you have to make some assumptions as you build a factory network, and in the range that we gave has a lot of room inside of it.
And as we're demonstrating by the near-term cost cutting, that Dave described, we're trying to build flexibility into our factory network even as we adjust the cost structure, which is largely a fixed cost structure. And obviously, as we're ramping into the next-generation products, we're building into our Intel 4 and 3 product lines and the costs associated with that even as we balance both the near term and the strategic agenda. So we feel like we're well-positioned to manage and thick or thin. And against that, with a strong product line, we believe we're a share gainer in this industry, and we're going to be quite aggressive to accomplish exactly that.
John Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
Vivek, do you have a quick follow-on?
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Yes. Thanks, John. So maybe, Pat, just following on to that. Do you think you are shipping to demand on the PC side? Or do you still think there is a channel inventory because as we head into Q1, that is often a seasonally softer period, but again, compares are very different this year.
So I was just hoping to get your perspective on what the supply demand balance is in the PC market as it exists kind of real time? Thank you.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Yeah. Our belief is that we ship below consumption levels. So our -- in other words, inventory levels at the OEM and in the channels decreased over the last quarter.
They didn't decrease as far as we were originally predicting. So consumption was a little bit weaker, but we still saw inventories systematically going down across the various routes to market throughout the quarter. We expect them to continue to go down next quarter at both the OEMs and at the channel level. And the numbers I gave on the TAM model would be our consumption models for next year, which are below the consumption models of this year.
So a somewhat smaller number for next year but not dramatically different as we already said. So overall, I think we're getting to a better point of supply demand equilibrium where we were way behind on demand and supply for many, many quarters in a row. Clearly, the last couple of quarters have been adjusting of inventory levels and we think that we're going to be in a better supply demand balance situation as we go into next year.
John Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks, Vivek. Jonathan, could we have the next question, please?
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Your question, please.
Pierre Ferragu -- New Street Research -- Analyst
Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I'd love to talk a bit about like the very ambitious like efficiency plan you heard you've announced.
And first, I'd like to understand the timing of it. The performance of Intel has been challenged in the last six months. Should we read that as a very reactive plan and you're basically --[Technical difficulty]
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
Pierre, are you still on?
John Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
Operator, I think we lost Pierre.
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
I can answer as long as we're still on. OK. Just make sure we're live.
Operator
Yes, you are.
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
OK. Thank you. So thanks for the question, Pierre. Yes.
So keep in mind, as we look at this $8 billion to $10 billion of efficiency gains that we're talking about, we're actually making a pretty meaningful down pain on those efficiency gains in 2023. We expect to get $3 billion of savings from -- versus '22 in '23. And keep in mind, actually, we have some fixed expenses that come on next year. So the cash savings is actually more like $5 billion of savings next year.
Now as it relates to the $8 billion to $10 billion, we think as we exit the 2025 period will roughly be in that $8 billion to $12 billion -- or $8 billion to $10 billion range. And as Pat kind of walked through, we just think we've already identified a lot of different efficiencies that will get us to this $8 billion. But also, as we start to manage the business in this internal foundry model, we think we'll find and cover a lot more opportunities to drive efficiency and savings. So we'll update you as we progress over the course of the next three years and let you know how we're doing in terms of our progress, but we have very good line of sight on the first $3 billion and pretty good line of sight on the full $8 billion to $10 billion.
John Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
Jonathan, could we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Great. Thank you. I want to come back to the internal foundry model again. Can you talk about -- it's very clear how it makes your foundry business better.
From the standpoint of the CPU business back when you guys were on top in process, there was a pretty clear indication that it was the alignment of the device business with the fab that was kind of creating this really good outcome. Is there any trade-off that you make with this from the standpoint, looking at it from the standpoint of the microprocessor part of the business?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Joe, and I'll start on that one. The simple answer is our job is to keep that One Intel synergy. And when I describe the three value vectors that I'm expecting to continue to really leverage around this technology collaboration, co-optimization of the microprocessor with the process technology is one that's high on that list.
And we've made a lot of -- actually quite a lot of progress since I've been back driving that. And we're really seeing the benefits of that. And for instance, the great health that we described on Granite Rapids as an example about the momentum that we're seeing from Meteor Lake, there were clear examples. So I do believe that we're well underway at keeping that rich cycle of technical collaboration and co-optimization.
But there's been many of these areas that I described that there hasn't been this intense accountability. Steppings were done too easily and without the quality A stepping. And some of that came through our stumbles as you went with 14 and 10 nanometers, but we lost the discipline of the understanding of what steppings cost and not just in the fab but also in the validation cycle. So we have to bring much more accountability and transparency to that.
Also, we expedited all the time. While expedites are a good thing when you're bringing a new product to marketplace, but they also create fab in efficiencies, and the results of that are we're not being accountable for the fab efficiencies. Otherwise, our margins will be markedly higher than they are today. So to me, it's really maintaining the good things and the three I described, the technology benefits, balance sheet capital and the supply chain while driving a lot more transparency, automation, efficiency and the result will be, I believe, is a much better Intel for the long term, not just for the external foundry customers, as you suggest, but for my internal customers as well.
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
I would just add that we have six business units today. We measure them separately, but they actually do a very good job. In a lot of cases, they need to pull together to engage with customers, to develop products and so forth. And so I think we have a pretty good process and culture within Intel, where we can strike the right balance between creating some transparency and accountability for the internal foundry business, but also make sure that they're aligned to the overall Intel goals.
John Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
Joe, do you have a quick follow-up?
Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Yeah, I do. And thank you for that. That's very helpful. In terms of the accounting in 2024 around this internal foundry structure, is the goal there to sort of have a transfer price between the foundry business and the rest of it, that kind of reflects the market price? Or just how -- it seems like the accounting of how you're going to determine where the profits could get tricky.
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, it's a good question. That's pretty much what we're thinking. I mean, we will have our own foundry business. So we'll have a good sense, I think, of the market.
And so that's how we'll approach it. I would say in '23 it's going to be a somewhat light touch. We'll do this through mostly kind of spreadsheet-oriented analytics. Eventually, we -- and Pat's been pretty vocal on this.
We want to create more automation, systemization of everything that we're doing between the foundry and the product. So over time, this will get more robust. And ergo, we'll be able to drive more accountability, I think, as we progress through --
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And just to add on to that a little bit, Joe. Here, this is a case where our internal processes and systems were optimized for IDM 1.0, right? We weren't having to say what is a sustainable wafer price that we should be designing against. And we were having a wafer cost view, right, which early in a process life is very high, right? And then it gets to mature, and how do design teams pick the right choice when you have such variability, whereas the foundry model gives a much more predictable wafer pricing that then enables a more efficient business unit model to pick the right technology choices to deliver the best products.
So that's just one example that we're finding that we're not making the best decisions today, and this will allow us to hold the manufacturing teams to be entirely accountable. You've given a price hit the defects, you hit the cost structures associated with it and the business units, you have a wafer cost and go build the best product against that and ramp it like crazy in the industry. And obviously, presenting those with clarity will help you as the Street understand the progress we're making to accomplish that.
John Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Joe. Jonathan, could we have the next question, please?
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.
C.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. And one more question on your Intel foundry strategy. It makes perfect sense to me around the discipline and cost that you're looking to achieve here.
But if I'm a business unit head, and you've been pretty clear that you're playing catch up five node migrations over the next four years. If I'm a business unit head over the next two years, why would I not outsource completely? So I guess what are the guardrails to ensure that you're keeping capacity internally until you achieve the goals that you've set out for 2025?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Maybe three different perspectives on that C.J. Obviously, most of the design decisions that are being made by my product teams now are '25, '26, '27 decisions when we're back to process leadership, right? And they're seeing that progress day to day. And just as I said, hey, if you want to design the best product, have the best transistor.
So they're with the capability to look now at the Intel leadership process technologies as they make those decisions. Also, secondly, as I described, this is a tight binding and we're going to maintain that tight binding of optimization and co-optimization for relationships that are decades old between our teams, by bringing in a new discipline to the boundary between them. And the third answer is we already use external foundries. This is a process that's already pretty well established, and we're using a range of external foundries.
Our design teams over the last five years or so have learned how to use external foundries. And the fact is they're interacting now with my internal foundry, many of those learnings on expectations of PDKs, design tools, IP libraries are driving the expectations for what is required to be a good internal foundry, which will make my internal foundry a better external foundry as well. So I see this as a very regenerative cycle as we unleash these energies. And ultimately, I'm the CEO across both, and we'll be making good decisions to hold both of them accountable even as we clarify the interfaces and the efficiencies between them.
John Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
C.J., do you have a quick follow-up?
C.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Yeah. Thanks, John. I guess, Dave, as you think about the strategy, how does it change capital intensity for the business, not into '23, but perhaps say, over the next five years? Is it still that 35% type of number? Or how should we be thinking about it? Thank you.
Dave Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Good question, C.J. So obviously, in this investment phase where we're catching up on node transitions, what we do, we will have a higher capex intensity, this 35%. But we do expect, as we get out of this phase, to be back down to a more normalized level of about 25% capex intensity.
So there definitely will be an evolution and adjustment. And that's one of the key components of allowing us to kick up our free cash flow to this 20% of revenue level that is ultimately the model.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And also just piling on to that, we also look -- we always look at that through the lens of our smart capital strategy, where clearly, we're viewing both the gross capex, but more importantly, the net capex from your perspective and how we access other pools of capital to be able to build that out in a very financially prudent way and those other approaches, EU, U.S. Chips Act, ITC skip give us a lot of flexibility, combined with the shell first strategy to be able to make sure we're spending the capital, the more expensive equipment capital, more timed with the market demand clarity.
John Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, C.J. Jonathan, could we have the next caller, please?
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your question, please.
Mark Lipacis -- Jefferies -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Pat, maybe for you, despite all the consolidation in the industry and the growth that Intel has seen and the larger foundries have seen, the capital intensity continued to seem to have moved higher, notwithstanding your hope that -- or expectations that it's going to come back down again. So given the high levels, you can make the argument that the industry actually needs even more consolidation than it has already seen at the level of the -- some of the biggest players in the industry.
Can you share your thoughts on how you think about the potential for this large scale -- this kind of large-scale M&A or maybe joint ventures among the class of the leading-edge players? Or are they just -- are there issues like FTC-related or national security-related that just means that thinking about that kind of consolidation or joint ventures across borders is something that just takes it off the table and maybe it's a different analysis for consolidation versus joint ventures? Thank you.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, there's a lot packed into that question. And I would just say, I mean, I generally said that, hey, we see this industry being a consolidating industry over time, particularly on the manufacturing side because of the extreme capital intensity, but also the incredible R&D costs, right? If you think -- if you want to have a world-class technology development team, all you have to do is spend $5 billion a year in R& D and do that for 30 years, right? Now you're OK. Now you're world class, right? And these are just extraordinary long-term investments that you have to build up and operate this way. And against that, I've consistently said I expect that there will be further consolidations in the industry going forward.
Now what shape those will take, what the timing of those will be, what will be the trigger points that would position such moves, and as you said, there's many factors associated with that in terms of regulatory, legal, financial steps associated with it. But fundamentally, economics 101, right, would say you will see further consolidations into the future, and we believe that will be the case. And we would expect to be a consolidator in that process over time.
John Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
Mark, do you have a quick follow-on?
Mark Lipacis -- Jefferies -- Analyst
No, that was good. Thank you, John. And thanks for that answer, Pat.
John Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
Perfect. Jonathan, I think we've got time for one last question.
Operator
Certainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your question, please.
Matt Ramsay -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Thank you very much, John, for squeezing me in. Pat, I wanted to ask a question about the server road map. We've got some, I think, relief from some of the commentary for cloud capex during this earnings season in the last three days and particularly from Meta last night, but the rest of the big guys as well. But on the flip side, there's some rumblings that maybe there's a couple of more months before Sapphire Rapids might ramp in big volumes.
So I'm just -- maybe if you could help and level set us on the timing of big cloud volume of Sapphire Rapids and how that now dovetails in with the timing. It seems like you're keeping for Emerald Rapids in late '23. Thanks.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thank you. And as I indicated, Sapphire Rapids is now peer queued and the ramp is underway. We are ramping the product as we speak, strong customer demand.
We expect this will be our fastest ever, Xeon to 1 million units, and we're going to push that quite aggressively, and the factories are ramping up as we speak. Obviously, this is good news for that business competitively, a big ASP uptick as well on the product. So lots of good things come. Also, we had a particularly good quarter on the execution front, not just Sapphire Rapids PRQ but great health on Granite Rapids, Emerald Rapids looking very good, Sierra Forest.
So the next three generation products are all making very good milestones, and I really feel like the worst of our execution is behind us. And we're really starting to see some enthusiasm, momentum, excitement building in those teams as they turn the corner on these products. We do think, as I said in the formal -- that the market is softer, right, on the enterprise side and somewhat on the cloud side as you reinforced by some of the other comments from others. That said, as we ramp these products, it's all about having the best product to gain share, to gain ASP, to improve the margins of the business.
And we now feel like our portfolio is taking share or taking shape to accomplish exactly that. And we're going to be aggressive. We're going to fight for every socket. This is a game where we have to reestablish ourselves in the marketplace.
And now we're starting to have the product line to do that. And that's exactly what you'll see. In addition to that, we're also building out our software assets to have an increased value proposition. And one of those is, for instance, with Sierra.
Sapphire Rapids is the market improvements in AI, but even more importantly, in security. And with our security services and capabilities, very differentiated areas like confidential computing are gaining quite a lot of interest in the industry for not just enterprise, but cloud customers as well. So a lot of things going on there. But overall, we feel like our momentum is being reestablished in this critical, critical area of our business and one that we know has a lot of attention from you all in the community.
John Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
Matt, do you have a quick follow-on?
Matt Ramsay -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Yeah, John. Thank you. And thanks for that, Pat. One thing that piqued my interest, Pat, in your prepared script was -- I mean there's a lot of discussion of the five nodes in four years and halfway through that transition is 20A with RibbonFET or gate all around.
So you guys are going to need to go through that jump. Your competition as well. And you mentioned, I think, some tape-outs of your own stuff but also some tape-outs of potential external foundry customers on 20A that seemed, I don't know, from the language used, kind of meaningful. So if you could give us a status report there on sort of the gate all-around RibbonFET progress you see versus competition? And is this external customer really significant? Thank you.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thank you. And on 20A and 18A, they go to RibbonFET, as you say. And Intel has driven every major transistor, right, in the volume production for the last 35 years.
So the idea that we're the ones who are going to drive this major new transistor structure into production is something that we're pretty committed to be a driver for 20A, as you said, on track, on schedule. We expect 20A will primarily be an internal node, not one that we have a lot of external foundry customers for the external foundry chipset or tape-outs are largely associated with 18A. And a very typical process for a foundry customer will be give me a test chip of my circuits on your process. and that's exactly what we take out.
The first one this quarter. We'll have several more in the pipeline. So now we're taking out not only our test chips for 18A, but our foundry customer test chips for 18A, and that's a pretty critical milestone when they see the results of the silicon for them making a volume decision for a foundry customer. So we're exactly on the time line that I described earlier for those tape-outs and those decisions.
So as they start to see the silicon results, which we think are going to be very promising we think that will be a key step to them making major foundry decisions. And overall, this just affirms our five nodes in four years. We're making the investments. We're seeing good progress to get back to process technology leadership, which for Intel is a tide that raises all boats in the company.
It makes our products better. It establishes our new business areas, positions us in a very profound way for foundry [Technical difficulty] economic environment. Macro, very challenged, but we're happy with the execution progress we made even though we're not happy with the reported results. And we know we have a lot more work to do there.
It was also thrilling to participate with the Mobileye IPO in a tough market with very good results. We're prepared for the economic headwinds. We're making the necessary adjustments structurally, as well as through our cost model to go through them. And we remain fully committed to being a value generator for our shareholders for the long term as we execute our 2.0.
We believe that that will be a great result for our owners for the long term. Thank you for joining us for the call today and look forward to our update next quarter.

2022-10-27 00:00:00+00:00,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares slip, yen steady ahead of Bank of Japan meeting",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/global-markets-asian-shares-slip-yen-steady-ahead-of-bank-of-japan-meeting,,,"By Ankur Banerjee
SINGAPORE, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Asian equities edged lower on Friday as investors grappled with mixed earnings reports, while the Japanese yen held firm ahead of the Bank of Japan's policy review.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was down 0.32%, set to snap a three-day winning streak. The index is down nearly 3% for the month and 30% for the year.
Japan's Nikkei .N225 fell 1.33%, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index .AXJO lost 0.55%. China's stock market .SSEC was 0.60% lower, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index .HSI down 0.5%.
China stocks have had a rough week, with investors reeling from Monday's brutal sell-off. Bleak industrial profit figure and widening COVID-19 outbreaks have also weighed on sentiment.
On Thursday, the European Central Bank raised interest rates again, but said ""substantial"" progress had already been made in its bid to fight off a surge in inflation.
The less hawkish comments from the ECB added to expectations that central banks are likely to slow their pace of rate hikes, especially after the Bank of Canada surprised the market by delivering a smaller-than-anticipated rate hike on Wednesday.
Rodrigo Catril, senior currency strategist at National Australia Bank, said the ECB delivered a 75 bps hike as expected, but it sounded less committal on future rate hikes.
Rates markets are cheering the idea of a potential slow down from central banks in terms of the pace of interest rate hikes, Catril added.
The focus now shifts to the monetary policy decision due on Friday from the Bank of Japan, the holdout ""dove"" among the world's major central banks, along with and Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's post-meeting briefing.
The central bank is set to keep ultra-low interest rates and remind markets it will remain a dovish outlier among a wave of central banks tightening monetary policy.
Core consumer inflation in Japan's capital Tokyo, considered a leading indicator of nationwide figures, hit a 33-year high of 3.4% in October, data showed on Friday. Inflation in the Tokyo area thus exceeded the central bank's 2% target for five straight months.
""We don't think this morning's much faster rate of inflation will change the BOJ's policy decision today,"" ING economists said in a note, adding Japan's central bank takes a different view than the ECB.
""If inflation is not driven by demand-side factors, they will not change the easy policy stance and it seems like they believe this will maintain their credibility.""
The BOJ's ultra-easy policy has helped trigger sharp yen JPY=EBS declines that inflate the cost of importing already expensive fuel and raw material, prompting the government to intervene in the market to prop up the currency.
The yen last bought 146.47 per dollar, and was on track for a nearly 1% weekly gain, its largest since August. /FRX
The euro EUR=EBS was up 0.18% at $0.998, following a more than 1% slide overnight, after the dovish tone from ECB.
The U.S. dollar index =USD, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 0.1%, after gaining nearly 0.8% overnight.
Meanwhile, Amazon.comAMZN.O predicted a slowdown in sales growth for the holiday season, while IntelINTC.O cut its full-year profit and revenue forecast, stoking more fears of an economic slowdown.
The downbeat results from Amazon on Thursday added to a string of dismal reports from Big Tech companies, with over $200 billion in U.S. stock market value up in smoke in extended trade on the day. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 EScv1 fell 0.33%.
Brent crude LCOc1 futures came off 42 cents, or 0.4%, to $96.54 a barrel at 0043 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures were down 56 cents, or 0.6%, at $88.52 a barrel.

2022-10-27 00:00:00+00:00,Tech giants feel pain as cloud spending cuts suggest slowdown,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tech-giants-feel-pain-as-cloud-spending-cuts-suggest-slowdown,,,"By Tiyashi Datta, Jane Lanhee Lee and Chavi Mehta
Oct 27 (Reuters) - In a further sign that large companies may be girding against an imminent recession, U.S. tech giants Amazon.com AMZN.O, Microsoft MSFT.O and Intel INTC.O said this week that customers were taking an axe to cloud and datacenter spending.
Cloud services for years has been one of the largest and most dependable sources of growth for some of the biggest tech companies, including during the pandemic as people worked and studied from home.
Now investors are looking to see whether there is a glut in capacity that will lead to investment cuts as companies deal with rising costs amid soaring inflation, while interest rate increases have squeezed consumer demand. The strong dollar has been a particular headwind.
Growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS), the firm's lucrative cloud unit serving enterprises, has ticked down consistently in the past four quarters, adjusted for changes in forex.
Net sales in the business grew 28% in the July-September period versus 39% a year earlier, the slowest since the fourth quarter of 2020. They fell short of a 31% average analysts' forecast.
Amazon shares slumped 12% after the bell on Thursday after it forecast a slowdown in sales growth for the holiday season, erasing some $140 billion from its market value and capping a week of dismal earnings from global tech firms.
""The AWS slowdown is a clear sign that businesses are beginning to trim costs, so this will likely put more of a squeeze on Amazon's bottom line in the coming quarters,"" said Andrew Lipsman, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.
Microsoft's cloud business Azure, which had supercharged revenue growth at the software giant for years, dropped to 35% growth in the July-September quarter from 50% a year earlier, missing estimates of a 36.5% increase according to Visible Alpha.
The company projected another drop in the holiday quarter.
Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue grew 38% in the quarter, beating estimates. That was a silver lining in an otherwise gloomy quarter but a far cry from the 45% growth the company posted a year earlier.
EUROPE, CHINA DRAG
Speaking broadly about cloud deployments from AWS, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL.O, YipitData research specialist Matt Wegner said: ""We really first started to see (a slowdown) in April ... and it's continued. The European region is a source of weakness.""
Eurozone inflation is close to 10% and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Thursday acknowledged that the risk of an economic contraction is on the rise due to soaring energy prices and higher interest rates.
Intel, which makes chips for data center customers including AWS, said third-quarter revenue from that business slumped 27% and profits were nearly wiped out. The business was hurt partly due to soft demand from Chinese enterprise customers, Intel boss Pat Gelsinger said.
The company cut its profit and revenue forecast for the year, reflecting economic uncertainty that Gelsinger said he expected to last into next year and that it was taking time to ramp up sales into datacenters.
Cloud services typically help companies save money so budget cuts in this sector could be especially worrying, indicating that companies think cost is king going into tougher times.
Businesses usually build out more cloud and datacenter capacity than needed and then wait for it to be absorbed, said Dean McCarron, president of Mercury Research, which tracks chipmakers.
""The ""build more"" happened in 2021 and we've been coasting down since then,"" said McCarron. He added that he expects Intel's datacenter weakness to be bottoming soon ""though there are larger macroeconomic concerns about how much improvement we might see on the next growth cycle.""

Updates with stock moves after the bell
By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted losses on Thursday, as investors contended with solid economic data and a mixed bag of corporate earnings.
The price-weighted Dow advanced, held aloft by industrials .SPLRCI, while weakness in market-moving tech and tech-adjacent megacaps depressed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in the wake of downbeat quarterly results and dour guidance.
""It’s very much a bifurcated market, a tale of two cities,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist Ingalls & Snyder in New York.
""There's lot of pressure on tech and tech-plus names, higher growth names,"" Ghriskey added. ""On the flipside you’re seeing a lot of strength in other sectors, in particular consumer staples, energy, financials, industrials and utilities.""
After the bell, Amazon AMZN.O slumped 12%, erasing over $100 billion of its stock market value after the retail and tech heavyweight forecast a slowdown in sales growth for the holiday season, disappointing Wall Street and warning that inflation-wary consumers and businesses had less money to spend.
That sent S&P 500 futures EScv1 down 0.5% and Nasdaq futures NQcv1 down 0.6%, showing traders expect Wall Street to open lower on Friday.
During Thursday's trading session, Meta Platforms META.O plunged 24.6% after the Facebook parent followed the trend set by Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O by providing gloomy forward guidance.
But heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc CAT.Nreported better-than-expected quarterly profit, sending its shares jumping 7.7% and providing the most muscle to the Dow's advance.
A third-quarter GDP reading showing the U.S. economy returned to growth in the July-Sept period, along with steady quarterly core inflation helped take the sting out of earnings.
Investors continue to scan the economic horizon for evidence that the barrage of aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, begun in March, are beginning to have the desired effect by cooling down the economy.
While a 75 basis point rate hike at the conclusion of its Nov. 1-2 policy meeting is all but assured, the likelihood of a smaller, 50 basis point hike in December was 55%, according to CME's FedWatch tool.
""The overriding theme is really the Fed. The Fed is going to control the direction of this market over the coming months,"" Ghriskey added.
At Thursday's close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 194.17 points, or 0.61%, to 32,033.28, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 23.3 points, or 0.61%, to 3,807.3 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 178.32 points, or 1.63%, to 10,792.68.
Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, industrials had the biggest percentage gain, with communication services .SPLRCL, weighed by Meta, down the most.
Third-quarter reporting season forges ahead at full speed, with 227 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 74% have beaten consensus estimates.
Analysts now see aggregate S&P earnings growth of 2.5%, down from 4.5% at the beginning of October.
""In general we’ve seen earnings come in at or slightly above expectations,"" Ghriskey said. ""But those expectations have been lowered throughout the quarter.""
McDonald's Corp MCD.N gained 3.3% after the fast food chain beat quarterly same-store sales estimates.
Also after the bell, Intel INTC.O rallied 5% after the chipmaker cut its full-year profit and revenue forecast and said it was targeting $3 billion in cost reductions in 2023.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.10-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 119 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.36 billion shares, compared with the 11.59 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

2022-10-27 00:00:00+00:00,"AAPL, PINS Beat; AMZN, INTC Mixed but Down",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/aapl-pins-beat-amzn-intc-mixed-but-down,,,"Our recent bifurcation among major market indices was apparent once again today, with the Dow +198 points on the day, +0.62%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq -178 points, -1.63%. The S&P 500, which includes blue-chip stocks and plenty of tech, split the difference, -0.59%. The small-cap Russell 2000 once again looked to be out of the earnings-disappointment fray, +0.11% on the day.

Apple AAPL has released its fiscal Q4 earnings results after Thursday’s close, outperforming estimates on both sales and earnings. Its $1.29 per share was 3 cents better than expected on $90.15 billion in revenues, which surpassed the $88.47 billion consensus estimate. Yet shares are trading down on the news, possibly due to disappointing iPhone 14 Pro sales relative to expectations.

While iPhone sales overall were up +10% year over year, the $42.63 billion reported was light of the estimated $43.2 billion. Supply and demand issues — which appear to be alleviated to a certain extent across the industry — are apparently still prevalent at Apple. Not only that, but Services came in below expectations as well: $19.19 billion came up short of the estimated $20.1 billion, likely due to a -2% drop in the App Store. All that said, however, gross margins at Apple slightly outpaced expectations to 42.3%.

Amazon AMZN is getting crushed in today’s after-market following its Q3 results this afternoon. While earnings of 28 cents per share beat the Zacks consensus by 5 cents — partially due to its $1.1 billion gain from its investment in Rivian RIVN — while coming up light on top-line revenues of $127.1 billion, versus $127.9 billion expected. AWS cloud services came in light of +30% for the first time in at least 6 quarters, to +28%.

But what really appears to be hammering at Amazon shares — now -18% in late trading as I type this — is the holiday quarter guidance coming in well below expectations: a range of $140-148 billion is expected for Q4, not even close to the $157 billion in the Zacks consensus. We expect the Zacks Rank for this current #3 (Hold)-rated stock to hit the skids in the coming days.

Intel INTC was mixed in its Q3 earnings report after the bell today, posting earnings of 59 cents per share easily surpassing the 34 cents expected while revenues of $15.34 billion in the quarter clearly missed the $15.49 billion analysts were looking for. Intel also lowered both next-quarter and full-year sales guidance — to a range of $14-15 billion and $63-64 billion, respectively, from a Zacks consensus of $16.5 billion and $65.7 billion, respectively. Shares are up 7% in late trading, however, perhaps on the notice that Intel will be cutting costs by $3 billion in 2023.

Pinterest PINS put up surprisingly good numbers this afternoon on both top and bottom lines: earnings of 11 cents per share more than doubled the 5 cents anticipated, on sales of $684.6 million which outpaced the Zacks consensus $665 million. Monthly and Daily Active Users (MAU, DAU) both came in higher than expected, as did Average Revenue per User (ARPU). Shares are trading up +12% in the after market, but still down more than -25% year to date.

This Little-Known Semiconductor Stock Could Be Your Portfolio’s Hedge Against Inflation

Shockwaves to the international supply chain from the global pandemic have unearthed a tremendous opportunity for investors.

Oct 27 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O on Thursday cut its 2022 revenue forecast for the second time this year as a slump in PC demand looks set to worsen and recession fears muddy the outlook for the data center market.
Surging inflation has prompted consumers to rethink buying computers and other gadgets, forcing electronics companies to cancel orders for components such as chips as they struggle to clear inventory.
PC shipments fell 15.5% in the third quarter, data from Counterpoint Research showed. The research firm expects a 13% drop for the full year, higher than Intel's estimate of a roughly 10% decline.
Chipmakers have also come under pressure from concerns that the threat of a global recession could prompt clients from the more lucrative data center market to wind down spending.
Net income for the third quarter ended Oct. 1 was $1.02 billion, or 25 cents per share, compared with a profit of $6.82 billion, or $1.67 per share, a year earlier
The company now expects annual revenue of about $63 billion to $64 billion, compared with $65 billion to $68 billion estimated earlier. Its original forecast was for about $76 billion.
Analysts on average expect annual revenue of $65.26 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

2022-10-27 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) Beats Q3 Earnings Estimates,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-beats-q3-earnings-estimates,,,"Intel (INTC) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.59 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.34 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.71 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 73.53%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this world's largest chipmaker would post earnings of $0.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.29, delivering a surprise of -57.97%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.
Intel, which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, posted revenues of $15.34 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.99%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $19.19 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Intel shares have lost about 47.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -19.6%.
What's Next for Intel?
While Intel has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Intel: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.69 on $16.49 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.19 on $65.66 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor - General is currently in the bottom 27% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
Amtech Systems (ASYS), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022.
This provider of equipment for solar panel and semiconductor makers is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -80%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
Amtech Systems' revenues are expected to be $30 million, up 23.3% from the year-ago quarter.

BERLIN, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE plans to expand its cooperation with Intel's Mobileye MBLY.O to include its automated driving program after Wednesday's decision to no longer invest in self-driving startup Argo AI, two sources familiar with the plan told Reuters on Thursday.
Mobileye, which develops autonomous driving technologies, already cooperates with VW's software unit Cariad.
""If you have obtained good results with one partner, it makes sense to work with them in other fields as well,"" said one of the sources.
Volkswagen declined to comment.
Volkswagen's and Ford Motor's F.N exit from Argo came after three years of joint efforts on the development of automated driving systems and investments of more than $3 billion, highlighting the cost pressure automakers face in that field.
While Ford took a $2.7 billion non-cash pre-tax impairment on Argo, VW might have to write down more than one billion euros ($1.00 billion), a source familiar with the company said.
Israel-based Mobileye went public this week, being valued at more than $20 billion. Chief Communications Officer Dan Galves said earlier this week that based on its design wins with automakers, the company's assisted driving systems would be deployed in 270 million cars by 2030.

2022-10-27 00:00:00+00:00,Where Will Intel Stock Be in 5 Years?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-will-intel-stock-be-in-5-years,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) stock has lost nearly half of its value in 2022 amid the broader market sell-off and the headwinds arising out of a slowdown in the personal computer (PC) space. It also lost market share to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). A closer look indicates that the chip giant is a perennial underperformer on the market.
Shares of Chipzilla are down 33% in the past five years. The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index gained 47% over the same time. Can Chipzilla turn its fortunes around in the next five years and become a stock market winner? Let's find out.
Intel's road to recovery is going to be bumpy
At its investor meeting in February 2022, Intel management pointed out that the company expects to achieve revenue growth in the mid- to high-single digits in 2023 and between 10% and 12% in 2026. However, achieving that seems like a tall order right now.
For instance, Intel was originally expecting to finish 2022 with $76 billion in revenue and $3.50 per share in earnings. But it was forced in July to reduce its guidance to a range of $65 billion to $68 billion, thanks to the shrinking PC market and the competition in data centers from AMD.
Analysts expect the results to be even worse. Consensus estimates suggest that Intel could exit 2022 with $65.5 billion in revenue, a drop of 12% over the prior year. Its earnings could drop to $2.17 per share from $5.47 per share in the prior-year period. The bad news is that Intel's top and bottom lines could remain under pressure for the next year or so.
CEO Pat Gelsinger indicated last month that Intel's data center business would grow at a slower pace than the broader market in 2023, which means that the company is on track to lose market share to AMD. Gelsinger expects Intel to start regaining data center market share from 2025 onward.
AMD controlled 13.9% share of the data center processor market in the second quarter of 2022, gaining 4.4 percentage points over the prior year. Intel held the rest of the market, but AMD has been consistently gaining share in the server-processor space, thanks to its technology advantage and Chipzilla's execution issues. And now that Intel has delayed its latest Sapphire Rapids data center processors (they won't hit the market until 2023), AMD could continue to win more share of this space.
Meanwhile, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) presents another challenge for Intel in the data center space with the launch of its Grace server processors next year. In May 2022, Nvidia announced that the likes of Asus, Foxconn, Gigabyte, QCT, and Supermicro will start offering server systems based on the Grace chips in the first half of 2023.
Nvidia claims the Grace CPU Superchip will be the fastest among its peers when it hits the market next year. While that claim remains to be independently tested, Intel will have more competition in the data center processor market that it's been dominating for a long time with Nvidia's foray into this space.
Regarding the client processor market that produces half of Intel's revenue and witnessed a 25% year-over-year drop in revenue last quarter, shrinking PC sales and market-share losses will continue to pose challenges for the company. IDC estimates that PC sales will decline in 2023 and the market could return to growth in 2024.
The long-term picture doesn't appear to be too bright, either. IDC estimates that the global personal-computing device market could clock annual growth of just 0.8% through 2026.
Throw in Intel's alarming share loss in the client processor market to AMD, and it's difficult to see a turnaround in Intel's largest business over the next five years. AMD was sitting on 20.6% of the desktop CPU (central processing unit) market at the end of the second quarter of 2022, while its share in notebook processors was almost 25%. Given that AMD has a solid product roadmap in the client CPU space that could help it widen the technology gap over Intel in the future, the latter may find it difficult to regain its mojo.
The chip giant doesn't look like a lucrative investment
Intel may find it difficult to hit its long-term growth targets and deliver the revenue growth it's anticipating in 2026. Analysts aren't upbeat about the company's prospects, either, projecting nearly no bottom-line growth for the next five years.
That's not surprising, given the stiff competition Intel is facing from AMD and the new threat that would arrive from Nvidia in 2023. Additionally, the slow pace of growth in the PC market isn't going to help Intel step on the gas.
All this indicates that Intel may continue to underperform the stock market over the next five years, as well. Investors looking to buy a semiconductor stock for the long run may want to look somewhere else as Chipzilla needs to pull up its socks big time to fight the multiple headwinds it's facing.

Reuters


NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - There’s nothing quite like setting low expectations. Doing so helped Mobileye price its shares a bit above their indicated range, at $21 apiece, and spark a 38% jump in their market debut on Wednesday. The maker of components for driver-assistance systems, its parent company Intel and two dozen underwriters slashed the original valuation target from $50 billion down to about the same $15 billion the chipmaker originally paid to buy the company five years ago.
After a long drought in initial public offerings, Mobileye’s deal provides a glimmer of hope for new stock sales. It’s unlikely to clear the way for many more, however, at least not anytime soon. Although Mobileye is unprofitable, its top line grew 41% in the three months ending July 2 compared to approximately the same stretch a year earlier. Autonomous driving also is further away than many in the industry predicted, but vision technology nevertheless remains essential for carmakers. Many other startups lack the same promise.
Only stronger companies manage to go public at all amid volatile markets and shaky economic conditions. Even so, Intel’s bad timing and clear-eyed view on investors cost it a wad of cash it could use. And despite briefly cracking open the IPO market, the deal failed to win Intel any additional credit. Its shares dipped slightly on the day. (By Jeffrey Goldfarb)
