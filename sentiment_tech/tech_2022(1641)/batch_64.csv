Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-03-14 00:00:00+00:00,Should iShares Russell MidCap ETF (IWR) Be on Your Investing Radar?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-ishares-russell-midcap-etf-iwr-be-on-your-investing-radar-1,,,"Launched on 07/17/2001, the iShares Russell MidCap ETF (IWR) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $28.04 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
Why Mid Cap Blend
Mid cap companies, with market capitalization in the range of $2 billion and $10 billion, offer investors many things that small and large companies don't, including less risk and higher growth opportunities. Thus they have a nice balance of growth potential and stability.
Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.
Costs
Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.19%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.19%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 17.30% of the portfolio. Industrials and Financials round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Dexcom Inc (DXCM) accounts for about 0.51% of total assets, followed by Idexx Laboratories Inc (IDXX) and Marvell Technology Inc (MRVL).
Performance and Risk
IWR seeks to match the performance of the Russell MidCap Index before fees and expenses. The Russell Midcap Index measures the performance of the mid-capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market.
The ETF has lost about -11.66% so far this year and is down about -0.69% in the last one year (as of 03/14/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $72.29 and $85.28.
The ETF has a beta of 1.10 and standard deviation of 24.88% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 834 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
IShares Russell MidCap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, IWR is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.
The Vanguard MidCap ETF (VO) and the iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF (IJH) track a similar index. While Vanguard MidCap ETF has $50.89 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF has $62.89 billion. VO has an expense ratio of 0.04% and IJH charges 0.05%.
Bottom-Line
While an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.

2022-03-12 00:00:00+00:00,Best Stocks To Buy Now? 3 Semiconductor Stocks For Your March 2022 List,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/best-stocks-to-buy-now-3-semiconductor-stocks-for-your-march-2022-list,,,"Are These The Top Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In Today?
Even with inflation concerns chugging along, many would agree that semiconductor stocks remain relevant in thestock market today After all, semiconductor chips are essentially the brains behind most of the tech surrounding us today. Not to mention, there is also the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips. The likes of which remain in demand across consumer and professional markets. As such, at a time where semiconductor stocks continue to recover from year-to-date losses, investors could be eyeing the industry.
For one thing, some of the biggest names in the space are not sitting idly by amidst all this as well. Take Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) for example. Yesterday, the company released its monthly revenue report. For the month, TSM reported a revenue of about $5.18 billion. This would mark a sizable 37.9% year-over-year increase for the company. On a year-to-date basis, TSM is seeing a 36.8% year-over-year jump in overall revenue so far. While all this is great, the company does not plan to slow down in the least bit on the operational end. As it stands, TSM is planning to invest up to $44 billion toward boosting manufacturing capacity and its workforce.
Likewise, other semiconductor firms like Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) remain hard at work expanding their portfolios. Namely, Qualcomm is now working with Chinese telco ZTE on end-to-end 5G time-sensitive networking (TSN) solutions for power grids. According to John Smee, SVP of Engineering at Qualcomm, open 5G TSN ecosystems such as this continue to benefit the industry. All in all, semiconductor chips are more in demand than ever and chip companies are upping their game accordingly. Could that make one of these semiconductor stocks top picks in the stock market now?

Marvell Technology Inc.
Another leading semiconductor industry player to know now would be Marvell Technology. In essence, the company specializes in making chips that serve to move, store, process, and secure data. Through Marvell’s semiconductors, organizations across a wide array of industries can move their information efficiently and safely. Among the company’s core end markets are the enterprise, cloud, automotive, industrial, and consumer spaces.
By and large, seeing as we live in the age of information, there would be plenty of use cases for Marvell’s offerings. This is evident from its latest quarterly earnings update. Last week, the company posted a record revenue of $1.34 billion for the quarter. In particular, this marks a solid 68.3% year-over-year jump in terms of revenue. According to CEO Matt Murphy, this is thanks to persistent revenue growth across all five of the company’s end markets.

Simply put, the tech serves to enable overall faster connectivity for switches used in cloud data centers. At the same time, Marvell also claims that the CPO platform accomplishes this while reducing power consumption.

2022-03-10 00:00:00+00:00,April 29th Options Now Available For Marvell Technology (MRVL),MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/april-29th-options-now-available-for-marvell-technology-mrvl,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options begin trading today, for the April 29th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new April 29th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $64.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.95. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $64.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $59.05 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $64.60/share today.
Because the $64.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.73% return on the cash commitment, or 56.51% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $64.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.05. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $64.60/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.44% if the stock gets called away at the April 29th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.82% boost of extra return to the investor, or 57.11% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $64.60) to be 46%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-03-10 00:00:00+00:00,Marvell Technology (MRVL) is a Top-Ranked Growth Stock: Should You Buy?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/marvell-technology-mrvl-is-a-top-ranked-growth-stock%3A-should-you-buy,,,"It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.
Featuring daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.
Zacks Premium also includes the Zacks Style Scores.
What are the Zacks Style Scores?
Developed alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.
Based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:
Value Score
Value investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.
Growth Score
While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.
Momentum Score
Momentum investors, who live by the saying ""the trend is your friend,"" are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.
VGM Score
If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank
The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.
Investors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.
This totals more than 800 top-rated stocks, and it can be overwhelming to try and pick the best stocks for you and your portfolio.
That's where the Style Scores come in.
To maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.
Since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.
For instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.
Stock to Watch: Marvell Technology (MRVL)
California-based Marvell Technology is a fabless designer, developer and marketer of analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits. The company operates in Bermuda, China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

2022-03-07 00:00:00+00:00,Should Vanguard MidCap Growth ETF (VOT) Be on Your Investing Radar?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-vanguard-midcap-growth-etf-vot-be-on-your-investing-radar-0,,,"Looking for broad exposure to the Mid Cap Growth segment of the US equity market? You should consider the Vanguard MidCap Growth ETF (VOT), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 08/17/2006.
The fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $10.61 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.
Why Mid Cap Growth
With market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion, mid cap companies usually contain higher growth prospects than large cap companies, and are considered less risky than their small cap counterparts. Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.
While growth stocks do boast higher than average sales and earnings growth rates, and they are expected to grow faster than the wider market, investors should note these kinds of stocks have higher valuations. Something to keep in mind is the higher level of volatility that is affiliated with growth stocks. When you consider growth versus value, growth stocks are usually the clear winner in strong bull markets but tend to fall flat in nearly all other environments.
Costs
When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.07%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.40%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 34.70% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Industrials round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Dexcom Inc. (DXCM) accounts for about 1.46% of total assets, followed by Marvell Technology Inc. (MRVL) and Msci Inc. (MSCI).
The top 10 holdings account for about 10.28% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
VOT seeks to match the performance of the CRSP U.S. Mid Cap Growth Index before fees and expenses. The CRSP U.S. Mid Cap Growth Index measures the investment return of mid-capitalization growth stocks.
The ETF has lost about -15.36% so far this year and it's up approximately 3.86% in the last one year (as of 03/07/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $204.75 and $265.79.
The ETF has a beta of 1.10 and standard deviation of 25.11% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 187 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
Vanguard MidCap Growth ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, VOT is a great option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Growth segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.
The iShares S&P MidCap 400 Growth ETF (IJK) and the iShares Russell MidCap Growth ETF (IWP) track a similar index. While iShares S&P MidCap 400 Growth ETF has $7.35 billion in assets, iShares Russell MidCap Growth ETF has $13.08 billion. IJK has an expense ratio of 0.17% and IWP charges 0.23%.
Bottom-Line
While an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.

2022-03-04 00:00:00+00:00,3 5G Stocks To Watch Today,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-5g-stocks-to-watch-today,,,"Are These Good 5G Stocks To Invest In Right Now?
5G stocks seem to be gaining attention in the stock market today as investors eye more defensive names. For the most part, this shift in overall sentiment is likely due to less-than-ideal conditions seen in markets now. Whether it is the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, global supply shortages, or inflation, there are plenty of headwinds to consider. As such, investors could be looking at some of the top 5G stocks in the stock market now. For one thing, this would not be all that surprising. After all, in our increasingly tech-reliant world, 5G wireless connectivity is an increasingly available convenience.
Among the leading names on this front now would be Verizon (NYSE: VZ). Through its ever-growing 5G network, the company has and continues to serve clients across a vast array of fields. This includes but is not limited to the health care, cloud, and consumer discretionary markets. In fact, the company made numerous notable announcements at its investor day yesterday. For starters, Verizon is currently working to cover 175 million users with its 5G Ultra Wideband network, It aims to do so by the end of the year. Moreover, the company is also now working with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: FB) via a strategic partnership. Through the current team up, the duo are exploring the uses of Verizon’s 5G expertise in bolstering the metaverse.
At the same time, investors could also consider semiconductor companies that develop 5G-powering tech. Namely, companies such as Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) and Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO) make chips that are crucial components in 5G systems today. Particularly, the likes of Marvell recently topped Wall Street’s earnings estimates in its latest quarterly earnings report. On that note, here are three top 5G stocks to know now.
5G Stocks For Your March 2022 Watchlist
AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T)
Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM)
T-Mobile US Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS)
AT&T Inc.
Starting us off today, we have telecommunications giant AT&T. The company is a diversified, global leader in telecommunications, media, and entertainment. Impressively, the company powers more than 100 million consumers in the U.S. with communications and entertainment experiences across mobile and broadband. Through its WarnerMedia subsidiary, the company provides premium and popular content to global audiences through its consumer brands. They include HBO, HBO Max, and Warner Bros among others.
Last month, the company announced that it will spin off AT&T’s interest in WarnerMedia in connection with the previously announced transaction with Discovery (NASDAQ: DISCA). The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022. “In evaluating the form of distribution, we were guided by one objective — executing the transaction in the most seamless manner possible to support long-term value generation,” said AT&T CEO John Stankey. “We are confident the spin-off achieves that objective because it’s simple, efficient, and results in AT&T shareholders owning shares of both companies, each of which will have the ability to drive better returns in a manner consistent with their respective market opportunities.”
In January, the company also reported its fourth-quarter and full-year financials. Diving in, consolidated revenue for the quarter was $41 billion. The company also reported an earnings per share of $0.69 compared to a loss of $1.95 a year ago. Cash from operations for the quarter was $11.3 billion. The company says it continues to lead the industry in postpaid phone net adds, gaining more subscribers than in the prior 10 years combined. It also added more than 1 million fiber subscribers. All things considered, is T stock worth investing in today?

Qualcomm Inc.
Following that, we have Qualcomm, a multinational corporation that creates semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology. The company also owns critical patents to the 5G, and 4G mobile communications standards. In fact, its foundational technologies enable the mobile ecosystem and are found in every 4G and 5G smartphone. It also continues to bring the benefits of mobile to industries like automotive, the Internet-of-Things (IoT), and computing.
Earlier in the week, the company announced new upgraded features and capabilities to its Qualcomm 5G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) Platform Gen 2. Upgrades designed to include support for standalone 5G mmWave as well as the all-new Qualcomm 5G RF Sensing Suite. The two new key features will help proliferate the adoption and deployment of FWA. Qualcomm continues to be a premium provider of FWA solutions. The successful adoption of the Qualcomm 5G Fixed Wireless Access Platforms and growing demand for FWA technologies is attributable to the efficiencies and cost reductions they bring from installation to deployment. 5G FWA networks also eliminate the need for fiber, potentially delivering enormous cost savings.
It also announced new and enhanced solutions to its rapidly expanding automotive technology portfolio. Notably, it is enhancing its Snapdragon Digital Chassis connected vehicle platforms and introduced a feature for Snapdragon Car-to-Cloud Services. Dubbed Connectivity-as-a-Service, it brings new technology collaborations to support out-of-the-box connectivity. For these reasons, is QCOM stock a buy?

T-Mobile US Inc.
Last but not least, we have T-Mobile in focus today. In brief, the company is one of, if not the largest supplier of 5G connectivity services in the U.S. Through its nationwide 5G network, the company boasts some of the fastest internet speeds in the business. Notably, with its expansive connectivity offerings, the company continues to see strong demand from consumers. Following a bump in business throughout the pandemic, T-Mobile posted exceptional figures throughout its fiscal 2021.
In its latest financial update posted last month, the company revealed several key operational highlights. Firstly, it ended the fiscal year with $5.6 billion in free cash flow, almost double year-over-year. Secondly, T-Mobile saw its core adjusted EBITDA surge to $23.6 billion for the year, a record high. Topping off all of that, the company is also looking at a whopping 5.5 million total postpaid net additions to its network in 2021. By T-Mobile’s estimates, it continues to lead the industry on this front, marking its seventh consecutive year doing so.
Moreover, T-Mobile does not seem to be slowing down in the least bit. As of last week, it is currently working with Deutsche Telekom (OTCMKTS: DTEGY) on cutting-edge IoT solutions. Through this partnership, the duo are offering T-IoT, a 5G-powered global IoT connectivity service for enterprises. As it stands, the service is available across 188 destinations on 383 networks worldwide. With T-Mobile seemingly firing on all cylinders now, will you be keeping an eye on TMUS stock?

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-03-04 00:00:00+00:00,Should Vanguard MidCap ETF (VO) Be on Your Investing Radar?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-vanguard-midcap-etf-vo-be-on-your-investing-radar-0,,,"The Vanguard MidCap ETF (VO) was launched on 01/26/2004, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
The fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $53 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
Why Mid Cap Blend
Mid cap companies, with market capitalization in the range of $2 billion and $10 billion, offer investors many things that small and large companies don't, including less risk and higher growth opportunities. Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.
Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.
Costs
Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it the least expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.24%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 22.30% of the portfolio. Industrials and Healthcare round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Dexcom Inc. (DXCM) accounts for about 0.77% of total assets, followed by Marvell Technology Inc. (MRVL) and Msci Inc. (MSCI).
Performance and Risk
VO seeks to match the performance of the CRSP US Mid Cap Index before fees and expenses. The CRSP US Mid Cap Index targets inclusion of the U.S. companies that fall between the top 70%-85% of investable market capitalization.
The ETF has lost about -8.78% so far this year and is up about 8.30% in the last one year (as of 03/04/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $214.97 and $261.20.
The ETF has a beta of 1.09 and standard deviation of 24.35% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 381 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
Vanguard MidCap ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, VO is a great option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.
The iShares Russell MidCap ETF (IWR) and the iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF (IJH) track a similar index. While iShares Russell MidCap ETF has $29.09 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF has $64.75 billion. IWR has an expense ratio of 0.19% and IJH charges 0.05%.
Bottom-Line
Passively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.

Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a recap of the exceptional results Marvell delivered in fiscal 2022, an absolutely pivotal year for the company. We saw a substantial increase in design wins, the completion of two significant acquisitions and strong revenue growth with great momentum in all our businesses. Our 5-nanometer technology platform, along with the rest of our data-centric IP portfolio, proved to be a key enabler for winning new opportunities in all of our focus markets.
Our sales and product teams did a tremendous job securing new sockets and drove a record level of design wins in fiscal 2022, a big step up from the prior year. Fiscal 2022 was also a breakout year for our cloud optimized silicon platform, winning a sizable number of important sockets, which we expect will drive significant revenue for the company going forward. We remain focused on extending our leadership in process technology and advanced packaging. Our engineering teams are driving the architecture and design of our complex analog and mixed-signal IP to three nanometers.
They are also advancing chiplet and 3D packaging technologies to support the integration of multiple advanced process nodes inside a single package. During the year, we completed the integration of Inphi, a transformational acquisition that substantially increased our participation in the fast-growing cloud data center market. The Marvell and Inphi team share very similar values founded on engineering excellence, innovation and a passion for our customers' success. The teams have integrated exceptionally well across the company and are jointly taking our capabilities to new heights.
Inphi's position at the core of cloud data centers has given the team unique insights into next-generation network architectures. The Inphi team has developed deep relationships with Tier 1 cloud customers, which has been instrumental in unlocking additional opportunities for the combined company, including the success of our cloud optimized silicon platform. The transaction, which was accretive to non-GAAP earnings within the first full quarter after close has been a resounding success, delivering revenue in fiscal 2022 above our deal model. We further complemented our cloud business with the Innovium acquisition, adding their leading cloud optimized switches to Marvell's feature-rich enterprise and carrier switch portfolio.
The Innovium team is fully integrated and are leveraging Marvell's 5-nanometer technology platform and extensive SerDes IP to accelerate the road map for our next-generation 51.2T switches. This development is closely aligned with our electrooptics DSP road map to provide customers with a complete solution optimized for power and performance. The combined Marvell and Innovium Ethernet switch portfolios are proving very attractive to data center customers, among them, a new design win at a Tier 1 cloud customer in Asia. We are also engaged with multiple additional customers and are looking forward to further expanding our footprint in this fast-growing market.
Moving on to revenue. In fiscal 2022, revenue grew 50% year on year to $4.46 billion driven by robust demand for our products. The organic Marvell business and the acquired Inphi business were both strong contributors to growth. Our results reflect our success in the cloud, 5G and automotive end markets, which collectively doubled in revenue from the prior year.
Our enterprise networking end market also had a phenomenal year with revenue growing 43% year over year. Later in the call today, you will hear more details about the start of an extended period of infrastructure refreshes in the enterprise market. We expect that these, combined with share and content gains from our merchant products, will produce enduring growth in our enterprise business. And not only that, you will also hear me talk about a new driver of revenue growth in the enterprise networking market.
Shifting gears to our fourth quarter. We delivered a record $1.34 billion in revenue, growing 11% sequentially and 68% year over year. Revenue exceeded the midpoint of guidance with all end markets growing sequentially and year over year. A particular note, cloud and enterprise networking delivered stronger than projected contributions.
Cloud, 5G and auto collectively increased to 40% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. We exited fiscal 2022 with record bookings momentum and opportunities for accelerated growth across our business going forward. We continue to win in the market as our customers look to expand the scope of their engagements with Marvell. Our operations team continues to secure capacity, and we are tightly engaged with our strategic suppliers.
Growth in demand continues to outstrip increases in supply. And as a result, our delinquency has continued to grow. We are working closely with our suppliers to secure additional capacity wherever possible. Let me now move on to discussing our five end markets, starting with data center.
In our data center end market, revenue for the fourth quarter was $574 million, growing 15% sequentially and 113% year over year, exceeding our guidance. The majority of the growth was from cloud driven by robust demand from hyperscale customers. Let me note that our on-premise data center business also grew sequentially and year over year. In the fourth quarter, sequential and year-over-year revenue growth was broad-based with multiple product lines contributing to the excellent results.
We expect the demand outlook from cloud customers to remain strong, and we are also looking forward to the ramp of new design wins. At our Investor Day, we discussed our expectations for $400 million in incremental revenue contributions in fiscal 2024 from new cloud optimized wins, doubling to $800 million in fiscal 2025. Development of these programs is well on track with several products slated to enter production later this year and start contributing meaningful revenue. Since that update, we have won multiple additional cloud optimized designs.
Similar to the wins in prior quarters, these chips are for a variety of networking and compute offload or acceleration functions in cloud data centers. We are expecting revenue contributions from these new wins to start as early as fiscal 2024 and then ramp more substantially over time. Both of these wins are incremental to what we had discussed at our Investor Day. In aggregate, in fiscal 2022, we have won over a dozen cloud optimized programs across multiple Tier 1 cloud customers.
A significant number of these designs are for custom DPU implementations, reflecting the increase in the attach rate of DPUs inside cloud data centers. We expect this trend to accelerate in next-generation architectures. We are confident that we are uniquely positioned to win these opportunities with our leading portfolio of compute, networking, security, storage and high-speed electro-optics IP, all of them delivered on our cloud optimized 5-nanometer platform. In our electro-optics business, we are continuing to innovate.
We are aggressively driving the road map to improve power performance in leading-edge technology nodes with our next-generation products. We have begun volume shipments of our 800-gig PAM4 DSPs, enabling customers to start deployment of 800-gig optical modules in cloud data center and AI network applications. We are confident that we are the industry's first PAM4 DSP supplier to achieve this production milestone. Let me now discuss a new product line we just announced for the emerging active electrical cable market.
This opens up another avenue of growth for us in the data center, leveraging our core DSP expertise. Today, our PAM4 products are primarily deployed in optical modules used in cloud data centers for long-reach switch-to-switch connections. In the same data centers, short-reach connections between switches, between server to top of rack switches and in AI interconnects have traditionally used passive electrical cables for speeds of up to 50 gig per lane. None of these requires advanced signal processing today.
However, in next-generation cloud data centers, AI, ML and other data-intensive workloads are pushing these short-reach connections to higher 100 gig per lane throughput. At these speeds, passive electrical cables have significant reach and performance limitations. To overcome these challenges, the industry is turning to active electrical cables, referred to as ADCs, which require advanced DSPs. To meet that demand, Marvell has introduced the industry's first 400-gig and 800-gig DSPs for the ADC market based on our leading PAM4 service technology.
Our unique business model allows us to work with both cloud customers, as well as all leading cable manufacturers to drive an open ecosystem. Our industry-leading DSPs have enabled major cable vendors to complete development of their first ADC solutions. We are also working with multiple cloud operators to take advantage of this new growth opportunity. On the storage side, our leading process technology platform and PCIe road map execution continues to drive new design wins for our data center SSD controllers.
During the quarter, we secured designs with our PCIe Gen 5 controllers at two additional NAND OEMs, making a total of three who are adopting the Marvell solution. Looking ahead, our team is also pushing forward with our PCIe Gen 6 development, and our customers are very excited about our road map. Moving on to our expectations for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023 from our data center end market. We project revenue to grow sequentially in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis and more than double year over year.
We are expecting another strong performance led by cloud customers across a broad range of products. We are also projecting the start of a strong ramp of our 400-gig ZR data center interconnect products. In fact, we are expecting this ramp to drive our DCI revenue to a new record in the first quarter, eclipsing the peak we had achieved in the 100 gig cycle. Even at this very early stage of industry adoption, we are excited to see the rapid growth of 400 ZR, and we expect to see a lot more growth over time.
Looking forward, we see ongoing growth in the data center, including revenue contribution starting from the new cloud-optimized product ramps to drive another step-up in our data center revenue in the second half of this fiscal year and beyond. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $241 million, growing 12% sequentially and 45% year over year. These results were driven by our 5G business, which delivered substantial revenue growth of over 30% sequentially, exceeding our guidance.
We benefited from the broader rollout of 5G technology and product ramps at multiple base station customers. Marvell recently announced a collaboration with Dell on their new suite of telecom solutions to help service providers enable their transformation to open cloud-native networks. This offering includes a codeveloped Open RAN accelerator card using our proven OCTEON Fusion baseband silicon to deliver in-line 5G Layer 1 processing. We continue to see strong traction on our 5G technology platform, resulting in another key 5-nanometer design win for a radio ASIC at a Tier 1 base station customer.
Following the strong step-up in the fourth quarter, we expect revenue from the carrier end market to continue to grow in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We are projecting revenue to grow in the low single digits sequentially, while year-over-year growth is expected to remain strong at over 40%. Moving on to our enterprise networking and end market. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $263 million, growing 6% sequentially and 64% year over year, another strong performance from this large and growing Marvell business.
As you heard in the opening remarks, this end market is going through an inflection. Hybrid work is here to stay, but the current networking infrastructure was never designed to support this flexible, seamless connect from anywhere, immersive and high video usage environment. Companies are now embarking upon an extended period of refreshing their infrastructure, becoming borderless, enabling new digital capabilities, massively increasing bandwidth, building redundancy and beefing up security. You will also remember from our prior discussions that we have been winning designs with our refreshed products over several years in this end market.
These wins have typically come with higher Marvell content driven by new features such as multi-gig Ethernet and MACsec. As the upgrade cycle in the enterprise networking market gains momentum, we are beginning to see our customers starting to ship their new platforms where we have higher share and increased content. Looking forward, we expect enterprises will continue to modernize their networks. And as a result, we project ongoing growth to continue from this end market.
Let me now discuss a new source of growth for Marvell in this end market, custom silicon. We have a very successful custom business in the carrier end market and are also building a large revenue stream from hyperscalers with our cloud optimized products. We are now enabling the enterprise networking market to take advantage of our advanced technology platform. I would like to point out that these designs frequently pull through additional Marvell content across a number of our product lines.
Our pipeline of opportunities is growing, and we see custom silicon becoming another leg to the enterprise networking stool, adding to the ongoing growth from our merchant products. We expect revenue from custom products and enterprise networking to grow sharply to well over $100 million in fiscal 2023. In aggregate, we expect a very durable period of high growth from enterprise networking to strongly complement our cloud, 5G and auto pillars. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect growth to accelerate in our enterprise networking end market.
We are projecting revenue to be up sequentially in the mid-teens on a percentage basis and year over year to grow over 70%. This growth outlook reflects our expectations of higher supply to support our product ramps and the ongoing enterprise infrastructure refresh cycle. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market, revenue for the fourth quarter was $79 million, growing 19% sequentially and 134% year over year. Strong revenue growth in this end market is being driven by higher adoption of our Brightlane Ethernet solutions in a growing number of vehicles from multiple OEMs.
Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting strong sequential growth to continue from auto and a flattish outlook for our industrial business. As a result, for the auto and industrial end market, we are projecting sequential revenue growth in the high single digits on a percentage basis, while year-over-year growth is expected above 80%. Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $185 million, growing 2% sequentially and 11% year over year.
Growth in this end market is being driven by our SSD controllers, shipping into consumer-oriented platforms such as game consoles. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect revenue to be flattish on a sequential basis and continue to grow year over year, approximately in the double digits on a percentage basis. In closing, we delivered record results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022, growing revenue well above our long-term target model. We expect this momentum to continue.
Marvell is uniquely positioned to benefit from the three most important growth opportunities in semiconductors: cloud, 5G and automotive. The transformation in the enterprise end market is also becoming another continuing growth driver for Marvell. We expect secular growth to continue from all our end markets, further supported by our large and growing pipeline of secured design wins, which will drive incremental revenue. We are also working to make sure that we grow in a responsible and sustainable manner.
Over the past year, Marvell has taken meaningful action on evolving our environmental, social and governance strategy, setting new goals and increasing transparency. We've committed to achieving net zero emissions as a company and are setting a science-based target to put us on track to reach this goal. Building a more inclusive and diverse workforce is another important area of focus, and we have increased our outreach to traditionally underrepresented talent. I would encourage investors to visit our new ESG website to review the goals we've outlined and our progress to date.
On behalf of Marvell's board and leadership team, I thank our valued employees for the outstanding results they've helped deliver in the fourth quarter and throughout fiscal year 2022. Ours is a highly resilient team that has stayed focused and outperformed through an extended period of challenges and uncertainty. This is an exciting time for our company as we've hit an inflection point in our growth cycle and are seeing strong momentum in our businesses across the board. I look forward to continuing to work alongside our exceptional Marvell team to address the numerous opportunities in front of us.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our fiscal year 2022 results. We are very pleased with our performance in fiscal 2022, delivering record revenue and profitability while continuing to aggressively invest to drive strong long-term growth from the data infrastructure market. Revenue grew significantly by 50% year on year to $4.46 billion.
GAAP gross margin was 46.3% and the GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.53. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 64.9%, expanding by 160 basis points, reflecting the increase in value and differentiation we provide to our customers. Revenue growth and gross margin expansion, combined with strong operating leverage from our business model, drove robust growth in earnings for the year. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 860 basis points from 24.2% to 32.8%.
And non-GAAP earnings per share grew 71% year on year to $1.57. Moving on to our financial results for the first quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.343 billion, exceeding the middle point of our guidance, growing 11% sequentially and 68% year over year. Data center was our largest end market, driving 43% of consolidated revenue.
Enterprise networking was next largest with 19% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 18%, consumer at 14% and auto industrial at 6%. GAAP gross margin was 51.1%. Non-GAAP gross profit was $877 million or 65.3% of revenue, another record driven by rich product mix, reflecting our strong IP position and leading product portfolio. GAAP operating expenses were $652 million and they include the cost of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, legal settlements and acquisition and divestiture-related costs.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $390 million, at the low end of our guidance range. GAAP operating income was $35 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $487 million, up 115% from a year ago, growing significantly faster than revenue. We achieved a record of 36.3% non-GAAP operating margin, an improvement of 790 basis points from the prior year, reflect the strong operating leverage in our business model.
For the fourth quarter, GAAP income per diluted share was $0.01. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.50, up 72% year over year, exceeding the middle point of our guidance. Now turning to our balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $346 million.
I'm pleased with our strong cash flow generation while investing significantly in working capital to support strong revenue growth. We returned $51 million to shareholders through cash dividends. As of the end of the fourth fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $614 million, and our long-term debt was $4.5 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.6 times and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times.
We are confident that we are on track to achieve our targeted gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio of two times by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, at which time we expect to restart share repurchase. Inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was $720 million. $39 million of this inventory balance is from Innovium due to purchase price accounting. We anticipate amortizing this step-up over the next two quarters.
We have also increased our working process inventory to support the rapid growth in revenue we are forecasting. In summary, the Marvell team executed exceptionally well, delivering accelerated top line growth and strong earnings expansion significantly faster than revenue growth. Turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.425 billion, plus or minus 3%.
We expect our GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 49.6% to 50.6%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 65% to 66%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $672 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $430 million to $435 million.
For the first quarter, we expect non-GAAP tax rate of 6%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 848 million.

[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. You may now go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Thanks a lot. Matt, it seems like you're ahead of plan, and I'm wondering if you could update us on your fiscal '23 growth forecast. And then also, as you look to fiscal '24, I know you said you're going to grow more than 30% this year. But it seems like you can do better than that, now it seems like you're getting a little more supply.
And then also, I think you had hinted that, well, maybe you can grow somewhere in that range also for fiscal '24 because the fiscal '23 guidance didn't include any work on -- in delinquencies. So I'm just kind of wondering if you can update us on those. It sounds like you'd be incrementally more confident that you can grow quite a bit higher possibly than 30% this year and maybe even 30% in fiscal '24?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Great, Tim. Thanks for the question. And yeah, just to answer, very happy that we're ahead of plan right now based on our strong outlook for Q1.
Second, we do continue to get more supply. You saw that in our fourth quarter, as well as in our first quarter outlook, which is very positive. I think as well, the order momentum continues to be strong. We had very, very strong bookings in our fourth quarter, which give us a lot of confidence in our '23 outlook and beyond.
And then, of course, new design wins, when you look out to '24, also have us feeling very good. So I think we're tracking really well across the board. And we're very pleased with the results we've got plus our outlook plus the long-term view.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Matt, can I sneak in a quick second one? I was wondering if you can maybe --
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Yeah. Thanks. Can you sort of size the custom ASIC business? I know it's reported across different segments, but can you maybe add up all of the custom ASIC revenue and just give us a sense for sort of how big it is in aggregate today. Thanks.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Hey, Tim, this is an interesting question. We've actually gotten this on and off over the years. And just to kind of refresh the investors on the line, it's really hard to define this precisely because when you think about customization, you have a range of products and business models that we offer.
For example, we have a full custom business in the traditional sense of the world. That would be an ASIC business that we picked up from Avera. But we also do a lot of semi-custom work or cloud optimized work as an example, where we work either with large hyperscalers or in the case of telecom with 5G to take the customer's IP and our IP and put it together. And then even in our merchant offerings, candidly, we end up doing SKUs and derivatives that have something special for what our customers want.
So I'd say that generally, it's not something we can even exactly quantify internally. What I would say is it's an absolute trend. It's the way the market is moving. You have to be able to have a rich set of intellectual property and flexibility in your business model in how you engage with your customers.
And that's not just for the hyperscale cloud, Tim, it's also for 5G. It's for enterprise as well. And then in the future, I think this is going to be a key differentiator for us in automotive as well is what we call our flexible business model. But anyway, I think that's as much as I can say.
It's a hot trend. It's the way the market is moving. And we're probably the best positioned company to take advantage of it.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
OK, Matt. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. You may now go ahead.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. Matt, given that conditions are so supply constrained, how are you ensuring the quality of demand and the backlog and making sure customers are not just stocking up in product? And related to that is the strength in the enterprise market, which seems to be well above what conventional wisdom and history would suggest, but you seem to be incrementally even more positive. So just thoughts on just demand quality overall and sustainability of the strength in enterprise.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Vivek. Yeah, this is something we've been paying extremely close attention to, not just even in the fourth quarter but really at the onset of this supply and demand imbalance as we were going through the pandemic. We have a very rigorous internal review process. We have very good end market data in terms of everything from how many base stations ship to the number of -- to which carriers are deploying, that would be a 5G example.
And then what is our content as it relates to that, we gave very good data on the cloud deployments. We know how many servers are shipping. We can then calculate all kinds of things about which products that we have attaching to those. Same with enterprise, etc.
So we have an end market focus that we look at. We also -- because we're actually a very focused company, Vivek, we have a handful of major accounts that we go very deep with. And given the system-level nature of what we do, we have very good insight into what they're doing and what the needs are. On top of that, we've also put in place a very rigorous, I guess, engagement model with our customers, where the backlog is firm.
We do have noncancelable conditions on those orders. Reschedules are limited. And so we've gone through a process to make sure that as we schedule the backlog and we get bookings, it's actually what people want. And then we prioritize around that.
And then finally, I would say that this crisis has brought, I'd say, the leaders of the chip industry and the leaders of the OEMs even closer. And so my interactions all the way to the CEO level of our major customers is another way that we triangulate. As it relates to enterprise, most of the growth here, Vivek, candidly is a combination of significant content gain as the electronics inside these various pieces of enterprise infrastructure have migrated to things like multi-gigabit Ethernet. They've added things like security and MACSec.
We've also -- and there's just more ASP per port as an example there. We've also been focused on this area. So if you look at traditional Marvell business in enterprise switch and PHY, we've gained market share through our offerings by refreshing the portfolio and staying competitive from a technical standpoint and staying focused on that market. And then we also have new product areas ramping, like custom silicon in enterprise, which basically, if you look at where we were a year ago in that custom area, I mean, that business is up dramatically year over year, and it's ramping very sharply in our fiscal '23.
So there's a lot layering in. And the trends are real, too. I mean if you just look at what we even go through at Marvell and other major companies, as you bring people back to work, things have changed over the last two years. And so there's an enterprise upgrade cycle that's also kicking in as companies spend to modernize their infrastructure.
So we think it's a combination of those things. The numbers are dramatic in terms of the growth. We're excited by that, and we see this business continuing to grow in fiscal '23 and beyond off of this already higher base of revenue that we're achieving.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. You may now go ahead.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Matt, congratulations on the solid results. A lot of things to highlight.
I was wondering if you could spend a few minutes just talking about gross margins, both cyclically and secularly, Clearly, you're seeing some input cost increases in your supply chain. I'm assuming given how strong gross margins are, your ability to pass that on is pretty high. But the real crux of my question is, when you guys talked about sort of restructuring the ARM server business as more of a custom silicon business, you kind of talked about how margins on that customer -- gross margins on that custom silicon side could be a little bit lower op margins kind of neutral to the overall model. But ever since you kind of reset that bar, you've done a better job on the gross margin line.
So I guess my question really is as you're getting into these custom engagements, are you finding out that the profitability is perhaps better than you originally thought?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, John, for the questions. And certainly, the solid results, in a large part, were driven by the very durable gross margin performance of the company. We're pleased to have set a record gross margin of 65.3% this past quarter.
We also guided gross margins to be in the 65% to 66% range, which is, call it, at the mid. Then we went all the way up to the high-end range of our long-term model. So despite input cost increases and all kinds of challenges the teams faced, I think the quality of our engineering and the quality of the products is ultimately what's enabling us to maintain our gross margin in a range that allows us to invest back in the business. On your question about what happens with some of these custom products and when they start ramping and -- well, first of all, they've already started ramping, right? We're deep into high volume in cloud optimized silicon.
If you look at our data center revenue, it's obviously our biggest segment within data center. The majority of that is cloud. Cloud on its own would be larger than any of our other segments. So there's already that contribution.
And if you remember from our Investor Day, Jean had a great chart of our gross margins by end market. And if you recall, data center and automotive actually were the two highest ones, and those are also -- happen to be two of our highest growth businesses. So look, I think an individual product here or there that's lower gross margin, if you will, but higher op margin. To be honest, this business is already so large and it's growing so fast.
We're able to deal with anything that might be slightly less gross margin than the average because we also have products like from Inphi, as an example, that are growing even -- that are higher gross margin and are growing even faster. So I think that's the beauty of our model, John. We can actually grow this business. We can be aggressive to take large, high-volume sockets, especially in compute.
And we could do that and still maintain the company's long-term target model on margins, which I think is a testament to the business model we've put together and the rich mix of products we have.

Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. You may now go ahead.
C.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Matt, on the call, you talked about a number of new products that are ramping this year and beyond, as well as new design wins. So curious, two-part question.
First, are you including both of those -- or did you include both of those when you originally guided the $5.9 billion for fiscal '23? And then as you think about these design wins coming into the model, is there a way to kind of rank order or highlight kind of the 1, 2 or 3 that you think are most relevant to the model into fiscal '24 and beyond?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Yeah, CJ, I think as it relates to the design win side and new products, I think a couple of things to think about. First of all, as I've said in my remarks -- and I just want to give a shout-out. Our sales field applications team and our business units absolutely knocked it out of the park this year on design wins.
It was a significant step-up in achievement. We just went through our process to review kind of the final numbers. They did a great job. Our funnel is as large as ever with respect to the opportunities in front of us.
The incremental wins that we've got, some of them do -- as we mentioned, they will layer in, in fiscal '24 and '25. Some of them may start a little bit earlier. But typically, when you get a new design win on a new product, it's typically not in the existing fiscal year. But remember, we've also got the revenue that's going to feed the $400 million, going to $800 million.
That's looking really good, and that's also planned to start ramping in the second half of this year. So I think just the way to think about it is the incremental wins we keep getting in the cloud area specifically really sort of are additive to the fiscal '24 and '25. There's not -- that you see just wouldn't from a timing perspective, capture a lot of it this year. But I would say, at the same time, the ones that we already won are tracking very well.

Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. You may now go ahead.
Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst
Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow up on John's question on margins. And one thing we saw, last month your earnings was -- that pricing kind of superseded future wafer costs.
A lot of people saw a benefit in the first quarter and margins come down. So I'm just kind of curious if you can talk about the kind of the strength in gross margin. And then just I wanted to make sure that this is a level that you kind of build off of and it wasn't that same dynamic a lot of other companies saw through earnings.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Blayne, thanks for the question. I think we have been in a very tight supply chain environment. So we have been dealing with the past increase, the price increase on the supply chain side for a long time now. For us, our team will work with the suppliers and customers closely and really try to just offset the cost for increase during the whole thing.
We have a very long product cycle. So we can plan ahead. Our gross margin is primarily driven by the end market mix that Matt talked about earlier. If you look at this Q4 and Q1, the guidance, we are very pleased with the gross margin but largely because the data center is growing really fast.
Automotive, they are growing really fast Enterprise market and market gross margin is also very strong, continue to trend up. So overall, if you look at our mix, that really drive our gross margin. For the rest of the year, it will be the similar situation in any given quarter. It largely depends on the mix.

Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead.
Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Great, thank you. I wonder if you could touch on the supply demand situation a little bit more. You said delinquencies are still kind of rising, but you are getting more supply. Any progress on getting lead times down? And can you tell -- in a lot of these cases, are you still kind of the bottleneck, is your product constrained? Or is there any possibility of your product kind of waiting for other chips to arrive?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Hey, Joe, great question. And you've been doing this a long time like me. It's shocking to say, I never thought we would be at this point in this cycle.
But yeah, the gap between supply and demand has actually grown. And we look at our -- some companies call it unfulfilled backlog. We -- I was raised in the old school, which is calling it delinquency. But that number continues to rise each quarter.
It rose in the fourth quarter and it will also rise in the first quarter. So demand is very strong. Now I think we're -- so -- but yes, we're getting more supply. And you see we're actually exceeding our guidance from last quarter and our Q1 guide is very strong, both sequentially and year over year.
But we're still having to grind hard with our suppliers to get more of what we need. We've moved -- although I'd say, dramatically, we've -- our position within the supply chain, I think, relative to the key suppliers we engage with, understanding our opportunity, I mean that has been a big transformation over the last year. And hats off to our team in operations, led by Chris Koopmans and also our business units and even myself personally engaging up and down the supply chain. So they understand our opportunity, which is, I think, helping us.
And we just continue to prioritize, Joe. It's -- I'm very close. I'm personally involved with all the major accounts. We've managed to not be the long pole in the tent or if we were, it wasn't for very long.
So we've been able to sort of stay barely ahead but -- and we're satisfying customers. We don't have anybody lying down that I know of right now, but it gets tight as we continue to ramp and customers have designed us in. But I think we're managing it very well, and we'll continue to just be very tactical in the short term to get the supply we need to match it to the right demand, make sure we're not building inventory and do our best to manage through this unprecedented cycle we're in. And I think the final thing I would say is it's a cycle that we haven't seen at least in terms of the strength and the duration.
And I think on top of that, with Marvell, given our increased market share, the end market exposure we have with the secular growth drivers we have, that's making it even -- creating even more pressure on us given those dynamics. But we're up for the challenge. And I think our team is doing a great job, and we'll continue to work closely with our customers to make it happen.

Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. You may now go ahead.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you, and congratulations on the record results. Matt, I think the big highlight at least for me this quarter is what you said about kind of custom enterprise business. And if you look at your carrier and your cloud business, I think it's pretty obvious, right? I mean there's like a handful of companies.
But enterprise is probably a much bigger group of companies. Could you just elaborate a little bit on that? I mean, on the custom enterprise side, are you actually going to be working with more than perhaps a half dozen companies?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, like everything, Tore, ultimately, even though there's certainly a broader set of OEMs and diversity of applications in, let's call it, the enterprise market than maybe people that make base stations. The reality is the folks that can afford or want to do a full custom design is a narrower subset. That being said, I think our ability to do this kind of optimization, if you will, without maybe having to do a full custom design, that's one advantage we bring to the table. That's a little bit of a different business model.
And then -- but yeah, it's multiple customers that we're engaged with. And they want a lot of the same things, including all of our high-performance IP. They want 5-nanometer going to 3-nanometer. Actually, our capability in compute is very attractive, especially as a lot of the trends in the hyperscale now, Tore, are starting to manifest themselves in the enterprise.
And people are looking to do acceleration in an offload fashion. In our DPU OCTEON DPU capability, whether we sell it as a card or we customize a chip and then somebody else puts the solution together, there's a lot of really interesting things going on in the enterprise. And then finally, even on the core processing opportunity as well. Our latest OCTEON 10 product is very competitive in the market.
It's the most competitive one we've had in 5-nanometer. So anyway, much broader, obviously, set of opportunities than we had before, Tore. But going back to your comment, yes, on custom enterprise, we're really pleased with the uplift in revenue. And we're also pleased with the pipeline we have there because these products last a long time.
And the overall profitability and gross margin profile of the enterprise business in Marvell is, and jean showed this at the Investor Day, but it's about where the corporate average is. So very healthy gross margins, broad set of customers, broad set of applications and very long product life cycles that are very sticky once you get designed in. And we're able to pull through other sockets. I mean there are -- in Ethernet-based designs as an example, you can pull through the fight.
So there's a lot of great things going on in enterprise.

Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities. You may now go ahead.
Srini Pajjuri -- Nikko Securities -- Analyst
Thank you. Hi, Matt. Question on the 400 ZR cycle. You said it's going to grow in Q1, but you also said something even more interesting, that it's going to be high -- I guess you said the revenue is going to be higher than the previous peak.
I know we are in very, very early days in this cycle. So if you could just talk about what's driving that strength? And also, if you could put into some perspective how big you think the SAM is going to be versus the previous, I guess, 100ZR, I think that would be very helpful.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, sure. And just to clarify, when we talk about the peak, I'm including the original 100-gig products, which is COLORZ, right, which was developed by Inphi, and now we have COLORZ 2, which is 400 gig. So COLORZ, when it was sort of at its peak, was about $100 million run rate for Inphi and then as -- into Marvell. And so what we're saying now is that COLORZ, COLORZ 2 total contribution, it's at a peak revenue.
The DCI contribution, the DCI revenue of that -- the DCI product line, if you will, is going to be at peak revenues in Q1 and then grow from there. In the past, on 100 gig, it was really driven by one customer, and that was almost a semi-custom like engagement. In 400ZR, there are multiple hyperscale customers that we're working with. We'll have multiple customers.
And it's the start of a very exciting ramp on our products. And this is a transition that we've all been waiting for, but it's here, and it's contributing to revenue now in Q1.

Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. You may now go ahead.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong results and execution. On your cloud optimized ASIC and some of your DIY design win pipeline, $400 million target in fiscal '24. I think, Matt, you said that you're on track for doubling that in fiscal '25, fiscal '26. So now that you guys are deep in the design phase for many of these products at five nanometers, can you guys just give us a sense of the types of chips you're developing for your cloud customers? Is it primarily AI and machine learning acceleration? Is it video transcode? Is it custom DPUs, surplus CPUs, etc.? And then any color on this point would be great.
And then just as important, is the team already starting to engage on early 3-nanometer programs with your cloud customers on their next-generation ASIC programs?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, it's a great question. And I think you understand quite well the sensitivities we have with respect to these types of engagement with the hyperscalers. I would say, it's between what we've won and the pipeline that we're pursuing, it's pretty much all of those applications that you're discussing.
It's acceleration primarily. And it could be for things like video. It could be for things like security or storage. There are networking ASICs that we're doing that are very customized.
There's compute. There's custom DPUs, if you will. Think of it as -- and then by the way, we said some of this. I mean the -- as you look at sort of the SmartNIC opportunity -- and we've been saying this for a while.
There is a lot of customization going on in that segment as well. So it's a wide range, Harlan. There's no sort of one trick pony in here -- and in aggregate, they're all tracking extremely well. And we gave a very judged view, by the way, when we gave those numbers.
So obviously -- maybe not obviously, but our customers' forecasts are actually higher than what we gave you, but that's sort of our baseline. But we've now won incremental designs, which would layer on top of that. So I think it's all positive, but our ability to get super precise at this point without a customer announcement would be a little bit tough.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
And you guys -- are you guys already engaged on early 3-nanometer?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Sorry, yeah. So we're very engaged on 3-nanometer, Harlan. I mean that's actually a key part of -- to be honest, why we've been winning in 5-nanometer is having that very committed, very rich 3-nanometer IP portfolio underway.
And we're in deep architecture discussion now on multiple products and in multiple end markets, by the way, from cloud to 5G to enterprise about using our 3-nanometer platform. So we're on the nanometer train, and we're fully committed and we're executing quite well on our road map and customers are excited.

Christopher Rolland -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst
Thanks for the question, and I also want to echo my congrats. You mentioned a new opportunity here, Matt. AEC -- or DSP for AEC. Basically, I guess my questions are, what's the timing on this product when it comes to market? How big do you think this market could be here? And ultimately, are you guys in a position to take majority share? Thanks.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. We're pretty excited about this transition in the market, Chris, as you -- and I said some of this in my prepared remarks. But traditionally, this type of active cable hasn't been needed or at least the last generation that -- where it was needed was based on NRZ technology. So a little bit like we did -- and I say we, meaning us and Inphi, we intercepted the market as it's about to take off in growth at 400 and 800 with PAM4-based technology in 6-nanometer.
So this is -- think of this as just right in our wheelhouse in terms of leveraging what we've already got but then optimizing the products for the specific application. Our partners -- and we've done some announcements. We've done a whole flurry of them. You've probably seen them around OFC coming up.
But we're engaged with all the major cable manufacturers that supply to the hyperscalers. Are -- those cables are available. They're sampling to customers now. We're working directly with the cloud customers on additional enhancements to the road map.
But we are going to be a force to be reckoned with in this market. And it's a perfect fit for us because when you think about sort of having all the pieces, if you will, having the switch, having the optics, having now the AEC products, having the DPUs and that insight into the -- and then also ASICs that sort of hang around all these things in interface. We have a unique opportunity to really work with our customers to optimize the full solution. And that's something that maybe companies that only have one piece of the puzzle.
Don't quite see what's exactly happening. So very excited about this. This is an incremental opportunity for us. Market size, depending on who you talk to, some are saying it's $1 billion-plus.
I think -- but we'll see. We're optimistic that it's a big opportunity for us. We're still sizing what we think it means for Marvell, but we're in the market today.

Gary Mobley -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Hey, everyone. Thanks for sneaking in my question. I know you haven't filed your 10-K yet. But as it relates to that, is there anything notable with respect to purchase commitments on your behalf with your foundry partners, specifically, that's quantifiable and then as well, purchase commitments and CNRs, they're called, with respect to your customers?
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Gary, this is Jean. Yeah, we have not filed 10-K yet. But as far as the purchase agreement, as you know, last quarter end, we have about $3 billion commitment we are engaging with our suppliers to ensure we have the capacity not only for this year, next year and for longer term. So as you probably noticed, a year ago, this is just $200 million.
So we have increased our commitment significantly. You're going to see going forward, the same trend because that's really the driving focus of the company to make sure we have the capacity to support our customers.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
And Gary, I would add, as Jean indicated, you can kind of follow the trend line. The engagements now, as we talked about -- you can actually directly relate them to some of the prior questions we had about our cloud optimized ramps in fiscal '24 and '25. We're planning our business out even beyond that with respect to some of the key capacity we need on the critical technologies that are required, substrates and various other pieces of the supply chain. So you'll see that trend continue as we plan our business actually multiple years in the future, both with our end OEMs and then our key supply chain partners to make sure we're all in lockstep to meet these very, very steep product ramps that are going to be required over the next few years.

Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. You may now go ahead.
Matt Ramsay -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Thank you very much, guys for letting me on. Matt, I wanted to ask a quick question about the -- given that cloud is such an important part of your business. My own observation is that a lot of things are coming in the data center space in the next 12 months with Sapphire from Intel, with Genoa from AMD, with PAM4 400-gig optics and a bunch of other things that are really, to me, that's -- have a pretty big upgrade cycle in the data center spending space. And I wonder as you engage with your customers, how you're -- do you agree with that? Do you see an inflection in sort of pent-up spending given maybe Intel's road map has held back some things on lack of clarity? I just wonder how you would characterize over the next year or two the hyperscale spending environment as you guys see it today.
Thanks.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Matt, and welcome to the call. So I think you're absolutely right on the trends that we're talking about here. I think as we have new processor refreshes, new server refreshes and then there's all kinds of chips, by the way, that are going to flow into the equation as well, not just the sort of the server itself, but then the acceleration that's going to be required, the new workloads, different AI, GPU clusters.
I mean you just start going through all of the trends. And that is underpinning the ultimately, the silicon sort of architectures are underpinning fundamentally, the cloud capex and what's needed. So we -- as these new cycles come in and there's an inflection, it's really good for Marvell. And the PAM4 400-gig opportunity is one just great example.
But our design win position on the new systems, right, in the new architectures that are coming, the content is just much higher, whether it's per data center, per server, you name it. And so I think that's exciting to us. And yeah, there's been some delays from certain suppliers here and there. But as those as that road map gets executed and that transition happens, there's a lot of uplift for Marvell.
And that is kind of another way to back into some of the growth that we're seeing in projecting that.

2022-03-03 00:00:00+00:00,"Top Stock Market News For Today March 3, 2022",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-stock-market-news-for-today-march-3-2022,,,"Stock Market Futures Dip As Federal Reserve Looks To Proceed With Rate Hike Plans
U.S. stock futures are slightly on the decline in early morning trading today. This follows Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell’s remarks that he expects an upcoming interest rate hike. All in all, the Fed, to the surprise of some, is maintaining its course to take a measured approach to tighten monetary policies. This would be despite the growing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. According to Powell, he is planning to support a quarter-percentage point rate hike at the upcoming Fed March meeting.
Weighing in on this is Chris Zaccarelli, the chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. He suggests that Powell “expressing that 25 basis points is the likely path of the Fed, that takes away some of the uncertainty. And there was a big debate in the markets about whether it would be 25 basis points or 50 basis points out of the gate.” Zaccarelli continues, “Clearly, [with] the conflict in Ukraine and the sanctions potentially dampening global economic growth, that makes it more likely that the Fed would want to go a little more slowly.” Overall, we continue to see the impacts of the Ukraine-Russia war ripple out across markets. As of 6:23 a.m. ET, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures are trading lower by 0.06%, 0.13%, and 0.28% respectively.
Oil Prices Surge To Nine-Year Highs As Russian Sanctions Intensify
Oil prices are once again a prominent focus in the current news cycle. This is mainly due to the rapid increase in oil prices today. Namely, as the war between Russia and Ukraine intensifies, concerns over global oil supplies continue to rise. This seems to be the case as global sanctions are likely weighing in on Russia’s trade and oil exports. As a result of all this, oil prices are gaining towards nine-year highs now. In particular, Brent crude futures hit a high of $118.22 a barrel, its highest level since February 2013. Moreover, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude peaked at $114.70 a barrel, a high last seen in 2011.
Commenting on this is Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at fund manager AMP. Oliver points out that “Russia supplies around 30% of Europe’s gas and oil imports and accounts for around 11% of world oil production.” Because of the current geopolitical environment, he argues that investors could now be worrying about a “stagflationary shock.” Not to mention, the latest update from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) seems less-than-ideal as well. In short, the OPEC+ is sticking to its current plans to boost output by 400,000 barrels per day. This would arguably not help the current issues with supply shortages much now. Nevertheless, it would not surprise me to see this trend persisting and oil stocks gaining more attention now.

Victoria’s Secret Tops Earnings Estimates By A Hair; Sees Broad-Based Mid-Term Inflationary Headwinds
After yesterday’s closing bell, fashion retailer Victoria’s Secret (NYSE: VSCO), or VSCO for short, posted its latest quarterly figures. The company reported revenues of $2.18 billion, above Wall Street estimates of $2.14 billion. This adds up to a year-over-year increase of 4%, slightly topping its previous guidance range of a flat to 3% gain. Notably, earnings per share came in at $2.70, exceeding estimates of $2.63. Accordingly, VSCO’s net income for the quarter was $333.2 million, a decline from $387.9 million a year ago. However, this figure would be on the higher end of its guidance. The company said its beauty merchandise helped drive sales online as well as in brick-and-mortar stores. Whereas its international business managed to outsize growth compared to its North American operations. 
Looking ahead, the company appears to be taking a cautious approach with its guidance. It is currently expecting revenue of between $1.43 billion to $1.5 billion and earnings of between $0.70 to $0.95 for the quarter. These two metrics would fall short of current forecasts of $1.52 billion and $1.32 respectively. For the most part, VSCO says this is largely due to the rising inflation and the possibility of growing global unrest. Sure, it may be looking at short-to-mid-term headwinds. However, VSCO is expecting operating income growth to pick up in the latter half of 2022, quoting the third quarter as a potential “inflection point.” Whether or not VSCO stock can benefit from this in the long term remains to be seen.

Pure Storage Gains After Massive Estimates Beat
Elsewhere, we have tech company Pure Storage (NYSE: PSTG) which also reported earnings after yesterday’s market close. Jumping in, the company delivered record revenues of $708.6 million, up by a significant 41% year-over-year. Additionally, it also reported adjusted earnings of $0.36 against the $0.26 analysts were expecting. Pure Storage CEO Charles Giancarlo attributes this to Pure Storage’s strategy of delivering an innovative portfolio of data storage and services. Other than that, Pure Storage also seems to have made a few notable strides in the past fiscal year. 
For instance, its subscription service is gaining momentum, with revenues growing by 37% last year. Along with that, the company also unveiled two new service offerings, Pure Fusion, and Portworx Data Services, which will be available this quarter. Accordingly, this will allow Pure Storage to offer its customers a wider range of services and strengthen its customer base. Apart from this, the data company also provided its guidance for the year. Specifically, it expects to bring in approximately $2.6 billion in revenue for the year, which is an estimated year-over-year growth of about 20%. In closing, CFO Kevan Krysler had this to say, “The momentum we are experiencing is the year’s culmination of relentless focus on innovating for our customers.” With all this in mind, PSTG stock could be worth noting for some now.

Semiconductor Firms Set To Report Earnings After Closing Bell Today
Regarding today’s upcoming earnings, the likes of Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) could be worth noting today. These two semiconductor industry players are set to report their latest quarterly financials after today’s closing bell. Amidst the persistent worldwide semiconductor shortage, companies such as Marvell and Broadcom could be worth watching during this earnings season.
For Marvell, Wall Street is currently forecasting earnings of $0.48 per share on revenue of $1.32 billion for the quarter. Should this be the case it would add up to year-over-year gains of over 65% for both metrics. Overall, it seems that analysts are expecting another good quarter for the company. In fact, analysts over at JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) recently reiterated an Overweight rating on MRVL stock. The firm believes that the company’s upcoming quarterly figures and guidance will top estimates. Similarly, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) recently highlighted the company’s shares as one of its “top semiconductor stocks for 2022.” This is after citing “strong organic growth,” as a core growth driver for Marvell. With all these positive opinions on the firm, MRVL stock could be in focus later today.
Secondly, Broadcom is also receiving similar attention from Wall Street as well. As it stands, consensus forecasts point towards earnings of $8.13 per share alongside revenue of $7.61 billion for the quarter. Likewise, analysts across the board appear to be bullish on AVGO stock’s growth prospects as well. For starters, KeyBanc (NYSE: KEY) recently boosted its price target from $575 to $710 a share. Following that, Piper Sandler (NYSE: PIPR) notes that Broadcom continues to see “strong hyperscale demand,” while its enterprise markets recover. As such, AVGO stock could also turn some heads post-earnings.

This is evident from the company’s recently extended collaboration with a leading global information services company, Experian, for enhancing identity data for digital measurement of the open web in the United States.
The Nielsen ID System will be equipped with Experian marketing data assets for matching person-level data to devices. This will help in providing more accurate demographic distribution for reported impressions for Nielsen’s Audience Measurement and Outcomes products.
The partnership will help NLSN enhance the ID Resolution System. It will also help in audience deduplication across linear and digital platforms, as part of Nielsen’s cross-media measurement solution, Nielsen ONE.
Further, the recent move will help Nielsen provide an enhanced experience to advertisers and publishers using Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings (DAR), which is backed by Experian’s data sources.

Efforts Toward Identity System
Apart from the recent collaboration, Nielsen joined forces with The Trade Desk TTD in a bid to power identity resolution for open Internet measurement in Europe, Asia, Mexico and Canada.

This will help in connecting digital impressions to demographics across millions of devices. The partnership with TTD will help Nielsen retain momentum among advertisers and publishers using Nielsen DAR.
Further, it recently released its enhanced Nielsen Identity System for DAR in 15 countries including the United Kingdom, France and Italy, to name a few, to equip advertisers as well as publishers with more accurate digital ad measurement. With this initiative, Nielsen expanded its presence in these countries. Further, the move is an effort to combat issues related to cookies and mobile ad id erosion.
Portfolio Strength
The recent move bodes well for Nielsen’s growing efforts toward strengthening its portfolio offerings. Further, the company has been consistently expanding its offerings to provide enhanced solutions to customers.
It recently introduced the Diverse Media Equity program for enhancing the visibility of diverse-owned media companies with advertisers and agencies.
NLSN also launched Streaming Signals for connected TV operators and advertisers to keep track of households watching a program and play relevant advertisements.
Additionally, it acquired a Paris-based TV attribution provider and ad monitoring company, TVTY. With the acquisition, NLSN expanded TV Attribution and Ad Intel services.
Further, the company’s content solutions arm, Gracenote introduced a content analytics tool named Audience Predict to help content distributors and owners predict the future of program performance and accordingly make strategic decisions that maximize return on programming investments.

MRVL may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.
That is because Marvell is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MRVL in this report.
In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 49 cents per share for MRVL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MRVL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.73% heading into earnings season.

Why is this Important?
A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).
Given that MRVL has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Marvell, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.

Marvell Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise

Factors to Note Ahead of Q4 Earnings
Marvell’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from solid demand for its networking products, primarily across data center and 5G infrastructure end markets.
During its third-quarter conference call, Marvell stated that it anticipates strong sequential revenues in the fourth quarter, driven by the substantial contribution from the cloud data center end market, accelerated 5G adoptions in the United States and other regions and broad growth across multiple products.
Marvell projects fiscal fourth-quarter revenues of $1.320 billion (+/- 3%). This suggests a year-over-year increase of 65% and sequential growth of 9%.
Additionally, 5G and cloud product ramp-ups and revenues from the recently acquired Inphi Corporation business might have favored MRVL’s overall performance during the quarter under review.
Record bookings and the ramp-up of multiple Ethernet design wins in upcoming vehicles are anticipated to have driven revenues significantly in the fiscal fourth quarter. The consumer and industrial businesses are likely to have put up an impressive show in the quarter under review.
However, certain ongoing supply-chain challenges are anticipated to have acted as headwinds, which might have curbed Marvell’s ability to fully meet the increase in demand for some of its product offerings.
Marvell expects the fourth-quarter non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 65%, while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated between $390 million and $395 million. The company forecasts to report non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately 48 cents (+/- 3 cents), representing year-over-year and sequential growth of approximately 66% and 12%, respectively.

 Broadcom Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
Broadcom Inc. price-eps-surprise | Broadcom Inc. Quote
 Let’s see how things have shaped up for Broadcom prior to this announcement:
Factors to Consider
Broadcom’s top-line growth is expected to have benefited from strong demand for its PON fiber in the broadband market, driven by the pandemic-induced work-from-home and online-learning waves. Continued solid demand for DOCSIS 3.1 cable modems has been a key catalyst.

Robust adoption of Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E for access gateways, courtesy of solid demand from homes, enterprises, telcos and other service providers, is expected to have contributed to revenue growth across the broadband end market in the fiscal fourth quarter.

Acceleration in 5G deployment, production ramp-up and increase in radio frequency content are expected to have driven top-line growth.

Broadcom’s fiscal first-quarter performance is likely to reflect synergies from the buyouts of CA and Symantec’s enterprise security business. The pandemic-induced work-from-home trend may have favored the adoption of cloud-based infrastructure software solutions, which is likely to get reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s top line.

These factors are anticipated to have aided Broadcom’s Infrastructure software revenues.

Broadcom is also benefiting from its partnership with Google Cloud.

2022-02-28 00:00:00+00:00,Why the Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue for Marvell (MRVL),MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-marvell-mrvl,,,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Marvell Technology (MRVL). This company, which is in the Zacks Technology Services industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.
When looking at the last two reports, this chipmaker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 11.42%, on average, in the last two quarters.
For the last reported quarter, Marvell came out with earnings of $0.43 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.38 per share, representing a surprise of 13.16%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.31 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.34 per share, delivering a surprise of 9.68%.
Price and EPS Surprise
With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Marvell. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Marvell currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.76%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on March 3, 2022.
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.
Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

2022-02-28 00:00:00+00:00,June 2023 Options Now Available For Marvell Technology (MRVL),MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/june-2023-options-now-available-for-marvell-technology-mrvl,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 2023 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 473 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new June 2023 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $67.50 strike price has a current bid of $13.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $67.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $53.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $68.88/share today.
Because the $67.50 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 20.59% return on the cash commitment, or 15.89% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $67.50 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $72.50 strike price has a current bid of $13.55. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $68.88/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $72.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 24.93% if the stock gets called away at the June 2023 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $72.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $72.50 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 42%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 19.67% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.18% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 59%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 53%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $68.88) to be 48%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.
