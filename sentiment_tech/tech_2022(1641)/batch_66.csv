One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.
In trading on Monday, shares of Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.0, after changing hands as low as $68.36 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 21.4. A bullish investor could look at MRVL's 28.0 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of MRVL shares:
Looking at the chart above, MRVL's low point in its 52 week range is $37.92 per share, with $93.85 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $68.55.

Chris Hill: Today on Motley Fool Money, we've got a closer look at some of the retailers investing in the last mile and some of the tech companies investing in the metaverse. All that and more coming up right now. I'm Chris Hill, joined by Motley Fool Senior Analyst, Emily Flippen. Thanks for being here.
Emily Flippen: Thanks for having me, Chris.
Chris Hill: We've also got surprising automotive news from the first day of CES, but we're going to begin with the future of food. This morning, KFC announced it will roll out a Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) version of its fried chicken nationwide starting next Monday. Shares of both Beyond Meat and KFC's parent company, Yum! Brands up slightly on this news. Emily, they started testing this in the summer of 2019. They've been working on this for a while, so you have to believe they're confident in this national launch.
Emily Flippen: I actually think they're not confident, Chris. The reason why I say that is because when I reflect on the last quarter for Beyond Meat and the way that management talked about their food service sales, that's the sales of their products in places like restaurants versus grocery stores. They are feeling was actually really tepid, and this was coming out at a time when they already had the partnership with Yum China's KFC in China, as well as with chains like Panda Express. I actually think the presser is on for Beyond Meat right now, because consumers and investors are looking at the partnerships they've made in the past in particular that with Dunkin Donuts and they are looking and asking themselves, ""Okay, well, is this going to be a thing that actually sticks around or is this going to be another Dunkin?"" As many investors will remember, Beyond Meat had a launch a couple of years ago with Dunkin, really publicized, had Snoop Dogg in it and it saw the Dunkin beyond sausage sandwiches rolled out nationwide, and earlier this year those were actually pulled back. They need this KFC launch to be really successful and they need that partnership to last longer than 9-12 months. They need that partnership to last for five,10 years into the future.
Chris Hill: I remember trying that Dunkin breakfast sandwich. I liked it and my problem with the sandwich was not the Beyond Meat sausage. It was actually the Dunkin part of it. But anyway, let's go back to the partnerships for a second because that's one of the questions I have about this business. You look at the stock, it is basically where it was on the first day it went public. It's been cut in half over the past year. What is going to drive this stock higher? Is it partnerships like this sticking around? Or is it the retail presence and really becoming more of a daily habit in everyday consumer lives?
Emily Flippen: In my opinion and as a shareholder of Beyond Meat, I think it's the partnerships with the foodservice at the restaurant in fast casual establishments, that is going to be the thing that will set Beyond Meat apart. If you actually look at fast foods supply chains, relationships between the suppliers and the change themselves have tended to be really sticky. There's a lot of work that goes into bringing a new product into a foodservice location. It's not done very quickly. You can actually look at the way that McDonald's started its partnership with Coke as an example.
They had this initial agreement decades ago, but its consents continued in this lock step motion and to this day, you can still only find Cokes and McDonald's. You'll never go to McDonald's and get a Pepsi. Once those relationships are formed, they tend to be pretty lasting. Now, this hasn't been the case for Beyond Meat thus far, again, pointing to that Dunkin partnership. But if they can get that type of decade's long lasting relationship with foodservice establishment, that's going to create really sticky, long-lasting partnerships that should result in some decent shareholder returns from this point out. The big question right now is, well, our foodservice establishments' really going to be buying into not just the non-meat alternatives, but Beyond Meat's non-meat alternatives.
Chris Hill: I'm really fascinated to see how this plays out now, because I'm thinking about what you said right at the top. Your belief is that, Beyond Meat is maybe not as confident in this launch. This is a nationwide launch. This is something that KFC tested in a couple of localities in the southeast part of the United States. They've got 4,000 restaurants across the US. Doesn't KFC at least have to be confident in this launch?
Emily Flippen: Typically when you have a foodservice establishment that is looking at a trend, you can look at the chicken sandwiches as an example. They want to act quickly, being the last person to act means that you've already lost the momentum behind the trend and the fact that it's taken so many years for Yum in the United States to really get behind Beyond Meat here and get behind this chicken product says to me one of two things. They're nervous about the staying power of this trend, or they're nervous about the quality of the products. Now that doesn't mean that this launch can't be successful. Again, as a shareholder, I really hope that it is, but the time that it has taken from initiation to creation is a little bit worrying to me.
Chris Hill: Shares of Nikola are up seven percent this morning. The EV company struck a deal with USA Truck logistics business. USA Truck will buy 10 of Nikola's electric trucks. Seems like a nice little deal, but what does it say about Nikola that the stock is up seven percent on a deal for just 10 trucks?
Emily Flippen: Well, it says a lot about the history of what it means to be the company that is Nikola. Let's take a step back for people who are not familiar with this carmaker. It was a business that went public in 2020. Had the goal of creating hydrogen fuel cell trucks and other electric vehicles for commercial sale. Shortly after its IPO, the Founder and CEO, Trevor Milton, was actually indicted for criminal and securities fraud, reportedly lying about nearly all aspects of the business. When you see the stock up on such a, what would normally be, say for business like Tesla, a small amount of news, it really just goes to show the very low amount of expectations that investors have for this business. Nikola still trying to come out of this controversy as a real carmaker. They're making some headway here. They delivered their first pilot trucks at the end of last year. That was the first step in the business to reach production in sales. The buy-in here, even in the only the amount of around 10 cars still says, ''Hey, maybe there's some opportunity for production to wrap up in this business.''
Chris Hill: You mentioned Tesla and I know that Tesla is the obvious comparison for any EV maker, but when I read this news, I actually thought about Ford Motor, because the F-150 Lightning electric truck is coming out this spring and the bad news for Nikola is they're not just competing against the likes of Tesla, they're now about to be in direct competition with Ford Motor and based on everything we've read, we'll see when it actually launches. But based on everything we've read so far, it seems like there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic about the new EV version of the F-150.
Emily Flippen: There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic about electric vehicles in general. We're seeing that tipping come in terms of adoption here. But these are still electric trucks that they're selling and as you mentioned, everyone in their docks right now are making electric cars, electric trucks. What was supposed to be the aspect that setting Nikola apart, was the fact that they were going to be making hydrogen fuel cell trucks. That was what was promised when they IPO-ed in 2020, they did pivot back toward electric vehicles because it was easier for them to get out and scale without needing the logistics and infrastructure for hydrogen fuel across the United States. They still want those hydrogen fuel cell trucks to be launched in 2023. I'd imagine that a lot of people who are still holding onto shares of Nikola, are owning these shares not under the premise that they're going to be the next Tesla or the next Ford in terms of their electric vehicle production, but in the belief that hydrogen and hydrogen fuel cell trucks can be the new long-way range that we use to transport machines and other items across the country. They haven't created that yet, so it's still very much in the air.
Chris Hill: The last thing before we move on. In terms of Nikola, you look at the stock, it's down about 65 percent off of its recent highs. I understand the enthusiasm for at least some investors out there who think, OK, there's this stock that's been beaten down, this is a nice deal they've struck here. Maybe this paves the way for more like this. Is it worth looking at their stock or are there enough question marks with the underlying business of Nikola that you just think to yourself, you know what? If you want to invest in EVs, there are better places for your investing dollars.
Emily Flippen: I tend to agree with the latter, Chris, which is, if you're interested in this space, there are companies that have proven out a bit stronger than Nikola has. That being said, if you are a purist in the world of hydrogen and you really believe that that's the future, then maybe you take a look at this company under the understanding that that concept and that technology has not been proven out yet and that that is going to be a very long-term investment as you wait for the technology to catch up to the ideas here. The important caveat I will add before moving on is that, when we talk about this story, again, that letter of intent from U.S. A. truck for 10 battery powered electric vehicles with an option to purchase 90 more over the next two years, it's vital to remember that there's a difference between a purchase order and a letter of intent. Nikola has done a great job in getting a lot of these letters of intent. It's wonderful, but it's not the same thing as that purchase order. It's more of an agreement that two parties want the same thing to happen. I want Nikola to do well, but whether or not those purchase orders come in, whether or not those deliveries happen, especially as they apply to the hydrogen business, I think is still very much in the air.
Chris Hill: Let's stick with automotive. Today's the first day of CES, largest consumer electronics show in the world, thousands of exhibitors in Las Vegas, and one of the trends we've seen over the past 5-10 years is the increasing presence of automakers at CES. Automotive news coming out of CES is not surprising. What is surprising is that today the automotive news out of CES is not from an automaker, it's from Sony, the consumer electronics companies. Sony rolled out the vision as electric SUV as apparently a direct challenge to Tesla. There are a couple of things I want to get to here, but first, what was your reaction to this story because mine was just utter surprise?
Emily Flippen: Well, my first reaction was forgetting that Sony was even still a publicly traded company that was apparently innovating on the backend here. The fact that Sony was even add CES to me was my immediate kind of, oh, I guess they're still around and I will tell you what Chris, and prepping for today's show I did take a look at that stock performance over the last couple of years and it's actually been pretty phenomenal. Now, whether or not Sony mobility, which is their separate division within Sony that will so focus solely on those electric vehicles, ends up being the thing that propels that stock price even higher over the next five years. I think I'm still not quite sold on the concept, but I was impressed by the fact that they were still apparently trucking, even though I had no idea what's happening on the backend.
Chris Hill: I got to say, I do like the fact that they are being very upfront about their ambition with respect to getting into the automotive space. So often, executive teams are trying to obfuscate in some way. They're being pretty direct about what their goal is. That said, this is a challenge that they're going to face, and by the way, Apple will face this too if they ever actually produce the much rumored Apple Car. Which is, why should I trust you with my safety? I think that's the challenge for any non-auto maker. Like just because I like your phone, doesn't mean I'm going to trust you to build a car that I feel safe driving around.
Emily Flippen: I'm actually interested in the fact that you came away from the story with the feeling that they weren't obfuscating their perspective on what they were going to do. Because only four months ago, Sony was saying, we are not interested in launching a commercial car. So from September 2021 to today in January 2022, something changed behind the scenes and that actually points to some of the issues I think that exists behind their capital allocation strategy, which is they just throw money at the wall and they see what sticks. This idea that they've been piloting for the past year was supposed to be focusing on the Sony sensors, and instead they've turned it into this entire vehicle division. To me it just begs the question of, well, why don't you use what your competitive advantage is?
When I'm looking at Sony, they could be innovative in creating an appliance or a plug-in that improves that customer experience of smart devices or electric vehicles, but I think they took a cop-out approach here by just taking their sensors, sticking them on an electric vehicle and saying, look, we're a car company now. I wish I had seen a bit more innovation, a bit more creativity on the backend. Something that would say, look, Sony is going to be the competitor here in this specific niche, because when I look at the potential for Apple's again to this space, obviously, Tesla being a big player. We just talked about Nikola and all these other businesses that are going to be competitors, I can't help but think, I don't see Sony coming out as a winner.
Chris Hill: I am glad you mentioned capital allocation because that was another thought I had. Again, as you mentioned, the last couple of years, the stock performance for Sony has been pretty strong, and one of my thoughts this morning was, really this is what you're going to put your money toward? Why don't you stick to your knitting in terms of consumer electronics, in terms of gaming? That sort of thing. Moving away from Sony because capital allocation is so important. The skill that any given executive team has with respect to capital allocation is one of those things that never shows up on the balance sheet directly, but it's such an important skill. If you and I are of the likemind, and I think we are, that Sony could be better at capital allocation than they are at the moment. What's a company or two that you look at and you think, that's a company that's doing it right in terms of the way that they invest their money, whether it's reinvesting in the business, paying a dividend, buying back shares? There are a lot of ways to allocate capital. What's the company or two you think that's doing it right?
Emily Flippen: When we talked about Sony taking a cop-out approach here, I'm probably going to be taking a cop-out approach with my answer. But I think probably one of the best capital allocators we can look at today is actually Amazon. I love to point that you make about capital allocation skills not showing up on the balance sheet. Because you know where they also don't show up? On the income statement, and Amazon got a lot of flak for decades about the fact that they weren't producing bottomline earnings, and a lot of that was because they were taking capital and reinvesting it pretty aggressively into their business. Now, the good thing is, is that the management team at Amazon had a pretty clear vision for what they imagine the company to be. Now that doesn't mean that all of the initiatives and the projects they put money behind succeeded. Clearly, they didn't. At the same time, the ones that did succeed were accretive to creating Amazon as a platform.
When I look at Sony and I look at where they've allocated capital, they've created numerous products. They're almost this conglomerate of interesting things that range from gaming, to media and movies, to disks, to memory sticks. But none of them point to Sony as a platform, Sony as a company, Sony as a brand, they all just exist independently. I think when you look at the difference of the way that capital is allocated across these two businesses, you have one that was done in a way to build up the Amazon brand, build up the Amazon experience. Whereas Sony was just trying to grow their top-line with no reflection upon whether or not that capital is really going to be paying dividends for lack of better words over the next few decades.
Chris Hill: Senior Analyst Emily Flippen, thanks so much for being here.
Emily Flippen: Thanks for having me, Chris.
Chris Hill: It wouldn't be the start of a new year for investors if we didn't get the mother of all predictions from the financial media. Here with some thoughts on that as well as some trends to watch is Motley Fool Senior Analyst Jason Moser. Thanks for being here.
Jason Moser: Hey, thanks for having me.
Chris Hill: Now in fairness, we made predictions for 2022, on last Friday's episode above info money but the one that gets the most headlines is the question, will the stock market go up in 2022? And I get it. It's natural to ask that question. It's natural to wonder that if you're an investor but if you're focused on the long term, one-year doesn't matter.
Jason Moser: Yes. I agree with you. It reminds me something I was thinking of earlier that in the near-term, stock price is not really a very good indicator, its not a reliable indicator of how a given business may be performing. Whatever, however you want to call it. It. It's almost like the psychological state of the market at any given point in time but as you noted, it's a fun question to deliberate is when we get every year, it's when we ask every year. It is, I think, fun to start the conversation. Everybody is hitting reset at the New Year and wanting to think about what the market may do. Obviously the market coming off of a very strong performance here in 2021, I think up better than 28 percent with dividends and everything included. It's going to be difficult to match that performance. It's worth remembering for investors that on average the market has a down year, one of every three years and the last down year was 2018. One could argue that maybe we're due for a down year. I said on Motley Fool Money, I wouldn't be surprised if we did have a down year. We've got a lot of things coming into play here this year in regard to inflation and interest rates and getting off of the stimulus from the last couple of years. Maybe that presents some headwinds. We'll have to wait and see. Of course but yeah, your point I think is spot on their one year in the frame of how we invest. Just really, I don't want to say it doesn't matter, but honestly it doesn't matter.
Chris Hill: Let's get to a few trends that investors might want to keep their eyes on this year and we'll start with something that is a concept we've talked about for years on this show. The idea of the last mile with more and more companies delivering. This is something that Amazon has invested in over the past decade. Now some people are starting to wonder about a business like Shopify, which has steadily grown over the last few years. Shopify hasn't really gotten into that last mile of delivering stuff to people's homes but I'm curious how you're thinking about the last mile in the year ahead. As a shareholder of Shopify, if you would be applauding Shopify, really investing in that last mile.
Jason Moser: Well, I do think that Shopify is going to continue investing in that last mile. They're just doing it very slowly. They acquired a little while back six River Systems, that's something to help in their fulfillment aspirations they're targeting. Investing over one billion dollars over the next several years but the bottom line is they are taking it very slow. This is a conscious decision on their part. They wanted to be done right. They want it to be done in accordance with what their merchant customers actually need. I absolutely appreciate that they're doing it. I think it makes a lot of sense for them, but it's also interesting to see how different businesses are approaching this problem in different ways. You look at Etsy, which is taking a little bit of a different tag there. They have essentially appeared a peer fulfillment design. They basically put the Onus on the merchant to get the shipping done.
That's why you don't see these today guarantees often when it comes to Etsy, because Etsy doesn't really control that. They want to let their best merchants rise to the top there. You look at a company like Wayfair. Wayfair continues to invest big money in its fulfillment infrastructure there. The CastleGate warehouses, they obviously getting furniture from point A to point B is a difficult value proposition. They've needed to invest in that fulfillment infrastructure to be able to whittle down that time and distance. Then another company we've talked about recently to Lowe's. Lowe's is building out this market delivery model, which essentially just the big and bulky products will flow directly from the supply chain to the customers homes without ever flowing through the store. You see different companies attacking this from different angles. But generally speaking, I think it's going to be something that consumers will only care more and more about. I think E-commerce and shipments, fulfillment, that's only going to become more and more important for businesses as time goes on.
Chris Hill: Over the past 12 months. The phrase global supply chain has been ordered more times than anyone can possibly count. It's something that's going to continue to be a challenge, at least in the first half of 2022. Semiconductors, we're really at the center of that. How are you thinking about semiconductors this year and what should investors expect?
Jason Moser: I look at semiconductors as increasingly more and more attractive opportunity. I think a lot of that really just boils down to the evolution of technology, the rollout of 5G, the subsequent Gs to come. Maybe it doesn't end with 5G, we're going to see six and seven and so on as time goes on. That's cyclicality window, I think for semiconductors is really shrinking as everything becomes more and more connected. Playing into the Internet of things, idea, things like Artificial Intelligence, machine learning. Everything is just relying more and more on technology. I think we're going to see that cyclicality window continue to shrink and we're going to see, I think a lot of businesses, the biggest and the best really rise to the top. In regard to the supply chain crunch immediate. It's something that certainly is going to be at the forefront of the conversation for the first half of this year.
I wouldn't be surprised to see it bleed into the back half of the year but we see companies talking about the biggest and the best being Marvell, for example, on their most recentearnings calltoward supply was used 35 times that AMD? It was used 30 times. Remember, AMD is bringing Xilinx into the fold this year. That closing has been delayed slightly due to Chinese regulators actually giving the deal a little bit of a closer look, but it is still scheduled to close. I think we're going to see some more consolidation in the space. It's definitely something these chipmakers, are talking a lot about. I think gives investors a lot of opportunity in this space. Look for the biggest and the best in the space. They're going to be able to cope with this better than others. As time goes on, it looks like an increasingly attractive space because of the connected nature of everything.
Chris Hill: Real quick, before we wrap up, let's talk about the Metaverse. For all the jokes that were made about Facebook changing its name to Meta Platforms. When you get past the humor and you look at what they are attempting and the opportunity, not just for Meta Platforms, but for so many different businesses. We can talk about a couple of them. How are you thinking about investing opportunities in the Metaverse?
Jason Moser: I think that for now, I think the Metaverse really, it's going to boil down to really big tech and their aspirations in the near-term. This is really still a fairly new concept, but we're going to talk more and more about it as time goes on. It's already you think in many ways, but it will continue to morph and develop. I think the bigger challenge right now is perhaps the physical interface getting something that can take us into this Metaverse without just being bulky and uncomfortable. Some places we could stay for long periods of time. For those who want to do that. That I think it's going to still take a little while.
We get a lot of companies out there really working toward that goal. From Qualcomm to Apple and everywhere in between but then I think also you see these just so many other businesses out there. They are going to be part of creating this Metaverse. I think Unity Software, GM of Unity creators, he's name is Mark [inaudible 00:24:50] best, the Metaverse is going to be built by millions of content creators. Unity Software is on a mission to give them the tools to be able to build their visions, bring those visions to life. I think that they're going to be a lot of opportunities. It's not going to be Meta wins the Metaverse or Alphabet wins the Metaverse. I think the 3D internet really sums it up well. I think from that perspective we're going to see a lot of winners but it's a space that's going to take some time to develop. I think.
Chris Hill: I'm glad you mentioned Alphabet because it's hard to imagine a business that big with pockets that deep isn't going to be doubling in this space along with another business like Apple.
Jason Moser: Indeed.
Chris Hill: Jason Moser. Thanks a lot for being here.
Jason Moser: Thank you.

2022-01-21 00:00:00+00:00,"Lumen (LUMN) Wins $1.2B Contract, Revamps USDA's IT Services",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lumen-lumn-wins-%241.2b-contract-revamps-usdas-it-services,,,"Lumen Technologies, Inc. LUMN has clinched a network services contract worth more than $1.2 billion from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). Per this 11-year task order, Lumen will be responsible for deploying a fully integrated wide-area data transport service across the United States and abroad, thereby securely revamping USDA's IT services.

Lumen will capitalize on its avant-garde edge computing architecture and vast fiber connectivity to provide cloud connectivity and contact center solutions to more than 9,500 USDA locations. Boasting a long history of working with various government organizations, Lumen aims to introduce advanced technology solutions while facilitating USDA to bolster economic development and conserve America’s natural resources as part of the latest contract.

The task order includes 10 one-year options and has an initial term through Sep 30, 2022. Markedly, the deal was awarded to Lumen under the General Services Administration's 15-year, $50 billion Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions program. It is worth mentioning that Lumen platform's edge computing architecture will aid USDA in collecting and analyzing data closer to the edge of the network with secure remote access. As a result, this will significantly save bandwidth and minimize latency.

As part of this agreement, Lumen will deliver managed security, voice and managed network offerings with speeds up to 100 Gbps. Some of these are zero-trust networking solutions, virtual private network services, unified communications and collaboration solutions, optical wavelength solutions, software-defined wide area network services (SD-WAN) and ethernet transport. These robust solutions will allow around 100,000 USDA employees to manage forestry and rural economic development and vital farming services with utmost efficiency.

Lumen’s fiber and IP-based network capacity positions it well to support customers and boost shareholders’ value in the long term. The company is likely to capitalize on key opportunities, such as data security, IoT, Big Data, 5G, AI and edge computing for revenue growth. The company aims to transform its business operations through product evolution and digitization of customer interactions, which augurs well for revenue growth.

Lumen introduced Dynamic Connections as part of its Cloud Connect portfolio and is working on the global expansion of its SD-WAN solutions while expanding its platform to cloud service and software-as-a-service providers. It is focused on generating revenue growth in its business markets and expects the scale of its global assets and innovative product portfolio to be accretive to earnings. The company is working with customers to enable their 5G roadmaps while extending its fiber footprint.

At the same time, Lumen is focused on bringing improved operational efficiencies through a number of methods, including network simplification and rationalization. This should help the company improve its end-to-end provisioning time and drive standardization. Lumen has been trying to establish itself as a global leader in cloud infrastructure and hosted IT solutions arena designed for enterprise customers.

Moreover, the company’s strong network capabilities, integrated hosting and network solutions are likely to promote growth in the cloud business. The company’s managed and cloud services are key differentiators from other players in the market. Also, investing in growth through product and network expansions, delivering enhanced customer experience across the business and deleveraging to strengthen its balance sheet remain key priorities.

Based on these strategic endeavors, Lumen expects the revenue trajectory to improve in the long run. The Monroe, LA-based communications company’s Quantum Fiber platform and IP-based network capacity also position it well to support customers.

Lumen currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its shares have gained 7.9% against the industry’s fall of 56.7% in the past year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

2022-01-21 00:00:00+00:00,"Top Analyst Reports for Walmart, Micron & Enbridge",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-analyst-reports-for-walmart-micron-enbridge,,,"Friday, January 21, 2022
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Walmart Inc. (WMT), Micron Technology, Inc. (MU), and Enbridge Inc. (ENB). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>
Shares of Walmart have underperformed the Zacks Supermarkets industry over the past year (-1.9% vs. +0.5%). Walmart has been encountering supply chain issues, inflation and rising labor costs that are hurting margins. The Zacks analyst, however, believes that a strong inventory position, increased contributions from advertising revenues and lower markdowns will offset inflationary pressures.
As more customers and members return to stores and clubs, the demand is likely to remain strong. WMT continues to benefit from solid omni-channel endeavors as well as last-mile delivery capabilities. Walmart is also gaining from its sturdy comp sales record, driven by its constant omnichannel efforts.
(You can read the full research report on Walmart here >>>)
Micron shares have gained +25.5% over the past three months against the Zacks Semiconductors industry’s gain of +26.1%, however, things seem to be improving for it. The Zacks analyst believes that Micron has been witnessing steady growth in demand for memory chips from cloud-computing providers as well as an acceleration in 5G cellular network adoptions.
Better customer engagement and an improving cost structure are other major growth drivers. Adoption of 5G beyond mobile is likely to spur demand for memory and storage, particularly in Internet of Things devices. Micron’s near-term profitability, however, is likely to hurt by planned salary hikes. High level of customer inventory in the cloud, graphics and enterprise market remains another concern for Micron.
(You can read the full research report on Micron here >>>)
Shares of Enbridge have gained +11% in the last six months against the Zacks Oil Production and Pipeline industry’s gain of +9.5%. A significant portion of ENB’s earnings is generated from transportation operations, driven by a string of long-term contracts. The Zacks analyst believes that a huge contract base is likely to provide Enbridge stable cash flows in the coming years.
With significant portion of its assets being contracted by shippers for long term, ENB’s business model is less susceptible to oil price volatility. From 2022 through 2024, it expects to generate C$9 billion from midstream growth capital projects. A huge debt exposure, however, remains a concern.

2022-01-19 00:00:00+00:00,5G Stocks To Watch Following The Latest Spectrum Auction,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5g-stocks-to-watch-following-the-latest-spectrum-auction,,,"Our theme of select 5G Stocks – which includes U.S.-based companies that stand to benefit from the ongoing transition of the wireless industry to 5G – returned a solid 26% over 2021, roughly in line with the broader S&P 500, although it has remained roughly flat year to date, compared to the S&P 500 which has declined about -2%. The growth is driven by strong demand for 5G network and testing equipment as carriers doubled down on 5G deployment plans. For perspective, Gartner forecast that 5G network revenues would rise by about 39% year-over-year to about $19.1 billion in 2021, up from $13.7 billion in 2020.
Things are likely to hold up over 2022, as well. Carriers are investing further in 5G wireless spectrum with the Federal Communications Commission recently indicating that it had raised over $22.5 billion via the auction of mid-band spectrum bands that previously had been used by the military, with AT&T and Dish emerging as the biggest spenders. This recent auction would take the total spending by the wireless industry on 5G spectrum to over $100 billion. The massive spectrum investments are likely to be followed by higher spending on deployment, which should bode well for the companies in our theme.
Within our theme, Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ:MRVL), a semiconductor solutions company, has been the strongest performer with its stock rising by about 63.5% over the last 12 months. On the other side, U.S. wireless behemoth Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has been the weakest performer in our theme, with its stock down by about -7% over the last 12 months.
Below you’ll find our previous coverage of the 5G theme where you can track our view over time.
[10/22/2021] Marvell, Teradyne: Are 5G Stocks Worth A Look Despite Near-term Headwinds?
Our indicative theme of 5G Stocks – which includes U.S.-based companies that stand to benefit from the ongoing transition of the wireless industry to 5G – is up by about 19% year-to-date, marginally underperforming to the S&P 500 which is up by about 21% over the same period. However, the theme has meaningfully outperformed from the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, rising by almost 97% since the end of February 2020, compared to a return of around 53% on the S&P 500.
While Apple’s new upgraded 5G iPhone 13 handsets and attractive carrier promotions are likely to drive the adoption of 5G services in North America, some companies in the theme are being weighed down by the ongoing semiconductor shortage and logistical issues, which is hurting their ability to cater to demand. That said, the longer-term outlook for the theme remains strong, as 5G is likely to find broad applications well beyond smartphones, in areas such as industrial automation, driverless cars, healthcare, and smart cities. The U.S. government is also prioritizing 5G as it looks to get a leg up over China, which is seen as one of the leaders in the 5G space. Research firm CCS Insight estimates that global 5G connections will triple this year to 637 million and more than double to around 1.34 billion connections next year.
Within our theme, Marvell Technology Group (MRVL), a semiconductor solutions company, has been the strongest performer with its stock rising by about 40% year-to-date. On the other side, Teradyne (TER), a company that provides automatic test equipment, has been the weakest performer, with its stock down by about 2% year-to-date.
[4/9/2021] How Is The Semiconductor Shortage Impacting 5G Stocks?
Our indicative theme of 5G Stocks – which includes U.S.-based companies that stand to benefit from the ongoing transition of the wireless industry to 5G – is up by about 8% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 9% over the same period. The theme has outperformed since the end of 2019, rising by about 45%, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 27% over the same period. So what’s the outlook like for the theme?
While longer-term demand for 5G products is likely to be robust, with carriers doubling down on 5G spectrum and smartphone makers pushing lower-priced 5G  handsets, there could be some near-term headwinds for the industry due to the global shortage of semiconductors. Although the automotive industry has borne the brunt of the shortage thus far, the issue appears to be spilling over to the telecom space as well, given that semiconductors are at the heart of smartphones and wireless networking products.
The shortage is having a mixed impact on the various companies in our theme. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) has been the strongest performer, rising by about 24% year-to-date, considering that the company operates some of its own fabs, reducing its exposure to the current supply crunch. Qorvo stock has also fared well, rising by about 16% year-to-date, as the company also operates its own foundries which should give it adequate supply, while potentially benefiting from higher pricing. On the other hand, modem supplier Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which is a fabless semiconductor company that depends on third parties to produce its chips, has been the worst performer as it struggles to keep up with demand. The stock has declined by about 8% this year.
[3/4/2021] Will 5G Stocks Benefit From Spectrum Auctions? 
Our indicative theme of 5G Stocks – which includes U.S.-based companies that stand to benefit from the ongoing transition of the wireless industry to 5G – is down by about -1.6% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 2% over the same period. However, the theme has outperformed since the end of 2019, rising by about 32%, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 19%. Within our theme, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) has been the strongest performer, rising by about 15% year-to-date. On the other side, Qualcomm (QCOM) has fared the worst, declining by about -14%. Here’s a rundown of some of the recent developments in the 5G space, and how could they impact the stocks in our theme.
Smartphone sales rebounded in Q4 2020, rising by about 4.3% year-over-year per IDC, after seeing a decline in the earlier part of 2020, indicating that 2021 could be a stronger year for the smartphone market. Moreover, premium vendor Apple, which has moved its entire flagship line-up to 5G, emerged as the largest smartphone vendor by volume and this is likely to speed up the industry’s shift to the new technology. Separately, the 5G C-band spectrum auctions conducted by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission a few weeks ago were much stronger than expected, with bids totaling a record $81 billion, ahead of the previous FCC auction record of about $45 billion. For perspective, this time around, Verizon alone has committed $45 billion towards the spectrum. Although it could take some time before carriers start deploying these airwaves,  it does underscore just how vital 5G is for carriers and should potentially help to drive sales of 5G equipment and infrastructure in the coming quarters.
[2/2/2021] 5G Will Come Of Age In 2021. Which 5G Stocks Should You Pick?
5G wireless technology is likely to see more widespread adoption through 2021, as Apple scales up production of its 5G equipped iPhone 12, with other players like Samsung launching more mass-market versions of their 5G smartphones. Wireless carriers are also likely to invest in improving 5G coverage, particularly for the faster version of the technology called mmWave, which is largely restricted to urban areas at the moment. The growing adoption of 5G is likely to help a range of companies including semiconductor companies, tower infrastructure companies, testing equipment manufacturers, and wireless carriers.  Our indicative theme of 5G Stocks – which includes U.S.-based companies that stand to benefit from 5G upgrades – is up by about 8% year-to-date, compared to a 0.6% gain for the S&P 500. Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) – a radio frequency chip provider – has been the strongest performer in our theme, rising by about 20% year-to-date, driven by strong quarterly results and soaring demand from Apple, its largest customer. On the other hand, U.S. wireless behemoth Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has been the worst performer, declining by about -8% year-to-date, as its subscriber and revenue growth over the most recent quarter fell below street estimates.
[Updated 11/25/2020] 5G Stocks Benefit From iPhone 12 Tailwinds
5G has emerged as a hot investment theme this year. While major U.S. carriers have been upgrading to the next-gen technology for over a year now, consumer adoption is also likely to pick up meaningfully as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has embraced the technology relatively early in the cycle, equipping its entire flagship iPhone 12 line-up with 5G radios. Carriers are also heavily promoting 5G devices, with the new iPhones effectively available for free for subscribers with trade-ins and some other commitments. As 5G adoption grows, it should have a positive impact on demand across a wide range of companies, ranging from semiconductor players, tower infrastructure companies, testing equipment manufacturers, and wireless carriers. Moreover, 5G technology is likely to find much broader applications beyond smartphones, potentially in areas such as industrial automation, driverless cars, healthcare, and smart cities. Our indicative theme of 5G Stocks – which includes U.S. listed companies that stand to benefit from 5G upgrades – is up by 27% year-to-date, compared to an 11% gain for the S&P 500. Qualcomm (QCOM) was the biggest driver of the theme’s return, as it rallied by 68% year-to-date. On the other side, Verizon (VZ) stock is down by about 2% year-to-date.
[Updated 10/7/2020] Verizon, Qualcomm, Qorvo: Stocks To Watch As Apple Preps 5G iPhones
Our indicative theme of 5G stocks – which includes semiconductor players, tower infrastructure companies, testing equipment providers, and wireless carriers that stand to gain from the next-generation networks –  is up by about 19% year-to-date, versus 5.5% for the S&P 500 as of 10/7/2020. While 5G wireless networks are being rolled out in the U.S. and other developed markets, mainstream adoption of the technology is likely to gather pace as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) – one of the largest and most iconic smartphone vendors – is set to unveil its first set of 5G handsets next week. Below, we provide a bit more about some of the companies in our theme, how the 5G upgrade cycle could benefit them, and how they have fared thus far in 2020.
Qualcomm (QCOM), one of the largest modem and mobile processor vendors, is seen as a leader in 5G wireless technology. The company could see sales pick up as smartphone behemoth Apple is widely expected to use Qualcomm’s modems in its new iPhones. The stock is up 38% year-to-date.
Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) sells analog semiconductors that include power amplifiers, front-end modules, and radio frequency (RF) products that go into mobile and wireless devices as well as wireless infrastructure equipment. The company counts Apple as one of its biggest customers. The stock is up 23% this year.
Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO)also supplies RF components to smartphone players such as Apple, as well as to the infrastructure, and defense space. The stock is up 13% this year.  (See our analysis Is Skyworks A Better Bet Than Qorvo?)
American Tower Corp (AMT), the largest U.S.-based tower leasing company, is structured as a real estate investment trust (REIT). Tower companies stand to gain from 5G considering that antennas and other equipment for 5G are heavier and larger, meaning that rentals could also be higher. The stock is up about 6% year-to-date.
Verizon (VZ) , one of the largest U.S. wireless carriers, stands to benefit from 5G related subscriber additions and potentially improved pricing for 5G plans. The stock has remained roughly flat year-to-date.
Keysight Technologies (KEYS)provides electronics test and measurement equipment and software targeted at the wireless sector. Keysight should benefit as the 5G rollout gathers speed globally, as equipment and chip manufacturers who want to design and develop 5G products likely require its testing and measuring solutions. The stock is down 3% year-to-date.

2022-01-19 00:00:00+00:00,"Unusual Options Activity in Marvell Technology (MRVL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Bausch Health Companies (BHC)",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/unusual-options-activity-in-marvell-technology-mrvl-nvidia-nvda-and-bausch-health,,,"Unusual Options Activity in Marvell Technology, Inc. (MRVL)
Today, January 19, 2022, in the market capitalization-weighted index NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite (NasdaqGS), we saw unusual or noteworthy options trading volume and activity in Marvell Technology, Inc. (MRVL), which opened at $78.34.
There were 5,300 contracts traded on the $100 strike call option bought to open at the ask, dated for March 18, 2022
These orders come just before Marvell pays out its dividend on January 26, 2022
Seen above are the noteworthy options in Marvell from the Unusual Whales flow.
Please note, trades that are struck through have been canceled for one reason or another. Trades can be modified or nullified for a variety of reasons, and per the SEC: for the maintenance of a fair and orderly market.
Exchanges can erroneously send more trades than were actually placed, especially during times of high volume. This is a normal occurrence.
The charts above represent Marvell’s option flow data with regards to the last 250 trades of the most sizable orders.
69.9% of the premium traded is in calls, with 67.4% as ask-side orders, with only 15.7% of the volume of options trades being in puts. The put call ratio for Marvell is 0.394.
A tip from the flow:  The put/call ratio (P/C) is put volume divided by call volume.  Put/call ratio is important and can be an indication of sentiment shifting. A P/C greater than .7 means more puts are being bought than calls, so the trend is getting bearish. A P/C of .7 to .5 is becoming more bullish.

Unusual Options Activity in NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)
Again in the NasdaqGS, we saw unusual activity in NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), which opened today at $260.79.
There were 1,357 contracts traded on the $230 strike put option, bought to open at the ask, dated for January 28, 2022.
Seen above are the noteworthy options in NVIDIA from the Unusual Whales flow.
A tip from the flow: Trades appended with a briefcase emoji can be intuited as bought or sold to open. This determination is made if the size of the trade was greater than the chain's open interest.  Only trades that can be positively identified as being bought or sold to open will be marked as such (with the briefcase).  Be mindful! Trades without the briefcase emoji might still have been bought or sold to open!  You may also watch this video to see how to track these kinds of opportunities in the Unusual Whales flow.
Furthermore, just because these orders were indeed opened, it cannot be absolutely known whether these calls were sold to open or bought to open; however, they were traded at and in some cases above the ask, so assuming long, bought to open positions is often what intuition tells us.
The charts above represent NVIDIA’s option flow data with regards to every trade in the flow at different levels of premium traded: $5,000, $15,000, $30,000, and $200,000.
53.90% of the premium traded at the $30,000 levels are in bullish bets, with a great majority of betting, however, being in put premiums. Furthermore, the $5,000 premium levels are in bullish premiums at 52.20%, with $3M more in put premium traded then in calls.
Reuters recently reported that “retail investors show signs of fatigue after last year's trading frenzy.”

Unusual Options Activity in Bausch Health Companies Inc. (BHC)
Finally, among the underlying components of the NYSE, we saw unusual or noteworthy options trading volume and activity in Bausch Health Companies Inc. (BHC), which opened today at $26.66.
There were a series of orders on the $18 and $20 strike call options dated for February 18, 2022
The open interest on these chains were between 7 and 57 open contracts as of today’s open, so this surge in volume is noteworthy and significant
It must be noted that these are not necessarily liquid chains with a wide bid-ask spread, sometimes more than a dollar wide, such as in the case of the first set of orders on the $18 calls; therefore, while these orders came in close to the bid, or even a mid price, it cannot be rightly ascertained if they were, in fact, bought or sold to open
Seen above are the noteworthy options in Bausch Health from the Unusual Whales flow.
These orders come after Zacks Equity Research reported that Bausch Health “has announced that its eye care business, Bausch + Lomb Corporation is going public in the United States and Canada.”
The chart above represents Bausch Health’s historical price in cyan, call volume in green, put volume in red, and open interest in blue.
Of interest, these orders were marked as “floor.” On the Unusual Whales blog is a report on floor traders' performance. Floor traders work on the floor of an exchange.  When a floor trader executes a trade, exclusively for their own account, it must be reported on an exchange by the ""floor"" tag.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-01-14 00:00:00+00:00,How The Parts Add Up: EUSA Headed For $101,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-the-parts-add-up%3A-eusa-headed-for-%24101,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares MSCI USA Equal Weighted ETF (Symbol: EUSA), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $101.08 per unit.
With EUSA trading at a recent price near $87.59 per unit, that means that analysts see 15.41% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of EUSA's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL), Lucid Group Inc (Symbol: LCID), and Entegris Inc (Symbol: ENTG). Although MRVL has traded at a recent price of $78.65/share, the average analyst target is 24.78% higher at $98.14/share. Similarly, LCID has 24.77% upside from the recent share price of $41.41 if the average analyst target price of $51.67/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ENTG to reach a target price of $161.12/share, which is 22.23% above the recent price of $131.82. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MRVL, LCID, and ENTG:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
iShares MSCI USA Equal Weighted ETF EUSA $87.59 $101.08 15.41%
Marvell Technology Inc MRVL $78.65 $98.14 24.78%
Lucid Group Inc LCID $41.41 $51.67 24.77%
Entegris Inc ENTG $131.82 $161.12 22.23%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2022-01-04 00:00:00+00:00,Strong Growth Rate to Pull Marvell Through Roughage,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/strong-growth-rate-to-pull-marvell-through-roughage,,,"Major semiconductor player Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) designs, develops, and markets analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits, among various other products.
The company primarily serves high-growth areas such as infrastructure, data center, enterprise, automotive and industrial markets.
Why Marvell?
Marvell’s compelling portfolio of products, and its expansion, have helped the company execute its operations consistently. Currently, Marvell enjoys one of the highest revenue growth rates over the long term, among large-cap semiconductor companies.
Notably, the company expects that its serviceable addressable market (SAM) in the cloud/5G/automotive domain will expand from $10.9 billion in 2021 to $18.9 billion in 2024, witnessing a 20% CAGR.
Recently, Needham analyst Quinn Bolton, who also happens to be one of Wall Street’s top analysts -- with a No. 1 ranking on TipRanks -- gathered a few key points that he believes make MRVL stock a good bet.
“We estimate Marvell will organically grow revenue by (greater than) 30% in CY22 and by (approximately) 20% in CY23, the fastest growth among its large-cap peers, driven by new design wins for its 5nm platform, market share gains, and increasing supply from its major wafer foundry, substrate and assembly and test partners,” reasoned Bolton.
The analyst believes that the valuation of the MRVL stock is likely to go up as investors focus on the fastest-growing companies.
The analyst reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and raised its price target to $115 from $100.
Infrastructure Exposure, an Insulator
Bolton is particularly impressed with Marvell’s focus on the development of cloud-optimized silicon products for infrastructure markets. One of the major drivers of the company’s growth is that a large chunk of Marvell’s revenues come from infrastructure markets, which makes the company’s top line enjoy a significant buffer against “any period of semiconductor or cloud inventory digestion over the next couple of years.”
The analyst believes that a slowdown of growth rates across the semiconductor industry this year will be a blessing in disguise for Marvell, as semiconductor stock investors are likely to play safe with high secular growth rate stocks like Marvell.
The rest of the Street seems to be positive about Marvell, with a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 22 Buys and two Holds. The Marvell stock prediction gives an average price target of $102.04, indicating 15.5% upside potential.

2022-01-04 00:00:00+00:00,Could Marvell Technology Become the Next Nvidia?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/could-marvell-technology-become-the-next-nvidia,,,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is one of the most popular technology companies on the stock market at the moment, with a market capitalization of nearly $730 billion.
Shares of the graphics card specialist have appreciated tremendously in the past five years as the demand for its products has exploded thanks to their application in several verticals, including gaming PCs (personal computers), gaming consoles, data centers, and self-driving cars, among others.
However, Nvidia's stock market rally has made it quite expensive at 92 times trailing earnings and 58 times forward earnings. Nvidia also has a rich sales multiple of 31. So investors looking to get into this hot tech stock will have to pay a heavy premium to buy into its terrific top- and bottom-line growth.
NVDA data by YCharts
Wouldn't it be great if investors could get their hands on a company that's expected to grow at a faster pace than Nvidia and is trading at a cheaper valuation? Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) stock is one such candidate -- it is not only cheaper than Nvidia, but it has the potential to outperform its more illustrious peer in the long run. Here's why.
Marvell Technology is serving several fast-growing markets
Nvidia's dominance of the GPU (graphics processing unit) space and the application of graphics cards in computers, data centers, and cars, among other use cases, have been the driving forces behind the company's rapid growth. Marvell Technology, similarly, supplies its chips to several fast-growing markets such as data centers, automotive/industrial, telecom, enterprise networking, and consumer.
Marvell's chips play a mission-critical role in these end markets. For instance, the company allows data center operators to increase bandwidth, reduce operating and capital costs, deploy high-performance computing applications, and take advantage of networked storage to increase cost and performance efficiencies.
Image source: Getty Images.
Not surprisingly, the company's data center chips are flying off the shelves, as evident from Marvell's fiscal 2022 third-quarter results, which were released on Dec. 2, 2021. Marvell's data center revenue jumped 109% year over year to $500 million in Q3, though it is worth noting that the segment's revenue growth was aided by the acquisition of Innovium. Marvell's Q3 data center revenue included 25 days of revenue from Innovium, but the company also pointed out that the segment also reported impressive growth on a stand-alone basis.
Marvell sees its data center business getting bigger in the future, as the company ""has been winning a large number of incremental cloud-optimized silicon designs, and these are now in development."" Marvell also has a $500 million revenue opportunity within the data center storage business for its storage accelerators. The company has already scored its first design win in this space, and its manufacturing partner has already announced the availability of products using its storage accelerators.
Looking ahead, Marvell sees stronger adoption of its storage accelerators, and this bodes well for its data center business, which supplied 41% of its revenue last quarter. Similarly, the carrier infrastructure business is on fire for Marvell thanks to the deployment of 5G networks.
Revenue from the carrier infrastructure business, which produced 18% of total revenue, increased 28% year over year in the third quarter to $215 million. This was ahead of what Marvell was expecting on account of 5G deployments. What's more, Marvell sees its carrier infrastructure business accelerating 40% year over year in the current quarter, with additional gains in the cards going forward on account of new design wins and content gains.
Coming to the enterprise networking business, which generated 20% of Marvell's top line last quarter, the company is benefiting from the growing adoption of ethernet switches. The segment's revenue increased 56% year over year to $247 million, and most of that growth was organic. Marvell sees this segment accelerating 60% year over year this quarter thanks to market share gains and recovery in enterprise spending.
In all, Marvell sees its end-market opportunity expanding to $30 billion in 2024 from $20 billion last year. What's more, the company is looking at annual revenue growth of 15% to 20% over the long run, driven primarily by its growth in the 5G, cloud, and automotive markets.
A better bet than Nvidia?
While Marvell is promising impressive long-term revenue growth, Wall Street is also anticipating rapid earnings growth. According to consensus estimates, Marvell's earnings could increase at an annual pace of 42% for the next five years. For perspective, Marvell is on track to finish fiscal 2022 with earnings of $1.55 per share, which would be a 68% increase over last year.
As such, it wouldn't be surprising to see Marvell's earnings grow at such a high rate in the coming years, especially considering the opportunities it is sitting on. If Marvell's earnings grow at the rate that Wall Street is forecasting, the company could generate annual earnings of nearly $8.95 per share at the end of the five-year forecast period.
Marvell has a forward earnings multiple of 38.6. Assuming a similar earnings multiple at the end of five years, its stock price could jump to $345 given the projected earnings at the end of the forecast period. That would translate into 295% gains from Marvell's closing stock price on Dec. 31.
Moreover, Marvell is way cheaper than Nvidia, as the forward earnings multiple indicates. Additionally, it trades at 17 times sales, which is a significant discount to Nvidia's sales multiple. Throw in the fact that Wall Street expects Marvell's earnings to grow at a faster pace over the next five years compared to Nvidia's projected annual earnings growth of 39%, and investors have solid reasons to buy Marvell Technology stock -- it offers better growth prospects at a substantially lower valuation.

2022-01-03 00:00:00+00:00,Marvell Technology: “Game-Changing” Earnings Call Suggests Upside,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/marvell-technology%3A-game-changing-earnings-call-suggests-upside,,,"Marvell Technology (MRVL) offers data infrastructure semiconductor solutions spanning the compute, networking, security, and storage segments. I am bullish on the stock. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)
In the proliferating data economy, microchips are in short supply but in high demand. However, so are other technology components and services which revolve around those chips.
That's where Marvell Technology comes into play. MRVL stock is among the most diversified chip-centered assets you could possibly own, as the company's product lineup is replete with practically everything from automotive transceivers, bridges, and switches to ethernet controllers and adapters.
The good news is that you don't have to be extremely tech-savvy to appreciate Marvell's value to its shareholders. In light of a terrificearnings call- and with some analyst-driven insights - we can all marvel at Marvell Technology's progress.
A Watershed Quarter
December 3, 2021, was a great day for Marvell Technology and its investors. MRVL stock surged more than 17% on that day, marking its best day since 2008.
This might seem like a counterintuitive result, given Marvell's third-quarter fiscal data, which had been issued the previous day.
During that quarter, Marvell recorded an earnings loss of $62.5 million, or eight cents per share. That's certainly worse than the $22.9 million loss, or three cents per share, from the year-earlier quarter.
That's not the end of the story, however. As it turned out, Marvell posted Q3 2021 adjusted earnings (excluding stock-based compensation expenses and other items) of 43 cents per share, easily outpacing the 25 cents a share reported in the year-ago period.
Not only that, but the company's revenue in Q3 2021 increased to $1.21 billion, compared to the year-ago quarter's revenue of $750.1 million. Hence, it's easy to see why Cowen & Co. analyst Karl Ackerman would call this a ""watershed quarter"" for Marvell Technology.
A Game-Changing Conference Call
Oftentimes, conference calls can be uninspiring and uneventful. This wasn't the case with Marvell Technology's Q3 2021 conference call, though.
Mizuho analyst Jordan Klein actually went so far as to characterize this conference call as ""one of the best (if not the best)... calls I have listened to in quite some time.""
Klein's effusive praise didn't end there. ""In fact, it was a GAME-CHANGER for investors and, in my view, squarely positions Marvell as a best-in-class GROWTH SEMI into CY22,"" the analyst continued.
It's not every day that you'll find a respected analyst using all-caps like this. Clearly, Klain found something encouraging in that particular conference call.
Perhaps it was Marvell Technology CFO Jean Hu's projection of ""continued strong demand across our end markets and improvement in supply to drive our top-line revenue growth above 30% in Fiscal 2023.""
Also, it could have been Marvell's January-quarter revenue forecast, which suggested growth of at least 60% - potentially game-changing, indeed.
Wall Street's Take
Turning to Wall Street, MRVL comes in as a Strong Buy, based on 23 Buys and two Hold ratings. The average Marvell Technology price target is $100.56, implying 12.5% upside potential.
The Takeaway
You can choose to own MRVL stock because the company really knocked it out of the park with a tremendous conference call.
Alternatively, you can be bullish on the stock because so many Wall Street analysts are giving it Strong Buy ratings and sometimes effusive praise as well.
Still, at the end of the day, you have to decide what's right for your portfolio. After seeing what may be in store for Marvell Technologies, however, a long position in the stock will be hard to resist.

2022-01-03 00:00:00+00:00,"A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL)",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-look-at-the-intrinsic-value-of-marvell-technology-inc.-nasdaq%3Amrvl,,,"In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.
The model
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate
2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031
Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$761.4m US$1.64b US$2.10b US$2.40b US$2.91b US$3.29b US$3.61b US$3.87b US$4.09b US$4.28b
Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x6 Analyst x7 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 12.96% Est @ 9.66% Est @ 7.35% Est @ 5.73% Est @ 4.6%
Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$711 US$1.4k US$1.7k US$1.8k US$2.1k US$2.2k US$2.2k US$2.3k US$2.2k US$2.2k
(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$19b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.0%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2031 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.0%) = US$86b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$86b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$44b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$63b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$87.5, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
NasdaqGS:MRVL Discounted Cash Flow January 3rd 2022
The assumptions
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Marvell Technology as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.154. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Marvell Technology, we've put together three essential items you should assess:

A chip company transforms itself for the next generation of computing needs
Nicholas Rossolillo (Marvell Technology Group): Not to be confused with Disney's (NYSE: DIS) superhero franchise with a similar name (Marvel, not Mar-VELL), this suddenly emergent semiconductor designer is popping on all sorts of Wall Street analysts' radar as of late. And for good reason. After a string of acquisitions over the last few years, Marvell has transformed itself into a leader in data-center hardware solutions that can handle increasingly complex workloads like artificial intelligence (AI).
It doesn't end with data centers, though. On the last quarterlyearnings call Marvell discussed its opportunity in the auto industry, given that the modern car is like a mini-supercomputer on wheels. Tech is gobbling up a share of the cost to produce a vehicle, and Marvell's diverse mix of data-computing chips and networking gear puts it in a prime position to benefit from increasingly advanced auto tech. Currently, the company's auto segment is generating annualized sales of about $140 million but sees that growing to a multihundred million-dollar per-year business in the coming years.
At the moment, Marvell's financials look a bit messy due to all the acquisition activity. Revenue in the third quarter was up 61% year over year to $1.21 billion; net losses were $61 million; but free cash flow was positive $185 million. However, in the next year, some of these confusing profitability signals will start to converge. And along the way, Marvell has indicated it expects to remain in double-digit sales growth mode as data-center upgrades supporting new cloud-computing services and auto-industry growth continue.
At this point, the cat's out of the bag. Marvell is no longer an under-the-radar semiconductor industry bet. Shares trade for 20 times trailing 12-month sales-to-enterprise value and 166 times trailing 12-month free cash flow to enterprise value. Free cash flow was in negative territory for one quarter earlier this year. However, the premium price tag will moderate as the company digests its recent purchases and scoops up greater share of the data center and auto tech market. Given the strong momentum Marvell is riding right now, I recently bought more before the start of 2022.
The closest thing to a cryptocurrency index fund
Anders Bylund (Coinbase): I started a position in cryptocurrency trading specialist Coinbase Global a week ago. As the digital currency sector recovers from the recent downturn, Coinbase strikes me as the safest way to increase my exposure to this sector -- without selecting any particular cryptocurrencies.
I do own a basket of hand-picked crypto tickers and will surely add to that portfolio over time. Including a robust stake in Coinbase is a more foundational investment, much like building your retirement portfolio around an index fund.
Let's imagine that all of the leading cryptocurrencies in today's market are about to be made obsolete by brand new projects that do the same things much better. I would miss my Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) holdings at first, of course, but the Coinbase investment would simply keep on ticking higher.
In fact, Coinbase also works as a hedge against sudden cryptocurrency upheavals. When everyone sells their old-school digital coins to embrace the Next Big Thing, this company will be happy to help while pocketing transaction fees for every Bitcoin sale. Trading platform operators love volatility, especially in the cryptocurrency market where brokers haven't abandoned trading fees like stock brokerages did in 2019.
And of course, Coinbase still benefits if the current leaders stay on top for the long haul. I see this stock as a broad investment in the cryptocurrency market with a couple of bonus features, as outlined above. I see great things ahead for this ticker regardless of how the cryptocurrency sector shapes up in the long run.
This market-beating fintech just sold off more than 50% on no relevant news
Billy Duberstein (LendingClub): I haven't been buying much recently but have been adding to a few favorites, including LendingClub, that have been particularly beat up amid the omicron/rate hike sell-off.
In early November, all was going right for LendingClub. The company posted a strong earnings report that smashed expectations, and the stock soared from the low $30 range to over $49 per share in short order.
Yet even in the absence of any company-specific news since then, LendingClub has sold off over 50% to around $24.30 per share. That's a massive sell-off for a company doing so well as of its last public disclosure. It appears omicron fears as well as fears of higher rates have caused investors to rethink LendingClub's business, which centers around unsecured personal loans.
But that doesn't seem particularly rational to me. After all, management disclosed that its fourth quarter 2019 vintage, or loans made on the eve of the pandemic, has outperformed the overall industry and is projected to achieve a 6% total net return. Recent employment and growth numbers have remained strong even amid the omicron surge. Inflation is a concern, but I don't think anything that might cause a recession may materially affect charge-offs. While interest rates used to pressure LendingClub's cost of funds, the company now has access to low-cost deposits as a result of its acquisition of Radius Bank back in February. The Radius acquisition also allows LendingClub to hold more of its loans on its balance sheet, allowing the company to reap greater profits from each loan it originates.
After the sell-off, LendingClub actually trades for a bargain valuation of 14 times 2022 earnings estimates. And with the company just coming into its own with this new model and growing new products such as auto loan refinancing, LendingClub should still be growing at a healthy clip in 2022, making it a growth stock at a value price heading into next year.
