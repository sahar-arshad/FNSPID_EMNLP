2022-11-16 00:00:00+00:00,What Recession? This Semiconductor Stock Just Projected Explosive Upside,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-recession-this-semiconductor-stock-just-projected-explosive-upside,,,"The market is very down on the semiconductor sector, and it's understandable. In fact, PC sales are in one of the worst yearly declines in the past 30 years. Meanwhile, the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) is down about 30% on the year.
Against that backdrop, it may be surprising that semiconductor equipment leader ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML), a key provider of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, just increased its 2025 revenue and profit outlook, over and above the projections given just one year ago in late 2021. Not only that, but ASML expects the good times to last through 2030 as well.
If anything, one would have thought ASML would be lowering, not raising, its outlook. Here's what ASML is seeing, and why semiconductor investors may want to look through the year ahead and take advantage of today's low prices. Afterall, even Warren Buffett is buying into the sector.
Higher growth through 2030, despite a 2023 downturn
By 2025, ASML now expects its revenue to double over 2021 – a significant increase from the guidance given just one year ago, along with similar gross margins and only slightly more operating expenses. Not only that, but ASML decided to guide out another five years to 2030. ASML sees revenue growing another 50% on top of its 2025 projections, and with expanding gross margins to boot.

Data source: 2022 Investor Day presentation. Operating margin is the midpoint of given ranges. Revenue figures in euros.
Even though the economic outlook has deteriorated over the past year, ASML's projections beyond this downturn actually increased.
As the only supplier of key extreme ultraviolet technology (EUV) for leading-edge nodes, as well as the dominant supplier of deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) for all nodes, ASML is deeply embedded with its customers' long-term plans and outlooks.
Thus, it appears that even though we might have a near-term cyclical downturn, the secular growth prospects of semiconductors have actually strengthened.
Artificial intelligence, the Metaverse, and electrification
There are several causes for ASML's increased view on semiconductor demand, happening on both advanced and mature nodes.
On advanced nodes, it appears ASML is now seeing the long-term demand for servers increasing above its prior forecast. In addition, it's also seeing an increase in the amount of augmented and virtual reality headsets and infrastructure.
ASML pointed to a general increase in the use of both artificial intelligence and intelligent edge devices, driving the need for more servers to execute the high-powered computing necessary for these game-changing applications. In addition, it was only one year ago that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) announced its name change and big push to create the Metaverse, and that probably wasn't factored into ASML's projections at the time.
Of course, given Meta's struggles this year, some may be questioning whether there really will be increased AR and VR headsets above and beyond last year's figures. However, the large cloud titans didn't appear to be shying away from their spending plans last quarter, despite slowing revenue growth. That seems to indicate the artificial intelligence story, which requires a ton of computing power, is for real.
In addition to these leading-edge applications, the electrification revolution, both in the automotive and electricity generation and distribution sectors, will require a huge increase in semiconductors made on mature nodes.
For instance, electric vehicle sales are projected to accelerate, and EVs require twice the semiconductor content of internal combustion cars, with more autonomous features growing semi content even further beyond that. Moreover, both wind and solar generators require lots of power semiconductor content, and will also require a smarter electric grid to help store and distribute the variable electricity generation that comes from both wind and solar power. A smarter grid will also entail more chip content.
And there are additional accelerators for semicap equipment growth
In addition to the growth in these end-market applications, there are additional drivers for semiconductor capital intensity, which means even greater opportunity for semiconductor equipment stocks to benefit further than their chip design customers.
First, chips will have to get bigger, thereby taking up more space on the wafer and neccessitating more tools to generate the same amount of chips. This is because Moore's Law is slowing down, making it more difficult to pack more and more transistors closer together on the same chip. Furthermore, highly dense chips require more energy to run efficiently.
With electricity prices surging in the face of rising natural gas prices today, energy efficiency is certainly coming to the forefront. The answer to this is that chips will have to get bigger in order to deliver leading-edge performance along with the required energy efficiency.
Equipment suppliers will also get a boost from the push for technology sovereignty, whereby all advanced nations want some chip capacity on their shores. As of today, chip production is highly concentrated in East Asia, but developed nations see this as a vulnerability. In addition, the world's leading foundries are currently engaged in fierce competition, with Intel and Samsung aggressively building their foundries over the next few years to attempt to compete with current foundry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
ASML believes the national subsidies and investments, such as the CHIPS Act in the U.S., as well as that industry competition, could lead to ""inefficiency,"" and therefore even higher capacity than what will be required by the higher projected demand. In total, ASML thinks that inefficiency could expand the equipment market by an additional 10% by 2030.
How can the industry afford this?
If ASML sees a bigger slice of the pie for itself, some may wonder where all the money for this investment will come from. To that point, ASML pointed out that its customers, including foundries, designers, original equipment manufacturers, and internet giants made a collective $688 billion in operating profits last year.
Given that semiconductor equipment revenues and profits make up a relatively low percentage of those overall tech sector profits, ASML believes these companies can afford to keep driving innovation this decade. As such, ASML believes the semiconductor equipment subsector should be more of a growth industry, and perhaps not as cyclical as perceived by the market.
Of course, the proof will be in how ASML and its peers get through the next year. Yet for those with a longer time horizon, major semicap equipment stocks look like solid bets through 2030 -- especially after this year's pullback.

2022-11-16 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Needs Sapphire Rapids to Be the First of Many Home Runs,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-needs-sapphire-rapids-to-be-the-first-of-many-home-runs,,,"While Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has regained its edge over AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) in the PC CPU market with its Raptor Lake chips, AMD is putting Intel to shame in the server chip market. Intel is still the dominant market leader, buts its products just can't hold a candle to AMD's latest EPYC processors.
Execution problems on Intel's part coupled with solid product design from AMD has created this predicament for Intel. After multiple delays, the semiconductor giant will have a chance to turn things around in a few short months.
AMD's Genoa is impressive
AMD has been steadily stealing away server CPU market share over the past few years, but its latest fourth generation EPYC Genoa chips have the potential to accelerate those gains. The chips use a 5nm manufacturing process from TSMC and a chiplet-based design from AMD, delivering substantial performance and efficiency gains.
AMD's Genoa chips feature anywhere from 16 cores to 96 cores. List prices aren't really relevant for server chips – big cloud customers buying thousands of chips at a time aren't paying list price, and total cost of ownership is more important. That makes comparisons difficult, but reviewers at Tom's Hardware concluded that Genoa has ""incredible amounts of performance and a reduced TCO [total cost of ownership] that is simply unmatched by its x86 competitors.""
Genoa's sheer number of cores gives it an advantage among customers who need to pack as much compute as possible into the smallest number of servers. A single server using two top-tier Genoa chips would have 192 cores and 384 threads. The best you can do on the Intel side is 40 cores per chip. Even outside the realm of workloads that heavily benefit from more cores, Tom's Hardware found that Genoa comes out on top: ""Regardless of the compilation tasks we threw at the chips, the Genoa chips provided substantial speedups over the previous-gen Milan chips and beat Intel convincingly.""
As it stands today, AMD is the king of the hill in the server chip market.
Sapphire Rapids is (finally) coming soon
Intel finds itself so far behind AMD in performance and total cost of ownership partly because of execution problems. The company's Sapphire Rapids server chips were originally planned for late 2021. Multiple delays have pushed back the volume launch to the first quarter of 2023.
Intel has high hopes for Sapphire Rapids. The company expects to ship 1 million units faster than it has ever done for any other line of server chips. Importantly, Intel CEO Gelsinger believes the company's execution problems are largely in the past. That's critical, because regaining its edge against AMD will take multiple generations of best-in-class products.
Intel's roadmap is aggressive, but it has to be to regain its performance advantage. Despite the Sapphire Rapids delays, Intel still expects to launch Emerald Rapids chips sometime during 2023. In 2024, Intel will roll out Granite Rapids chips as well as Sierra Forest, its first server chips to feature a mix of high-performance and high-efficiency cores. While it's taken an eternity to bring Sapphire Rapids to market, Intel is full steam ahead on launching two new generations of powerful server chips and a new line of ultra-efficient server chips over the next two years.
If Intel can pull it off, its comeback could look a lot like its comeback in the PC CPU market. Sapphire Rapids needs to be good enough to slow down market share losses to AMD, and its next-gen chips need to surpass AMD in every measure. That will be easier said than done, but with Intel more focused on execution and efficiency under Gelsinger, it would be foolish to count the company out.

2022-11-15 00:00:00+00:00,Intel hit with $948.8 mln U.S. verdict in VLSI computer chip patent trial,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-hit-with-%24948.8-mln-u.s.-verdict-in-vlsi-computer-chip-patent-trial-0,,,"By Blake Brittain
Nov 15 (Reuters) - A federal jury in Texas on Tuesday said Intel Corp INTC.O must pay VLSI Technology LLC $948.8 million for infringing a VLSI patent for computer chips.
VLSI, a patent-holding company affiliated with the SoftBank Group Corp-owned private equity firm Fortress Investment Group, argued during the six-day trial that Intel's Cascade Lake and Skylake microprocessors violated its patent covering improvements to data processing.
An Intel spokesperson said the company ""strongly disagrees"" with the verdict ands plans to appeal, and that the case is ""one example of many that shows the U.S. patent system is in urgent need of reform.""
Representatives for VLSI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Last March VLSI won a nearly $2.2 billion verdict from Intel in a separate Texas trial over different chip patents, which Intel has appealed. VLSI lost another related patent trial against Intel the following month.
VLSI bought the patent in the latest trial from Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O.
An attorney for VLSI said at trial that Intel's chips cause ""millions and millions of infringements per second."" The jury awarded the company the full amount of damages it requested.
A lawyer for Mountain View, California-based Intel said during the trial that the company's engineers developed its innovations independently, and that its modern microprocessors would not work with VLSI's outdated technology.
Two other patent cases brought by VLSI against Intel are still pending in Northern California and Delaware. A trial in the California case is set to begin in 2024.

Dow stock No. 1 to buy hand over fist: Walt Disney
The first Dow Jones stock begging to be bought is the famed ""House of Mouse,"" Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS).
Last week, Disney suffered its worst single-day performance in more than two decades after releasing its fourth-quarter operating results. While select metrics came in ahead of expectations, Wall Street and investors were displeased with a much larger loss from streaming service Disney+, lower average revenue per user from Disney's streaming services, and the company coming in more than $1 billion below expectations for quarterly sales.
While the company is facing tangible headwinds, such as China's ongoing zero-COVID strategy and a decline in advertising revenue as fears of a U.S. recession build, Walt Disney has clearly identifiable competitive edges that make it a smart buy right now.
As I've recently alluded, one of the strongest selling points of Walt Disney as an investment is that its user engagement can't be replicated by other businesses. For decades, the company's theme parks, movies, proprietary shows, and merchandise have brought multiple generations of friends and family together, with the common ground often involving fun and imagination. Despite being prone to the ebbs-and-flows of the U.S. and global economy, these competitive advantages don't go away.
Disney has also laid the groundwork for Disney+ to become a profitable service by 2024, according to CEO Bob Chapek. With the peak costs associated with its international rollout now in the rearview mirror, the company can focus on monetizing the more than 164 million subscribers it began with in October 2022.
Another key reason for Disney's long-term success is the company's pricing power. The cost for an admission ticket to Disneyland in Southern California has grown 10 times faster than the actual rate of inflation since 1955. Despite this, Chapek noted that the company's Parks, Experiences, and Products segment delivered ""record"" results in 2022. The point is that Disney can use its superior customer engagement to its advantage by passing along higher price points for its products and services.
Being able to scoop up shares of Walt Disney below $100 looks like a bargain.
Dow stock No. 2 to buy hand over fist: Intel
The second Dow stock that can comfortably be bought hand over fist by patient investors is semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
Since hitting its all-time closing high in early 2020, shares of the chipmaker have fallen 56%. This is due to a combination of Advanced Micro Devices taking some of its market share and supply chain issues over the past 2-1/2 years wreaking havoc on production and/or demand. Though far from ideal, these headwinds have present as an incredible buying opportunity for long-term investors.
To begin with, yes, AMD has been (bad pun alert) chipping away at Intel's central processing unit (CPU) share in personal computers (PCs) and data center servers. But we're not talking about Intel falling to No. 2 in either of these categories. Even with modest market share losses, Intel holds the bulk of PC, mobile, and server CPU share, which continue to generate mammoth amounts of cash flow for the company.
Intel is also one of the direct beneficiaries of the CHIPS and Science Act, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden in August. The CHIPS Act will provide close to $53 billion to aid the domestic manufacturing of semiconductor solutions and award design grants. Intel is in the process of building two manufacturing plants in Ohio (at a $20 billion price tag), and will likely lean on the assistance of the CHIPS Act to bolster its foundry capabilities.
Another exciting development for Intel is the recent debut of autonomous vehicle company Mobileye (NASDAQ: MBLY) as a public company. Intel acquired Mobileye for a little over $15 billion in 2017 and is its majority shareholder. Mobileye ended last week with a $24 billion valuation, which comes on the heels of 38% revenue growth in the third quarter and a $1.8 billion annual sales run-rate.
It's been a very long time since Intel was this inexpensive on a fundamental basis (nearly par with its book value), and investors are going to kick themselves is they miss the opportunity to scoop up an industry leader on the cheap.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average stock to avoid: IBM
But as noted, not all Dow stocks are created equally. Though it's been a low-volatility stock I've supported in the past for income-seeking investors, it's time to kick tech stock IBM (NYSE: IBM) to the curb.
To be fair, IBM has done some things right. For years, it's been broadening its niche as a key hybrid-cloud player organically and through acquisitions. Considering that the labor force has been permanently changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for hybrid cloud services appears destined to grow sustainably over time. IBM's cloud revenue has, indeed, been growing by a relatively steady double-digit percentage.
Additionally, IBM continues to reward its shareholders with a market-trouncing and inflation-fighting dividend. Paying out $6.60/share annually equates to a yield of 4.6%. Unfortunately, IBM looks more like a yield trap than a bargain.
One of the bigger issues with IBM is that its legacy operations act as cement blocks on its top-and-bottom-line figures. IBM was late to shift away from legacy hardware and software to cloud-driven services, and it's been paying the price for a decade. Total sales have been precipitously shrinking, and per-share profit has fallen from north of $14 in 2012 to what'll likely be close to $9 in earnings per share (EPS) this year.
Furthermore, IBM's share buyback program has been a waste of capital. Normally, buying back stock would reduce the outstanding share count and boost EPS for companies with steady or growing net income. Yet despite IBM retiring roughly 250 million shares since the end of 2012, its share price has declined, its EPS has fallen, and its net debt situation has worsened -- from approximately $22.1 billion in net debt a decade ago to more than $41.3 billion today.
Although IBM's turnaround strategy marches on, investors shouldn't be waiting around for this transformation to materialize.

2022-11-15 00:00:00+00:00,China's Tencent starts new round of layoffs -sources,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chinas-tencent-starts-new-round-of-layoffs-sources-0,,,"By David Kirton and Josh Ye
SHENZHEN, China/HONG KONG, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings 0700.HK has begun a new round of job cuts targeted at its video streaming, gaming and cloud businesses, four sources close to the matter said.
The sources said the layoffs affect three out of Tencent's six business divisions - platform and content (PCG), which comprises of its video and news platforms, its gaming-focused interactive entertainment department (IEG) and cloud and smart industries group (CSIG).
Two of the sources said some staff in IEG were informed last week they were being laid off.
Tencent declined to comment.
Reuters was not able to establish the scale of the job losses.
China's technology sector continues to feel the effects of a regulatory crackdown and headwinds from zero-COVID measures that have slowed the broader economy.
Tencent already cut jobs earlier this year, alongside peers, including Alibaba Group 9988.HK and smaller Chinese tech companies such as Xiaohongshu. In August, Tencent disclosed its employee numbers fell to 110,715 by the end of June from 116,213 in March.
Refintiv data shows analysts expect Tencent to report flat revenues or a small contraction on Wednesday, when it publishes third-quarter results.
Tencent management have said they are focused on cutting costs and have shuttered non-core businesses in certain areas, including online education, e-commerce and game live-streaming.
The Shenzhen-based company is eyeing global expansion to offset slowing growth in China. Reuters reported last month Tencent is resetting its M&A strategy to put more focus on buying majority stakes mainly in overseas gaming companies.
Several U.S. tech employers, including Facebook parent Meta Platforms META.O, Intel Corp INTC.O and Twitter have also laid off thousands of workers in recent weeks.

2022-11-15 00:00:00+00:00,Surprise! Warren Buffett Just Bought a Semiconductor Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/surprise-warren-buffett-just-bought-a-semiconductor-stock,,,"Followers of Warren Buffett know he's generally averse to technology stocks. Buffett typically takes big positions, and therefore seeks a high bar in terms of both valuation and conviction.
Since Buffett has admitted he's a novice when it comes to technology, it's no surprise to see few tech stocks in his portfolio, which totaled nearly $300 billion as of the third quarter. While Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) largest holding, Buffett has said he sees that more as a consumer brand than a technology stock.
If tech stocks are typically avoided, that goes double for semiconductor stocks. Semiconductors are known to be cyclical, with frequent technology disruption being more of a rule than an exception.
However, could the semiconductor industry be changing for the better? In Berkshire's 13F filing, released Monday afternoon, Buffett's conglomerate revealed it took a big position in the world's largest semiconductor foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), making it Berkshire's 10th-largest position overall.
Taiwan Semi: Right out of the Buffett playbook
Buffett watchers know that Berkshire looks to buy companies with deep competitive advantages, attractive long-term growth prospects, and bargain valuations.
Taiwan Semiconductor appears to have all three elements. In terms of competitive advantages, it's the largest, most dominant semiconductor foundry in the world. According to Statista, it produced a stunning 53.6% of all semiconductors as of the first quarter of 2022. That market share is even higher on the most advanced chip nodes, where TSM vaulted past Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in leading-edge production several years ago.
How did Taiwan Semiconductor do it? Well, this momentum has been a long time in the making, which probably makes it more durable.
Years ago, most semiconductor firms sought to separate their manufacturing from their design, since manufacturing was very capital-intensive. For instance, in 2008, Advanced Micro Devices spun off its foundry into what is now GlobalFoundries. By shedding the foundry business, semiconductor designers could focus on their research and development, thereby boosting margins and returns on capital without having to invest in costly manufacturing plants.
That enabled the foundry part of the industry to become concentrated and diversify its customer bases, as having more customers and scale would enable outsourced foundries to run at higher utilization, thereby boosting their economics as well.
Thus, Taiwan Semi attracted more and more top semiconductor designers, and its customers' diversity allowed it to compound semiconductor manufacturing knowledge at a faster rate. That, in turn, enabled Taiwan Semi, as a pure-play foundry, to surpass Intel, one of the last integrated designer-manufacturers, in leading-edge technology. Over time, semiconductor production has only gotten more challenging, giving TSM the opportunity to surpass the former leader.
New Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has vowed to build out its own rival foundry and catch TSM within four to five years. However, that will be a long, expensive endeavor. Making things more complicated, Intel's main cash cow, its PC chip division, is in severe decline in 2022. That could delay or hamper the former leader's plans to catch up. Meanwhile, TSM is investing another $36 billion in its leading manufacturing footprint this year.
Flexing its pricing power in tough times
Taiwan Semi's status as the outright leader in semiconductor production gives it one of Buffett's favorite qualities: Pricing power. Amid inflationary concerns for raw materials, Taiwan Semi has been able to raise prices to its chip design customers throughout the past year, while also insisting on upfront payments when capacity was tight a year ago.
Even as the semiconductor market softened this summer, TSM refused to give refunds to customers that had pre-paid. Even a TSM customer as powerful as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was forced to take a $1.3 billion inventory charge this summer, as TSM refused to cancel production of Nvidia gaming chips ordered earlier in the year. A report from earlier this summer also claimed TSM was insisting on faster payment terms from customers, to better finance its capital expenditures.
Despite many chip stocks running into softer results this summer, Taiwan Semi continued to deliver blistering growth. Revenue grew 35.9% in Q3 in dollar-terms, with a stunningly high net profit margin of 45.8% and a sky-high return on equity of 42.9%.
While most analysts think the semiconductor sector will decline next year, management has insisted that even if that occurs, TSM will still likely grow in 2023. This is due to its dominance in leading-edge technology, and demand for lagging-edge nodes for auto and industrial applications, which are still in high demand.

An opportunity came about in Q3
Finally, Buffett likely saw a tremendous bargain this summer, as TSM's stock fell after the PC sector went into freefall, China began saber-rattling over Taiwan following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island in August, and the U.S. unveiled restrictions on high-performance chip sales to China.
During these headwinds, TSM's stock fell to around current levels in Q3, then fell even further in early October, before recovering. That means Buffett likely bought shares at an equivalent or even higher price than shares are at now. Currently, TSM trades at roughly 15.5 times earnings and just 12.5 times next year's earnings estimates, with a 2.5% dividend yield. Shares are currently down 48% on the year and 51% from all-time highs.
Going up Apple's supply chain
Some may think the TSM purchase may have come from one of Buffett's younger lieutenants, Todd Combs or Ted Wechsler. However, if that's the case, it would be the largest of their positions, as every allocation larger than TSM in Berkshire's portfolio is a Buffett purchase. Thus, there's a good chance the TSM buyer is Buffett himself.
It's quite possible Buffett found TSM from his position in Apple. After all, TSM produces Apple's Bionic iPhone processors and M series laptop chips, so Buffett likely came to appreciate TSM's market position and pricing power through the Apple position. In October, the website MacRumors reported that even Apple had reluctantly accepted TSM's most recent price hike, after initially pushing back. According to Taiwan's Economic Daily News, ""At present, not one of the IC design factories that received the price increase notice has refused.""
It's a good sign for the semiconductor sector that Buffett's giving at least one stock in the space his seal of approval. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) is down 32% on the year, so it could use the help.

Shares of GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS) opened lower on Monday. At one point, GFS stock was down 2.1% on the day, although it has since turned higher and is now trading in positive territory. News of GlobalFoundries layoffs have the stock tossing and turning today.
Last week, the company delivered a top- and bottom-line earnings beat, as revenue grew 23.5% year-over-year. More so, the company reported record margins and net income and provided a better-than-expected earnings outlook.
Despite the company recently reporting a strong quarter, GlobalFoundries layoffs are still on the docket. The company is “the biggest U.S.-based provider of made-to-order semiconductors.” However, it did not say how by much it would reduce its headcount or which division would be impacted.
During GlobalFoundries’ conference call, management said it was looking to decrease its annual operating costs by $200 million. Now it’s clear reducing its workforce will be a part of that plan.
Specifically, “The company Friday informed its employees of the impending workforce reductions, without disclosing when exactly they would occur or which divisions would be affected.”
What GlobalFoundries Layoffs Mean Now
The news comes after last week’s impressive rally, when shares gained 19.6%. It sent GFS stock to its highest level since March, although last week’s high of $66 was just 4 cents per share above the August high. In any regard, the layoffs come at a tough time in tech.
Not only are chipmakers struggling with falling demand, but tech companies in general are going through a slowdown in hiring.
Recent reports cite Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) looking to slash 10,000 jobs. That news comes just days after reports that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is axing 11,000 jobs. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is on the list, too.
All of FAANG has either announced layoffs or a freeze in hiring. Countless companies within tech have also taken that step. When listening to the conference calls and going through the press releases, it’s also clear chipmakers are struggling. That includes not just Intel, but also companies like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
Simply put, the overall jobs market is holding up quite well, as is the overall economy. But the carnage seen in growth stocks and tech stocks is starting to be seen in the underlying businesses as well. These companies are pulling in the reins and cutting costs and that’s impacting everyone — including chipmakers.
We’re seeing that now in various hiring freezes, and now in GlobalFoundries layoffs too.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Futures down: Dow 0.24%, S&P 0.35%, Nasdaq 0.60%
Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged lower on Monday as hawkish comments from a U.S. Federal Reserve official tempered hopes of a less aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening.
Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said on Sunday that markets should now pay attention to the ""endpoint"" of rate increases, not the pace of each move, and the endpoint is likely ""a ways off"".
The comments from Waller, a voting member of the rate-setting committee this year, follow softer-than-expected inflation data for October that led to a euphoric market rally last week, with the S&P 500 logging its biggest weekly percentage gains in about five months.
""The message is coming loud and clear from the Fed, investors should hold their horses when it comes to expectations of looser monetary policy,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

2022-11-13 00:00:00+00:00,Smartphone chip firm MediaTek CEO sees 'incremental' move away from Taiwan,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/smartphone-chip-firm-mediatek-ceo-sees-incremental-move-away-from-taiwan,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
Nov 13 (Reuters) - Tensions between China and the United States are pushing some manufacturer companies to talk about moving some of their supply chain away from Taiwan as well, although it’s “incremental,” the head of Taiwan’s most important smartphone chip design firm told Reuters over the weekend.
Some of the ""very large (equipment manufacturers) will require their chip suppliers to have multiple sources, like from Taiwan and from U.S., or from Germany or from Europe,"" said MediaTek Inc 2454.TW Chief Executive Rick Tsai. ""I think in those cases, we will have to find multiple sources for the same chip if the business warrants that.""
It’s happening already but not at large scale, he added.
Tsai and senior executives talked to Reuters on the sidelines of a media and analyst event the company was hosting in California’s wine valley Sonoma Valley on Friday. The company has been pushing to grow its U.S. business, and Tsai said the goal was to triple or quadruple sales, although he didn’t give a time frame.
While MediaTek's most advanced smartphone chips are made at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW in Taiwan, Tsai said some older smartphone chips are made by GlobalFoundries Inc GFS.O, which has factories in places like the U.S. and Singapore, and pointed to an announcement earlier this year to make its chips at Intel Corp’s INTC.O fabrication facilities.
Tsai said the ""Intel 16"" chip manufacturing technology that MediaTek has committed to use fits well for producing MediaTek chips for smart TVs and Wi-Fi. “It’s a big business segment for us. So we're not joking. And I'm supervising that progress myself every month,” said Tsai adding that its chips will be made by Intel’s Ireland fabrication facility from the second half of 2024.
He said that MediaTek will also be producing chips in TSMC’s Arizona’s fab when that is up and running, but cautioned that it wasn't realistic for the chip industry to completely move away from Taiwan, the world's most important region for advanced chip making.
“But is that going to be enough? No. Not by far,” he said.

2022-11-13 00:00:00+00:00,The 7 Best Stocks for Retirement,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-7-best-stocks-for-retirement,,,"With corporate pensions largely becoming an anachronistic relic, it’s never been more important for investors to plan for their golden years. However, with the combination of broader market volatility and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes (and all that this action encompasses), the backdrop practically bolsters the case for finding the best stocks for retirement.
Specifically, the market no longer incentivizes investors to consider growth-oriented names. Instead, the Fed’s monetary tightening will likely drive demand for value-driven enterprises, in other words, companies with deeply established track records that pay back their shareholders in the form of reliable and stable dividends.
Further, the sharp rise in borrowing costs due to the aforementioned rate hikes created a paradigm shift in the purchasing power of the dollar. Previously, inflationary forces made money “cheap,” thus sparking growth-focused endeavors. Now, money is “expensive,” meaning that value has become the priority. Organically, this framework helps the best stocks for retirement as they already eschew expansion for stability.
Below are seven market ideas that deserve closer attention during these unusual times.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
One of the best stocks for retirement, thanks to its far-reaching relevance, software and technology giant Microsoft primarily warrants attention because it dominates the language of business. Based on the latest data, Microsoft Windows owns nearly 76% of the global desktop market share. Stated differently, if you want to succeed in the professional realm, you must be fluent in Windows along with Microsoft’s various business applications.
Quantitatively, MSFT ranks among the best stocks for retirement because it features a balanced financial profile. Leveraging a solid balance sheet, this fiscal stability undergirds the company’s strong revenue growth and excellent profit margins. While its forward dividend yield of 1.1% isn’t particularly generous, its payout ratio of 26.7% suggests high reliability of passive income outflows.
Is MSFT Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, MSFT stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average MSFT price target is $293.46, implying 18.8% upside potential.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)
One of the most iconic American companies and a symbol of western-style capitalism, Coca-Cola also ranks among the best stocks for retirement. Fundamentally, analysts for years labeled KO stock as resistant to recessionary pressures. In addition, the company’s products offer a cheap thrill, providing a caffeine boost at a relatively low cost.
Regarding its financials, investors will appreciate its forward yield of 2.87%, which stands nominally one percentage point higher than the sector average. Although its payout ratio is high at 69.64%, the company also enjoys 60 years of consecutive dividend increases. There’s really no way that management will let this status go without a fierce battle, allowing stakeholders to rest easier at night.
Is KO Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, KO stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys, two Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average KO price target is $66.29, implying 8.1% upside potential.
Allstate (NYSE:ALL)
An insurance agency, Allstate may be boring, but it easily counts itself among the best stocks for retirement available. Indeed, insurance firms live for market ecosystems such as the present juncture. That’s because insurance stocks and the benchmark interest rate typically share a direct correlation: as one rises, so too does the other.
On the financial side, ALL brings a forward yield of 2.57%. Though not the greatest dividend, the company’s payout ratio is 36.7%, implying a sustainable passive income outflow. Also, Allstate is relatively undervalued, with its price-to-sales ratio of 0.7x favorably lower than the industry median of 0.95x.
Is Allstate Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, ALL stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on six Buys, five Holds, and one Sell rating. The average ALL price target is $141.08, implying 6.8% upside potential.
Aflac (NYSE:AFL)
One of the world’s biggest suppliers of supplemental insurance, Aflac provides a critical need by filling gaps that traditional insurance plans don’t cover. In addition, AFL ranks among the best stocks for retirement because of fundamental awareness. With the pain of COVID-19 still fresh, everyone realized that circumstances can go awry without warning. Therefore, Aflac couldn’t have asked for a better marketing campaign than COVID-19.
Aflac also makes plenty of sense for those seeking a worry-free retirement. For instance, its dividend yield is 2.40%, while its payout ratio sits at 31.26%, indicating reliable passive income. Further, the company sports 39 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status no executive team will relinquish cheaply.
Is AFL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, AFL stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on two Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average AFL price target is $66.17, implying 5.9% downside potential.
AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)
A pharmaceutical giant, AbbVie draws intrigue because of its acquisition of Botox. With normalization trends likely to fully materialize in the workforce as employers recall their workers back to the office, an emphasis will rise on physical complexion. It’s a cynical take, sure, but it’s also one that could make ABBV one of the best stocks for retirement.
By the numbers, AbbVie continues to attract investors. Primarily, the pharma carries a forward yield of 3.94%, well above the healthcare sector average of 1.58%. While its 50.54% payout ratio is a bit on the high side, AbbVie commands 50 years of consecutive dividend increases. Again, management will do whatever it takes to keep this trajectory moving forward and higher.
Is ABBV Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, ABBV stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on five Buys, six Holds, and one Sell rating. The average ABBV price target is $154.75, implying 3.06% upside potential.
Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK)
A major utility firm, Duke Energy makes plenty of sense across most frameworks due to its infrastructural relevance. However, it really makes sense as one of the best stocks for retirement. Because Duke covers regions popular with millennials, it’s basically positioned where people will be, not necessarily where they are. Thus, DUK enjoys forward relevance.
In addition, Duke Energy offers a forward yield of 4.14%, slightly exceeding the sector average of 3.75%. Though the payout ratio stands on the high side at 70.63%, the company also has 17 years of consecutive dividend increases. Finally, Duke also benefits from profit margins that rank among the industry’s top-half performers.
Is DUK Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, DUK stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average DUK price target is $101.82, implying 7% upside potential.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Saving the riskiest name among the best stocks for retirement for last, Intel has certainly seen better days. Since the start of the year, INTC has shed 40% of its equity value. However, it’s also fair to point out that the company could be significantly undervalued. For instance, INTC is priced at 9.2x trailing-12-months (TTM) earnings. In contrast, the industry median is 16.4x.
Intel is also generous, featuring a forward yield of 4.8%. This handily beats out the sector average of only 1.37%. While the payout ratio is lofty at 73.29%, INTC delivers a potentially potent combo of upside potential and passive income. Thus, it’s one of the best stocks for retirement.
Is INTC Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, INTC stock has a Hold consensus rating based on four Buys, 16 Holds, and eight Sell ratings. The average INTC price target is $29.54, implying 2.9% downside potential.

2022-11-13 00:00:00+00:00,Here Are All 23 Stocks I've Bought During the 2022 Bear Market,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/here-are-all-23-stocks-ive-bought-during-the-2022-bear-market,,,"Even after accounting for Thursday's ginormous rally following a lower-than-expected change in the year-over-year inflation rate, the stock market is having a rough go of things in 2022. The ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and tech-dependent Nasdaq Composite have all plunged into bear market territory.
But when there's pain on Wall Street, there's also opportunity. Historically, stock market crashes, corrections, and bear markets have represented the ideal time for long-term investors to put their money to work. I certainly lump myself in that category of patient/buy-and-hold investor types.
Image source: Getty Images.
Since the year began, 73 buy orders spanning 23 unique stocks have been executed in my investment portfolio. Some of these buys led to the creation of a new position, while others added to existing stakes. Here's a brief rundown of all 23 stocks I've bought during the 2022 bear market (presented in no particular order).
1. Alphabet
Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube, is a new addition to my portfolio in 2022 (I specifically bought GOOGL). Alphabet's Google accounts for 92% of global internet searches, and Google Cloud has grown to become the world's No. 3 provider of cloud infrastructure solutions. Alphabet has never been this inexpensive relative to future earnings or cash flow.
2. Novavax
Biotech stock Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX) is another new addition. Despite running into delays and manufacturing snafus for its COVID-19 vaccine, the company's recurring revenue opportunities, domestic and abroad, remain intriguing. More importantly, Novavax has plenty of cash on hand, and it's demonstrated that its drug-development platform works. I look forward to potential combination vaccines from Novavax (e.g., COVID-19/influenza).
3. AT&T
While I generally go after growth stocks, I won't turn down an inflation-busting dividend yield. I've added to my existing position in AT&T (NYSE: T) on a few occasions during the 2022 bear market. AT&T's wireless division should benefit from higher data consumption tied to the 5G revolution, and its balance sheet has considerably more financial flexibility following the spinoff of content arm WarnerMedia in April.
4. EverQuote
Online insurance marketplace EverQuote (NASDAQ: EVER) is one of my riskier long-term investments, given that the company is currently losing money. The catalyst here is that digital ad growth in the insurance space is growing more than three times faster than traditional insurance advertising channels. EverQuote should be able to sustain a double-digit long-term growth rate while expanding into new insurance verticals (home, rental, health, life, and commercial).
5. Intel
Semiconductor stock Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is the first chipmaker I've bought in a decade and a new addition to my portfolio. Though it's facing clear headwinds at the moment -- supply chain challenges, weakening chip demand, and Advanced Micro Devices chipping away at its market share -- Intel is still the undisputed central processing unit market share leader in personal computer, mobile, and data center servers. With the CHIPS Act providing subsidies for domestic manufacturing plant construction, the framework has been laid for a healthy turnaround.
6. Bark
Small-cap dog-focused services provider Bark (NYSE: BARK) is a stock I've added to more times than I count in 2022. Although it's performed poorly since its debut in December 2020, the pet industry has routinely demonstrated that it's pretty much impervious to economic weakness. Bark's online subscription focus (around 90% of its sales usually originate from its direct-to-consumer segment) should help lower overhead costs and boost margins over time.
7. Teladoc Health
Virtual-visit stock Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) has had a miserable year. However, this isn't a fad stock. It grew sales by an average annualized rate of 74% in the six years prior to the pandemic, and it's making life easier for patients, physicians, and insurers. My assumption is we'll see narrowing losses in 2023 as one-time costs tied to the Livongo Health buyout are put into the rearview mirror. Further, cost synergies and higher-margin subscriptions should provide a boost.
8. Meta Platforms
Another stock I've aggressively added to of late is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Ad-driven stocks seem to be priced as if they're going to die every time a bear market rolls around, and this just isn't the case. Meta has four of the most downloaded/used social media assets on the planet, which should give it exceptional ad-pricing power during long-winded periods of expansion. As a bonus, the company has close to $32 billion in net cash on its balance sheet.
9. Lovesac
Furniture stock Lovesac (NASDAQ: LOVE) might be my favorite stock right now. Lovesac's sactionals -- modular couches designed to fit most living spaces -- bring a functionality, optionality, and eco-friendliness to the table that other furniture retailers can't match. What's more, Lovesac's omnichannel sales platform has lowered its overhead expenses and lifted margins in a relatively stodgy industry.
10. Visa
Payment processor Visa (NYSE: V) is a company I added for the first time in September. Despite being cyclical, Visa spends a disproportionate amount of time benefiting from economic expansions than navigating through recessions. It holds a 54% share of credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. and is looking at a multidecade opportunity to organically or acquisitively push into underbanked emerging markets.
Image source: Getty Images.
11. Fastly
I'd consider Fastly (NYSE: FSLY), like EverQuote, to be one of my riskier buys during the 2022 bear market. As businesses shift their data online and into the cloud, the need to move data from the edge of the cloud to end users as quickly and securely as possible will grow. I see this as a sustainable opportunity for Fastly to grow by a double-digit percentage. The key for Fastly is to rein in expenses to some degree as revenue scales.
12. Innovative Industrial Properties
In June, I took the plunge and opened a position in cannabis-focused real estate investment trust Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE: IIPR). IIP, as the company is known, generates predictable cash flow thanks to leases typically averaging 15 or more years. While acquisitions are its primary means of growth, it does have modest organic growth components built in as well. And how could I turn down a 7% yield?
13. Qorvo
Not long after buying Intel, I opened a position in semiconductor solutions company Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO). Qorvo generates a sizable percentage of its sales from Apple. With the iPhone cemented as the top smartphone in the U.S., Qorvo's cash flow has been rock-solid for many years. With the opportunity for long-term growth from ancillary channels, such as advanced antennas used in next-generation vehicles, Qorvo appears cheap.
14. NextEra Energy
Electric utility stock NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) is yet another new addition during the 2022 bear market. Whereas most utility stocks are slow-growing, NextEra has sustained a high-single-digit growth rate for more than a decade due to its aggressive green energy investments. No utility generates more capacity from wind or solar than NextEra -- and I expect that'll remain the case for quite some time.
15. Baidu
China-based Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) is the newest addition to my portfolio. Despite China stocks facing the threat of delisting in the U.S. and tighter regulation domestically, at 9 times forward earnings, Baidu was too cheap to pass up. Its search engine held a 60% share in China for October, making it a logical go-to for advertisers. Further, its investments in artificial intelligence and cloud computing have resulted in jaw-dropping growth, even in an uncertain economic environment.
16. PayPal Holdings
Fintech stock PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) is a brand-new holding for me, and it's been purchased on multiple occasions throughout the year. Despite historically high inflation, total payment volume growth has been resilient, and active account engagement has been climbing -- 50.1 payment transactions over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period versus 40.7 over the TTM at the end of 2020. PayPal looks like a screaming buy, given how early we are in the digital payment growth cycle.
17. Walgreens Boots Alliance
As noted, I do love a good bargain, and adding to my existing position in pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) made sense. Walgreens is in the midst of a turnaround strategy that's seen the company slash its annual operating expenses by more than $2 billion and emphasize direct-to-consumer sales. Even more exciting is its partnership with VillageMD that'll target opening 1,000 full-service health clinics by the end of 2027. Walgreens is a gem for value and income investors.
18. Warner Bros. Discovery
Once again, anything having to do with ads has been given the heave-ho in the 2022 bear market. That's led to some incredible opportunities for patient investors and is why I added to my stake in Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD). The streaming subscription growth potential for Discovery+/HBO Max, coupled with a near-certain rebound in ad revenue during long-winded periods of economic expansion, makes for an inexpensive media stock.
19. Pinterest
The 2022 bear market was also the perfect opportunity to add to my existing stake in social media stock Pinterest (NYSE: PINS). When examined over a five-year stretch, Pinterest's monthly active users (MAUs) count has been on a fairly steady incline, and most importantly, the company has had no issue monetizing these users. Perhaps best of all, Pinterest's MAUs willingly share what interests them, allowing merchants to easily target these potential shoppers and paving the way for Pinterest to become a meaningful e-commerce player.
20. Planet 13 Holdings
I opened a position in small-cap marijuana stock Planet 13 Holdings (OTC: PLNH.F) in March. Despite not reaching recurring profitability as of yet, Planet 13 has demonstrated a unique operating model that other pot shops can't replicate. Its two SuperStores are gigantic, with just as much focus placed on nostalgia as on making sales. With this unique concept in its corner and the company opening neighborhood-styled stores in Florida, I believe recurring profitability is not too far off.
21. Redfin
Arguably the riskiest stock I've bought during the bear market downturn (albeit a very small position) is tech-driven real estate company Redfin (NASDAQ: RDFN). Redfin substantially undercuts traditional real estate companies on listing fees, and it offers a number of personalized services to help users get the best bang for their buck when selling their homes. The key for Redfin is going to be cost controls as higher mortgage rates slow homebuying activity.
22. PubMatic
Next to Lovesac, small-cap adtech stock PubMatic (NASDAQ: PUBM) is my favorite to buy and hold. It's crystal clear that ad dollars are shifting from print to digital channels, and PubMatic finds itself at the center of this rapid growth. What's particularly interesting about this company is that it built its cloud infrastructure. Not having to rely on a third party to operate its programmatic ad platform should lead to superior operating margins as revenue scales.
23. Amazon
Last but not least, I've added to my existing stake in e-commerce kingpin Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) on more than one occasion. Though Wall Street is fixated on the company's struggling retail operations, its dominant online marketplace isn't a key contributor to cash flow. Growth from the world's No. 1 cloud provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS), as well as advertising services and subscription services, are what really drive Amazon's cash flow. There's nothing holding back these segments at the moment, which makes Amazon such an incredible buy.

2022-11-12 00:00:00+00:00,3 Investing Megatrends You Can't Afford to Miss,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-investing-megatrends-you-cant-afford-to-miss,,,"There's a lot of near-term uncertainty facing the global economy. Surging inflation and rising interest rates are driving growing concerns we could be heading toward a recession. That could impact cyclical companies that rely on an expanding economy to drive growth.
However, amid the uncertainty, three prominent macroeconomic themes have emerged in recent years and will continue to drive growth in certain sectors: digitalization, decarbonization, and deglobalization. Here's why investors won't want to miss these megatrends.
Data-driven growth
Companies worldwide will invest an estimated $1 trillion in capital over the next five years to upgrade global data infrastructure. Those investments include upgrading copper wire networks to fiber optic cables, expanding global data center capacity, and building additional cell towers to support 5G networks, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence (AI).
Many companies focus on building the infrastructure needed to support the digitalization trend. For example, Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) is investing in fiber networks, wireless infrastructure, and data centers.
Brookfield also recently agreed to acquire a European telecom tower company. It has 36,000 towers and a pipeline of 5,200 more that it expects to build for its primary tenant over the next five years to support its growth. That's one of several data infrastructure investments Brookfield has secured that will help power its growth in the coming years.
Meanwhile, real estate investment trusts (REITs) American Tower (NYSE: AMT), Crown Castle (NYSE: CCI), Equinix (NASDAQ: EQIX), and Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR) are focusing on various aspects of the digitalization megatrend to drive growth. American Tower recently expanded its global tower business to include data centers, putting it in an even better position to capitalize on the digitalization megatrend.
Crown Castle sees a decade-long investment cycle in 5G to build more towers, small cell nodes, and fiber optic networks. Data center REITs Equinix and Digital Realty have several expansion projects underway worldwide to help meet growing data center demand. Those investments position these REITs to continue growing their cash flow and dividends at healthy rates.
A powerful growth opportunity
Decarbonization is a multi-trillion-dollar trend that will last several decades. Energy companies must invest trillions of dollars in building renewable-energy-generating capacity to replace fossil fuels.
For example, leading utility NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) expects to deploy from $85 billion to $95 billion on new investments through 2025, primarily geared toward decarbonization. Those investments could give NextEra Energy the power to grow earnings and dividends at double-digit annual rates for the next several years.
Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP) is also investing heavily to capitalize on the decarbonization megatrend. The company has over 100 gigawatts of renewable power projects in its pipeline, more than four times its current operating capacity. It also has carbon capture and storage investments to help decarbonize other sectors of the economy. These investments could power upwards of 20% annual earnings-per-share growth for the company over the next several years.
Security is driving new investments
The pandemic exposed weaknesses in the global supply chain. That's leading governments to shift their focus to securing supplies of energy and other materials crucial to their economies.
The drive toward energy independence is fueling a boom in liquefied natural gas (LNG). European countries are locking up LNG supplies to reduce their dependence on Russian gas. That's enabled several LNG developers to move forward with new liquefaction and export facilities this year, including Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT: LNG). It started building its Corpus Christi Stage 3 project consisting of seven LNG liquefaction trains. The company is also evaluating an additional expansion to build two more trains at that facility.
Meanwhile, several companies are building new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. as the country restores supply. For example, semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is investing billions of dollars into building several new chip manufacturing facilities in Arizona and Ohio.
One catalyst driving Intel's investments is the CHIPS Act, which provides incentives to help boost domestic chip manufacturing capacity and reduce the country's reliance on overseas markets. Intel will be a major beneficiary of this recently passed legislation as it should help finance its manufacturing build-out in the country. That will better position it to capitalize on the rapidly growing semiconductor market that could double by the end of the decade, reaching $1 trillion in global sales.
Focus on the long-term picture
There's a lot of uncertainty in the global economy these days. However, it's clear that governments and companies will pour trillions of dollars into digitalization, decarbonization, and deglobalization in the coming years. Because of that, companies focused on those megatrends should thrive. That makes them potentially lucrative opportunities that investors won't want to miss.

2022-11-11 00:00:00+00:00,Wall Street's Making Big Calls on These 2 Dow Stocks,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-streets-making-big-calls-on-these-2-dow-stocks,,,"Friday was a mixed day on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) giving back a portion of its gains from Thursday even as other major market benchmarks kept gaining ground. The Dow in particular has held up better than most other stock market indexes, in part because of its blue chip stock focus and its wide array of companies from different industries. Indeed, even after yesterday's big rally, the Dow remains down the least among popular stock measures.
Wall Street analysts pay close attention to the 30 stocks in the Dow, in part because those companies are so important as indicators of what's happening in the global economy. A pair of stocks caught analysts' eye on Friday, with Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) getting differing opinions from various professionals in the industry.
Walgreens gets a nod
Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance had risen more than 5% at midday on Friday. The drugstore chain giant recently announced a big acquisition, and analysts liked the implications on Walgreens' business of its buying Summit Health.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB) upgraded Walgreens stock from hold to buy, boosting their price target on the drugstore chain's shares by $9 to $50 per share. Deutsche Bank believes that Walgreens has come up with a viable strategy to expand its business scope to include more direct healthcare for customers, and it sees Walgreens' VillageMD business as having made a smart move with its offer to buy Summit Health.
Summit Health's business includes a group of physicians and urgent care centers, and Walgreens offered a $9 billion price tag in order to compete more effectively in primary care. The move follows similar acquisitions by rival CVS Health as well as aspiring healthcare entrant Amazon.com, and with hundreds of medical practice locations, Summit offers Walgreens a chance to expand its network offering care dramatically.
After having lost a lot of ground during the first part of 2022, Walgreens stock has rebounded by more than a third just in the past month. Yet with a rock-bottom earnings multiple, investors still seem more skeptical than Deutsche Bank about the drugstore giant's ability to succeed in the long run.
Wall Street chips away at Intel
On the other side of the coin, Intel faced a stock downgrade on Friday. It wasn't enough to pull the share price down, but gains of just a fraction of a percent trailed what most of the semiconductor company's tech peers were seeing on the day.
Analysts at JPMorgan made the unusual move of downgrading Intel stock all the way from overweight from underweight, skipping the usual middle ground of equal weight in the process. JPMorgan also slashed its price target in half, with a new projection of just $32 per share.
JPMorgan is generally quite optimistic about the semiconductor industry as a whole, with favorable trends helping to offset macroeconomic pressures. However, the analyst company's views on Intel are less enthusiastic, raising concerns about losing market share to rival Advanced Micro Devices in the central processing unit space. Intel hasn't executed on its opportunities as well as it could have in recent years, and JPMorgan sees it taking time for the chipmaker to recover its past prowess.
As the lowest-priced stock in the Dow, Intel has drawn criticism from some who believe it no longer deserves its place in the venerable stock index. With the share price having dropped by more than half since early 2021, Intel needs to get moving in the right direction again if it wants to avoid that fate.

2022-11-11 00:00:00+00:00,Investors Heavily Search Intel Corporation (INTC): Here is What You Need to Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investors-heavily-search-intel-corporation-intc%3A-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-2,,,"Intel (INTC) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Over the past month, shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned +12.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +9.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Intel falls in, has gained 25.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
Intel is expected to post earnings of $0.27 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -75.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -71.9%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $1.98 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -63.8%. This estimate has changed -11.7% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.01 indicates a change of +1.1% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -19.9%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intel is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Intel, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.5 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -25.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $63.76 billion and $62.45 billion estimates indicate -18.3% and -2% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Intel reported revenues of $15.34 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.1%. EPS of $0.59 for the same period compares with $1.71 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.49 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.99%. The EPS surprise was +73.53%.
Over the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Intel is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

2022-11-11 00:00:00+00:00,US STOCKS-Wall St set to extend Thursday's surge on hopes of less hawkish Fed,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-st-set-to-extend-thursdays-surge-on-hopes-of-less-hawkish-fed,,,"By Shubham Batra and Sruthi Shankar
Nov 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were set for a higher open on Friday after a sharp rally in the previous session spurred by hopes that cooling inflation will push the Federal Reserve to take a less aggressive stance in its interest rate hikes.
The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX and the tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC closed 5.5% and 7.4% higher on Thursday, racking up their biggest daily percentage gains in over 2-1/2 years after data showed annual inflation below 8% for the first time in eight months.
""The inflation data was below expectations, but it is historically very high,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director, trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.
""At best it reduced the likelihood of a three-quarter point rate hike in December and brought it down to a half-point hike. It is still restrictive, but it just shows how much optimism there is to push this market higher.""
Futures contracts tied to the Fed's benchmark rate show traders now expect the blistering pace of policy tightening to slow next month and stop sooner than expected, as well as for the U.S. central bank to cut rates in the second half of 2023.
Investors see a 71.5% chance of a 50-basis point rate hike in December, while the top policy rate is seen in the 4.75%-5% range next May, lower than the 5% plus range seen before the inflation data. FEDWATCH
The S&P 500 has now rallied over 10% from its mid-October closing lows, while the Nasdaq has climbed nearly 8%, aided by better-than-expected earnings reports and hopes of a Fed slowdown.
The Dow .DJI is now down just 8.4% from its record closing high hit earlier this year.
However, all the three indexes are down sharply on a year-to-date basis, on course for their worst annual performance since 2008, on fears that surging inflation and rising interest rates will dent corporate profits.
At 8:27 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 148 points, or 0.44%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 19 points, or 0.48%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 69 points, or 0.59%.
Shares of megacap companies extended gains in premarket trading, with Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O up 0.8% after a near 9% surge in the previous session.
U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies rose, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N gaining 5% as China eased some of its strict COVID-19 rules.
Intel Corp INTC.O slipped 2% after J.P.Morgan resumed coverage of the chipmaker with ""underweight"" rating.
A survey from the University of Michigan due later in the day is expected to show consumer sentiment eased slightly in November, with the index seen slipping to 59.5 points this month from 59.9 in October.

2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00,Better Semiconductor Stock: AMD vs. Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-semiconductor-stock%3A-amd-vs.-intel,,,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have been sold off brutally on the market this year as the slump in the personal computer (PC) market has caught up with the chipmakers, both of which reported disappointing third-quarter results recently that didn't live up to the market's expectations.
AMD's Q3 numbers missed Wall Street's expectations and its guidance points toward a further slowdown in its growth in the fourth quarter. Intel's revenue and earnings, on the other hand, were also down significantly thanks to a terrible performance from its two largest business segments. Not surprisingly, shares of AMD and Intel are down 56% and 45%, respectively, in 2022.
However, one of these semiconductor stocks could regain its mojo and turn its fortunes around sooner than the other. Let's see which one that could be.
The PC slump hurt AMD, but Intel faces bigger problems
AMD's third-quarter revenue was up ""just"" 29% to $5.6 billion last quarter. The 40% year-over-year decline in the company's client segment revenue, which includes sales of processors used in desktop and notebook computers, played spoilsport and kept AMD from meeting its original revenue target of $6.7 billion. The chipmaker's earnings also dropped 8% year over year to $0.67 per share.
The PC slump is going to weigh on AMD's performance in the current quarter as well. The company expects just 14% year-over-year revenue growth this quarter thanks to the weakness in the client and the gaming markets. Analysts expect AMD to deliver muted growth in 2023 as well, forecasting an increase of just 6% in revenue and 4% in earnings per share.
Intel, however, fared worse in the third quarter. Chipzilla's revenue fell 15% year over year to $15.3 billion, while adjusted earnings were down 59% to $0.59 per share. The PC market's weakness led to a 17% year-over-year decline in Intel's revenue from its largest segment -- client computing group -- to $8.1 billion.
Intel's other key pillar, the data center and artificial intelligence group, also crumbled as the segment's revenue fell a whopping 27% year over year to $4.2 billion. It is worth noting that AMD's data center business recorded an impressive year-over-year growth of 45% last quarter to $1.6 billion, driven by the healthy demand for its Epyc server processors.
So, while both of Intel's biggest businesses misfired, AMD was able to hold its ground in the data center business. That's not surprising, as AMD has been consistently taking market share away from Intel in data center processors. The bad news for Intel is that AMD is expected to corner a bigger share of the server processor market in 2023.
Market research firm TrendForce estimates that AMD's server market share could increase to 22% in 2023 from 15% this year. Intel itself is to blame for its market share decline as the chip giant has failed to start the mass production of its next-generation Sapphire Rapids processors. These processors were supposed to be made widely available to customers in 2022, but Intel has now shifted the timeline to 2023.
AMD's fourth-generation Epyc server processors, on the other hand, have already been selected by major server OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and are all set to hit the market. So, it won't be surprising to see AMD corner a bigger share of the server market in 2023, and the bad news for Intel investors is that it doesn't expect to start gaining market share in this space until 2025.
This explains why analysts expect Intel's top and bottom lines to contract in 2023, unlike AMD, which is expected to deliver growth despite the headwinds.
Investors have an easy decision to make
Intel is gunning for a turnaround, but it faces a stiff challenge from its rivals in the server and client processor markets. Wall Street isn't optimistic about a comeback by Intel, as its earnings are expected to shrink at an annual pace of 20% over the next five years. AMD is expected to fare better, with an estimated annual earnings growth of 17% for the next five years.
That's not surprising, as AMD's diversified end markets and its share gains against Intel should help it overcome the near-term challenges that it is facing. Moreover, with AMD stock trading at 15 times forward earnings, which is identical to Intel's forward price-to-earnings ratio, buying the former looks like a no-brainer since it is built for growth while Intel's struggles are expected to continue.

2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Big Tech Stocks Apple, Microsoft, and Intel Ripped Higher Today",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-big-tech-stocks-apple-microsoft-and-intel-ripped-higher-today,,,"What happened
Shares of big tech stocks Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) all moved significantly higher today, rocketing 6.2%, 6.6%, and 5.5%, respectively, as of 12:33 p.m. ET.
Those are massive moves for companies that big, but today was no ordinary day. After basically a year of negative surprises in the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) releases, with some exceptions, today's CPI print was lower than expected, fueling hopes of a Federal Reserve pause on its aggressive interest rate hikes.
These tech giants are each at least partially exposed to the troubled PC sector, which has been one of the hardest-hit areas of tech. While enterprise spending on cloud and servers has been hanging in, the prospect of more interest rate hikes or recession had led to fears another shoe was to drop. So today's print was especially positive, given that the sooner inflation declines, the sooner the Fed can stop hiking interest rates, and the greater the possibility of avoiding a recession.
So what
Obviously, Apple and Microsoft make the two main operating systems for virtually all PCs, and Intel's largest business segment is its PC processors. Therefore, each stock had seen a big sell-off this year, despite their size, moats, and relatively limited competition.
Of note, technology research firm Gartner projects that third-quarter PC shipments were down a stunning 19.5% year over year -- the biggest drop since it began tracking PC shipments in the 1990s.
So why is today's CPI print so important in relation to PC sales? Well, the rapidly rising interest rate hikes tend to hit interest rate-sensitive items hardest first, which are usually big-ticket items like housing, autos, home electronics, and business fixed investments, which these days include data centers and enterprise PCs.
Add to that the fact that so many consumers bought new computers during the 2020-2021 timeframe, and could therefore defer the purchase of a new computer, and the rapid shift in rates led to a huge air pocket in PC sales. So, the potential for a pause in interest rate hikes could give big-ticket items a boost from their current severe downturn.
Apple has held up much better than others, as it had fallen ""only"" 23.6% this year, as opposed to 32.8% for Microsoft and 44.5% for Intel.
AAPL Year to Date Total Returns (Daily) data by YCharts
It's somewhat surprising that Apple has done better than Microsoft, given that it was thought consumer spending on electronics is generally weaker than enterprise spending. Microsoft's More Personal Computing segment, which is geared toward consumer-facing PCs, video games, and Bing digital advertising, is only 30% or so of the business, as opposed to Apple being predominantly a consumer-facing company, so it's strange that Apple had held up better than Microsoft this year. The outperformance does go to show how strong Apple's brand is and how much of a staple the iPhone is.
Intel has really been feeling the pain of the PC downturn this year, because that had been the company's cash cow. New Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has ambitious plans to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing in leading-edge semiconductors by achieving five node transitions in four years, while also building out a massive foundry ecosystem to serve third-party chip designers.
That's incredibly hard and very expensive to do, which is why the plummet in PC sales has been so harmful to Intel this year, as it deprived the company of needed cash to execute its investment plans. That's why Intel has traded down to just a single-digit P/E ratio this year.
Given the shellacking these stocks have already taken, and given that the market is forward looking, it's no surprise they are ripping higher at the prospect of inflation cooling off.
Now what
Given the lags with which the Fed's economic policy operates, investors should know that while inflation is slowing, it's because the economy is also slowing. Over the coming months, the Fed will try to keep rates high enough to cool inflation further, without tipping the economy into a recession. Despite today's rally, that's still a tricky proposition.
A recession would be bad news for all stocks, but of these three, especially Intel, since it is in a capital-intensive hardware business.
On the other hand, today's promising CPI print could allow the Fed to slow down or even stop its rate increases. That would be good for all economically sensitive stocks, as long as the economy doesn't have too bad of a downturn.
As is often the case, Apple and Microsoft still look like strong core holdings for the long term, even in spite of this year's declines. With Intel, an investment really comes down to your belief in CEO Pat Gelsinger's vision and ability to execute. If the turnaround works, Intel stands to have the most upside of these three names; however, if all that spending doesn't result in solid returns or Intel catching up to Taiwan Semi in leading-edge technology, it could be a problem, even if Intel's stock does look cheap today.

2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00,5 Cash-Rich Stocks to Buy to Resist the Fed,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-cash-rich-stocks-to-buy-to-resist-the-fed,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Cash is king. Cash lets companies grow through hard times, which is vital in technology. What investors forgot in 2022 is that tech has always been a boom-and-bust business. If you’re making computer chips or building clouds, you have enormous capital needs. You must invest through the business cycle. Cash is how you do it. So, it pays to be one of the top cash-rich stocks.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was once a prime example. For years, under leaders like the late, legendary Andy Grove, Intel refused to offer a dividend. Tech companies that paid dividends didn’t have anything better to do with shareholders’ money.
This changed in the 21st century. Intel’s dividend now yields over 5%. It has been fat for years. It was supposed to help Intel stock compete for investor cash against rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which didn’t pay a dividend.
But by focusing on chip design and contracting manufacturing, NVDA and AMD passed INTC in market cap. When trouble came the dividend was no protection for Intel stock. Intel lost almost half its value in 2022. It still had $27 billion in cash on its books in Sept., but it now needs U.S. government aid to “inshore” production to Ohio.
Most  companies in this gallery are what I call “Cloud Czars.” Like cash-rich stocks, such as Intel, they have huge capital budgets, built entirely with cash. Their giant data centers are built with cash flow, but they also keep mountains of cash on hand in case the cash flow runs low, as it has this year. Contrast this with AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). They defined infrastructure in the 20th century. They built with debt. Since the start of the 21st century AT&T stock is down by half and Verizon by one-third.
This is a tough time for tech. Nearly all tech stocks are down. The Cloud Czars are down more than most. But it’s when a well-run company’s stock is down that you buy it. Buy low, sell high.
On the other hand, if you just don’t like tech, I do have a non-tech stock to suggest. It has tons of cash on the books. You can probably guess what it is.
AAPL Apple $143.12
MSFT Microsoft $238.82
GOOG GOOGL Alphabet $93.55
AMZN Amazon $96.93
BRK-B Berkshire Hathaway $297.98
Cash-Rich Stocks: Apple (AAPL)

One of the biggest cash-rich stocks to own is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the King of Wall Street. With a market cap of $2.27 trillion, it had sales of almost $400 billion in the last 12 months. It reported one-quarter of that as net income. What stands out is its cash, $36 billion, and operating cash flow, $122 billion over the last year. This supports a capital budget of $11 billion/year and dividends of nearly $15 billion.
While Apple has been volatile, its value down 22% in 2022, it’s up 213% over the last 5 years, while paying a steady stream of dividends that are up 43% in that time. Before co-founder Steve Jobs’ death in 2011, it had paid no dividends for nearly 17 years. The stock is now worth 10 times what it was at Jobs’ death, which is why it’s said Apple is a stock you own, not a stock you trade.
This year Apple’s share price has tracked that of the NASDAQ market. Small wonder when it represents a full 7% of NASDAQ’s $30.47 trillion market cap total. But long-term investors (like me) who have held the stock for 5 years have done four times better than the average.
Cash-rich stocks like Apple does best when times are good. Times are not good right now. But no tech company has a firmer hold on its own supply chain, its sales channel, or its after-market services than Apple. Few balance sheets are stronger. It’s a sturdy place for your money to be.
Microsoft (MSFT)

Another one of the top cash-rich stocks is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the second-largest stock in the country by market cap, worth $1.79 trillion in early Nov. It had sales of $200 billion over the most recent 12 months, reporting a staggering 35% of that as net income in its most recent quarter. At the end of Sept., it also had an immense cash stash of $107 billion.
Unlike Apple, Microsoft remains cash flow positive, with net cash increasing by nearly $9 billion during the most recent quarter. This came despite covering almost $25 billion in new investment during the previous 12 months and making $18 billion in dividend payments.
Despite this success, Microsoft stock is down by one-third this year, although over the last five years it’s up 168%. During those five years, the dividend is also up 47%, to 62 cents. This means those who have held the stock for 5 years are getting a yield of over 3%, at the stock’s current price.
Microsoft seemed to dominate the computing world under co-founder Bill Gates, so much so that it was deemed a monopoly by the courts. But it’s current CEO Satya Nadella, who took over in early 2014, that has brought the company to glory. He did this by committing the company completely to the cloud, a decision that costs $5 billion/quarter in cash. But the stock is up almost 500% since he took over. Gates, who became a full-time philanthropist after retirement, is still worth over $100 billion. 
Technical indicators on Microsoft remain bearish. That’s fine if you’re a trader, with a time horizon measured in days or months. If you’re investing for the decades ahead, this is an easy stock to own.
Cash-Rich Stocks: Alphabet (GOOG GOOGL)

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has the third-largest market cap of any U.S. stock, about $1.21 trillion. It’s another one of the top cash-rich stocks to consider, with sales of almost $210 billion in the first three quarters of 2022. In the most recent quarter, it reported nearly one-quarter of that money as net income. 
Alphabet was barely cash flow positive in the third quarter. It had $116 billion in cash and securities on the books at the end of Sept., against $14.6 billion in long-term debt. Operating cash flow, however, was nearly $25 billion, in what was considered a down quarter. Cash fell because few companies have Alphabet’s capital budget. In just the first three quarters of 2022, it spent $24 billion, mostly on cloud data centers. That is as much as it spent in all of 2021. It has also bought back $67 billion of stock this year.
Despite this, the value of Alphabet is down nearly 40% in 2022. The main culprit is advertising, where operating income fell in September from the previous quarter. Aware of this vulnerability, Google has been putting enormous effort into getting enterprise customers for its Google Cloud service, which scored a quarter-to-quarter sales growth of 37%. But that came at a cost. Google Cloud lost nearly $700 million in the third quarter. Overall quarterly earnings were down 18%. Alphabet may continue to fall for a while. But it has plenty of cash to keep growing its cloud footprint. At some point, the value of that footprint will tell.
Amazon (AMZN)

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  lost over half its value in the last year. It was recently worth “just” $940 billion. In its latest quarterly report, this included over $35 billion in cash. Unlike most companies, Amazon always puts its cash flow statement first in its quarterly reports. 
Amazon was built on cash flow. Cash flow for clouds, cash flow for warehouses, cash flow for trucks. Most of the cash came from competitors, who rented those clouds, warehouses, and trucks, along with the software driving them. Amazon’s cash drove down its cost of doing business, it shared the savings, and this became the source of its success. It’s another one of the top cash-rich stocks to own.
This has been a tough first year for Andy Jassy. The former Amazon Web Services head replaced Jeff Bezos as CEO a year ago. Bezos was overbuilt during the pandemic. Growth has slowed, and profits have disappeared. It’s the first time in its history the company has had to cut back. The 45% fall in its market cap this year is valid. But the economy will come back.
There remain huge markets in banking and health care for Amazon to pursue. The company has, along with its competitors, launched a standard called Matter for voice services. This will boost its Alexa service. Amazon is also winning the streaming wars. It will also pursue all these opportunities with cash. In addition, Amazon had more cash on its books last Sept. than at the same point in 2021. More cash will flow.
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) is the real King of Cash, making it another key cash-rich stock.
Combined with its cash, short-term government T-bills, and fixed maturity investments, and Berkshire had $123.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Sept. That’s one reason the stock is down less than 3% this year. Another is the over $100 billion in operating cash flow it generated in the last year, $27 billion in the Sept. quarter alone. Even though its equity portfolio is down a whopping $44 billion since December, that portfolio is still worth $306 billion.
This means the actual business of Berkshire Hathaway, including its vast railroad and electricity operations, was valued at just $240 billion in early November. Annual revenues are about $280 billion. Take out its losses on investments, and foreign exchange and Berkshire operations would have been profitable.
The main business of cash-rich stocks, like Berkshire Hathaway, is insurance. Only about 18% of revenue comes from its vast holdings in railroads, energy, manufacturing, and distribution. This includes everything from one of the country’s largest electric grid operations, to the Burlington Northern railroad, to Dairy Queen and distributor McLane. Berkshire Hathaway is involved in nearly all forms of insurance, from personal to business, from first-dollar coverage of your car to the biggest reinsurance pools. GEICO is Berkshire Hathaway. So are U.S. Liability, HomeServices of America, and General Re.
It’s these operations that are the real source of Berkshire’s wealth. Insurance is a bet on disasters. If there’s no disaster, the insurer keeps your premium. If there are a lot of disasters, the insurer can raise prices. Over the long run profits are guaranteed.
Those profits must be invested. Warren Buffett, whose investments built the business, still does a lot of the investing. A few years ago, day traders fell over themselves criticizing the “Oracle of Omaha.” It turns out Berkshire isn’t a great investment in good times. But when there’s “blood in the streets,” when cash is hard to come by, that’s when Buffett swoops. That’s when his shareholders win.
But don’t think that if God calls Buffett home tomorrow you should sell your Berkshire stock. He has a deep bench of good executives. The break-up value of the company is greater than its $640 billion market cap. All that investment cash is gravy.

2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00,"AMD launches data center CPU 'Genoa', taps Google, Microsoft as customers",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-launches-data-center-cpu-genoa-taps-google-microsoft-as-customers,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee and Chavi Mehta
Nov 10 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O launched its latest data center chip on Thursday and said Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Azure, Alphabet-owned GOOGL.O Google Cloud and Oracle Corp ORCL.O would be some of its customers.
The fourth generation EPYC processor, code named ""Genoa"", makes significant improvement on performance and energy efficiency compared with its previous chip, said Chief Executive Lisa Su.
""What that means for enterprises and for cloud data centers is that it translates into lower capex, lower opex and lower total cost of ownership,"" she said.
Shares of AMD soared about 14%, mirroring the rise in peers such as Nvidia Corp NVDA.O which gained over 13% on signs of cooling inflation. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX surged 8.7%.
Genoa launches at a time when rival Intel Corp's INTC.O latest data center chip, code named Sapphire Rapids, has struggled with delays.
""With this latest generation, they (AMD) have made a huge leap in performance not only against Intel, but against their previous generation... so that makes the viability of an AMD-based solution much more real,"" said Bob O'Donnell, an analyst for TECHnalysis Research.
AMD, which launched its first EPYC data center chip in 2017, has been steadily gaining market share at the expense of Intel, making especially strong inroads with cloud service providers.
According to research firm IDC, AMD's market share of chips, which are built on the x86 architecture and used by cloud services, went from zero in 2016 to about 29% last year. Cloud is one of the biggest growth areas for semiconductors.
""IDC expects AMD will stay on track, continue building up market share in public cloud deployments,"" said Ashish Nadkarni, datacenter and cloud analyst at IDC.
