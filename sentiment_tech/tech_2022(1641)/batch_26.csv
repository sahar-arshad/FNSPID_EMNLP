2022-07-19 00:00:00+00:00,U.S. Senate tries again on computer chip bill to compete with China,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-senate-tries-again-on-computer-chip-bill-to-compete-with-china,,,"By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate is due to vote later on Tuesday on a slimmed-down version of legislation to provide $52 billion in subsidies and tax credits for the computer chip industry, over a year after passing its first version of a bill boosting semiconductor competition with China.
The bill is part of U.S. efforts to address an industry-wide chip shortage that has disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some firms to scale back production.
Senate aides said the bill would include a new, four-year 25% tax credit to encourage companies to build plants in the United States in response to growing calls to decrease reliance on other countries for semiconductors.
The Senate's Democratic majority leader, Chuck Schumer, announced that a first procedural vote would take place on Tuesday, calling U.S. semiconductor manufacturing a matter of national security as well as a source of jobs.
Senate aides said the goal is to pass the bill early next week. They would then send the bill to the House of Representatives, whose approval would then send it to the White House for President Joe Biden to sign into law.
""The message is not subtle: If companies do not think it is profitable to make chips here in America, they are going to go somewhere else,"" Schumer said as he opened the Senate on Monday.
Many major weapons also require sophisticated computer chips. Javelin missile systems made by Raytheon Technologies RTX.N and Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N each contain 250 microprocessors. These systems have been in high demand by Ukrainian soldiers as they work to repel the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
INTEL EXPANSION PLANS
Intel Corp INTC.O said in January it would spend $20 billion on a factory in Ohio after breaking ground on two new plants in Arizona last year. That could grow to $100 billion with eight total fabrication plants and would be the largest investment on record in Ohio, Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said in January.
However, he added that without government funding, ""it's just not going to happen as fast and it's not going to grow as big as quickly.""
Administration officials urged lawmakers last week to pass the bill, citing among other issues concerns about national security.
The current bill is a pared-down version of rival bills in the Senate and House of Representatives that stalled before becoming law, even though support for improved competition with China is one of the few areas of agreement between Biden's Democrats and Republicans.
The Senate approved a bipartisan $250 billion bill boosting spending on technology research and development in June 2021, one of the first major pieces of legislation passed after Democrats gained their slim control of the chamber.
However, the legislation was never taken up in the Democratic-controlled House, which earlier this year passed its own bill with almost no Republican support. That measure included provisions to boost chipmakers, but also billions of dollars for other supply chains and the Global Climate Change Initiative, which Republicans oppose.
Urged by the administration to do something, lawmakers recently began working more urgently on the slimmed-down legislation focused on semiconductors.

Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) were all rising today as the broader market made gains amid rising investor optimism. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up by 3% and the S&P 500 gained 2.6% this afternoon, likely helping to lift stocks higher.
Additionally, Apple may have been rising after positive comments from an analyst, and Intel was likely gaining as Congress works on a bill to help boost chip production in the U.S.
Apple was up by 2.5%, Amazon had gained 4%, and Intel was up 5% as of 2:20 p.m. ET.
So what
Investors were generally optimistic today as some are betting that the technology sector has already hit the bottom. Stocks have, of course, tumbled recently as investors have sold shares on fears of rising inflation, Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, and a potentially slowing economy.

Many stocks -- including Apple, Amazon, and Intel -- have suffered as investors have fled the market for safer places to put their money. That's resulted in Apple falling 15%, Amazon down 29%, and Intel sliding 20% year to date.
But some investors may now be looking at the share prices of these stocks and believing that they've finally reached the bottom.
With investors already expecting inflation to be persistent and the Federal Reserve to continue hiking rates, some investors think these headwinds are already baked into many stock prices right now.
As investors came back to the broader market today, Apple, Amazon, and Intel all benefited. But Apple may have also been rising after Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in an investor note that he believes iPhone demand is holding up fairly well despite supply chain headwinds.
Additionally, Intel's stock is likely rising today after a recent Wall Street Journal report said that draft Senate legislation shows that the U.S. could invest as much as $52 billion, through subsidies, to increase semiconductor manufacturing in the country.
The U.S. wants to invest in chip manufacturing as a way to stay competitive with China's chip production amid growing tensions between the two countries.
Now what
While it's good to see Apple, Amazon, and Intel making gains today, investors should also understand that there's still a lot of uncertainty in the market right now.
That doesn't mean that these companies aren't great long-term investments, but investors should pay extra close attention to the companies' upcoming earnings reports to see how each is navigating supply chain issues, rising costs, and a potential economic slowdown.
Apple, Amazon, and Intel will all report their latest financial results on July 28.

2022-07-19 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Rallied on Tuesday,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-rallied-on-tuesday,,,"What happened
Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) surged higher Tuesday, jumping as much as 5.1%. As of 1:38 p.m. ET today, the stock was still up 4.9%.
While there wasn't any company-specific news involving the chipmaker, a new bill being considered by Congress could boost much of the U.S. semiconductor industry.
So what
A draft bill in the Senate aims to increase semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S., putting the country on a more even footing with China. The bill would provide roughly $52 billion in grants and subsidies in the midst of a global semiconductor shortage and ongoing supply chain disruptions.
The chip shortage caused slowdowns across a wide range of consumer products, including electronics, smartphones, automobiles, and gaming consoles. The legislation is intended to help the U.S. better compete with China in advanced manufacturing and technology.
The draft bill being considered includes a variety of incentives, including tax credits for companies that manufacture chips in the U.S., high-tech worker training programs, and supply chain innovation and improvements, according to Bloomberg.
The legislation could also include provisions that would block companies from receiving funds if they build or expand manufacturing plants in China.
Now what
The Senate could take a procedural vote as early as Tuesday, as proponents hash out the final language of the bill. A final vote could come as early as next week.
It's important to note that even as the market bids up the stock, it doesn't appear that the legislation will benefit Nvidia, at least not directly. Nvidia farms out the manufacturing of its semiconductors, with the bulk of that outsourcing going to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
But Nvidia is exploring other options. Earlier this year, CEO Jensen Huang suggested the company was in discussions with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) to take over some of the company's semiconductor manufacturing, though no specific timeline for a collaboration has been suggested. Intel could be a direct beneficiary of the legislation.
This potential legislation aside, there are plenty of reasons to invest in Nvidia, as evidenced by its recent results. In its fiscal 2023 first quarter (ended May 1), the company generated record quarterly revenue of $8.29 billion, up 46% year over year, fueled by record gaming and data center revenue. Profits were also robust, as adjusted earnings per share of $1.36 climbed 49%.

2022-07-19 00:00:00+00:00,Better Semiconductor Stock: Intel vs. Micron,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-semiconductor-stock%3A-intel-vs.-micron,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) are two of the most important chipmakers in the world. Intel is the largest producer of x86 CPUs for PCs and data centers, and Micron is one of the top suppliers of DRAM and NAND memory chips.
However, investors dumped both stocks this year amid the broader sell-off across the semiconductor sector. Intel shed about a quarter of its value as Micron's stock lost roughly a third of its value. Should investors bet on either of these beaten-down chip stocks as a turnaround play?
Image source: Getty Images.
The differences between Intel and Micron
Intel and Micron both manufacture their own chips. Intel still leads the PC and data center CPU markets, but its first-party foundries have fallen behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the world's largest contract chipmaker, in the process race to develop smaller, denser, and more power-efficient chips. As a result, its fabless rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), which outsources its manufacturing to TSMC, now produces more power-efficient chips than Intel.
Micron isn't the world's largest producer of DRAM or NAND chips. That title belongs to the South Korean tech giant Samsung. However, Micron's 1α (1-alpha) DRAM chips and 176-layer NAND chips for data centers are still the most advanced memory chips in their respective markets.
Intel also sells NAND memory chips, but it's in the process of selling that smaller business division to the South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix. That entire sale, which will occur in phases, is expected to close in March 2025. Until that happens, Intel will exclude its NAND business from its non-GAAP (adjusted) revenues and profits.
Intel and Micron both operate in cyclical markets. However, Intel's core PC and data center CPU markets are arguably more stable than Micron's DRAM and NAND markets, which are prone to cyclical shortages, supply gluts, and price swings.
Intel faces existential challenges
Intel's non-GAAP revenue increased 8% in 2020, then grew 2% to $74.7 billion in 2021. Its growth decelerated as the PC and data center markets cooled off in a post-lockdown market, and it continued to struggle to hold AMD at bay across the laptop, desktop, and server markets.
As Intel struggled with those headwinds, its non-GAAP gross margin declined from 60.1% in 2019 to 57.7% in 2021. Its earnings per share (EPS) grew just 9% in 2020 and 7% in 2021.
Under its former CEO Bob Swan, Intel briefly considered becoming a fabless chipmaker like AMD. Swan's successor, Pat Gelsinger, swiftly abandoned that idea when he took over in early 2021 and doubled down on the expansion of its manufacturing capabilities to catch up to TSMC instead.
However, Intel's capital expenditures target of $27 billion for 2022 is still much lower than TSMC's estimated capex of about $40 billion this year, so it will likely need to rely heavily on government subsidies -- such as the CHIPS Act in the U.S. -- to close that funding gap. Analysts expect its revenue to stay flat this year and for its earnings to decline 37% as it grapples with those challenges.
Micron faces a cyclical slowdown
Micron's revenue surged 29% in fiscal 2021, which ended last September, and rose 24% year over year to $24.1 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2022. That growth was driven by robust demand for new memory chips across the PC, data center, cloud, auto, and industry 4.0 markets.
However, Micron expects its revenue to decline 13% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2022 as the PC and smartphone markets cool off. That forecast implies its revenue will only rise about 13% for the full year. For fiscal 2023, analysts expect its revenue to decline 7% to $29.1 billion.
Micron and its peers are curbing their production to avoid causing a severe supply glut (like the one which sank the market in 2019 and 2020), but it will be tough to avoid a hard landing as the market's appetite for new chips wanes.
Micron's non-GAAP gross margin jumped from 31.3% in fiscal 2020 to 39.7% in fiscal 2021, then expanded to 47.4% in the first nine months of fiscal 2022. Its non-GAAP EPS also soared 114% in fiscal 2021, and analysts anticipate another 41% growth in fiscal 2022 as it closes out its current growth cycle. But next year, they're bracing for a 25% decline as it exhausts its pricing power.
Micron would also benefit from the passage of the CHIPS Act and other government support measures, but it remains a technological leader and isn't starved for subsidies like Intel.
Both stocks look cheap, but only one is a value play
Intel trades at 11 times forward earnings, while Micron has an even lower forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9. Intel pays a forward dividend yield of 3.8%, but it might need to reduce that payout to fund its ambitious manufacturing plans. Micron pays a much lower forward yield of 0.8%.
Both stocks are cheap -- but Intel's existential challenges make it a weaker play than Micron, which merely faces a cyclical slowdown. Therefore, I believe Micron remains a much better buy than Intel.

July 18 (Reuters) - Several U.S. semiconductor firms are deliberating whether to oppose a package of chip industry subsidies if the final language of the legislation awaiting a vote in the Senate disproportionately benefits manufacturers like Intel Corp INTC.O, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has told lawmakers that a vote could come as early as Tuesday on a slimmed-down set of bills to bolster the U.S. computer chip industry, after Democratic lawmakers cleaved them from a larger, more contentious bill.
The bills are aimed at making the U.S. more competitive against a rising China, whose chip industry has grown rapidly over the last five years to account for almost 10% of global sales.
The measures include $52 billion in subsidies and an investment tax credit to boost U.S. manufacturing. The bills have bipartisan support, though Republicans may vote against the chip measures unless Democrats give up plans to try to push through unrelated spending bills that Republicans oppose.
But a rift is emerging within the chip industry itself, with some players concerned the final language of the legislation could provide disproportionate support to manufacturers like Intel while doing little to support other chip makers like Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O.
Intel, along with firms like Texas Instruments TXN.O and Micron Technology Inc MU.O, designs and manufacturers its own chips. Such firms would benefit from the $52 billion in CHIPS Act subsidies to build factories and also from an investment tax credit to purchase tools for use inside their factories from another measure called the FABS Act.
Intel earlier this year said it would spend $20 billion on a factory in Ohio after breaking ground on two new plants in Arizona last year.
AMD, Qualcomm and Nvidia design their own chips but tap partners to fabricate them and would see no direct benefit from subsidies to build plants or tax support for tools.
They support a separate version of the FABS Act introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives that contains both the manufacturing tax credit and a tax credit for chip design activities that would directly benefit them.
That version of the FABS Act - which is more pleasing to a broader swather of chip industry players - is also the one the Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents U.S. chip firms, has called on lawmakers to pass.
“We’re encouraged that the legislation is progressing, and we continue to support enactment of $52 billion in CHIPS Act investments and a FABS Act investment tax credit for both manufacturing and design,"" the association said in a statement on Friday.
The current Senate legislation contains no design tax credit. That has prompted some U.S. chip companies, which asked not to be named for fear of industry and government blowback, to debate opposing the Senate bill if the final language that comes to the floor has no tax credit for design activities, two people familiar with matter said.
""You have Intel that might get $20 billion with CHIPS Act plus $5 billion or $10 billion under the FABS Act. So $30 billion goes to your direct competitor, and you don't get a penny? That's going to cause problems in the market,"" said one person at a company debating opposition to the bill, speaking on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to talk to the press.
""It's going to benefit just a few companies,"" said a person at a second company deliberating its support for a bill with no design credits who was not authorized to speak to the press.
Nvidia declined to comment. Spokespeople for AMD, Qualcomm and Intel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

2022-07-18 00:00:00+00:00,Is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Stock a Buy Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-stock-a-buy-now,,,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the contract chipmaking giant more commonly known as TSMC, posted its second-quarter earnings report on July 14. Its revenue rose 37% year over year to $18.16 billion, which beat analysts' estimates by $580 million.
Its diluted earnings rose 67% to $1.55 per American depositary share, which also exceeded analysts' expectations by a nickel. Those headline numbers were impressive, but is it the right time to buy TSMC's stock?

Growing in all the right places
As the world's largest and most advanced contract chipmaker, TSMC produces the smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips for fabless chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Apple.
TSMC's growth decelerated in 2019 as consumers purchased fewer smartphones and consumer electronics. But in 2020, multiple catalysts -- including new 5G devices, robust sales of PCs during the pandemic, and a growing appetite for more powerful data center chips -- brought in a flood of new orders. That soaring demand, along with disruptions from trade restrictions, caused a global chip shortage, which further amplified TSMC's growth.
That momentum continued throughout 2021 and the first half of 2022, and TSMC started to generate a higher percentage of revenue from its smallest and most advanced 5-nanometer node. It also continued to manufacture a large number of chips with its second smallest 7nm node.

The stable expansion of its 5nm and 7nm nodes kept TSMC comfortably ahead of its two largest rivals, Samsung and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), in the race to produce smaller and denser chips.
Samsung also manufactures 5nm chips, but it hasn't been able to match TSMC's transistor density yet. Intel, which has fallen far behind TSMC and Samsung in that race over the past decade, completely abandoned nanometer-based measurements under CEO Pat Gelsinger -- who took the helm in early 2021 and tried to overhaul the chipmaker's manufacturing operations.
Its dominance of the 7nm and 5nm nodes has given TSMC the power to repeatedly raise its prices without losing customers. Its scale has also allowed it to expand its operating margins even as it increases its capital spending from $30 billion in 2021 to a historic high of about $40 billion throughout 2022 to produce even smaller 3nm and 2nm chips.

Can TSMC maintain that momentum?
Based on those two charts, TSMC looks like a rock-solid investment. However, TSMC's growth is cyclical, and the semiconductor market has been cooling off as people buy fewer PCs and as macroeconomic headwinds throttle the market's appetite for new chips.
As a result, there is a looming fear that the increasing production of chips to counter the chip shortage will create a sudden supply glut instead. TSMC's own guidance indicates that slowdown has already begun.
For the third quarter, it expects its revenue to rise 33%-38% year over year with a gross margin of 57.5%-59.5% and an operating margin of 47%-49%. Those metrics look healthy, but they also suggest its revenue growth will cool off slightly as its gross and operating margins dip sequentially.
Analysts expect TSMC's revenue to rise 31% for the full year, but to grow just 11% to $82.2 billion in 2023. They predict its operating margin will expand to 46.2% this year as some supply chain headwinds force it to postpone some of its planned upgrades (which recently caused it to reduce its full-year capex estimate from $40 billion-$44 billion to about $40 billion), then dip to 44.3% in 2023 as it ramps up that spending again. Its earnings per share are expected to increase 42% this year and grow 8% in 2023.
Even after increasing its capex this year, TSMC will still have plenty of cash left over for its dividends. During the second quarter, it spent 64% of its operating cash flow on capital expenditures, and 21% of that total on its dividends. It pays an attractive forward dividend yield of 2.3%.
It's a rock-solid buy at these prices
TSMC has endured plenty of cyclical slowdowns before, but it's still generated a total return of 1,520% over the past 20 years. It might not replicate those massive gains over the next two decades, but it will remain a linchpin of the growing semiconductor market for the foreseeable future.
TSMC's stock has declined about 30% this year along with the broader tech sector, but it now looks like a screaming bargain at 13 times forward earnings. The bears might fret over its near-term slowdown, but the bulls know it will inevitably recover as the cyclical tailwinds pick up again.

Blue-chip stocks are the backbone of any portfolio. These stocks protect investor capital in volatile markets and also create value through dividends and share repurchase.
Even in the recent market correction, there continues to be blue-chip stocks that trade at premium valuations. The reason is the flow of funds from growth stocks to low-beta blue-chip stocks. However, there are several blue-chip stocks trading at a discount due to near-term challenges.
When market sentiments improve, these stocks are positioned to trend higher. These blue-chip stocks trading at a discount also provide investors with a robust dividend yield. This would magnify total return for investors when sentiments change.
The 7 Best Tech Dividend Stocks to Buy Right Now
Importantly, it makes sense to be overweight blue-chip stocks in current market conditions. The focus is on capital preservation and returns that beat inflation. I believe that these seven stocks can be considered for exposure at current levels to achieve the key objectives.

Blue-Chip Stocks: Altria Group (MO)

Altria Group (NYSE:MO) stock has corrected by 21% in the last month. The key reason is that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ordered JUUL products off the shelves. Subsequently, the FDA has allowed selling of JUUL products as the company appeals against the order.
Irrespective of the outcome, MO stock seems to be among the attractive blue-chip stocks to buy. At a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.5 and a dividend yield of 8.75%, the stock is too cheap to ignore.
One reason to like Altria is the fact that Marlboro remains the cash flow machine. Even with stable revenue or marginal decline in the top-line, cash flows are likely to remain robust. This allows Altria to sustain dividends at current levels.
At the same time, Altria has been focused on expanding its non-combustible product portfolio. The company’s share of the oral tobacco category in the U.S. has been increasing. In the next few years, the non-combustible segment will increasingly contribute to cash flows.
With secured dividends and attractive valuations, MO stock is worth buying among blue-chip stocks trading at a discount.
Pfizer (PFE)

Year-to-date, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock has remained sideways. I believe this is a good accumulation opportunity for a stock that provides a dividend yield of 3%. Also, PFE stock trades at a forward P/E of 7.7, which indicates undervaluation.
On a relative basis, it’s likely that the company’s revenue from Covid-19 vaccine sales will decline even as countries mandate booster doses. However, the growth story for Pfizer is beyond the pandemic vaccine.
For the current year, Pfizer expects to invest $11.5 billion in research and development. With a strong pipeline of drug candidates, the company is positioned to deliver steady growth in the coming years.
Pfizer has also been on an acquisition spree in the last few quarters. With strong cash flows from Covid-19 vaccine sales, the company’s financial flexibility has improved. Acquisitions will allow the company to diversify and deepen the product pipeline.

As an example, the company believes that the acquisition of ReViral can add $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenue to the top-line by 2030. With visibility for sustained growth and cash flow upside, PFE stock looks deeply undervalued.
Blue-Chip Stocks: AT&T (T)

After the spin-off of the media division, AT&T (NYSE:T) stock looks attractively valued among blue-chip stocks. The stock looks good at a forward P/E of 8.2 and offers a dividend yield of 5.26%.
It’s worth noting that T stock has witnessed a marginal upside of 6.5% in the last six months. The uptrend in challenging market conditions is an indication of the undervaluation.
It’s worth noting that for first-quarter (Q1) 2022, AT&T reported revenue growth of 2.5% to $29.7 billion. Further, free cash flow for the quarter was $2.9 billion. This implies an annualized FCF potential in excess of $10 billion. Therefore, AT&T is well positioned to sustain dividends and deleverage.
AT&T has also witnessed sustained growth in post-paid phone and fiber subscribers. With strong capital investments and a robust 5G network, the company is positioned to benefit. For 2022, the company is also targeting to achieve $4 billion to $6 billion in cost savings. This is likely to have a positive impact on key margins.
Target Corporation (TGT)

Retail stocks have been under pressure due to inflation and its impact on margins. A possible recession in 2023 has also added to the concerns. However, these near-term headwinds provide a good entry opportunity in blue-chip stocks.
Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) stock has slipped by 35% in the last six months. Gradual accumulation can be considered. A forward P/E of 16.8 looks attractive. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock trades at a forward P/E of 37.7. This is an indication of relative undervaluation.
For Q1 2022, Target reported 3.3% growth in comparable sales on top of 22.9% growth last year. Digital sales have also remained strong as Target builds omni-channel sales presence.
7 Best Dow Stocks to Buy in July
Back in March 2021, Target had committed to spend $4 billion annually. This investment is targeted toward store re-modelling, building new stores and improving online sales capability. These investments, over the next few years, will ensure that the company sustains healthy growth.
Blue Chip Stocks: Intel (INTC)

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is another name among blue-chip stocks to buy that looks deeply undervalued. After a correction of almost 30% in the last six months, INTC stock trades at a forward P/E of 10.7. The correction clearly seems to be overdone for this 3.95% dividend yield stock.
A key reason to like Intel is some big planned investments. For the current year, Intel has guided for net capital expenditure of $27 billion. Recently, the company also acquired land to build a manufacturing plant in Ohio with a planned investment of $20 billion. If the CHIPS Act is passed in the United States, Intel will be a major beneficiary of semi-conductor subsidies.
In March 2022, Intel announced that the company will invest 80 billion euros in the European Union over the next decade. The initial investment of 17 billion euros is targeted toward a semiconductor fab mega-site in Germany.
With healthy cash flows, Intel is positioned to make big investments. This will translate into accelerated top-line growth in the coming years along with cash flow upside.
JPMorgan Chase (JPM)

The banking sector has been an under-performer and there seems to be value in high-quality banking stocks. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock has declined by 31% in the last six months and trades at a forward P/E of 9.9. The blue-chip stock also offers a dividend yield of 3.6% and looks significantly undervalued.
The banking sector has some near-term concerns. Inflation is likely to impact purchasing power. Aggressive rate hikes will also impact credit growth. At the same time, JPMorgan is likely to see some net interest income margin expansion.
JPMorgan Chase also has a strong balance sheet. A recession can be navigated with relative ease. On the flip-side, the bank is likely to see a loss in the wealth management and investment banking division. Weak equity markets will impact these segments. However, considering the valuation, this factor seems to be discounted in the stock.
5 Best Stocks to Buy if You Have $250 to Spend
Overall, JPM stock is worth considering at current levels for sustained dividends and potential upside when macro-economic headwinds wane.
Blue-Chip Stocks: Exxon Mobil (XOM)
Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com
Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is another quality name among blue-chip stocks trading at a discount. At a forward P/E of 7.4, the stock is worth considering and a dividend yield of 4% is attractive.
In the near term, a reason to be bullish on Exxon Mobil is strong growth in refining margins. For Q2 2022, refining profit is expected to surge by $5.5 billion. For Q1 2022, Exxon generated $14.8 billion in operating cash flow. With visibility for cash flow acceleration, dividends are secured.
Exxon also has some high-quality oil and gas assets. In particular, the company’s Guyana project is likely to be a game-changer in the next few years. The company’s Permian production is also on track for a 25% increase in 2022. If oil sustains above $80 per barrel, Exxon will be positioned to deliver robust cash flows from the exploration and production business.
From a balance sheet perspective, Exxon reported a net-debt ratio of 17% for Q1 2022. Considering strong cash flows, the overall credit health is likely to improve further. This can potentially ensure aggressive share repurchase and dividend growth.

2022-07-16 00:00:00+00:00,3 Dirt Cheap Semiconductor Stocks That Pay Growing Dividends,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dirt-cheap-semiconductor-stocks-that-pay-growing-dividends,,,"The semiconductor industry is constantly evolving to make chips smaller and more powerful. But in today's interconnected world, the demand for chips has expanded beyond consumer electronics and into cars, industrial machinery, and virtually every sector of the economy. The shift from mechanical processes to automation requires more chips. And that makes semiconductor stocks worth a look amid the broader stock market sell-off.
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) stand out as three particularly appealing semiconductor stocks to buy now. Here's why.
Image source: Getty Images.
An inexpensive way to make money with microchips
Scott Levine (Texas Instruments): If you're like many other investors, you've suffered a few sleepless nights recently thanks to the fear of an extended market downturn. While some may be running to fortify their portfolios with gold and other safe-haven investments, others are turning to the stocks of dividend machines like semiconductor manufacturer Texas Instruments -- a stock that currently offers an attractive 3% forward yield.
A cursory look at the stock's valuation may lead some to recoil at its price-to-sales ratio of 7.6, in light of the 2.5 P/S multiple of the S&P 500. Dig slightly below the surface, however, and you'll find that this is a discount compared to TI's five-year average sales multiple of 8.3 -- but don't conclude that it's a bargain now on that valuation alone.
Let's consider how shares are valued in terms of cash flow. Currently, shares are valued at 16 times operating cash flow, representing a discount to their five-year average cash flow multiple of 19.3. Furthermore, shares of Texas Instruments are trading at 17.7 times trailing earnings -- a notable discount to its five-year average P/E of 24.2.
Turning to the dividend, income investors will surely embrace management's commitment to rewarding shareholders. For 18 consecutive years -- from 2004 to 2021 -- Texas Instruments has raised its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 25%. While there's no guarantee that the company will increase the payout at the same rate in the years ahead, the dividend growth indicates management's dedication to shareholders. Yet management hasn't sacrificed the company's financial health to please shareholders with its rising dividend: Over the past 10 years, Texas Instruments has averaged a conservative payout ratio of 53.3%.
A high-yield blue chip dividend stock poised for a turnaround
Daniel Foelber (Intel): Intel stock has lacked luster in recent years. An absence of innovation caused the company to lose market share to Advanced Micro Devices and other competitors. In many ways, the stock deserved to fall. But looking ahead, buying shares now could make for an excellent turnaround play.
Intel made headlines in January when it announced a $20 billion investment in two chip factories in Ohio. However, it then announced in late June that its megaproject could be delayed based on the status of the CHIPS for America Act, a bill that is meant to bolster domestic chip production to create jobs and wean the U.S. off of chip imports.
Regardless of the timing of the project, the semiconductor industry has multidecade tailwinds. The growing need for domestic production is yet another green light for Intel to enter expansion mode.
With a price-to-earnings ratio of just 6.4 and a current dividend yield of 3.9%, Intel looks like a great source of passive income, while also providing upside potential if it can turn its business around.
A cyclical maker of chipmaking equipment
Lee Samaha (Applied Materials): The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical; it always has been, and it always will be. Сustomers cut production plans and stop ordering chips at the first sign of a slowdown. Similarly, as soon as the budding shoots of recovery appear, customers start picking up phones and placing chip orders. That goes for chip manufacturers and also for companies that make semiconductor manufacturing equipment, like Applied Materials.
That's something you can see clearly in the chart below. Revenue oscillates wildly but continues in a general uptrend, interspersed with dramatic falls during recessionary periods. However, note that the company generates good amounts of free cash flow that easily covers its growing dividend:
Data by YCharts.
Applied Materials' key customers include Samsung, Intel, and Taiwan Semiconductor. And if the recent warning from another chip maker, Micron Technology, is anything to go by, then a significant slowdown is coming. Applied Materials will feel it in the coming quarters, too -- so don't be surprised if the company suffers some bad news soon.
That said, if you believe this will just be another temporary trough in a long-term uptrend, it makes sense to start looking into investing in the sector. After all, the need for more and more chips in intelligent devices isn't going away over the long term. Moreover, this time around, semiconductor stocks like Applied Materials will pay a dividend while you wait for the next upturn.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Despite Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Lisa Su offering a strong outlook for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), investors panicked. AMD continued its plunge as it traded at fresh, new 52-week lows. At a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 18 times, AMD is historically inexpensive. Sellers reacted to a weak outlook from Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). Additionally, Ohio may delay funding for Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) semiconductor factory.
With those negative events, is AMD a buy, sell, or hold?
Ticker Company Price
AMD Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. $78.16
Micron Warning Sent AMD Stock Lower
On Jun. 30, 2022, Micron posted revenue growing by 16.4% year-over-year to $8.64 billion. It earned $2.59 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Unfortunately, it surprised markets by posting a weak fourth-quarter outlook. Micron Technology President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the industry demand environment weakened. In response, Micron will moderate its supply growth in fiscal-year 2023.
7 Best Dow Stocks to Buy in July
The supply cut is shocking to semiconductor investors. For over two quarters, the industry grappled with a chip shortage. Micron’s warning contradicts the previously favorable market conditions.
On its conference call, Micron said that it led the memory market with DDR5. However, server CPU platform launch delays hurt DDR5 demand. Micron said that PC demand weakened in many geographies. This is a red flag for AMD stock.
PC unit sales will likely fall by almost 10% year-over-year. This is worse than the previous expectations of an approximately flat 2022 for PC unit sales.
PC Sales Decline
Source: Chart from Stock Rover
AMD’s fair value is around $95.
Micron has a strong product portfolio for DDR5 memory and solid-state storage. Conversely, AMD is dueling with Intel on the PC desktop and server market. AMD may trounce Intel on the latter, but investors cannot ignore the PC market weakness.
Gamers who delayed upgrading their system may do so again. In the last two years during the cryptocurrency boom, graphics card prices soared. Retailers demand triple the manufacturer’s suggested retail price for GPUs. This means that AMD will not get unit volume sales to lift.
Gamers must pay more for food and gas. They are prioritizing their spending on necessities. The steep slump in CPU and GPU prices is hurting AMD stock. Investors who chased AMD shares at above $110 will hold onto losses for longer.
According to Stock Rover, a quantitative stock research site, AMD has a fair value of $95.
The semiconductor firm’s growth score improved in the last five quarters. Similarly, the stock’s quality rose. Profit margins and higher return on investments increased AMD’s worth. Its acquisition of Xilinx will strengthen its high-performance and adaptive computing offering.
Is AMD Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?
Hold AMD. Server demand will not change. Corporations must update their technology, regardless of the economic slowdown. When it reports results in August, AMD may post weaker PC-related sales. Fortunately, the stock already reflects the worst-case scenario.

2022-07-14 00:00:00+00:00,5 Semiconductor Stocks to Look at After the CHIPS Act Passes,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-semiconductor-stocks-to-look-at-after-the-chips-act-passes,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The CHIPS for America Act, meant to bring the semiconductor industry back to America, has become lost in partisan politics. Republican leaders who claim to support it are using it to seek concessions on other issues. Anyone interested in semiconductor stocks should pay close attention to these developments.
Stock in companies that support the funding are hitting the ground and aren’t being picked up. Reports that the present chip shortage is easing has increased opposition. Many oppose subsidizing an industry that appears, on the surface, to be highly profitable.
While I have many friends who question the need for the act, making semiconductors is a dirty business done by highly-paid people. Low-wage countries with lax environmental protections captured it decades before the origin of chips became a national security concern.
If we want to allay the national security concern, or avoid the industry moving to Europe, taxpayers must make an investment that will pay off in jobs, taxes and repaired supply chains.
There’s less urgency among voters for the semiconductor industry. The pressure to pass the bill is all coming from the industry, which is delaying construction of new facilities until the funding is secure.
7 Best Dow Stocks to Buy in July
If you think the CHIPS Act is necessary and likely to pass eventually, now would be a good time to buy the companies that most benefit from it.
INTC Intel $37.17
NVDA Nvidia $152.15
TSM Taiwan Semiconductor $81.24
MU Micron $58.96
AAPL Apple $145.77
Intel (INTC)

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) isn’t exactly broke right now, but the economics of the industry mean its cash would be better deployed in Vietnam or Abu Dhabi if the U.S. government doesn’t help.
CEO Pat Gelsinger, a longtime Intel executive who returned from VMWare (NYSE:VMW) last year, saw Intel move offshore and wants to bring it back. But he has threatened to move production to Europe if he doesn’t get government cash.
Intel is desperate because it needs to make decisions now on where it will produce chips in 2025. By then it hopes to be making chips with circuit lines just 18 Angstroms, less than two nanometers apart.
While Moore’s Law gets the headlines, Intel is acting as it is thanks to Moore’s Second Law. That is, as circuit lines get closer the equipment to make them becomes proportionally more expensive. There’s also what I call Moore’s Third Law, the idea that as chips grow more complex their environmental footprint also grows.
In the past, Intel offset these costs by putting factories where labor cost less, or environmental regulations were ignored. For Intel, the CHIPS for America Act is necessary to offset those costs. Without it, Gelsinger argues, Intel is either overseas or uncompetitive.
Nvidia (NVDA)

No company better represents the recent past of the semiconductor industry, and its future, than Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Nvidia makes graphics processors. These were once thought of as “helper” chips that offloaded complex graphics calculations from the microprocessor, for things like rendering video games. They’re now at the heart of artificial intelligence and metaverse applications, the future of the industry.
Nvidia doesn’t manufacture chips. It designs them, then hires a fabrication plant or foundry to make them. In recent years that has been Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), first to master the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology needed to render designs at 10 nm and less.
Nvidia’s co-founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, was also born in Taiwan, in the historical capital of Tainan, six years before Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO Lisa Su was born in the same city.

This brings up the industry’s problem. China claims Taiwan as its territory, and regularly threatens to take it by force. The semiconductor industry is now completely dependent on Taiwan for leadership as well as for manufacturing. If Taiwan were invaded today, the entire world economy would be threatened.
Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)

An hour’s drive outside Taipei is Hsinchu Technology Park, the most important manufacturing center in the world.
This is where Taiwan Semiconductor has most of its fabrication plants, or “fabs.” This is where it mastered EUV process needed for making today’s most powerful microprocessors.
Taiwan Semi has mastered this technology. Samsung has, too. Intel says it has. Chinese semiconductor manufacturers have not. China finds making even 14 nm chips difficult without imported technology, which the U.S. is now trying to deny it.
Taiwan Semiconductor is now building plants in Arizona and promises to build more once the CHIPS for America Act passes. This would protect the global industry from China’s threats against Taiwan Semiconductor’s home, a possible landing point for Chinese troops in an invasion. If war came, analysts at the U.S. Army War College have suggested, the Taiwanese plants should be destroyed. This would take the global economy with it.
Meanwhile, two thirds of the world’s semiconductor foundry revenue goes to Taiwan.
Micron (MU)

Micron (NASDAQ:MU) makes something the rest of the U.S. industry, including Intel, have given up on.
Micron makes memory and storage chips. Two Korean companies dominate the memory market, but Micron still has a 23% share.
Micron is known for making chips at its hometown of Boise, Idaho, but it is a global supplier, with plants in Malaysia, Taiwan and even China. Micron plans to invest $150 billion over the next decade. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra says that, depending on the fate of the act, more or less of that money will go to the U.S.
7 Best Biotech Stocks to Buy in July 2022
Because memory chips are commodities, unlike microprocessors, their price and Micron’s profitability are very sensitive to supply and demand. This has made the stock highly volatile over many years. It traded for just $10 as recently as 2016, and for $97 as recently as January. It’s down 37% on the year as prices for memory have eased for the first time in years.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Moab Republic / Shutterstock
The biggest beneficiary of the CHIPS for America Act is America’s most valuable company, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Apple has been seeking to control its supply chain for years. At the center of this are semiconductors, which it designs based on ARM Holdings designs. But Apple has no chip foundries of its own. Instead, it depends heavily on Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor.
As Taiwan Semiconductor expands in the U.S., in other words, Apple secures its own supply chain. Apple chips are among those expected to be produced at Taiwan Semiconductor’s new Arizona plant.
Apple CEO Tim Cook has said supply constraints could cost Apple as much as $8 billion this quarter. That is one reason why Apple stock is down 18% so far in 2022. Apple’s new designs change the entire industry landscape and will let it unify its iPad, iPhone and Mac product lines.
But without new manufacturing capacity in the U.S., it may all be just vaporware.

Finding tech stocks that come with a dividend is as hard as it gets. And if you find some good ones, it’s even harder to narrow down to the best tech dividend stocks.
Tech companies have historically focused on reinvesting profits in expanding their businesses and creating shareholder value through share price appreciation. It’s just the nature of the beast. Considering the current market conditions, though, finding investments offering dividends has become imperative.
Right now, most tech stocks with dividends yield lower than 2%. However, a few, as discussed in the article, offer much higher yields. The tech sector has evolved immensely over the past decade and now boasts big stable companies that can easily cover their dividend obligations. For companies having gone past their hypergrowth phase, that history has led to a healthy dividend increase.
7 Best Dow Stocks to Buy in July
So, with all of that in mind, here are seven tempting tech stocks offering dividends at this time.
Ticker Company Price
AVGO Broadcom $482.86
HPQ HP $31.10
INTC Intel $37.26
KT KT Corporation $14.34
IRM Iron Mountain $47.19
NTAP NetApp $64.25
NLOK NortonLifeLock $22.94
Best Tech Dividend Stocks: Broadcom (AVGO)
Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com
Dividend Yield: 3.4%
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor giant with a massive portfolio of more than 23,000 patents. Its CEO, Hock Tan, has reshaped Broadcom in his tenure, with the firm foraying into infrastructure software solutions and acquiring other businesses to expand its total addressable market. Moreover, it boasts an illustrious dividend profile with 11 consecutive years of payouts and has achieved solid dividend growth in the process.
On the fundamentals side, the company has done well to deliver robust revenue growth over the past several years. Its sales have grown more than 16.40% over the past five years, with a 37% increase in levered free cash flows. I expect its margins and top line to grow faster as it rebrands its software division to VMware. Its acquisition of cloud infrastructure provider VMware could result in massive synergies down the line, with Broadcom planning to shift its license customers to subscriptions.
In turn, the plan will likely result in higher recurring sales and a colossal increase in free cash flows.
HP (HPQ)

Dividend Yield: 3.18%
HP (NYSE:HPQ) has been delivering personal computers (PCs) since 1939, and more profitably than its peers. Of late, it has been experiencing robust PC demand due to hybrid work environments, homeschooling, and other novel coronavirus pandemic-led tailwinds. Its printers segment, though, has been experiencing declining revenue growth and has weighed in on its operating results. However, the trend hasn’t gone unnoticed, as its management now focuses on multiple verticals to usher in the next growth phase.
HP’s second-quarter results were encouraging, with its personal systems segment, setting a new record with 9% sales growth year-over-year (YOY). Consequently, GAAP earnings per share came in at $1.08, comfortably beating estimates at $1.05. Perhaps more encouraging is that growth from emerging businesses such as peripherals and gaming has been rising at a healthy pace.

For instance, peripherals sales grew by more than 40% during the second quarter. Therefore, there’s plenty to be excited over with HPQ stock, as recognized by the “Oracle of Omaha” Warren Buffett.
Best Tech Dividend Stocks: Intel (INTC)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Dividend Yield: 3.92%
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has the lion’s share in the PC and data center markets, with a loyal customer base. Over the years, it has proven resilient despite multiple headwinds and generated heaps of cash to cover its dividends and buybacks. However, amidst the current market downturn, its trades near its 52-week lows and at just two times forward sales.
Intel has plans to finally address production delays and chip shortages by developing its own foundries. It plans to dominate the space and reclaim the process lead by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) within the next three years. In addition to catering to its own supply, it can also offer services as a third-party foundry to other companies down the line. The strategy will take quite some doing from a financial perspective, which is why Intel is streamlining its business and freeing up resources. Moreover, it has expanded into the discrete GPU market and could move into other profitable verticals down the line to diversify its risk.
KT Corporation (KT)

Dividend Yield: 5.34%
KT Corporation (NYSE:KT) is a leading South Korean telecommunications services provider. Similar to other telcos, it delivered consistent top and bottom-line growth while boasting a strong dividend profile. KT is unique in its approach as it has identified that it needs to diversify from core services such as voice and text. Its Digital Platform (DIGICO) segment is what sets it apart from the competition and could deliver strong gains over the next several years.

DIGICO is a platform similar to what most software-as-a-service enterprises operate, aiming to expand in multiple digital services. Some of these areas include original content, logistics, and others. The division is set to deliver double-digit growth for KT and could expand at an incredible pace, with the company investing $21 billion over the next five years.
Best Tech Dividend Stocks: Iron Mountain (IRM)

Dividend Yield: 5.02%
Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) has established itself as a leader in managing physical records and storage solutions. In recent years though, it has been looking to transition towards digital data management and solutions. The world is quickly moving toward paperless transactions, and it’s recognized the shift and developed a strong portfolio of data centers in the process. At the end of last year, it reported 177 Megawatts (MW) of leasable capacity compared to 136 MW a year ago.
In its first quarter, the company delivered record quarterly revenues and profits. Its revenues came in at a whopping $1.25 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA of $431 million. Moreover, its annual funds from operations per share grew more than 11% from the prior-year period. Additionally, it boasts a well-positioned fortress balance sheet with $1.8 billion in liquidity.
NetApp (NTAP)

Dividend Yield: 3.19%
NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) describes itself as a “cloud-led, data-centric software company” that effectively allows customers to run their applications from data centers to the cloud. Its performances have been relatively strong, and it boasts healthy growth prospects ahead, particularly with its public cloud business.

Operating results have mostly come in ahead of expectations. In its recently released fourth-quarter results, it generated $1.68 billion in sales, representing an 8% bump YOY. Moreover, net billings grew by a remarkable 16% to $2.02 billion from the prior-year quarter. Perhaps more importantly, capital returned to its stockholders rose 53% sequentially from the third quarter, reaffirming its focus on shareholder capital return.
Best Tech Dividend Stocks: NortonLifeLock (NLOK)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Dividend Yield: 2.24%
NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK) provides a wide range of cybersecurity solutions to its growing customer base. Its client base continues to grow and evolve rapidly, which bodes remarkably well for the company’s long-term growth runway. Moreover, its services cater to three main cybersecurity branches: security, privacy, and identity. Its product base offers an easy-to-use platform that can enable its customers to effectively prevent, detect, and counter threats from cyber criminals.
Its revenue growth has been choppy owing to the cut-throat competition in the sector. Nevertheless, it’s coming off a strong year, and with its commitment to innovation, I expect single-digit revenue growth for the foreseeable future. Moreover, with its strong expertise in digital marketing, it can chomp away at its competitor’s market share. More importantly, for income-oriented investors, it offers a healthy dividend yield of 2.24% with a payout ratio of roughly 28.60%.

2022-07-14 00:00:00+00:00,These Are the 2 Cheapest Stocks I Own -- but Not for Long,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-are-the-2-cheapest-stocks-i-own-but-not-for-long,,,"There are many different ways to measure and analyze the fair-market value of a stock. Value investors often look at profit-based ratios first, such as the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) or the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio. Growth investors tend to focus on the pace of year-over-year growth on the top and bottom lines.
Income investors can base their investments on dividend growth or effective yields. So when you ask for the cheapest stocks in my portfolio, there are lots of ways to answer that question.
Let's keep this exercise simple, leaning on the most popular of all valuation metrics. Coinbase International (NASDAQ: COIN) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are the two cheapest names in my portfolio of 40 tickers, in terms of price to earnings. I expect great things from both companies in the long run, and I have no plans to liquidate these investments anytime soon. In fact, I should probably stop writing about them so I can double down on my investments without violating The Motley Fool's ironclad disclosure policy.
That will have to wait, though. Let me tell you why Intel and Coinbase are so cheap right now and why I'm sure they'll deliver tremendous returns from today's bargain-bin prices.
Coinbase P/E ratio: 4.9
The cryptocurrency trading-platform's stock has plunged from the lofty highs of 2021, losing 85% of its value since mid-November. Investors are currently not comfortable with high-risk investments and nosebleed-inducing valuation ratios, and Coinbase checked all of those boxes last year.
Coinbase shares traded at a hair-raising 101 times earnings roughly one year ago, but that formerly unreasonable ratio is now down to less than 5. That's a bargain in any sector, any industry, or any market environment.
It's true that Coinbase is under serious pressure right now. Fewer people are trading cryptocurrencies since the entire sector has reported sliding prices in the last six months. The idea of relying on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) as a hedge against inflation in the U.S. dollar and other fiat currencies isn't working so far, as cryptocurrencies largely followed the market moves of the most volatile growth stocks, instead.
The so-called digital gold still jumps higher and falls lower than the stock market as a whole. In fact, Bitcoin's price drop in 2022 is comparable to the highly leveraged ProShares UltraPro QQQ exchange-traded fund, which aims to match the daily moves of the fairly volatile Nasdaq Composite index -- amplified by a factor of three:

Coinbase is struggling at the moment. The company has paused its hiring of new employees while taking other cost-cutting measures. However, this isn't Coinbase's first rodeo, and I see no reason why the company shouldn't be able to come back even stronger when the crypto market turns upward again.
That, of course, is the crux. You don't want to own Coinbase shares if you think that cryptocurrencies are about as useful and valuable as a pet rock. If so, you may want to jump ahead to the Intel discussion below.
But I see blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies as important and valuable upgrades to industries, including (but not limited to) banking, payment, and contract management. In my eyes, these are the early days of a financial revolution and Coinbase is an innovator with tremendous long-term business prospects.
I don't mind Coinbase shares hanging out in Wall Street's bargain bin for a while. Since I have no intention of selling my existing position, I'd love to pick up some more stock at a great price, instead.
Intel P/E ratio: 6.2
Semiconductor-giant Intel is a different story. This stock has taken a milder haircut of 35% from the highs of last summer.
On top of the marketwide inflation fears, Intel is wrestling a lengthy global shortage in semiconductor manufacturing capacity and materials, and smaller rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia are nipping at the company's leading market share in key sectors, such as data center products. As a result, you can pick up Intel stock at 6.2 times trailing earnings, down from roughly 13 last summer.
Intel comes with a few advantages that Coinbase can't match. This company has been around since 1968, building a unique legacy and a massive infrastructure over the years. Chipzilla had $38.7 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of March, not to mention nearly $130 billion worth of properties, machinery, and chipmaking equipment.
We're looking at a fantastic cash machine here, and management isn't shy about putting that cash to work in the form of new or upgraded chip factories. The company generated $9.8 billion of free cash flow over the last four quarters, which is more than Coinbase's total top-line sales over the last three years.
Right now, the company is boosting its manufacturing facilities like never before, pumping a record-high $21.6 billion into new construction in 2021:

Intel has been down many times before, but the company always finds ways to spring back into action. This stock and the company behind it have all the tools to create a tremendous rebound from these historic lows. And Intel's effective dividend yield today stands at a generous 3.9%, so income investors may also want to take a second look at this down-but-not-out semiconductor titan.

2022-07-13 00:00:00+00:00,2 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-dividend-paying-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now-2,,,"When you think of dividends, perhaps slow-moving industrial companies or real estate investment trusts (REITs) may come to mind. Most companies that pay dividends have few growth opportunities ahead, but what if you want to find stocks that are dividend payers and have appealing potential ahead of them?
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) both fit in this box. These two companies have robust business models that have allowed them to see immense profitability and cash generation. These companies are using that cash to explore potentially lucrative spaces and are paying investors a dividend for their patience.
Here's why long-term investors should consider taking advantage of these great deals.
1. Apple
As one of the largest companies in the world, it's not all that surprising that Apple has enough cash flow to pay a dividend. The company has a dividend yield of 0.61%, which is small but represents over 14% of its net income. In the first six months (ended March 26, 2022) of its fiscal year, the company generated almost $60 billion in net income and $70 billion in free cash flow. The company uses this to buy back lots of stock and reinvest into its business; yet, there's still enough cash left over for this dividend.
What opportunities is Apple investing in? One of the most appealing areas Apple is exploring is augmented reality. The rumors are that Apple is developing virtual reality (VR) goggles and augmented reality (AR) glasses to come out in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Considering that Apple has been hiring employees in the AR/VR space, it makes sense that rumors are spreading.
The AR/VR market is expected to be worth over $450 billion by 2030, according to Allied Market Research, which could allow Apple to thrive given its unrivaled brand strength. Additionally, if these products connect with its pre-existing products, that could strengthen its robust ecosystem, making it easier for current Apple customers to adopt AR/VR spectacles.
Apple's primary concern is its size. Currently, it's worth $2.4 trillion, so for it to deliver market-beating returns over the next decade, the company would likely have to grow larger than $3 trillion -- breaking its own record for the biggest company ever by market capitalization. This is certainly possible, but beating this record by a large margin isn't something investors should expect.
Apple is, however, trading close to its lowest valuation since early 2020 at 24 times earnings. While this business might not deliver 1,000% returns over the next decade, it will likely provide steady gains, exposure to the emerging VR industry, and a nice dividend that will likely expand as the business continues to gush cash. For those reasons, you might want to ensure you have this technology staple in your portfolio.
2. Nvidia
Nvidia might not be the first stock to come to mind when thinking about dividends, but with a yield of 0.10%, it is a dividend payer. Additionally, this could get bigger in the future, considering the company only pays out 4% of its net income in its dividend.
Rather, most of its cash is getting funneled into capitalizing on the chip space. Nvidia is a leader in the gaming graphics processing unit (GPU) space with over 200 million gamers using its GeForce graphics cards. However, it also dominates other segments. The company has a 90% share in graphics for workstations in the professional visualization market, and 71% of the top 500 supercomputers rely on Nvidia's chips.
The company is also looking to gain prevalence in emerging segments like enterprise artificial intelligence and omniverse software. With all of these segments combined, Nvidia sees an industry worth $1 trillion. Therefore, it might make sense that most of its $9.5 billion in trailing 12-month net income is being spent here rather than on a dividend.
While the opportunity for Nvidia looks lucrative, it does not come without risk. The company faces stiff competition from companies like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices -- both of which also generate lots of cash. It's safe to say that this will be a fierce battle to gain share, but considering how big these segments are, it won't necessarily be a winner-take-all scenario.
The other risk to monitor is the company's valuation. At 42 times earnings, Nvidia isn't cheap, and investors might see some multiple compression ahead.
However, Nvidia looks too good to miss out on now. The company could rapidly expand over the long term given its massive potential. Additionally, as Nvidia gains share, it could decide to increase its dividend, making it even more attractive as a dividend play. Patient investors looking to see high growth and a rising dividend over the long term should consider adding Nvidia to their portfolio.

2022-07-13 00:00:00+00:00,"Google's cloud unit taps Arm-based chips, adding to Intel, AMD pressure",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/googles-cloud-unit-taps-arm-based-chips-adding-to-intel-amd-pressure,,,"By Stephen Nellis
July 13 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Cloud unit on Wednesday said it will start adopting computing chips based on technology from Arm Ltd, making it the latest company to join a transition that will take market share from Intel Corp INTC.O and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O.
Arm, the British chip firm that has said it plans to go public after a megadeal to be acquired by Nvidia Corp NVDA.O fell through earlier this year, has long supplied designs and other intellectual property that power chips for smart phones and tablets. In 2018, Arm started offering technology for chips used in data centers, a market dominated by Intel and AMD.
In the four years since, Arm's technology, which it licenses to other companies to weave into complete chips, has showed up in data centers around the world, including those at Amazon.com AMZN.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Oracle Corp ORCL.N in the United States and Alibaba 9988.HK, Baidu 9888.HK and Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700.HK in China.
Those firms buy huge volumes of computing chips and then rent out the computing power to software developers via their paid cloud computing services. They all still offer services based on chips from Intel and AMD. But with Google joining the ranks of cloud providers offering Arm-based chips, nearly every major provider now has at least a few offerings based on Arm.
Some of the cloud computing firms such as Amazon and Alibaba are designing their own Arm-based chips and having them manufactured by chip factories. Several others - including Google - are turning to Ampere Computing, a chip firm founded by former Intel executives that has filed confidential paperwork with U.S. securities regulators for an initial public offering.
Google said on Wednesday its new offering will be based on Ampere's ""Altra"" chips. Ampere is also selling chips to Microsoft and Oracle, among others.
