2022-04-18 00:00:00+00:00,October 21st Options Now Available For Marvell Technology (MRVL),MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/october-21st-options-now-available-for-marvell-technology-mrvl,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 21st expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 186 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new October 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $52.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $61.59/share today.
Because the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 12.17% return on the cash commitment, or 23.88% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $60.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $62.50 strike price has a current bid of $8.15. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $61.59/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $62.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 14.71% if the stock gets called away at the October 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $62.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $62.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 44%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 13.23% boost of extra return to the investor, or 25.97% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 52%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 50%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $61.59) to be 48%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-04-18 00:00:00+00:00,Marvell's (MRVL) Cloud Data Center Ethernet Growth Doubles,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/marvells-mrvl-cloud-data-center-ethernet-growth-doubles,,,"Marvell Technology MRVL recently announced that as per 650 Group's latest quarterly report, the company's year-over-year growth doubled in the cloud data center Ethernet switch port shipments, exceeding $9 billion per quarter run-rate in the fourth quarter of 2021. Also, the company's data center switch market share jumped from 6% to 10% year over year in the quarter.

Marvell's shipping of more than 3 million 400G switch ports in the fourth quarter reflected its strong growth momentum in cloud networking. Further, the company secured a record high level of 31% market share within the 50G SerDes switch segments, witnessing 104% year-over-year growth.

The growing cloud infrastructure build-out has been driving demand for low-latency and high-performance networking solutions. Marvell's Teralynx product line, added to the company's switch portfolio through the acquisition of Innovium, delivers the ultra-low latency, optimized power, programmability, and innovative telemetry essential to the cloud data center. The Teralynx switches and optical transceivers address the growing traction from cloud data customers.
Marvell Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus

Meanwhile, Marvell’s Ethernet switch and PHY business is gaining traction with new products in the enterprise market. Its refreshed switching products continue to grow with new socket wins.

The acquisition of Cavium business in 2018 has further boosted Marvell’s capabilities in the Ethernet business. It has so far helped Marvell in expanding its capabilities in the networking market and capture significant market share in the fast-growing data-center space.

In March, the company introduced Alaska A PAM4 DSP family for Active Electrical Cables, the industry’s highest performance 400G/800G AEC DSPs to address emerging 100G/lane adoption in cloud data center interconnect architectures. In the same month, Marvell announced the industry’s first 800Gbps or 8 x 100Gbps multimode platform solution that enables data center infrastructure to achieve dramatically higher speeds for short-reach optical modules and Active Optical Cable applications.

Per Global Market Insights report, the global industrial Ethernet market is expected to see more than 15% CAGR from 2021 to 2027 and reach $127 billion. This exponential growth bodes well for Marvell’s Ethernet Switches owing to the rising demand for higher network speeds for fast processing of data.

During fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Marvell’s revenues from the data center soared 113% year over year to $574.1 million. The segment accounted for 42.7% of total quarterly revenues, highlighting that it is currently Marvell’s largest end market compared to the rest.

2022-04-16 00:00:00+00:00,Best Semiconductor Stocks To Buy This Week? 3 To Know,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/best-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-this-week-3-to-know,,,"Are These The Top Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In This Month?
While investors digest the latest mix of earnings from big banks, semiconductor stocks remain relevant in thestock market today For the most part, this industry has and continues to serve crucial roles across the globe today. As most tech investors would know, these chips are essentially the brains behind most of today’s tech. From smart handheld devices and cars to computers and high-end gaming and cloud computing tech, this is apparent. Pair this with the current weakness in the broader tech sector and investors could be seeing an opportunity here.
For example, we could look at the largest semiconductor maker in the world, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). In its latest quarterly earnings update from yesterday, the company saw green across the board. Notably, it is looking at record revenue for the quarter, a total of $17.57 billion. This represents a solid year-over-year increase of about 36%. According to TSM’s VP and CFO, Wendell Huang, the company is seeing strong demand for its high-performance computing and automotive offerings to thank for this. For the current quarter, TSM expects its momentum to continue in these sectors with revenue growing by as much as 43% year-over-year. Despite all this, TSM stock is still trading at a year-to-date loss of about 23%.
Nevertheless, other industry leaders continue to press forward as well. Earlier this week, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) launched a $3 billion expansion of its Oregon research factory. Through the move, Intel is adding about 270,000 square feet of cleanroom space, bolstering the facilities’ efficiency. Safe to say, semiconductor firms across the board are leveraging the current global chip shortages. Should all this have you keen to jump on the top semiconductor stocks, here are three more worth watching in the stock market now.
Semiconductor Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] Now
Marvell Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVL)
Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU)
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO)
Marvell Technology Inc.
For starters, we will be taking a look at Marvell Technology. In brief, this semiconductor firm primarily focuses on developing chips for the data infrastructure industry. Through Marvell’s cutting-edge chips, tech firms across the globe can move, store, process, and secure their data assets. Among Marvell’s core end markets are the enterprise, cloud, automotive, and carrier architecture industries. As tech firms continue to upscale their data processing infrastructure, MRVL stock could be worth looking out for.
For one thing, even with investors rotating towards more defensive stocks, Marvell continues to grow its operations. Earlier this week, the company provided a key update on its cloud data center business. According to Marvell, its cloud data center ethernet switch port shipments are up by over 100% year-over-year. This would go to show that the company’s offerings remain relevant as shipments more than double. Additionally, Marvell also highlights that its share in the “overall data center switch market” is up from 6% to 10% year-over-year. In detail, the company notes that its share of the 50G SerDes segment is at a record high of 31% for the quarter. This is commendable seeing as it is a switch that is deployed by the “fast-growing cloud infrastructure market,” according to Marvell.
Overall, the current developments bode well for the company moving forward. This comes at a time when the Ethernet switch market continues to grow to greater heights. Throughout the previous quarter, the industry soared above the $9 billion per quarter run rate for the first time. With Marvell seemingly becoming a go-to for companies in the ever-growing cloud data center space, MRVL stock could be in focus. Would you agree?

Micron Technology Inc.
Another player to consider in the booming semiconductor industry now would be Micron Technology. Namely, Micron focuses on providing innovative memory and storage solutions for clients. These come in the form of DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory storage products alongside related services. Through its deep portfolio of modern storage solutions, Micron enables a vast array of tech industries today. Whether it is advances in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G applications, and data centers, or even businesses scaling their data stores, Micron remains relevant.
Despite all of this, Micron continues to find more room for growth. On Tuesday, the company revealed the volume production of its latest gaming memory product, the 16Gb GDDR6X. Alongside this revelation, Micron also highlights the differences between this iteration and its predecessor. According to the company, the GDDR6X memory boasts twice the capacity and up to 15% higher performance. In theory, this increase in overall capacity will serve to extend the boundaries of today’s state-of-the-art gaming setups.
As it stands, the GDDR6X will be shipping alongside NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) flagship RTX 3090 Ti graphics cards. Commenting on all this is Mark Montierth, Micron’s VP. He says, “Micron is once again at the forefront of the memory innovation powering today’s highest bandwidth solutions and built with the advanced process and interface technology to enable continued graphics performance leadership.” As such, would you consider MU stock a top buy in thestock market today

Broadcom Inc.
Last but not least, we have Broadcom. By and large, the company designs, develops, and manufactures semiconductors and related infrastructure software. Similar to our previous entries, Broadcom caters to the data center, networking, enterprise software, broadband, industrial, and storage industries. It accomplishes this by supplying hardware in the form of its semiconductors. On the flip side, Broadcom also offers software infrastructure solutions. These include data center networking, enterprise, mainframe, and cyber-security services. The likes of which focus on automation, monitoring & security, smartphone components, and telecoms.
Even with its diverse library of offerings, Broadcom is working to break new ground. This is evident as the company recently released sample availability of its Wi-Fi 7 ecosystem chip solutions. Why is this important might you ask? Well, simply put, it is the first set of comprehensive end-to-end chipset solutions for this generation of the ecosystem. By Micron’s calculations, “These Wi-Fi 7 chips more than double the speed of Wi-Fi 6 and 6E solutions on the market today, while simultaneously delivering reliable low-latency communications and extended range.”
Regarding the general demand for such a product, Broadcom notes that consumers continue to upgrade their Wi-Fi systems. This, it argues, is likely a result of the ongoing shift in lifestyles due to the global pandemic. Over two years since the initial onslaught, organizations around the world are adopting hybrid work arrangements. With such a shift, Broadcom’s latest Wi-Fi tech would come in handy. After considering this, could AVGO stock be worth investing in for you?

2022-04-14 00:00:00+00:00,"Is Trending Stock Marvell Technology, Inc. (MRVL) a Buy Now?",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-trending-stock-marvell-technology-inc.-mrvl-a-buy-now,,,"Marvell Technology (MRVL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this chipmaker have returned -8.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.9% change. The Zacks Technology Services industry, to which Marvell belongs, has gained 8.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Marvell is expected to post earnings of $0.51 per share, indicating a change of +75.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $2.23 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +42%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.79 indicates a change of +25.2% from what Marvell is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marvell.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Marvell, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.43 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +71.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $6.14 billion and $7.18 billion estimates indicate +37.6% and +16.9% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Marvell reported revenues of $1.34 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +68.3%. EPS of $0.50 for the same period compares with $0.29 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.46%. The EPS surprise was +4.17%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Marvell is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marvell. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-04-11 00:00:00+00:00,Are You a Momentum Investor? This 1 Stock Could Be the Perfect Pick,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-you-a-momentum-investor-this-1-stock-could-be-the-perfect-pick-45,,,"For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals. Zacks Premium provides lots of different ways to do both.
Featuring daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.
Zacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.
What are the Zacks Style Scores?
The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.
Each stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:
Value Score
For value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.
Growth Score
While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.
Momentum Score
Momentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying ""the trend is your friend."" The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.
VGM Score
If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank
The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.
#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.
But it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.
That's where the Style Scores come in.
You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.
As mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.
For instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.
Stock to Watch: Marvell Technology (MRVL)
California-based Marvell Technology is a fabless designer, developer and marketer of analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits. The company operates in Bermuda, China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
MRVL is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.
Momentum investors should take note of this Business Services stock. MRVL has a Momentum Style Score of A, and shares are up 0.1% over the past four weeks.
11 analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.01 to $2.22 per share. MRVL boasts an average earnings surprise of 8.6%.
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, MRVL should be on investors' short list.

There were concerns about the released FOMC minutes from a meeting in March, which revealed that the Fed officials are planning to shrink their balance sheet from the month of May. All the three major stock indexes ended in negative territory.
How Did The Benchmarks Perform?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 0.4% or 144.7 points to close at 34,496.51. Fifteen components of the 30-stock index ended in the red zone, while fifteen remained in green.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.2% or 315.35 points to close at 13,888.82, due to sharp decline in tech-stocks.
The S&P 500 lost 1% or 43.97 points to end at 4,481.15. Six out of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in the red zone.
The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) went down 2.6%, 2.4% and 1.9%, respectively, while The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) rose 2%.
The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was up 1.1% to 22.10. A total of 12.6 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 13 billion. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.76-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.56-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.
FOMC Minutes Signal Imminent Reduction of Balance Sheet
Minutes of the Fed FOMC meeting held on March 15 and 16 were released on Wednesday. It showed that the officials had reached consensus of  reducing approximately $95 billion a month from the central bank’s asset holding. There was general agreement that $60 billion in Treasurys and $35 billion in mortgage-backed securities would be allowed to roll off, phased in over three months, starting in May.
In addition to this, officials also discussed about rapid pace of interest rate hikes to tackle inflation. Their plans are not only to raise the target policy rate to half of a percentage point but also to push it to a ""neutral posture,"" approximately 2.4%. The markets reacted grimly to this report as there were concerns that these plans would lead to a major slow-down of the economy, sending it to recession. Tech-stocks and growth stocks were the biggest losers, as investors rotated out of the sectors with interest rate hikes undermining their valuation.
Consequently, stocks like Marvell Technology, Inc. MRVL and JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU fell 2.7% and 8.7%, respectively. Marvell Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
The 10-year Treasury Bond Keeps Reversing Course
On Wednesday, the 10-year Treasury note yield closed at 2.61%, putting the benchmark rate well above the 2-year bond, which traded around 2.5%. Investors kept monitoring the bond market as the 2-year bond had recently been hovering above the 10-year triggering a yield curve inversion, which is often seen as a precursor of recession.
Further Sanctions on Russia
The United States, the Group of Seven nations and the European Union announced further sanctions on Wednesday to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. New measures include a ban on all new investment in Russia. Sanctions were also announced on two major Russian banks, President Vladimir Putin’s two adult daughters, and on the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
Economic Data
U.S. commercial crude oil inventories increased by 2.4 million barrels in the week ending April 1, 2022. In the previous week, inventories had gone down by 3.4 million barrels.

In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 15.42% for Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc, 0.33% for Marvell Technology Inc, and 1.97% for Brady Corp.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-04-01 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now-2,,,"The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has been seeing some positive turnaround since the middle of March, gaining 20% as investors seem to have regained their confidence in tech stocks after a terrible start to the year.
The broader market rally has given shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: FB), Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) a big shot in the arm.
But investors who haven't bought these tech stocks yet still have an opportunity to go long, as they can be bought at relatively attractive valuations. Let's look at the reasons why Meta, Marvell, and Nvidia are worth buying right now.
MRVL data by YCharts.
1. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms stock is trading at just 16 times trailing earnings and 5.4 times sales despite rallying impressively over the past few days. These multiples make buying the stock a no-brainer right now as it is trading at a big discount to the Nasdaq-100's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33. The sales multiple is also lower than Meta's five-year average multiple of 10.3.
Throw in the fact that Meta's earnings are expected to grow at an annual rate of close to 20% for the next five years, and it becomes easy to see that investors are getting a good deal on the stock. However, it won't be surprising to see Meta's earnings grow at a faster pace as the company is on track to benefit from the fast-growing digital advertising market as well as the metaverse.
Global digital ad spending stood at $492 billion last year, according to third-party estimates, which puts Meta's market share at 23% since it generated $115 billion in ad revenue last year. It is worth noting that Meta's ad revenue shot up 37% in 2021, outpacing the 29% growth in digital ad spending last year, leading to a slight increase in the company's market share.

According to third-party estimates, global digital ad spending could exceed $645 billion by 2024, which should pave the way for incremental growth at Meta given its robust market share. What's more, digital ad spending is expected to cross $1 trillion by 2027, indicating that Meta is sitting on a secular growth opportunity.
The metaverse, meanwhile, could add to the multibillion-dollar advertising market by opening another avenue for digital marketers to tap into. The metaverse is a virtual, 3D world where avatars of real people could interact with each other. Though the concept is in its nascent phase, it is expected to take off substantially. According to a third-party estimate, the metaverse could grow at an annual rate of 39% through 2030.
Not surprisingly, companies have already started making their presence felt in the metaverse, setting up virtual stores and studios. Meta Platforms was the leader in the market for augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) headsets last year with a share of 78%. Headsets are the key to entering the metaverse, so Meta can use its solid market share in the headset market to make a dent in the virtual advertising space. Its Oculus Quest 2 is the most popular AR/VR device on sale now.
All of this indicates that Meta Platforms has a bright future ahead that should help the stock sustain its terrific growth momentum.
2. Marvell Technology Group
Chipmaker Marvell Technology is a fast-growing tech stock that can be scooped up at an enticing valuation right now. The stock is trading at 22 times trailing earnings, a discount to the Nasdaq-100's multiple of 33. Buying the stock at this valuation looks like the right thing to do given its terrific growth.
Marvell's revenue for fiscal 2022 was up 50% over the prior year to $4.46 billion, while adjusted earnings per share increased 71% to $1.57 per share. Analysts expect Marvell to sustain its momentum in the new fiscal year as well, estimating 37% revenue growth and a 46% increase in earnings per share.
It isn't surprising to see why Marvell is expected to grow at such an impressive pace once again this year. The company's chips are used in multiple fast-growing applications that include data centers, automotive, networking, and 5G networks, and the good part is that Marvell's offerings are witnessing solid demand.
For instance, in the data center market, Marvell said on the March earnings conference call that it scored more than a dozen design wins across multiple cloud customers last fiscal year. The company anticipates the new design wins to start contributing to its revenue from fiscal 2024. More specifically, Marvell estimates $400 million in additional revenue in fiscal 2024 from its new design wins with cloud customers, which could increase to $800 million in incremental revenue in 2025.
The data center business produced $1.78 billion in revenue for Marvell last year -- accounting for 40% of the top line -- and management's comments indicate that it is set to take off impressively in the next couple of fiscal years.
On the other hand, the growing adoption of 5G technology is accelerating the growth of Marvell's carrier infrastructure business. This segment supplied 18% of the company's revenue last quarter, recording 45% year-over-year growth. Marvell says that the rollout of 5G networks by multiple customers is driving this segment's growth. The good part is that Marvell has scored new design wins to supply chips for use in 5G base stations and has struck a partnership with Dell Technologies to help deploy open radio access networks that are expected to play a key role in the 5G rollout.
These developments indicate why Marvell expects its carrier infrastructure business to grow 40% year over year in the current quarter. More importantly, with the 5G infrastructure market set to grow at an annual pace of 53% through 2026, Marvell's carrier business should sustain its outstanding growth.
As it turns out, analysts expect Marvell to clock annual earnings growth of 42% for the next five years, which isn't surprising thanks to multiple catalysts. That's why investors looking to buy a growth stock should consider buying Marvell right away given its valuation.
3. Nvidia
At 74 times trailing earnings, Nvidia is not a cheap stock to buy. However, growth-oriented investors with an appetite for risk may find Nvidia an attractive bet right now despite its rich multiple for two reasons.
First, the stock is trading at a discount as compared to last year's earnings multiple of 90. Second, Nvidia recently revealed that it has a massive addressable market worth $1 trillion spread across several fast-growing industries that include gaming, automotive, artificial intelligence software, Omniverse software, and semiconductors.
For comparison, Nvidia had generated $26.9 billion in revenue last fiscal year, up 61% from the prior year. The huge size of Nvidia's addressable market indicates that its hot growth could continue for years to come. Not surprisingly, analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to grow at 30% a year for the next five years, though the company could exceed that given the potential revenue opportunity that lies ahead of it.
For instance, Nvidia sees a $100 billion revenue opportunity in gaming. This segment generated $12.4 billion in revenue for the company last year, and the good part is that Nvidia is well placed to grow this business at a terrific pace thanks to its solid market share in this space. Jon Peddie Research estimates that Nvidia had 81% of the discrete graphics card market under its control at the end of 2021. The company is unlikely to lose its solid grip over this market thanks to a massive upgrade cycle.
Nvidia estimates that only 29% of its installed base is using its latest RTX cards, with the remaining using graphics cards that are at least two generations old. What's more, the users upgrading to Nvidia's RTX cards are spending $300 more on each card as compared to prior generations. As a result, Nvidia should continue enjoying an increase in both graphics cards volumes and average selling prices.
Meanwhile, Nvidia sees a $300 billion revenue opportunity in the automotive market. It has already secured an $11 billion design win pipeline to tap the same for the next six years thanks to partnerships with several OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and component suppliers.
As such, investors who haven't bought Nvidia following its slide in recent months still have an opportunity to do so, and they should consider acting quickly before the stock becomes more expensive.

2022-04-01 00:00:00+00:00,FOCUS-The chip challenge: Keeping Western semiconductors out of Russian weapons,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/focus-the-chip-challenge%3A-keeping-western-semiconductors-out-of-russian-weapons,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
OAKLAND, Calif., April 1 (Reuters) - When Silicon Valley chipmaker Marvell learned that one of its chips was found in a Russian surveillance drone recovered in 2016, it set out to investigate how that came to be.
The chip, which costs less than $2, was shipped in 2009 to a distributor in Asia, which sold it to another broker in Asia, which later went out of business.
“We couldn’t trace it any further,” Marvell Technology Group Ltd MRVL.O Chief Operations Officer Chris Koopmans said in a recent interview.
Years later, it reappeared in the drone recovered in Lithuania.
Marvell’s experience is one of a myriad of examples of how chipmakers lack ability to track where many of their lower-end products end up, executives and experts said. That could stymie the enforcement of new U.S. sanctions designed to halt the export of U.S. technology into Russia.
While higher-end sophisticated chips that can build supercomputers are sold directly to companies, lower-cost commodity ones that might just control the power often go through several resellers before they end up in a gadget.
The global chip industry is expected to ship 578 billion chips this year, 64% of them “commodity” chips, said TechInsights’ chip economist Dan Hutcheson.
While Russia accounted for less than 0.1% of global chip purchases before the sanctions, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization, new Western sanctions underscore the threat in human terms.
“All those drones we've seen were not armed,” said Damien Spleeters, deputy director of operations at the European Union- and Germany-funded Conflict Armament Research group, which found the chips in the drones.
“Some of these drones that we have documented, like the Forpost, are now used in their armed version in the current conflict” in Ukraine, he said.
The report that prompted Marvell’s tracking work published late last year by the Conflict Armament Research also found chips in Russian drones from Intel, NXP, Analog Devices, Samsung Electronics, Texas Instruments, and STMicroelectronics.
Texas Instruments and STMicroelectronics did not reply to Reuters for comment; NXP and Analog Devices said they comply with sanctions; Intel said it’s against its products being used for human rights violations; and Samsung said it does not make chips for military purposes.
Military weapons such as drones, guided missiles, helicopters, fighter jets, vehicles and electronic warfare equipment all need chips and experts say they often use older chips that are well tested out. Now, under new U.S. sanctions even some of the most basic chips cannot be shipped to prohibited Russian entities.
For the most sensitive chips, controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the U.S. company selling them can be held responsible if the chip ends up with an entity on the U.S. banned list, said Daniel Fisher-Owens, a specialist on chips and export control and at law firm Berliner Corcoran & Rowe.
‘LIKE THE DRUG BUSINESS’
Figuring out where chips go is like tracking the flow of narcotics, experts say.
“It’s like the drug business,” said James Lewis, director of the technology policy program at Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. “There's cutouts. There's middlemen. There's money laundering … There's a black market distribution network.”
The point of the Russian sanctions, Lewis said, isn’t to track every chip, but to disrupt their supply chain, which the intelligence community has been working on.
Finding a solution could take creative technical approaches.
""Knowing where the chips go is probably a very good thing. You could for example, on every chip put in essentially a public private key pair, which authenticates it,” and allows it to work, Eric Schmidt, the former Google chairman, told Reuters in a recent interview, discussing high-end processors.
Marvell says it has a growing number of products supporting fingerprinting and tracing, and is working with industry partners and customers to advance this area. The Global Semiconductor Alliance has proposed its members work on building a “Trusted IoT Ecosystem Security” to tag and trace chips, said Tom Katsioulas, technology executive at the industry group.
That may be a lot harder to do for a $2 chip, without making it prohibitively expensive. The answer could be a matter of manufacturing process, regulation and, perhaps, will.
“Ironically, the technology to do this, all of the things that we've got in there, the blockchain, the IDs in the device, this has all been done before for other applications,” said Michael Ford an executive at Aegis Software who is working with the industry standards group IPC for better supply chain security. “All that is needed is that catalyst to make it happen.”
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could be that catalyst, he said.

2022-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,"Is Most-Watched Stock Marvell Technology, Inc. (MRVL) Worth Betting on Now?",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-most-watched-stock-marvell-technology-inc.-mrvl-worth-betting-on-now,,,"Marvell Technology (MRVL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned +7.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Technology Services industry, which Marvell falls in, has gained 0.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Marvell is expected to post earnings of $0.51 per share, indicating a change of +75.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.8% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $2.22 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +41.4%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.78 indicates a change of +25.2% from what Marvell is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.4%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marvell.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Marvell, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.43 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +71.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $6.14 billion and $7.17 billion estimates indicate +37.6% and +16.7% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Marvell reported revenues of $1.34 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +68.3%. EPS of $0.50 for the same period compares with $0.29 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.46%. The EPS surprise was +4.17%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Marvell is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marvell. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was among the best performing tech stocks of 2021. Although the stock did come under pressure this year, it has so far weathered the market-wide downturn relatively better than most of its tech peers. NVDA stock is down about 6% year-to-date (YTD) compared to the 9.5% drop for the Nasdaq 100 Index.

Industry-leading growth, solid product momentum, strong execution and innovation are all secret recipes that have powered the Nvidia growth engine. The only pushback now seems to be the stock’s stretched valuation.
Is Nvidia still a buy at current levels?
How NVDA Stock Makes Money
Nvidia derives the bulk of its revenues by selling gaming chips, predominantly to the PC industry. These graphic processing units (GPUs) also go into streaming services and console gaming devices.
The company is also heavily reliant on data center chips that power compute-intensive workloads such as artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics, graphics and scientific computing across hyperscale, cloud enterprise, public sector and edge data centers.

Segment-wise Revenue Breakup For Nvidia In Q4’21
Source: Chart by Shanthi Rexaline
Nvidia took to the hot-and-happening metaverse by unveiling its Omniverse enterprise platform in April 2021. This platform is meant to facilitate real time collaboration of global 3D design teams in a shared virtual space.
Nvidia Evolving as Diversified Tech Play
Nvidia is not about merely chips anymore. It has developed a whole new array of products, bestowing on it the advantage of a diversified company.
The four-day 2022 GPU Technology Conference (GTC) underlined Nvidia’s ambitious plans. The company bumped up its long-term total addressable market opportunity to $1 trillion. The break-up works out as follows:
Gaming: $100 billion
Software (AI enterprise software & omniverse enterprise software): $300 billion
Chips & systems: $300 billion
Automotive: $300 billion
To put things in perspective, Nvidia is now seeing more potential outside of Gaming, which makes the biggest contribution to the top line.
Nvidia’s Hot New Technologies
Nvidia is currently targeting a massive AI inflection. At the GTC, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang announced updates to the company’s AI platform and the AI accelerated program that would ensure performance and reliability of AI applications developed by partners.
The Nvidia founder sees the company’s AI as the “software tool box of the world’s AI community.”
“Our GTC 2022 release is massive. Whether it’s creating more engaging chatbots and virtual assistants, building smarter recommendations to help consumers make better purchasing decisions, or orchestrating AI services at the largest scales, your superpowered gem is in NVIDIA AI.”
The auto end market is another promising opportunity for Nvidia, given the accelerated electric vehicle (EV) transformation that is underway. Team Green is cementing its position in the automotive segment with the latest Nvidia Drive Hyperion 8 platform and Drive Orin system-on-a-chip. The who’s who of the auto industry have all stitched up partnerships with Nvidia. The company puts the value of its automotive pipeline at over $11 billion.
Not to mention the metaverse opportunity. At the GTC 2022, the company announced Omniverse for developers.
Nvidia also launched Nvidia OVX, a computing system, to operate complex digital twin simulations that will run within the Nvidia Omniverse.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Harlan Sur summarized Nvidia’s all-pervasive push as follows:
“With leading silicon hardware and software platforms and a strong ecosystem, Nvidia is well positioned to continue to benefit from major secular trends in artificial intelligence, high performance computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles.”
NVDA Stock Trades at Elevated Valuation
Notwithstanding the recent pullback, NVDA stock is still trading at an elevated multiple of 51.08 times its forward earnings. This is amongst the highest in the industry. In comparison, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) trade at forward price-to-earnings multiples of 28.09 and 13.18, respectively.
Nvidia’s trailing twelve months (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is at 26.51. The metric is at 9.03 for Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), 2.5 for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), 8.52 for AMD and 12.31 for Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL).
Bottom Line on Nvidia Stock
Nvidia’s premium valuation may deter some investors. Sifting through the company’s performance metrics over the quarters, we see that the it has been able to grow revenues at a robust clip of 50% or more for seven straight quarters.
After bottoming in mid-2019, margins have been trending higher thanks to strong topline growth and operational efficiency. Nvidia is among those very few companies that consistently outperform relative to expectations on the bottom line. More importantly, Nvidia’s future holds a lot of promise as it finds itself in the sweet spot of cutting-edge technological innovation.
The recent pullback in shares presents an attractive entry point for those investors looking to ride the potential upside promised by this tech growth story.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-03-23 00:00:00+00:00,3 5G Stocks to Buy Now Before They Rally Higher,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-5g-stocks-to-buy-now-before-they-rally-higher,,,"The newest generation of wireless network technology, 5G, is rapidly being built around the globe. In fact, dozens of countries have now deployed 5G, and some estimates point to these next-gen networks reaching 1 billion users worldwide by 2024.
But wireless service providers are highly regulated and quickly becoming a utility-like business model. The most profitable way to invest in 5G has been with the companies that develop the hardware and use cases for the technology, and they're poised to continue delivering strong returns in the next few years. That's why Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) look like great buys right now.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Qualcomm: 5G is about more than just smartphones
Mobile-chip-design leader Qualcomm was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the mobility movement of the 2000s and 2010s. Nearly every smartphone on the planet has a Qualcomm chip in it, and the company's bread-and-butter business is still doing great things. As 5G has set off an upgrade cycle among consumers, Qualcomm expects its sales from smartphones and RF Front End (the semiconductors that enable a device to receive a wireless network signal) to increase an average of 12% per year through 2024.
But 5G won't just be a growth driver for smartphones. Lots of other devices will benefit from 5G, too, as many consumers are turning to wireless mobile as their primary internet service provider. Smart-home devices and laptops are increasing the adoption of 5G. Industrial internet of things (IoT) is also proliferating as large enterprises use mobile tech to connect large numbers of smart devices to a network for greater efficiency and control of work.
Then there's Qualcomm's nascent auto segment, which is on pace to surpass $1 billion in annual sales for the first time this year. Qualcomm is using its know-how in smartphones to build an end-to-end platform for the modern vehicle, encompassing everything from the infotainment system within a car to advanced driver-assist systems (and perhaps someday fully autonomous driving cars) to vehicle connectivity with a mobile network. In another five years, Qualcomm thinks its auto business could be hauling in $3.5 billion a year.
After a pullback from recent highs, Qualcomm stock now trades for just 18 times trailing-12-month earnings (or 24 times trailing 12-month free cash flow). Highly profitable and growing sales at a healthy double-digit percentage clip, Qualcomm stock deserves some love right now.
2. Broadcom: These profit margins are no joke
Broadcom may not be the commonly recognized name that Qualcomm is, but it isn't any less dominant a business in the semiconductor industry. As its name implies, Broadcom is a specialist in all sorts of communications hardware, from data center equipment to wireless chips to optical network hardware. As far as 5G goes, Broadcom designs chips for 5G network infrastructure (like the small cells that generate wireless signal) to smartphone circuitry that enables 5G and WiFi connectivity.
As a big tech conglomerate, Broadcom isn't the fastest-growing enterprise. Even with a global chip shortage keeping demand (and therefore pricing on chips sold) at an elevated level, Broadcom's semiconductor revenue was up 20% year over year during Q1 fiscal 2022. Many peers reported sales far higher than that. Additionally, the enterprise-software segment (comprising network monitoring and security services Broadcom acquired in recent years) grew at just a 5% clip.
However, what Broadcom lacks in sizzling revenue growth it more than makes up for in profitability. The company generated free cash flow of $3.39 billion -- a free cash flow profit margin of 44%! Nearly all of this excess cash is returned to shareholders each quarter via a dividend and share repurchases. As for share repurchases, the board of directors authorized a $10 billion plan in December that's good through the end of 2022, and $2.7 billion of that authorization was repurchased during Q1.
Churning out massive amounts of cash, Broadcom is a must-see deal in the world of 5G and general communications technology. Shares trade for 34 times trailing-12-month earnings (19 times trailing-12-month free cash flow). A 2.7% dividend yield, one of the best in the industry, sweetens the deal.
3. Marvell Technology Group: An emerging leader in managing data
2021 was a busy year for Marvell Technology. It acquired cloud data center switch provider Innovium, and later, optical-networking company Inphi. Paired with Marvell's existing portfolio of hardware designs addressing high-speed movement of data, the new company is poised to be a key player in 5G and data center construction.
It's still early on for Marvell post-acquisition, but the merits for broadening its portfolio of offerings were on display in its Q4 2021 update. Revenue increased 11% sequentially to $1.34 billion, and the outlook for Q1 2022 implies another sequential rise in sales of over 6% at the midpoint of management's guidance. With a stronger lineup of silicon than ever before, the company is reporting a strong pipeline of design wins as its customers implement more of its hardware in their plans.
5G and adjacent areas of tech like the cloud and data centers should be a strong driver of Marvell's growth in the next few years. Cloud and mobile network services that utilize 5G are on the rise, and Marvell's high-performance compute, data movement, and data management hardware is well-suited to handle the faster network speeds of 5G technology. Some of these same designs are also being put into use in autos (much like Qualcomm's mobile chips), as the modern vehicle quickly transforms into a network-connected data center on wheels.
Granted, investors looking for a ""cheap"" 5G stock won't find that here. Marvell currently operates in the red (although it's free cash flow positive) due to its big purchases in 2021. In the coming years, the company will turn a corner and generate a profit again. In the meantime, though, the stock trades for nearly 90 times trailing-12-month free cash flow. Nevertheless, with data consumption quickly rising because of 5G-network deployment, Marvell is worth a serious look right now.

2022-03-17 00:00:00+00:00,We Did The Math WGRO Can Go To $27,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/we-did-the-math-wgro-can-go-to-%2427,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the WisdomTree U.S. Growth & Momentum Fund ETF (Symbol: WGRO), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $26.59 per unit.
With WGRO trading at a recent price near $22.08 per unit, that means that analysts see 20.44% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of WGRO's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL), Qualcomm Inc (Symbol: QCOM), and NVIDIA Corp (Symbol: NVDA). Although MRVL has traded at a recent price of $68.91/share, the average analyst target is 38.55% higher at $95.48/share. Similarly, QCOM has 35.34% upside from the recent share price of $150.45 if the average analyst target price of $203.62/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting NVDA to reach a target price of $310.02/share, which is 26.56% above the recent price of $244.96. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MRVL, QCOM, and NVDA:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
WisdomTree U.S. Growth & Momentum Fund ETF WGRO $22.08 $26.59 20.44%
Marvell Technology Inc MRVL $68.91 $95.48 38.55%
Qualcomm Inc QCOM $150.45 $203.62 35.34%
NVIDIA Corp NVDA $244.96 $310.02 26.56%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2022-03-17 00:00:00+00:00,Is Nuveen ESG MidCap Growth ETF (NUMG) a Strong ETF Right Now?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-nuveen-esg-midcap-growth-etf-numg-a-strong-etf-right-now,,,"The Nuveen ESG MidCap Growth ETF (NUMG) was launched on 12/13/2016, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Growth category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.
Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.
But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.
These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Because the fund has amassed over $355.15 million, this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Mid Cap Growth. NUMG is managed by Nuveen. Before fees and expenses, NUMG seeks to match the performance of the TIAA ESG USA Mid-Cap Growth Index.
The TIAA ESG USA Mid-Cap Growth Index comprises of equity securities issued by mid- capitalization companies listed on US exchanges. It uses a rules-based methodology that provides investment exposure that generally replicates that of mid-cap growth benchmarks through a portfolio of securities that adhere to predetermined ESG, controversial business involvement and low-carbon screening criteria.
Cost & Other Expenses
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.
Annual operating expenses for NUMG are 0.30%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.
It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 14.93%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Most ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.
Representing 37.20% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector; Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.
When you look at individual holdings, Marvell Technology Inc (MRVL) accounts for about 3.64% of the fund's total assets, followed by Cadence Design Sys Inc (CDNS) and Match Group Inc (MTCH).
Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 27.84% of NUMG's total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF has lost about -13.64% so far this year and is down about -3.31% in the last one year (as of 03/17/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $39.39 and $59.46.
The ETF has a beta of 1.10 and standard deviation of 24.41% for the trailing three-year period. With about 59 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
Nuveen ESG MidCap Growth ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Mid Cap Growth segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.
IShares ESG Aware MSCI EAFE ETF (ESGD) tracks MSCI EAFE ESG Focus Index and the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ESGU) tracks MSCI USA ESG Focus Index. IShares ESG Aware MSCI EAFE ETF has $7.24 billion in assets, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF has $23.76 billion. ESGD has an expense ratio of 0.20% and ESGU charges 0.15%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Mid Cap Growth.

2022-03-15 00:00:00+00:00,Market Sell-Off: Buying This Tech Stock Is a No-Brainer Right Now,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/market-sell-off%3A-buying-this-tech-stock-is-a-no-brainer-right-now,,,"The broader market sell-off has sent Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) stock packing in 2022, with shares of the chipmaker down 31.1% so far this year. When you look at Marvell's results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (released on March 3), however, you see indications that the stock's pullback might just be a buying opportunity given the pace at which the company is growing.
Marvell's revenue and earnings cruised past Wall Street's expectations thanks to the terrific growth in its top and bottom lines. The company's guidance was also better than expected on account of the robust demand for its chips, which are used in multiple fast-growing markets such as data centers, cloud computing, 5G wireless networks, enterprise networking, and automotive.
Let's take a closer look at Marvell's quarterly report and check why buying this tech stock is a no-brainer right now.
Image source: Getty Images.
Multiple catalysts are driving terrific growth at Marvell Technology
Marvell Technology reported $1.34 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 68% over the prior-year period. Adjusted net income increased to $0.50 per share from $0.29 per share in the year-ago period. The numbers exceeded Wall Street's expectation of $0.48 per share in earnings on revenue of $1.32 billion.
Marvell's outstanding year-over-year growth was driven by solid showings across all five of its end markets. Additionally, the acquisitions of Inphi and Innovium that were completed during the fiscal year gave Marvell's business a big boost, though CEO Matt Murphy said on the latest earnings conference call that its organic growth remained strong as well.
The data center business was Marvell's primary growth driver last quarter, as it produced 43% of total revenue. The segment's revenue more than doubled year over year to $574 million from $269 million in the prior-year period. Innovium and Inphi's relationships with data center customers played a key role in the data center business' growth, along with the fact that Marvell now has a stronger product portfolio to attract new customers.
Not surprisingly, Murphy remarked on the conference call that the company is ""engaged with multiple additional customers and are looking forward to further expanding our footprint in this fast-growing market."" The data center business generated $1.78 billion in revenue for Marvell last fiscal year, and the company sees strong acceleration in this segment on the back of new design wins.
More specifically, new design wins are expected to increase Marvell's data center revenue by $400 million in fiscal 2024, followed by $800 million in incremental revenue in fiscal 2025.
The 5G infrastructure market is turning out to be another tailwind for Marvell Technology, driving impressive growth in the company's carrier infrastructure business, which produced 18% of its top line last quarter. The segment's revenue was up 45% year over year on the back of an increase in 5G rollouts and the ramp-up of its products at multiple base station customers.
Marvell's 5G business should be able to sustain its strong momentum in the long run, as global 5G coverage is expected to hit 75% by 2027, compared to just 15% in 2020. Meanwhile, the 5G base station market is expected to clock a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. What's more, Marvell's partnerships with major 5G infrastructure providers should help it take advantage of the secular growth opportunity in this space.
The solid growth momentum is here to stay
Marvell Technology's guidance makes it clear that the company's impressive pace of growth is sustainable. It anticipates $1.42 billion in revenue this quarter, along with adjusted earnings of $0.51 per share. Those numbers point toward big gains from the prior-year period's revenue of $832 million and earnings of $0.29 per share. More specifically, Marvell's revenue could increase 71% year over year at the midpoint of its guidance range, while earnings could increase 76%.
For the full year, analysts expect Marvell's revenue to increase nearly 50%, followed by a 32% increase next year. What's more, the company's earnings are expected to increase at an annual rate of 43% for the next five years.
Marvell stock is trading at 11.3 times sales as compared to its 2021 average price-to-sales ratio of 16.8. The company's forward earnings multiple of 28 is also lower than last year's average of 38.
