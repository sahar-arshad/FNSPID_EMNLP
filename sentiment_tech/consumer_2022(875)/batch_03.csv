Nov 16 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell on Wednesday as a grim outlook from Target spurred fresh concerns for retailers heading into the crucial holiday season, while Micron's supply cut triggered a selloff in the chip sector.
Target Corp TGT.N tumbled as much as 17% in early trading as a pullback in consumer spending despite heavy discounting cut its third-quarter profit by half.
Its bleak results jolted the retail sector, with shares of Macy's Inc M.N, Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N and Dollar Tree Inc DLTR.O dropping between 1.6% and 8.9%.
Meanwhile, Micron Technology Inc MU.O said it will reduce memory chip supply in 2023 and make more cuts to its capital spending plan, as it struggles to clear excess inventory due to a demand slump.
Shares of other chip stocks such as Intel Corp INTC.O, Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O, Applied Materials AMAT.O and Lam Research LRCX.O fell between 2% and 6%, weighing heavily on the tech-heavy Nasdaq.
""There are two things weighing on market sentiment; you're seeing softer demand in two sectors with Target in the retail sector and Micron with the chips,"" said Dennis Dick, market structure analyst and trader at Triple D Trading, highlighting Micron's drag on other chipmakers.
Investors will also keep an eye on chipmaker Nvidia Corp's NVDA.O earnings, which is expected later in the day.
Despite the sales warning from Target, data showed U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in October, boosted by purchases of motor vehicles and suggesting that consumer spending remained stable.
The data and earnings reports come on the heels of upbeat quarterly results from Walmart Inc WMT.N on Tuesday that had added to market optimism driven by a softer-than-expected producer prices report.
All the three main indexes ended higher in the previous session as geopolitical worries were overshadowed by expectations that the improved inflation outlook would allow the Federal Reserve to shift to smaller interest rate hikes as soon as December.
Several Fed officials have also signaled that the central bank could slow its pace of tightening while stressing the need to continue to raise borrowing costs to stamp out high inflation.
San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly on Wednesday said it is reasonable for the U.S. central bank to raise its policy rate to the 4.75%-5.25% range by early next year, with a 5% policy rate as a ""reasonable starting point.""
At 13:04 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 18.28 points, or 0.05%, at 33,611.20, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 20.36 points, or 0.51%, at 3,971.37, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 124.92 points, or 1.10%, at 11,233.49.
Among other stocks, home improvement retailer Lowe's Companies Inc LOW.N jumped 4.9% after increasing its annual profit forecast on steady demand.
U.S.-listed shares of Grab Holdings Ltd GRAB.O rose 1.4% after the ride-hailing and food delivery firm bumped up its 2022 revenue forecast.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.73-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.23-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded three new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 50 new highs and 104 new lows.

2022-11-16 00:00:00+00:00,3 Reasons Dollar Tree Stock Is a No-Brainer Buy,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-dollar-tree-stock-is-a-no-brainer-buy,,,"With the S&P 500 down 17% year to date, 2022 hasn't been kind to stock market investors. But not every company has been hurt by the bear market. Discount retailer Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) has seen its share price jump 17% in the same period. Let's discuss three reasons why it can continue outperforming.
A recession-proof business
According to a Bloomberg survey of economists in October, 60% believe the U.S. economy will enter a recession within 12 months. An economic downturn could be catastrophic for many retail companies because less consumer spending means fewer sales and profits. Dollar Tree bucks the trend. As a dollar store, its business model focuses on getting prices as low as possible.
It pulls off its strategy through a no-frills shopping experience, low labor costs, and by locating its stores in underserved (mainly rural) communities where space and labor are cheaper.
That said, Dollar Tree is not completely immune from macroeconomic challenges like inflation (which stands at 7.7% annually as of October). The company is dealing with this headwind by raising its standard price; it went from $1 to $1.25 in late 2021. But as a deep-discount store, Dollar Tree is naturally better-suited to handle this challenge than its big-box retailer rivals (such as Walmart and Target) because dollar stores are typically the cheapest option for consumers when money is tight.
Business is booming
Dollar Tree's business is holding up well in this challenging economy. Second-quarter net sales jumped 6.7% year over year to $6.77 billion as inflation drives consumers to its low-priced goods. Inflation is a double-edged sword because it increases freight costs and changes the company's product mix in favor of lower-margin consumable products. But so far, Dollar Tree has shrugged off these headwinds -- with its gross margin actually improving from 29.4% to 31.4% in the period.
To keep powering growth, Dollar Tree continues to expand its store count, opening 127 new locations to bring its total to 16,231 in the period. The company also rolled out its new ""Plus"" offering to 697 more stores. Dollar Tree Plus offers higher-priced items of $3 and $5, which can expand selection and help boost same-store sales going forward.

Dollar Tree is also a cash cow. Second-quarter net income soared by 27.4% to $359.9 million, and management expects earnings per share to be between $7.10 and $7.40 for all of 2022 (an increase of 25% over the prior year at the midpoint).
The company returns value to shareholders through a generous buyback program, which retired 250 million worth of shares in the first half of 2022 with an additional $2.25 billion authorized for repurchase in the future. Buybacks can benefit investors by increasing the fundamental value of their shares relative to earnings and cash flow.
A good valuation
Despite its strong performance in 2022, Dollar Tree is still reasonably valued compared to the wider market. With a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 18.9, Dollar Tree trades lower than the S&P 500 average of 19.4. With strong bottom-line growth and a recession-resistant business model, the stock looks like a no-brainer buy at these prices.

Chicago, IL – November 16, 2022 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Macy's, Inc. M, lululemon athletica LULU, Dollar General DG and Dollar Tree DLTR.
Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:
What's in the Cards for Macy's Earnings?
Macy's, Inc. is likely to register both top- and bottom-line declines from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported numbers in its third-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 17, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5,175 million, suggesting a 4.9% dip from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has been stable at 19 cents per share in the past 30 days. The consensus mark indicates a decline from $1.23 a share earned in the year-earlier quarter. Macy's bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.7% in the last reported quarter. M has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 80.8%, on average.
We expect revenues to be down 4.6% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reading to $5,192.4 million and adjusted earnings to plunge 84.1% to 20 cents per share in the quarter under review.
Factors to Note
Soft consumer demand due to the inflationary environment and incremental promotional pressures is likely to have weighed on Macy’s third-quarter performance. Markdowns to optimize inventory levels within overstock categories and the possibility of an elevated promotional environment, given the high inventory levels, might have hurt margins and the bottom line. Also, deleveraged SG&A expenses are concerns.
On its lastearnings call management had expected third-quarter net sales of $5,160-$5,230 million, indicating a decline from the net sales of $5,440 million reported in the year-ago period. M had envisioned third-quarter adjusted earnings of 15-21 cents a share, suggesting a decrease from $1.23 reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.
Despite the aforementioned headwinds, we expect Macy’s solid execution of the Polaris strategy, robust omni-channel capabilities, curated merchandise assortment and initiatives to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience to have provided some cushion to its quarterly performance.

2022-11-16 00:00:00+00:00,U.S. retailers take a knock after Target's sales warning,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-retailers-take-a-knock-after-targets-sales-warning,,,"By Medha Singh
Nov 16 (Reuters) - Shares in several U.S. retailers slid on Wednesday after Target Corp TGT.N warned of a gloomy outlook for the crucial holiday quarter with surging inflation hitting sales and as it announced plans to save up to $3 billion in cost cuts to shore up profits.
Target shares tumbled 15% after the open and are now down by about a third so far this year, while Macy's Inc M.N and Best Buy BBY.N dropped more than 6% in early trade. Dollar Tree DLTR.O slid 2%, while the retail index .SPXRT slipped more than 2%.
But shares in Target's larger competitor Walmart WMT.N edged up 1.1%, a day after lifting its annual sales and profit forecast as demand for groceries held up despite higher prices.
""After so many emergency rate hikes it's now affecting the consumer a little bit and I think it's evidenced in Target today,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.
Target, which said third-quarter profit halved, warned of ""dramatic changes"" in consumer behavior that was hurting demand for everything from toys to home furnishings.
Target's update echoed its quarterly report in August when it posted a bigger-than-expected 90% fall in earnings.
With annual inflation running at 7.7% in October and high interest rates, shoppers are reining in discretionary spending, bad news for retailers that rely on year-end shopping to boost annual sales.
U.S. Commerce Department data showed U.S. retail sales improved more than expected after no growth in September.
""There was an expectation already that retailers are going to have a tough holiday quarter. I do think that overall the sentiment will be overshadowed by hopes of less aggressive Federal Reserve and inflation,"" said Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index in London.
Bucking the retail trend, home improvement chain Lowe's Cos Inc LOW.N added more than 4% after raising its annual profit forecast, while discount store operator TJX Cos Inc TJX.N bumped up annual same-store sales forecast, rising almost 1%.

2022-11-15 00:00:00+00:00,Kohl's (KSS) to Report Q3 Earnings: Here's What You Should Note,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/kohls-kss-to-report-q3-earnings%3A-heres-what-you-should-note,,,"Kohl's Corporation KSS is likely to register a decline in the top and the bottom line when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings on Nov 17. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $4,289 million, suggesting a drop of 6.8% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.

Although the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kohl's quarterly earnings has moved up 52.8% in the past seven days to 81 cents per share, the projection indicates a decline of 50.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The branded apparel, footwear, accessories, beauty and home products retailer has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 15.3%, on average. Kohl's delivered an earnings surprise of 2.8% in the last reported quarter.
Kohl's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
  Kohl's Corporation price-eps-surprise | Kohl's Corporation Quote
 Things To Note
Kohl's is battling a tough macroeconomic landscape, increased inflation and sluggish consumer spending. Escalated freight expenses, product cost inflation and more promotional activities have been putting pressure on the company’s margin. In its lastearnings call management highlighted that it expects freight costs to remain elevated in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. KSS anticipates a higher promotional environment during the fiscal third quarter. Apart from this, Kohl's has been grappling with escalated selling, general & administrative expenses (SG&A) for a while now.

Kohl’s is benefiting from its strategic framework, including driving top-line growth, expanding operating margin, implementing disciplined capital management and undertaking agile accountability. Its focus on optimizing store portfolios and accelerating digital business growth bodes well.
What the Zacks Model Unveils
Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Kohl's this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

2022-11-15 00:00:00+00:00,Macy's (M) to Announce Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/macys-m-to-announce-q3-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-cards,,,"Macy's, Inc. M is likely to register both top- and bottom-line declines from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported numbers in its third-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 17, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5,175 million, suggesting a 4.9% dip from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has been stable at 19 cents per share in the past 30 days. The consensus mark indicates a decline from $1.23 a share earned in the year-earlier quarter. Macy's bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.7% in the last reported quarter. M has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 80.8%, on average.

We expect revenues to be down 4.6% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reading to $5,192.4 million and adjusted earnings to plunge 84.1% to 20 cents per share in the quarter under review.
Factors to Note
Soft consumer demand due to the inflationary environment and incremental promotional pressures is likely to have weighed on Macy’s third-quarter performance. Markdowns to optimize inventory levels within overstock categories and the possibility of an elevated promotional environment, given the high inventory levels, might have hurt margins and the bottom line. Also, deleveraged SG&A expenses are concerns.

On its lastearnings call management had expected third-quarter net sales of $5,160-$5,230 million, indicating a decline from the net sales of $5,440 million reported in the year-ago period. M had envisioned third-quarter adjusted earnings of 15-21 cents a share, suggesting a decrease from $1.23 reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.

Despite the aforementioned headwinds, we expect Macy’s solid execution of the Polaris strategy, robust omni-channel capabilities, curated merchandise assortment and initiatives to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience to have provided some cushion to its quarterly performance.

2022-11-15 00:00:00+00:00,What's in the Cards for Applied Materials (AMAT) Q4 Earnings?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/whats-in-the-cards-for-applied-materials-amat-q4-earnings,,,"Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 17.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, AMAT expects net sales of $6.4 billion (+/- 250 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $6.4 billion, suggesting growth of 4.5% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading.

Applied Materials, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
Applied Materials, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Applied Materials, Inc. Quote
Factors to Consider
Applied Materials is likely to have persistently suffered supply-chain disruptions during the fiscal fourth quarter.

Further, sluggishness in memory spending, weak demand in the consumer electronics space and softness in AMAT’s 200mm equipment business are expected to impact the upcoming results negatively.

Additionally, escalating tensions between the United States and China inducing new export checks by the U.S. regime to cripple the Chinese semiconductor companies, might have marred AMAT’s financial prospects in the to-be-reported quarter.

The export curbs prompted AMAT to stop its shipment of equipment in the quarter under review to wholly-China-owned factories that manufacture advanced logic chips. This is likely to have hurt top-line growth in the fiscal fourth quarter.

Nevertheless, Applied Materials’ portfolio strength, expanding position in memory and increasing new design wins are likely to have driven its performance in the fiscal fourth quarter.

Growth opportunities across specialty nodes and new nodes ramp across foundry, logic, NAND and DRAM are expected to have benefited AMAT in the to-be-reported fiscal quarter.

The growing adoption of IoT, AI and Big Data is expected to have contributed to the performance in the fiscal fourth quarter.

Further, strengthening ICAPS portfolio is expected to have benefited the company in the quarter under review.

However, Applied Materials is likely to have continued suffering sluggishness in its Display and Adjacent Markets segment in the fiscal quarter under review.

Uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to have induced headwinds to AMAT in the soon-to-be-reported fiscal quarter.

2022-11-15 00:00:00+00:00,Buckle (BKE) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buckle-bke-to-report-q3-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-offing,,,"The Buckle, Inc. BKE is likely to register an increase in the top and bottom lines from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figures in its third-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings on Nov 18, before market open.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings is pegged at $1.34 per share, suggesting a 6.4% rise from the year-ago fiscal period’s tally. The consensus mark has been stable in the past 30 days.

This Kearney, NE-based player’s trailing four-quarter earnings surprise is 12.7%, on average In the last reported quarter, BKE delivered an earnings surprise of 8.6%.
Key Factors to Note
Strength in Buckle’s men’s and women’s divisions coupled with gains from the online business is most likely to have boosted sales in the fiscal third quarter. Apart from men’s and women’s businesses, BKE is benefiting from its denims and private label business. Categories like accessory and tops have also been performing well for a while now.

BKE is focused on enhancing its omnichannel capabilities. It continues expanding its assortment offerings to meet consumers’ altering preferences. Buckle’s store-expansion efforts appear fruitful as well. Further, the comparable-store sales (comps) increased in all three months of the fiscal third quarter. Comps rose 1.4%, 2.7% and 5.8% in October, September and August, respectively.

While the aforementioned factors raise optimism about the quarterly performance, any deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses is concerning. Also, a tough operating backdrop, including inflationary pressures and supply-chain headwinds, remains a deterrent.

2022-11-15 00:00:00+00:00,Dollar Tree (DLTR) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-dltr-earnings-expected-to-grow%3A-should-you-buy-0,,,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Dollar Tree (DLTR) reports results for the quarter ended October 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 22. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings call it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +20.8%.
Revenues are expected to be $6.84 billion, up 6.6% from the year-ago quarter.
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.09% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Dollar Tree?
For Dollar Tree, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +6.57%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.
So, this combination indicates that Dollar Tree will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?
While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Dollar Tree would post earnings of $1.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.60, delivering a surprise of +1.27%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
Dollar Tree appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.
Expected Results of an Industry Player
Ross Stores (ROST), another stock in the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.80 for the quarter ended October 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -26.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $4.36 billion, down 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.
The consensus EPS estimate for Ross Stores has been revised 0.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 3.13%.
When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Ross Stores will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.

2022-11-15 00:00:00+00:00,BJ's Wholesale (BJ) Lined Up for Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bjs-wholesale-bj-lined-up-for-q3-earnings%3A-whats-in-store,,,"BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. BJ is likely to register an increase in the top line when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 17 before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.62 billion, indicating growth of 8.3% from the prior-year reported figure.

The bottom line of this operator of membership warehouse clubs is expected to decline year over year. Although the consensus estimate has risen 5% over the past 30 days, it suggests a decline of 7.7% from the year-ago period.

BJ's Wholesale has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 16.5%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this Westborough-based company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 27.7%.

We expect total revenues to be up 7.6% year over year to $4,586.4 million and the bottom line to decline 11% to 81 cents a share.
Factors to Note
BJ's Wholesale’s focus on simplifying assortments, boosting marketing and merchandising capabilities, expanding into high-demand categories and building an own-brand portfolio is commendable. The company remains committed to enhancing omnichannel capabilities and providing value for customers. These endeavors have been contributing to growth in membership signups and renewals.

The company has been directing resources toward expanding digital capabilities to better engage with members and provide them with a convenient way to shop, including same-day delivery, curbside pickup and buy-online, pickup in-club. Management believes that digitally engaged members have higher average baskets and make more trips per year than members who shop in-club only. Also, the company’s acquisition of the perishable supply chain from Burris Logistics puts it in an advantageous position to scale up supply-chain capabilities and expand fresh food offerings.

Thus, BJ's Wholesale’s better pricing, private label offerings, merchandise initiatives and digital solutions are likely to have favorably impacted the to-be-reported quarter’s performance. We expect total comparable club sales to increase 4.6%. Excluding gasoline sales, we expect comparable club sales to improve 1.6%.

However, margins remain an area to watch. Higher freight costs, investments in inflationary categories and markdowns in general merchandise inventory might have hurt merchandise margins.

Post Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Post Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Post Holdings, Inc. Quote
Factors to Consider
Post Holdings has been battling cost-related hurdles. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, its gross margin contracted from 29.5% to 23.9% due to higher raw material, freight and manufacturing costs.

Labor shortages and supply-chain hurdles caused manufacturing inefficiencies and capacity constraints in the third quarter of 2022. These limitations hurt sales, lowered throughput and increased per-unit product costs.

The company’s operations have been hurt by high inflation, rising fuel and energy prices and restricted availability, thereby raising the cost of certain raw materials and other commodities. On the lastearnings call management stated that it expects the cost of energy and raw materials to remain inflated due to the Ukraine-Russia war. This raises concerns for the quarter to be reported.

However, Post Holdings is benefiting from the recovery in the Foodservice business. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, Foodservice sales increased 33.1% to $579 million. Volumes rose 6.2% due to increased away-from-home egg and potato demand.

Moreover, segmental adjusted EBITDA was $86.4 million, up 44.5% year over year. Management projected the Foodservice business to exceed the pre-pandemic profitability level by the fourth quarter.

The company has also been gaining from its prudent acquisitions. These have been helping it expand the customer base.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, POST’s top line included $128.1 million in net sales from acquisitions. These buyouts include the Lacka Foods Limited, the Private label ready-to-eat cereal business, the Egg Beaters liquid egg brand, the Almark Foods business and related assets and the Peter Pan peanut butter brand. The continuation of these trends bodes well.
What the Zacks Model Unveils
Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Post Holdings this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.

Post Holdings has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -18.69%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Stocks With the Favorable Combination

Chicago, IL – November 15, 2022 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Costco Wholesale Corp. COST, Target Corp. TGT, Dollar General Corp. DG and Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR.
Industry: Retail - Discount Stores
Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2017812/4-stocks-to-watch-as-inflation-hit-consumers-turn-to-discount-stores
A strengthening labor market and strategic endeavors undertaken at company levels are working in tandem for the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry. Moreover, the strategy to sell products at discounted rates has helped industry players draw customers who are currently feeling the pinch of rising prices. People’s search for cheaper alternatives, be it essentials or other consumer goods, has been a tailwind for discount stores.
Meanwhile, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investment to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corp., Target Corp., Dollar General Corp. and Dollar Tree, Inc.
About the Industry
The Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, arts and crafts supplies, toys, and seasonal décor products.
These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both. Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.
3 Key Industry Trends to Watch
Consumers Seek Better Bargains Amid Inflation: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices. Under the current circumstances, people in the low-to-middle income groups have been showing a preference for discount stores to get quality products at reasonable prices.
Industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Clearly, companies are leaving no stone unturned to tap any surge in demand.
Digitization is Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives such as building omni-channel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store are worth mentioning.
Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.
Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled a number of players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs.
Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation, tight labor market and supply-chain headwinds. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.
Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects
The Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #94, which places it in the top 37% of more than 250 Zacks industries.
The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of September 2022, the industry’s bottom-line estimate for the current financial year has jumped 3%.
Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.

2022-11-14 00:00:00+00:00,Foot Locker (FL) to Post Q3 Earnings: Key Factors to Note,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/foot-locker-fl-to-post-q3-earnings%3A-key-factors-to-note,,,"Foot Locker, Inc. FL is expected to register a decline in its top and the bottom line from the last fiscal year’s respective quarterly reported figures when it releases third-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 18, before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is currently pegged at $2,118 million, indicating a 3.3% dip from the prior fiscal year’s quarterly reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings currently stands at $1.12 per share, suggesting a decrease of about 42% from the earlier fiscal year’s quarterly figure of $1.93. The consensus mark has increased a couple of cents over the past seven days.

This athletic shoes and apparel retailer delivered an earnings surprise of 28.6%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.
Key Factors to Note
Foot Locker’s persistently high inflationary pressures are affecting customers’ spending decisions. Also, a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, including supply-chain disruptions and foreign currency headwinds, is concerning. Aforesaid factors and any deleverage in SG&A expenses might have hurt FL’s performance in the fiscal third quarter.

On its lastearnings call management had notified that it expects more pressure in the back half of fiscal 2022. The consensus estimate for comparable-store sales is pegged at a 6.9% decline for the fiscal third quarter.

However, management is consistently trying to improve performance through operational and financial initiatives. FL has been making efforts for a while to enhance digital capabilities and strengthen assortments to aid growth. Foot Locker is progressing well with its FLX membership program and strategic deals, including partnerships and acquisitions. These tailwinds might have provided some cushion in the quarter under review.
What the Zacks Model Unveils
Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Foot Locker this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here, as elaborated below. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

The TJX Companies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  The TJX Companies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The TJX Companies, Inc. Quote
 Things To Note
The TJX Companies has been grappling with higher freight costs, hurting its margin performance. The company’s merchandise margin was hurt by incremental freight pressure in the last reported quarter. It also witnessed incremental wage costs, which put pressure on the pretax profit margin in the previous quarter.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, management is projecting 100 basis points (bps) of incremental freight expense and higher wage costs of nearly 80 bps. The company is projecting a U.S. comparable store sales decline of 3-5% in the to-be-reported quarter. It reported 16% U.S. open-only comp store sales growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Management anticipates quarterly earnings per share (EPS) between 77 and 81 cents. Apart from this, the company’s exposure to international markets makes it vulnerable to currency fluctuations.

The TJX Companies is benefiting from its solid store and e-commerce growth efforts. The company is committed to boosting growth through effective marketing initiatives and loyalty programs.
What the Zacks Model Unveils
Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for The TJX Companies this time around.

Factors to Note
Strength across all brands, along with rising e-commerce growth, accelerating growth initiatives, and operational improvements, are expected to have contributed to Williams-Sonoma’s fiscal third-quarter performance. Notably, the accelerating online sales trend is expected to have meaningfully contributed to its top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

The multi-channel, multi-brand platform, strong e-commerce growth, solid execution of strategic initiatives, digital leadership, product innovation, retail transformation and operational excellence across businesses are also expected to have provided some support to the top line. Also, cross-brand initiatives are expected to have positively contributed to consolidated comps to some extent.

However, supply-chain disruptions and rising raw material and labor costs are likely to have weighed on its quarterly performance.

Importantly, slowing discretionary demand conditions along with the slowing macro (particularly housing) outlook and heavily over-inventoried industry are expected to weigh on the company’s results. Also, key leading indicators for WSM’s business, like existing home sales, are still depicting worrisome pictures. Softening category demand owing to inflationary pressure and macro and geopolitical concerns have been weighing on consumers’ capacity to spend on discretionary products.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Pottery Barn Kids and Teen’s comps growth is pegged at 5.7%. The same had improved 16.9% a year ago. In second-quarter fiscal 2022, comps improved 5.3% year over year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Pottery Barn’s comps growth is pegged at 9.7%. The same improved 15.9% a year ago. In second-quarter fiscal 2022, comps grew 21.5% year over year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for West Elm’s comps growth is pegged at 6.7%. The metric was 22.5% a year ago and 6.1% in the last-reported quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the namesake brand’s comps is pegged at down 0.3%. The metric came in at 7.6% growth a year ago and 0.5% in the last-reported quarter.

2022-11-14 00:00:00+00:00,Things to Note as Walmart (WMT) Lines Up for Q3 Earnings,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/things-to-note-as-walmart-wmt-lines-up-for-q3-earnings,,,"Walmart Inc. WMT is likely to register top-line growth when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Nov 15. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $147.4 billion, suggesting a rise of 4.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.

However, the bottom line is likely to have declined year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at $1.31 per share, indicating a 9.7% decline from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter. The supermarket giant has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.5%, on average. WMT delivered an earnings surprise of around 10.6% in the last reported quarter.
High Costs a Woe
Walmart is grappling with volatility related to rising inflation. In this regard, food inflation and cost pressure associated with fuel prices, supply chain and excess inventory are a concern. Walmart’s consolidated gross profit margin contracted by 132 basis points (bps) in the last reported quarter, primarily due to markdowns and a sales mix in the U.S. segment and a LIFO charge at Sam’s Club related to inflation. The company’s operating income at constant currency fell 6% to $6.9 billion, thanks to increased wage investments and cost inflation. We believe that the persistence of these factors might have been a headwind to the quarter to be reported.
Walmart Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  Walmart Inc. price-eps-surprise | Walmart Inc. Quote
 For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Walmart expects a consolidated operating income decline of 8-10%. The company anticipates earnings per share (EPS) decline of 9-11% in the to-be-reported quarter.
Favorable Sales Picture
Walmart is benefiting from growing e-commerce business and omni-channel penetration. In this regard, it has been undertaking several e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances and improved delivery and payment systems. Walmart is making aggressive efforts to expand in the booming online grocery space, which has been a major contributor to e-commerce sales.

The company is innovating in the supply chain and adding capacity and building businesses such as Walmart GoLocal, Walmart Connect, Walmart Luminate, Walmart+, Spark Delivery, Marketplace and Walmart Fulfillment Services. The company’s compelling pricing strategy has been aiding growth amid a rising inflationary environment. Walmart expects consolidated net sales growth of nearly 5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter sales at Walmart Stores U.S. is pegged at $99.6 billion compared with the $96.6 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for Walmart International and Sam’s Club currently stands at $24.5 billion and almost $21 billion, respectively, up from $23.6billion and the roughly $19 billion reported in the same quarter last year.

The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

GPS is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2022 numbers on Nov 17. The company is likely to register declines in the top and bottom lines when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 results.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third-quarter bottom line is pegged at 1 cent per share, suggesting a sharp decline of 96.3% from 27 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.

The Gap, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  The Gap, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Gap, Inc. Quote
Key Factors to Note
Gap’s fiscal third-quarter results are expected to reflect the impacts of the changing consumer preference from casual wear to dressier clothes, as well as higher inventory, a tough macroeconomic environment and elevated costs. The company has been witnessing industry-wide challenges and headwinds in its Old Navy brand, including issues related to the launch of BODEQUALITY. Also, lower-than-anticipated demand in key categories like active, fleece, and kids and baby are likely to have dented the fiscal third-quarter performance.

The company has been witnessing higher air freight costs. Huge discounts at Old Navy and rising commodity price increases are expected to have acted as other deterrents. Also, high inventory levels due to longer transit times, more delays, pack-and-hold strategies, and elevated AUC and input costs have been headwinds.

On its last reported quarter’searnings call management noted that the company entered the fiscal third quarter with higher inventory. This is likely to have weighed on the fiscal third-quarter performance.

However, management remained optimistic about sales in the second half of fiscal 2022. It anticipated air freight costs to decline in the second half of fiscal 2022, suggesting improved costs for the fiscal third quarter. The bottom line in the fiscal third quarter is expected to have gained from the sale of its UK distribution center.

Gap has long been gaining from the continued momentum across its Athleta brand. Strength in women’s active and wellness category, along with an increased focus on performance active as well as active lifestyle products to capitalize on the evolving shopping trends, bodes well.

Strength in Banana Republic has also been a key driver in recent quarters. The company’s fiscal third-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from the easing of fuel prices, which is likely to have led to higher discretionary spending.

Gap has been on track with the execution of its Power Plan 2023, focusing on store fleet optimization. The company’s efforts to leverage its powerful platform to deliver competitive omni capabilities to meet customers’ needs, all fueled by its scaled operations, are likely to have aided sales in the fiscal third quarter.

See the 10 stocks
Stock Advisor returns as of October 26, 2022
This video was recorded on Nov. 11, 2022.
Chris Hill: It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Chris Hill joining me on the show Motley Fool Senior Analyst, Jason Moser and Ron Gross. Good to see you as always gentlemen.
Jason Moser: Hey.
Ron Gross: Hi, Chris
Chris Hill: We've got the latest headlines from Wall Street. We've got a closer look at retail trends heading into the holidays. And as always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar. But we begin with the big macro on Thursday morning, the latest consumer price index report sent the stock market soaring. The S&P 500 rose five-and-a-half percent, the Nasdaq rose more than seven percent. All because inflation rose just 0.4 percent in October Ron, which was lower than economists we're expecting. If you had told me at the time, it was going to be a report that was a little cooler than economists were expecting, I would've guessed the market would be up. I wouldn't have guessed this.
Ron Gross: Oh boy. If you didn't like Thursday, Chris, you weren't trying because there was something for everyone across the board on Thursday. This is a big sigh of relief really, I think perhaps indicating that inflation is moderating. Some of the things that factored into that better-than-expected report were a decline in used vehicle prices that had a relatively big impact. Apparel prices, medical care services also went lower, but there was offsets, offsetting that were still higher fuel costs and really more importantly, higher shelter costs, which make up about a third of the CPI index. That acceleration was fueled by the biggest jumping cost of hotel stays in more than a year. That's important to note. It's really about hotels in this specific circumstance. One thing to note is I think we're seeing rent and housing costs come down, but there's a lag and that's not going to show up in the data for a while. But when it does, I think you're going to start to see people even get more excited. We got the better-than-expected print, as they say, on Wall Street and treasury yields fell sharply on the better-than-expected news. As I said, I think investors are hoping we're seeing peak inflation and now they're waiting for what's called the Powell pivot. It's when the Fed chairman will slow or stop the interest rate hikes. I think we've still got a long way to get to the Fed's inflation target of two percent. Don't think the rate increases are going to stop anytime soon. Future is tied to the Fed fund rates indicate an 80 percent probability of a 50 percent basis point hike in December. But I think there's hope that inflation is coming down. We can either avoid a recession or it will be mild and that's why the markets rallied so much. I don't ever recall seeing an index up more than seven percent in one day.
Chris Hill: Same although Jason, I don't know about you, but why don't we wait for Jay Powell to actually pivot before we actually name something that Powell pivot. But to Ron's point, we got this report. Eyes go back to the Federal Reserve, Johnte.
Jason Moser: I'm making a mental note here. I feel like after the show we need to establish a Powell pivot Twitter feed because it's just too good. I mean, you can just go so many different directions. That was the headline we all wanted to see. Inflation easing better than expected. The market's performance this week has been mind-bending at times. I think that's great. I think Ron made a lot of good points there in regard to potentially we're seeing inflation starting to ease in a more persistent fashion. You look at the prices that exclude food and energy, for example, that core inflation that policymakers see is more reflective of the trend that was up just 0.3 percent from September versus an expectation of 0.5 percent. We are seeing data from Zillow and CoreLogic that shows that rent prices are coming down in even property management software accompany RealPage. They reported that apartment rents fell 0.6 percent in October from September. That's the third largest drop it's recorded since 2010. Those are also very encouraging signs. But you look back in history here just a few months ago, I mean in August, we had the same thing play out. Better-than-expected inflation in the market received the news very positively the following month, we went back to inflation, back on the rise. I'm hopeful that this is the beginning of a more long-term trend. But I think he got to take it with brain and soul.
Chris Hill: Agreed. I don't think any economic conversation or recession conversation is complete without talking about the labor markets, especially in this environment, labor market remains strong. Unemployment's sitting at 3.7 percent only that's pretty darn good. Which also maybe pretty darn bad depending on what your point of view is. But we do have some indication that it's softening. I think layoffs are certainly accelerating technology and financial sectors. I think we're seeing that I feel like the cutting in the financial sector is more cyclical and typical while the tech sector is really reacting to, I think I'll use the word bubble, the bubble that occurred over the last few years and the over-hiring that resulted and it's just necessary to pair that back, as costs are too high and companies need to right-size their business a little bit to get their profitability of where they want it to be. A little bit additional softness in the labor market is probably necessary to get the Fed where they want to be.
Jason Moser: Well, and we saw signs of that already this week. We have better platforms starting to execute some layoffs, Redfin as well. It seems like there's a crystal ball element to our conversation. But Ron, it does seem like over the next 6-12 months, this is something investors should be watching when it comes to specific companies, particularly the larger tech ones, isn't it?
Ron Gross: For sure. We'll want to listen to guidance for our earnings estimates coming down. They're actually doing pretty well. I would have predicted that we would have seen the earnings come in a little weaker and guidance being a little weaker. I'm not seeing it as bad as I thought which may bode well again for not having a deep recession. But we'll have to watch costs. China news on Friday about the easing on some of the COVID restrictions is good, the Goldman Sachs described it as marginal and it won't really amount to more than a fine tuning. They really have to go further away from their COVID zero policy for journey to make a huge impact. But that may help with supply chain issues and some other issues as well with respect to costs. But we'll have to watch individual companies. How is profitability looking? What does guidance look like?
Chris Hill: I'm glad you mentioned China because Jason, for those who missed it on Friday, China announced the pullback of some of the countries COVID restrictions, including one dealing with international flights to the point that Ron made with the reference to the Goldman report, there was not a specific timeline. If you want to take a bearish view of this announcement, you can take, well, there weren't a lot of specifics. There wasn't a timeline. Let's wait and see. If you want to be a little bit more optimistic, you could look at the announcement from China and say, well, this is really the first indication of the central government moving away from that zero COVID policy. I'm just thinking of all of the times over the last couple of earnings seasons that we've heard companies talk about inflation, supply chain, China on their conference calls. Maybe I'm looking through rose-colored glasses, but I'm choosing to be a little bit more bullish on this China announcement. What about you?
Jason Moser: Well, I mean, I appreciate that perspective. I want to be more optimistic and hopefully, again, maybe this is really the first sign. Maybe they've started to wake up to reality here and understand there are better ways to handle this, I think, then adopting that zero COVID stance. Maybe the easing of these controls, maybe this is that first-step. I'm not sold that it is. I think it's odd to see this news coming out as, I think the country is dealing with its worst outbreak in more than six months. I don't know what ultimately changed there. Maybe it ultimately amounts to nothing. Maybe this is just like a headline and then that's really all. I think you go back to pre-COVID. I mean we were having this conversation regarding China and supply chains well before COVID. That's what I encourage folks to remember because we had companies in 2018, 2019 really talking on earnings calls, looking for ways to diversify their supply chains away from China. Because we were having trade issues even back then, and it's a difficult country to predict.
They march to the beat of their own drum so to speak. I feel like if I'm a CEO of a company today, one of my top priorities would remain figuring out how to diversify my supply chain away from China. Because either way I've seen enough to know that I don't have any faith really, honestly, and what they may or may not do going forward, not just necessarily regarding COVID either, but anything else that comes down the pike. If I'm a CEO, I think you really need to focus on trying to diversify their supply chain away from China as much as possibly seeing big company, Minneapolis even doing it really. They mentioned they're going to have some supply issues with their upper tier iPhones because of these supply chain hang-ups in China. We've already seen that they are making big efforts to move into India, for example to produce more in India. I think that when you see even the largest companies in the world, like Apple trying to do something like that. That's a real tail. It's going to take time for that to play out. It's going to take years for them to really appropriately diversify away. But I think we'll continue to see those conversations being had because I think it really does matter.
Chris Hill: Earnings after the break, including entertainment, media, and the war on cash. So stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money, Chris Hill here with Jason Moser and Ron Gross. On Wednesday, shares of Disney had their worst loss in 21 years, fourth-quarter profits were well below expectations. The company warned about slowing growth for its Disney Plus streaming service. Ron, how warm is the seat that CEO Bob Chapek is currently sitting on?
Ron Gross: Getting warmer Chris, I'm not going to lie. This one made me win a little bit. I've held this stock for 20 years, my family has. That's a big move for a company like Disney. It was a bit of a shock, Disney Plus costs are ballooning or have ballooned. The media business was also weak. Some metrics to back some of the sub Disney Plus added 12 million net new accounts that did beat analyst predictions. Now, they have about 164 million subscribers, not bad at all. But the Lawson division surged to almost $1.5 billion more than double the year before, due to heavy spending on content marketing and technology, which let's face it, is sometimes necessary when you have a new business that you're looking to get off the ground and grow significantly. But I think what the investors in the markets are telling you is that perhaps was too aggressive because they were not expecting that loss. As you said, CEO Bob Chapek who is a bit on the hot seat, said, the streaming business has reached peak losses in the quarter. I don't know what that means, peak losses but that's what he said.
Chris Hill: That doesn't sound cool.
Ron Gross: That doesn't sound that good. But he said the business is still on track to reach profitability in fiscal 2024. Very important for us to watch that, to see if he sticks to that, because if he doesn't, then the hot-seat gets even hotter. They've got some changes, coming price increases to some Disney Plus packages and new ad supported subscription tier taking place in December. Higher prices could backfire though will need to watch that carefully. Management does have plans to make cuts to marketing and content budgets. I think that's necessary. The one bright spot was a 36 percent increase in revenue from theme parks, where Chapek comes from. Disney said the full-year results from the theme parks set all-time records for the company in both the revenue and operating income. As I said, the media division was weak, that's ABC, ESPN was a bit weak there. Overall companywide revenue up nine percent adjusted earnings actually down 19 percent. Guidance was disappointing, 20 times forward earnings. I think earnings are going to actually get better, so it will be even better than 20 times forward earnings. I'm not selling my shares at all. I'm going to let the company do what they do.
Chris Hill: Third-quarter revenue for The Trade Desk came in higher-than-expected, but guidance sent the stock lower this week. This was before the big rally on Thursday, Jason, so shares of The Trade Desk actually ended up in the positive territory this week. Put aside the stock, how is the business of The Trade Desk doing?
Jason Moser: I think the business is doing great. These reports get to be like a broken record, I mean, the best possible since. They just continue to do their thing, they offer smart, achievable targets. They achieve those targets, and they just continue to focus on this big market opportunity that's in front of them, particularly on the connected TV side. The results very strong, $395 million in revenue, $163 million in adjusted EBITDA nicely exceeding their own internal benchmarks and customer retention remains over 95 percent as it has for the past eight consecutive years going to that connected TV opportunity, because that really is the big opportunity for The Trade Desk. It was their fastest-growing channel. It's become their largest when they exit Q3 video, which includes connected TV, represented a low 40s percentage share of their overall business and continues to grow rapidly, they say as a percentage of the mix. Interestingly too, this is becoming an international opportunity. The connected TV spend grew in the majority of their international markets faster than it did in the US. You look at this company with its partnerships with companies like Disney and Peacock, those relationships are only growing big tailwinds in the coming years for this advertising supported video on demand. You've got a company here, generated $500 million in free cash flow over the last 12 months. It's up 53 percent from a year ago. This for me is just one of those holdings that I grow more and more comfortable with as time goes on. We'll just check back in next quarter.
Chris Hill: The rally could not prevent shares of Lyft from falling. This week, active riders were down in the third quarter and shares of Lyft fell to their lowest point since the company went public in 2019, Ron?
Ron Gross: It's not a good time for Lyft. Adjusted earnings were fine, but the revenue growth and the number of riders were disappointing. Revenue up 22 percent. Active riders of 7.2 percent ended the quarter with just over 20 million riders. They were shorter of analysts prediction and still below the 23 million that had before the pandemic contrast that with Uber, who said their ride count had bounced back to pre-pandemic levels. Lyft reported 66 million in adjusted earnings, but its actual net loss widened to over 400 million as they issue new stock to employees to make up for it's falling share price, not something you really want to see as a shareholder. Fourth-quarter outlook was in line with Wall Street predictions, reiterated guidance of $1 billion in adjusted earnings in 2024. I caution investors to be wary of that number and they're going to cut 13 percent of the staff to reduce costs, which I think is appropriate.
Chris Hill: From ride-sharing to the war on cash, Marqueta's third-quarter revenue came in higher than Wall Street was expecting. You're shareholder, Jason, how's Marqueta look into you?
Jason Moser: A company I think folks need to be paying attention to, remember, they operate a platform that delivers card issuing and transaction processing services. According to Bain Capital, the value of the embedded finance, which is basically non-financial companies offering financial services in some capacity, the value of those transactions is expected to reach $7 trillion by 2026. That's important because those are Marqueta's customers. Clearly pursuing a big market opportunity, total processing volume for the quarter was $42 billion in net revenue of $192 million. Gross margin 42 percent was down slightly from a year ago, but that was mostly due to timing and business mix. The thing to pay attention to with this company, they're very reliant on block that accounted for 72.5 percent of their total net revenue for the quarter. But this is a nice problem to have. A lot of this comes from the success of block Cash App, the Cash App card. We talked about how now Cash App card, the attachment rate for those that use the App at 35 percent of the users now using that Cash App card up from 31 percent just at the end of the year, and 25 percent from a year ago. That accounts for more inflows, direct deposits, people use those cards and spend more all plays into market as specialty. All in all, I think things are looking good.
Chris Hill: Guys. We'll see you later in the show up next, Rachel Warren with a closer look at the tough retail trends this holiday season. This is Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money, I'm Chris Hill. Anjee Solanki is the National Retail Director for Colliers, a professional services and investment management company. Motley Fool contributor, Rachel Warren, caught up with Solanki to talk about the top retail trends this holiday season and how consumer spending continues to evolve.
Rachel Warren: One of the things we've been hearing about is that there might really be an unprecedented holiday shopping season ahead which seems counterintuitive in the current environment, but even just some of the earnings reports we've been seeing recently seem to portend that that may be the case. From your vantage point, what are you seeing? What retailers do you think are poised to do particularly well?
Anjee Solanki: We're going to still see, of course, the grocery spend, many buying to have parties at home, friends and family at home. People are really much more, I think, open to seeing one another and more of a large family format or a family and friends format. I think the spend is going to occur. We are going to see, I think, a soft peak as it relates to in-house decorations, more on the smaller sales still, HomeGoods is going to do well, all the TJX brands, of course, are going to do quite well in that category because they're grab and go, they're fun, they're playful, and from the consumer's perspective, if they're spending call it $10-20, in their mind they feel like, oh, that's doesn't seem too out of scale. However, if they compound that with quite a bit of items, it can shift. But we're starting to see that, and also what's fascinating to me, I don't know if you've picked this up but Walmart is doing these amazing commercials, really more touching that spirit of family and getting together, really driving, I would say, that subliminal message of, hey, it's time to get together as a group. Well, those things also spark. Well, if we're going to do that we're going to spend. The Dollar Trees, the Walmarts more those value oriented where you can grab-and-go, little tabletop accessories, etc, and then of course, on the grocery side for the holiday dinners.
Rachel Warren: It is fascinating to see how these trends are shaping up as we approach the holiday season. Another thing that's come to the forefront that I think investors think about as well is this idea of, especially, big retailers potentially discounting items as a means of lowering an inflation, and of course, that makes sense from the business perspective but there's also the fear of how could that impact the top and bottom lines. What are you seeing from your position right now?
Anjee Solanki: That is definitely a concern. Now, there's couple of things that I have factored in. For certain retailers, they may have over purchased and so they're still dealing with an oversupply. In that scenario these retailers really have to be mindful of the sequencing of discounting. What I'm starting to notice and see which I think is actually very different from prior years, it's not this call it, fire sale of sorts, It's also not very sequenced and tied to holiday. What I mean by that is that you're seeing the retailers discounting at different periods of time almost as though the consumer's not even aware when they may discount. It's almost like a little bit of a surprise. Now that with all this technology that we have, the ability to push notifications, the ability to spark, oh, just exited my car, I'm about to go into the grocery store and I get a notification that something I'm not even considering to buy such as, hey, do you remember you may want to buy some pumpkin pie. It's like, oh, it's a dollar off maybe I might do that. I think that retailers are getting much more clever. If you want to call it in how they ration out their discounts, so it's not tied purely to the Thanksgiving holiday and the Christmas. I think they're starting to really spread it out, which is helping them as it relates to how they're softly disposing of their oversupply. But, yes, for those that do not have the resources, the manpower, the technology, etc, that may be a significant challenge. As we all know, from an online perspective, Amazon decided to have a second Prime day. I wasn't too surprised purely because of the oversupply but nonetheless, it was still a significant clearing. I think they cleared somewhere around five billion in terms of inventories. That's a lot of inventory.
Rachel Warren: It's a lot.
Anjee Solanki: I'm sure it's somewhat a global perspective, but still it's significant amount.
Rachel Warren: When we spoke earlier this year I asked you a question along these lines but I'm curious to hear how your answer may have changed at all. What can you share about the changes that you're seeing in consumer spending preferences? How have those shifted? Do you think that these are permanent?
Anjee Solanki: There are a few that I've seen in terms of, people are really looking at, my dollar and how I'm using that dollar and where I'm using it as it relates to quality of goods. In some situations you will start to see, depending on your income, it's going to be very, very different, but I'm still seeing quite a bit of spend in the luxury space. I'm monitoring that very closely because I'm curious to see what it will look like come January as we continue to see the interest rates change and hike, so I'm watching that. From a behavioral perspective, quality seems to be still important and they're willing to spend a little extra for better quality. They're buying less about better quality. We're still seeing quite a bit of spin on the resale. People are being more open to buying on the resale market. I think we're going to continue to see there, some of which is more related to sustainability, ESG, and the other piece of it is also from a value perspective. We are going to continue to see the challenges in those economic areas where it is going to be very difficult for families to, if we don't see macroeconomic changes with gas and so on and so forth, we will see those what I would say, a continuation of this shift between people who have more to spend versus those that do not. That spend, of course, is going to be on staple items. My hope is that we'll try to figure out this balance between everything. But we're still seeing that spend occur. The other thing we're seeing a big spend is those that are very focused on value shopping are spending more in Fast Food and I don't know if you've noticed, but a lot of the Fast Food categories, the [Yum's] KFCs, the Taco Bell's, the Young Brands, etc, they are benefiting from it. They're seeing a nice increase in sales. However, it's dollar tacos. What's the health risks around that? That worries me too. Whenever we see these, call it financial challenges, those that really struggle and suffer are also those that also potentially at high risk as it relates to what they're consuming, how they're consuming, etc.
Rachel Warren: As we got to the end of our time together today, I think there's one key question for investors that are looking at the retail space right now, that are looking at some of these companies in different ways to play this landscape. What are some of the most prominent tailwinds or trends that you can see as driving the retail landscape in 2023 and beyond and how can we track the health of this space?
Anjee Solanki: Sure, I think it's really important to understand the strategy of a brand. What does that true omnichannel strategy that they are going to deploy? Remember this is a partnership and that partnership requires both sides. The investor's side and understand the retailer and vice versa. If we can be transparent in that conversation early on, of course, it's not going to be 100 percent but transparently it becomes a partnership. When there's some down days, one party helps, when there's some up days, the other party helps. That can be done in so many ways but financially from that point of view, but also from a longevity point of view. What I mean by that is from a trend perspective, you're going to see more conversations as it relates to having your retailer. What is your strategy as you deploy that demand delivery? How will you share that information? How are you looking at technology and technology as it relates to that specific store? Is there an opportunity to share that information with the developer? Not to the point where we're going to be managing your business, but to the point where we can again look at how the success of your business can drive the success of us bringing in more retailers to drive everyone's business up. I think if we can have more of those conversations, I think it really who's all of us into looking at retail. Continuing to see retail elevate and becoming even more healthier. There were a few clients I was speaking to the past few days, institutional clients that have become quite bullish again, as it relates to retail. Class A lifestyle, suburban retail because they are seeing, as I mentioned at the beginning of this discussion, this increased velocity as it relates to leasing. Retailers are having those appetites, as I mentioned, to expand, more open to buys, but they're being very cautious. Certain retailers, it's not 100 stores. It might be 10-15 per year. A very strategic. Having that balance is going to really show and shed some success. I think that omnichannel that approach to how we're delivering, how we're educating consumer, and that's going to continue to drive. I think you may have read or heard. The drone is out there and Walmart's drowning your gifts, so it's not Santa, it's the Walmart's drone that you'll see flying around here pretty soon.
Chris Hill: I'm not adopting the innovation of flying drones, but they've got a long way before they catch up to the scope and scale of Santa's delivery system. Coming up after the break, Ron Gross and Jason Moser return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about in the Motley Fool Money formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here once again with Jason Moser and Ron Gross.
Guys, there has been no shortage of consumer-facing companies raising prices this year. But where they raise prices and by how much can be a delicate add? Carnival Cruise Line announced that starting in January, they're raising prices on specialty dining restaurants on their cruise ships due to increased food costs and supply chain challenges. One of the increases caught the attention of a producer, Ricky Mulvey. Guests will now be charged an additional five dollars if they order a third entree for lunch or dinner. Now, let's put aside just for a moment. How hungry you have to be to consume two entire entrees at lunch or dinner and think to yourself. I think I'm going to need one more. Ron, in terms of this move, is this helping Carnival Cruise Line's balance sheet? If you're a shareholder you're thinking, how this is going to work?
Ron Gross: I think it will cut costs marginally. But listen, I took a cruise once I liked the midnight bacon as much as the night crack. But it's not healthy and three entrees isn't healthy either, so maybe they're doing a public service to all of us by limiting our intake. But yes, I think it will cut costs. They're doing other things to their lobster dinners and some other cost-cutting measures. On the margins I think it will help.
Chris Hill: Jason, I don't know. I'm skeptical. I haven't been on a cruise in a very long time but this just seems like one of those moves that, look, I get that it results in more money, but why wouldn't you just raise the overall price of the ticket rather than nickel and dime people looking for a third entree?
Jason Moser: I've never been on a cruise. I don't really have a desire to go on a cruise. I share your skepticism. But really what this all boils down to me is if I ever started band, I'm totally get to name it midnight bacon.
Chris Hill: Feel free. I thought you were going to go third entree. That also seems like it could.
Jason Moser: Third entree could open up for a midnight bacon.
Chris Hill: Let's get to the stocks on our radar this week. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Jason Moser, you're up first, what are you looking at this week?
Jason Moser: Stock that closed at $11.47 on November 8th and now I'm watching it scratched $20 per share at the end of this week, Outset Medical ticker, OM remember they make dialysis machines known for the Tablo dialysis machine that opens them up to not only acute care settings in hospitals and clinics, but also in home settings. This was a really good quarter they announced raised guidance for the full year and this really was the quarter where they've been able to put that whole FDA hold on Tablo machines from earlier in the year they made it but to put that behind them. I remember that was something where the FDA, they were working with the FDA ultimately to provide more data. It wasn't a question of the machines but updates to the machines. They just wanted more data. The stock got hammered, when that hold was placed. They got through it very quickly and now it really does feel like they've just put this in the rearview mirror and that's why the stock has performed so well this week because it really is pursuing a large market opportunity in dialysis, in general, it's limited competition in the space. They were awarded a VA contract which enables them to be sold into 106 VA hospitals throughout the United States. All things considered, I think this is a business that is back on track, is one that I own shares in personally and I'm excited to see how they develop.
Chris Hill: Dan, question about Outset Medical?
Dan Boyd: Raising guidance, Jason? You never hear about that happening anymore.
Jason Moser: Unheard of in this market. Unheard of Dan and that's why I think the market is reacting so positively to that news.
Chris Hill: In all seriousness that caught my attention as well. Because I just thought, wow, we've been saying all year. This is not the time nor the place to be overly aggressive with guidance, so definitely something that's worth watching. Ron Gross, what are you looking at this week?
Ron Gross: An update for longtime listeners on Titan International TWI, a stock I've held anytime sold for a long time manufacturer of wheels and tires for agricultural and industrial equipment. Shares are up almost 40 percent this year that's even after falling 20 percent from their 52 week highs. Not that normal to see a stock up that much in this environment. Still a very small company with a market cap of only about $960 million. Company is probably in the strongest position. They've been in a quite a while. In this latest quarter, sales were up 18 percent gross margins and operating margins widened. Operating income was up 120 percent. Free cash flow was 40 million for the quarters, almost 70 million year-to-date. They've reduced their debt by 35 million in the quarter, improving their debt leverage ratios significantly. Management expects adjusted EBITDA of around 250 million for this year with free cash flow for the year to be at 100 million or more. That puts the stock at only five times EBITDA. EBITDA is a quick and dirty measure of cash flow. I'm thinking we have at least 30 percent upside left in the stock. Stock is around 15. I think it goes to the 20s or perhaps even the low 20s. That's around where I've sold some in the past. I think Titan is doing a great job. Recession is always the wildcard, a slowing economy. Slowing agricultural market is always a wildcard, but I think they look really strong right here.
Chris Hill: Dan, question about Titan International?
Dan Boyd: I'm just glad that old economy Ron showed up here on Friday of Motley Fool Money. I miss him.
Ron Gross: Just for you Dan.
Chris Hill: What do you want to add to your watch list Dan?
Dan Boyd: That's a tough one, Chris, because Titan continuously impresses and they're just making wheels out there, they're not reinventing them.
Chris Hill: Say don't you feel like they're reinventing the wheel?
Ron Gross: They have some technology out there that you could argue is reinventing the wheel
Chris Hill: But isn't that part of the bull case for this company? Who in the world needs to reinvent the wheel? That shows how solid their competitive position is, right?
Ron Gross: I guess so. That's why I'm picking Titan, Chris.
Chris Hill: No. Jason Moser, Ron Gross, guys we'll see you next time.

2022-11-14 00:00:00+00:00,Here's How Target (TGT) Looks Placed Ahead of Q3 Earnings,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-how-target-tgt-looks-placed-ahead-of-q3-earnings,,,"Target Corporation TGT is likely to register an increase in the top line when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 16 before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $26.36 billion, indicating growth of 2.7% from the prior-year reported figure.

The bottom line of this general merchandise retailer is anticipated to have declined year over year. Although the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for the quarter under review has risen by a couple of cents to $2.14 over the past 30 days, the figure suggests a sharp decline from the earnings of $3.03 from the year-ago period.

We expect revenues to be up 2.5% year over year to $26,300.6 million and the bottom line to decline 31.6% to $2.07 per share.

Target has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 13.7%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this Minneapolis, MN-based company’s bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 45.1%.
Key Factors to Note
Target has been deploying resources to enhance omnichannel capabilities, come up with new brands, refurbish stores and expand same-day delivery options to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience. It has been ramping up store openings and remodels, scaling up fulfillment services and enhancing supply-chain capabilities. Customers have been opting for Target due to its multi-category assortment of owned and exclusive brands and popular national brands.

Cumulatively, the aforementioned factors are likely to have contributed to the company’s sales performance. We expect comparable sales to increase 2.3% during the quarter under discussion.
Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
Target Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Target Corporation Quote
We believe that Target’s recent attempt to rightsize the inventory is in the right direction as the demand is skewed toward consumer staples and away from discretionary categories. However, a slew of actions to tackle the excess inventory, such as additional markdowns, is likely to have weighed on margins. Additionally, the increased compensation and headcount in distribution centers might have hurt the gross margin rate.

Management expects the third-quarter operating margin rate to be lower than the prior-year period. We expect the third-quarter operating margin to shrink 280 basis points.

However, management has been undertaking cost-control measures, such as working with vendors to offset inflationary pressures and driving continued operating efficiencies. Also, Target remains focused on maintaining strength in frequency categories like Food & Beverage, Household Essentials and Beauty.
What the Zacks Model Unveils
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Target this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Target has an Earnings ESP of -2.57% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Stocks With the Favorable Combination
Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:

Five Below FIVE currently has an Earnings ESP of +10.31% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is likely to register a bottom-line decline when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly earnings per share of 14 cents suggests a decline of 67.4% from the year-ago quarter.

Five Below's top line is expected to increase marginally year over year.

2022-11-14 00:00:00+00:00,4 Stocks to Watch as Inflation-Hit Consumers Turn to Discount Stores,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-stocks-to-watch-as-inflation-hit-consumers-turn-to-discount-stores,,,"A strengthening labor market and strategic endeavors undertaken at company levels are working in tandem for the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry. Moreover, the strategy to sell products at discounted rates has helped industry players draw customers who are currently feeling the pinch of rising prices. People’s search for cheaper alternatives, be it essentials or other consumer goods, has been a tailwind for discount stores.

Meanwhile, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investment to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corporation COST, Target Corporation TGT, Dollar General Corporation DG and Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR.
About the Industry
The Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, arts and crafts supplies, toys, and seasonal décor products. These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both. Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.
3 Key Industry Trends to Watch
Consumers Seek Better Bargains Amid Inflation: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices. Under the current circumstances, people in the low-to-middle income groups have been showing a preference for discount stores to get quality products at reasonable prices. Industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Clearly, companies are leaving no stone unturned to tap any surge in demand.
Digitization is Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives such as building omni-channel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.
Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled a number of players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation, tight labor market and supply-chain headwinds. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.

2022-11-11 00:00:00+00:00,What's in Store for Infineon Technologies (IFNNY) Q4 Earnings?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/whats-in-store-for-infineon-technologies-ifnny-q4-earnings,,,"Infineon Technologies IFNNY is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 15.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, IFNNY expects revenues of €3.9 billion.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter is projected at 60 cents per share, reflecting 25% growth from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.

Infineon Technologies’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 14.62%.
Infineon Technologies AG Price and EPS Surprise
Infineon Technologies AG price-eps-surprise | Infineon Technologies AG Quote
Factors to Consider
Infineon Technologies’ strength in product and application areas, especially microcontrollers, is likely to have continued driving top-line growth within the Automotive (ATV) segment during the quarter under review.

Also, growing prospects in ADAS and electromobiity are expected to have aided the segment’s performance further.

Coming to the Industrial Power Control (IPC) segment, industrial drives, and strength in renewable energy, energy infrastructure and transport are expected to have aided top-line growth within the segment. Strong momentum in decarbonization and automation is likely to have contributed well.

The Power & Sensor Systems (PSS) segment is likely to have benefited from solid momentum across enterprise power solutions and automotive charging during the to-be-reported quarter.

Also, rising solar installations by residential customers and strong demand in the area of servers, industrial applications and silicon microphones, are likely to have driven the top line within the segment in the fiscal fourth quarter.

The Connected Secure Systems (CSS) segment is expected to have gained from solid demand in the industrial IoT and smart buildings space in the quarter-to-be-reported.

However, sluggish demand for consumer applications like battery-powered do-it-yourself tools, PCs and smartphones might have been a negative for the PSS segment during the fiscal fourth quarter.

Further, weakening demand for home appliances might have been concerning for the IPC segment.

Also, material shortages and supply disruptions are likely to have continued hurting the automotive production volumes. Plus, weak momentum in the wearables and gaming areas is likely to have affected the CSS segment.

2022-11-11 00:00:00+00:00,Lowe's (LOW) Lined Up for Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lowes-low-lined-up-for-q3-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-cards,,,"Lowe's Companies, Inc. LOW is likely to register an increase in the top and the bottom line from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s respective readings when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings on Nov 16, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $23,102 million, indicating a 0.8% rise from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been stable in the past 30 days at $3.10 a share, suggests 13.6% growth from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally.

We expect revenues to be up 0.9% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals to $23,126.2 million and adjusted earnings to increase 13% from the same to $3.08 per share. Comparable sales are likely to inch up 1% from the prior-year fiscal period’s reported figure in the quarter under review.

In the last reported fiscal quarter, LOW delivered an earnings surprise of 0.9%. We note that this home-improvement retailer has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.5%, on average.
Key Factors to Note
Lowe's retains its focus on enhancing its omni-channel retailing capabilities in store operations, website and supply chain to resonate well with customers’ demand. In addition, its pro business has been significantly contributing to its performance for a while. Management constantly enhances the Pro offerings across LOW’s stores and online with improved service levels, deeper inventory quantities, an intuitive store layout and the addition of Pro-focused brands.

LOW also continues benefiting from the solid execution of its Total Home strategy, focusing on boosting productivity and enriching the integrated omni-channel shopping experience. Further, gains from the execution of the Perpetual Productivity Improvement initiative have been aiding its performance for a while now. All these strengths are most likely to have driven LOW’s performance in the quarter to be reported.

On the flip side, a tough operating backdrop, including inflationary pressures and supply-chain disruptions, might have raised a concern.
What the Zacks Model Unveils
Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Lowe's this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here, as elaborated here.

Ross Stores, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  Ross Stores, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ross Stores, Inc. Quote
Key Factors to Note
Ross Stores has been witnessing robust customer demand, aiding the top line. Sales in the fiscal third quarter are likely to have benefited from broad-based growth across merchandise categories and regions, as well as robust comparable store sales. Sales are also expected to have gained from robust trends at the dd's DISCOUNTS business. Gains at the core business, driven by consumers' continued focus on value and the company’s ability to deliver value bargains to customers, bode well.

On its last reported quarter’searnings call Ross Stores stated that the ongoing strength in consumer demand would likely continue despite the uncertainty regarding supply-chain woes.

Ross Stores has been consistent with the execution of its store expansion plans, which are likely to have aided the top line. The company's store-expansion efforts have been focused on continually increasing penetration in existing and new markets. The third-quarter fiscal 2022 performance is anticipated to have gained from the company’s return to normal store opening targets. Gains from new stores are expected to get reflected in the company's sales for the fiscal third quarter.

However, Ross Stores has been witnessing the effects of the ongoing industry-wide supply-chain challenges, leading to higher freight costs and distribution expenses. This is likely to have partly impacted the company’s cost of goods sold rate in the fiscal third quarter. Higher domestic freight expenses and distribution costs mainly on the ongoing supply-chain headwinds and higher wages are likely to have weighed on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.

On the last reported quarter'searnings call Ross Stores anticipated continued impacts from the industry-wide supply-chain dynamics and other risks from inflation, as well as costs within its business, to hurt the fiscal third-quarter performance. Ross Stores provided a conservative view for the rest of fiscal 2022.

Ross Stores anticipates comps to be down 7-9% for third-quarter fiscal 2022, whereas it reported 14% growth in third-quarter fiscal 2021. Earnings per share are envisioned to be 72-83 cents, whereas it reported $1.09 in third-quarter fiscal 2021.

For third-quarter fiscal 2022, the company expects the operating margin to be 7.8-8.7%, down from 11.4% reported in the prior-year quarter. The operating margin is expected to be affected by the negative comp forecast, lower merchandise margin stemming from ocean freight costs and sluggish sales view, and increased markdowns. Also, the unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs is likely to hurt the operating margin.
