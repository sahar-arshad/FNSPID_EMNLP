2022-06-16 00:00:00+00:00,eBay Enters Oversold Territory,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-enters-oversold-territory-0,,,"The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.
But making eBay Inc. an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Thursday, shares of EBAY entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $40.52 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of eBay Inc., the RSI reading has hit 29.99 — by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel currently has an average RSI of 34.6. A falling stock price — all else being equal — creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, EBAY's recent annualized dividend of 0.88/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.02% based upon the recent $43.51 share price.
A bullish investor could look at EBAY's 29.99 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on EBAY is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

2022-06-16 00:00:00+00:00,Technology Bear Market: 3 Software Stocks Primed to Recover,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/technology-bear-market%3A-3-software-stocks-primed-to-recover,,,"The technology industry has borne the brunt of the market downturn. Many of the more prominent growth stocks have lost more than three-fourths of their value as negative sentiment weighs on the market.
However, amid the pessimism, many companies continue to deliver positive returns for investors. As the negativity abates, it could foster a comeback in growth tech stocks, and companies such as Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: ROP), Monday.com (NASDAQ: MNDY), and PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) have positioned themselves for such a recovery.
A steady software name in a turbulent market
Jake Lerch (Roper Technologies): There are plenty of beaten-down software stocks out there. And I've highlighted ones like Salesforce, Workday, and Snowflake as long-term buy-and-hold opportunities. However, I decided to go ""against the grain"" for my pick this week. Instead of choosing a former high flyer that's fallen out of favor, I picked a defensive stock within the software industry. Roper has outperformed its sector average and sports a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of only 14.
Roper isn't your typical software company. Founded in 1981, it began as an industrial services company. But timely acquisitions and overall trends in the industrial sector mean that over 65% of Roper's revenue now comes from software. Its products fill niches in many different non-cyclical markets. It provides truckers and food distributors with cloud-based supply chain software; the oil and gas industry relies on its temperature control and emergency shutoff valves. Roper even sells automatic meter-reading technology to water utilities.
With its niche markets and diverse customer base, Roper faces little in the way of competition, granting it pricing power. Its operating margins are a solid 27.4%. Revenue over the last 12 months was $5.93 billion, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $2.26 billion.
Since it is a stable, if not a particularly exciting business, Roper has fared better than many software stocks over the last year; it's down only 17% over the last year and 22% year to date. That's impressive relative performance compared to many software names that have shed 70% or more of their value. What's more, Roper even pays a small dividend (0.68% yield). So, if you're looking for a steady name in the software space, Roper Technologies might be for you.
This enterprise business is going strong
Justin Pope (Monday.com): A declining share price might have investors panicking, but enterprise software company Monday.com is humming along just fine. It refers to itself as a work operating system; its cloud-based software gives companies low-code and no-code tools to build customized work management applications.
Whether it's managing customer relationships, projects, marketing, or internal development, Monday.com's product can be built specifically to a company's needs and easily shared across departments within a company. More than 152,000 customers use Monday.com, which makes money with its software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscription model.
The product is mission-critical to its customers; the software becomes more ingrained in a company as more people use it. Customers spending $50,000 or more annually grew 187% year over year in the first quarter of 2022, while total revenue for the quarter was $108 million, an 84% increase over the prior year. This growth is excellent, but what happens in a bear market?
Downturns can spell trouble for growing companies. Debt can carry high interest rates, and issuing new shares of stock at low prices can dilute shareholders, making the existing shares less valuable. Strong financials to endure tough times is the best safety net a growing business can have.
Look to this old ""friend"" in the mobile payments arena
Will Healy (PayPal): At first glance, PayPal may look like another one-time high flyer that has been anything but a pal to investors. It has lost more than 70% of its value versus year-ago levels as fears over rising inflation and falling profits soured investors on this company. The transition of former parent eBay away from PayPal has further affected revenues.
However, the majority of its revenue still comes from making transactions. This segment derives revenue by charging a percentage of the total transaction value. Such an approach serves as an inflation hedge as revenue tends to rise along with prices. CEO Dan Schulman stated on the Q1 2022earnings callthat 60% of consumers choose PayPal as their favorite digital wallet, a factor that should bolster its ecosystem.
Admittedly, PayPal continues to deal with uncertainties. In the first quarter of 2022, revenue rose to $6.5 billion, 7% higher than year-ago levels. This is lower than the 17% growth in 2021.
Also, Q1's net income of $509 million fell 54% versus 12 months ago. This was due to a 12% increase in operating expenses. Additionally, income tax expenses came in at $120 million versus a $225 million credit in the year-ago quarter.
Nonetheless, the company forecasts revenue growth of between 11% and 13% for 2022, indicating a recovery in growth. Also, a drop in the stock price has taken its P/E ratio to 24, near record lows.
Indeed, rising inflation and overall market pessimism may weigh on PayPal in the near term. But these trends will not stop the shift away from cash, arguably making PayPal a fintech stock to buy right now.

2022-06-14 00:00:00+00:00,4 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy Right Now for Less Than $100,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-no-brainer-stocks-to-buy-right-now-for-less-than-%24100,,,"With the Nasdaq Composite still firmly in a bear market -- down around 26% over the past six months -- it is more critical than ever for investors to keep dollar-cost averaging into high-quality businesses at discounted prices.
While there are no sure things in stocks, the four companies we'll look at today have clear megatrends working in their favor and come with leadership positions in their niches. All trade below $100 and are down between 35% and 70% this year -- and indications point to a rebound over the long term.
^IXIC data by YCharts
1. PayPal
With Statista projecting global mobile wallet transaction volume to grow more than 60% by 2025, PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) looks primed to continue profiting from its growing base of 429 million active accounts. However, because of decelerating sales growth rates -- partially due to the ending of its partnership with eBay -- shares have plummeted more than 70% from their 52-week highs.
Recording first-quarter sales growth of 15%, not including eBay's sales from last year, and a free cash flow (FCF) decline of 32%, year over year, PayPal exhibited steady but mixed results. One bright spot in the report was the company's continued growth in active accounts and customer engagement, which respectively rose 9% and 11% for the year.
Image source: PayPal Q1 2022 earnings report.
PayPal's rapidly expanding value proposition to its users leads to this rising engagement across its growing customer base. Offering services such as Happy Return's reverse logistics, buy-now, pay-later options, crypto trading, and even shopping deals with Honey, this broad ecosystem has created strong customer loyalty that continues to shine through in these growth figures.
Guiding for free cash flow generation of greater than $5 billion in 2022, PayPal would trade at around 27 times FCF , even after accounting for $1.4 billion in stock-based compensation, making it a premium business trading at a fair price, below $100.
2. Unity Software
Creating and helping operate interactive, real-time 3D content, Unity Software (NYSE: U) is well-known for its leadership position in providing tools to game developers. However, investors should also take note of its rapidly developing business of creating digital twins (virtual representations of physical objects).
This secondary business line for Unity recorded 34 new deals in Q1 of 2022, each worth more than $100,000 in value -- a figure that grew 126% year over year. With market analysis firm Grand View Research expecting the global digital twin industry to grow by nearly 40% annually through 2030, this growth should just be getting started.
Thanks partly to this business line's growth, Unity reported year-over-year revenue growth of 36% for the first quarter but saw its net loss per share jump by more than 50%.
Despite the company's promising growth avenues, the widening loss and slowing sales growth have led to an 80% share price drop from all-time highs and its lowest price-to-sales (P/S) ratio since going public.
U PS Ratio data by YCharts
While this P/S ratio is still double that of the median technology stock in the S&P 500 index, Unity's deal with The Orlando Economic Partnership to build a digital twin for the 800-square-mile region may be a glimpse into the company's long-term optionality potential.
3. Roku
With TechCrunch projecting connected TV (CTV) advertising spending to double from 2020 by the end of 2022, it isn't shocking to hear that streaming TV juggernaut Netflix is planning to launch an ad-supported pricing tier shortly. Considering these intentions, the rumors circulating that Netflix is weighing an acquisition of Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) and its advertising platform make sense in theory -- but it may be hard to pull off because of the latter's reasonably large market capitalization of $12 billion.
Further clouding this buyout possibility are Roku's advertising partnerships with AMC Networks and Paramount Global and its content distribution deals with YouTube and Disney -- all of whom are competitors with Netflix.
Posting 39% sales growth year over year for the first quarter of 2022 in its core platform segment, Roku showed that its trio of advertising operations, The Roku Channel, and content distribution on its operating system all look more vital than ever.
ROKU Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
With returning advertisers increasing their spending by more than 50% year over year with Roku, look for the company to continue thriving amid the ongoing shift in advertising from linear TV to CTV.
4. Match Group
While Statista projects the online dating industry to grow by only 6% annually through 2026, Match Group's (NASDAQ: MTCH) leadership position and massive 30% free cash flow margins make it a no-brainer stock to buy under $100.
With its paying member count and revenue per payer rising 13% and 6%, respectively, in Q1 of 2022, Match Group's overall revenue jumped 20% over the same time.
Delivering promising growth since completing its spin-off from IAC/InterActiveCorp (NASDAQ: IAC) in 2020, Match Group hosts 16 million paying accounts and the world's most downloaded dating app, Tinder.
MTCH Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
Highlighting its leadership position, 60% of American couples that met on a dating app did so on a Match Group brand. Thanks to this dominance in the online dating industry, the company looks very intriguing, trading at just 24 times free cash flow.
MTCH Price to Free Cash Flow data by YCharts
Any time a company's revenue growth rate nearly matches its price-to-FCF, it should catch investors' attention as it highlights growth at a fair price -- making Match Group's 20% growth at 24 times FCF attractive. Thanks to this favorable valuation and its global expansion potential, Match Group offers multibagger prospects over the long haul.

Matt Frankel: I've owned Square since two days after its IPO or Block (NYSE: SQ) or whatever. I call it Square until it changes its ticker, then I'll actually start calling it Block. I recently added to PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) in the market downturn. I owned PayPal as part of the eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) spinoff originally then sold it but I recently bought back in. I love PayPal. I think it's a cash-cow business that is just making so much money that the market doesn't really appreciate it.
There's a few that are on my radar. Shift4 (NYSE: FOUR) is the big one that's on the top of my radar. I describe them as the Square for hotels and restaurants. They really specialize in an all-in-one solution for hospitality businesses. They are building out other forms of payment processing. They've signed some big clients. SpaceX is the big one they just signed and they are just rolling out.
They're the payment provider for Starling the internet service that SpaceX is doing. Really great customer relationships and it's really impressive traction so the ticker symbol for that one is FOUR, F-O-U-R and that's high on my radar right now. But the only two other payment stocks I own are Square and PayPal.

2022-06-12 00:00:00+00:00,"Want $5,000 a Year in Passive Income? Buy This Stock Now",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/want-%245000-a-year-in-passive-income-buy-this-stock-now,,,"Dividend stocks are an excellent option if you're looking to build a recurring income stream. Because mostly profitable businesses pay dividends, it makes this an ideal source of passive income in the long term.
More specifically, investors looking to generate $5,000 per year in passive income can do so by purchasing 6,944 shares of eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) stock. At a price per share of $47 as of this writing, the purchase will set you back roughly $326,400. The e-commerce retailer has grown earnings robustly over the previous decade, demonstrating the potential to boost dividends over the long run.
EBAY EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YCharts
eBay's asset-light business model can work in passive income investors' favor
Indeed, eBay has increased earnings per share at a compound annual rate of 23.6% in the last decade. The company runs on an asset-light business model that keeps expenses low. Unlike rival Amazon, eBay does not own or operate any fulfillment centers, leaving shipping arrangements to sellers. Instead, it is content with taking a percentage commission for each transaction on its platform. It works in passive income investors' favor because when eBay generates profits, it does not need to use the cash to maintain or build new fulfillment centers, which leaves money to pay dividends.
eBay's robust earnings growth allowed it to start paying a dividend in 2019 of $0.56 per share. It has already boosted its dividend twice, to $0.64 in 2020 and $0.72 in 2021. Since dividends are paid out of earnings, passive income investors can reasonably expect eBay to continue increasing its dividend over the next several years. That's especially true if you consider its dividend payout ratio. The metric divides the dividend payment by profits and indicates room for expansion.
EBAY Payout Ratio data by YCharts
eBay only paid 4% of its earnings as dividends, opting to reinvest the rest of the funds in the business. Furthermore, since eBay only initiated a dividend in 2019, it could be that management is taking a conservative approach to the payment total. That's because investors typically punish a company severely (by selling its stock) if it is ever to cut or pause a dividend. Therefore, management prefers to pay a dividend they feel confident they can sustain and increase over time.
Indeed, online sales as a percentage of overall sales totaled just 14% in the U.S. in 2020. The figure is estimated to grow to 22% by 2025 as buying online offers several conveniences to consumers, including being open 24/7 and shipping to your doorstep. eBay benefits from the trend as one of the two most visited e-commerce sites in North America in 2021.
Passive income investors are getting a fair price for eBay stock
EBAY Price to Free Cash Flow data by YCharts
eBay is trading at a price to free cash flow of 16.8, a little above the average price it has sold for in the last five years, save for the brief collapse at the pandemic's onset. That means investors are getting a fair price to build a stream of $5,000 per year in passive income -- a stream that is likely to grow more prominent over the years.

2022-06-10 00:00:00+00:00,Netflix shares slide as Goldman downgrades on grim economic picture,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/netflix-shares-slide-as-goldman-downgrades-on-grim-economic-picture,,,"By Tiyashi Datta
June 10 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc NFLX.O shares fell 5% on Friday after Goldman Sachs downgraded the streaming pioneer over risks of slower consumer spending and tough competition from Amazon and Walt Disney Co.
In April, Netflix lost subscribers for the first time in more than a decade, signaling trouble ahead for the industry as rising prices of food and gas left people with little to spend on entertainment.
Suspending its services in Russia after the Ukraine invasion also took a toll on Netflix.
Goldman downgraded the stock to ""sell"" from ""neutral"" and slashed its price target to $186 from $265, the lowest PT among analysts covering the stock, according to data from Refinitiv.
The brokerage also lowered its ratings on e-commerce platform eBay Inc EBAY.O and online gaming firm Roblox Corp RBLX.N to ""sell"" from ""neutral"". Roblox and eBay shares fell nearly 4% in afternoon trading.
Netflix is now a ""show-me story"", Goldman said, as it cut revenue estimates for 2022-2023.
That sent Netflix shares down 4.6% at $184.06 in midday trading on Friday, adding on to this year's 68% slump.
""The cost of living crisis will have a major impact on all streaming services. Let's not forget the market is now awash with too many streaming media services chasing too few services,"" said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight.
""Expect some to pivot more towards a yearly discounted bundle to entice users and increase loyalty.""
Netflix is already considering a cheaper subscription that includes advertising, following the success of similar offerings from rivals HBO Max and Disney+.
The median price target of the 48 analysts covering the Netflix stock is at $297.50, down from $502.50 in March.

2022-06-10 00:00:00+00:00,2 Top Growth Stocks to Buy Right Now and Hold for the Long Term,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-top-growth-stocks-to-buy-right-now-and-hold-for-the-long-term-2,,,"The stock market has decimated tech stocks, and many fast-growing companies are down significantly from their all-time highs. But this can provide appealing opportunities for long-term investors who are willing to sift through the rocks to find some diamonds in the rough.
The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) and Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y) are down more than 50% off their all-time highs, creating an optimal time to pick up some shares. More importantly, both companies continue to leverage their competitive advantages to thrive in their respective industries. This should continue over the long term, and investors might want to add these two companies to their portfolios.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. The Trade Desk
The Trade Desk stands at the top among independent advertising technology (adtech) companies that operate outside the walled gardens of Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms' Facebook. It is the largest independent platform where advertisers can buy ad space.
The Trade Desk thrives on its scale and dominance on the independent side of adtech. While Alphabet and Meta might be larger, both have incentives to bring advertisers to their own platforms, leaving The Trade Desk as the best choice for advertisers wanting a neutral middleman. In the first quarter of 2022, revenue grew 43% year over year to $315 million, and there was more than $136 million in free cash flow. It can reinvest this cash into strengthening its partnerships with ad inventory providers in the future, which solidifies its position as the leader in the industry.
Even after facilitating nearly $6.2 billion in ad spending in 2021, the company has tons of potential left. According to PubMatic, a Trade Desk partner on the sell side of adtech, global digital ad spend is expected to reach $627 billion by 2024, so the opportunity for The Trade Desk is still significant.
One of the main risks to advertising-focused companies is an economic downturn, because one of the easier places for businesses to cut budgets is advertising. Social media company Snap has already reduced its second-quarter guidance because of macroeconomic conditions, but The Trade Desk seems to be unphased. The company reiterated its guidance for the second quarter, signaling that it isn't expecting to see as much of a slowdown as Snap.
The Trade Desk is not cheap trading at over 67 times free cash flow, but that's close to its lowest multiple since 2018. Because of this high price, it might be wise to dollar-cost average into a position at lower valuations over time. But investors should not miss out on this opportunity because of the high valuation -- it can be a major winner over the long term if it can continue taking market share in the advertising space.

2. Adyen
You might not know this Netherlands-based payment processor, but Adyen is likely familiar with you. If you ever paid for an Uber ride or a burger at McDonald's with a digital form of payment, then you have experience with Adyen without even knowing it. The company has an end-to-end payments platform, offering everything from processing to digital card issuance.
What makes Adyen unique is its approach to growth. Instead of increasing its take rate on the volume it processes, Adyen's take rate actually decreases as customers process more volume. While this might seem counterintuitive, it has been a great selling point for the company.
This low-cost advantage has allowed it to supplant larger competitors like PayPal for payment processing. In 2018, eBay replaced PayPal with Adyen as its primary payments processor. Back then, Adyen processed only 159 billion euros (or $170 billion) in total payment volume (TPV), while PayPal processed $578 billion, meaning Adyen was just 29% the size of PayPal in terms of volume. Now, Adyen is catching up. In 2021, it processed more than 516 billion euros ($551 billion), up 70% year over year and roughly 44% the size of PayPal's total payment volume.
While its take rate decreased almost 14% year over year in 2021, its customers relied more heavily on Adyen, which enabled revenue to jump 46% to 1 billion euros. Adyen also generated 567 million euros in free cash flow last year, up 53% and enough for an outstanding 57% free-cash-flow margin. The company can leverage this cash to continue creating a better product experience and attract larger customers.
Adyen looks like a stellar business today, and it is valued as such. The company trades at 23 times free cash flow, slightly higher than rival PayPal. However, with an end-to-end solution, the free cash flow to continue innovating, and a durable low-cost advantage, I think Adyen is well positioned to capitalize on a market expected to be worth $52.4 trillion by 2026.

2022-06-08 00:00:00+00:00,eBay (EBAY) to Attract Collectors With Its Trading Cards Vault,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-ebay-to-attract-collectors-with-its-trading-cards-vault,,,"eBay EBAY has introduced the eBay vault, a digital marketplace for single and top-graded trading cards.
The eBay vault is a 31 thousand square foot, temperature-controlled facility, which provides secure access all day.
The vault is equipped with the Price Guide and Collections tool, which helps vault users track the real-time valuation of their trading card portfolios and list cards directly from their collection.
With the eBay vault, collectible enthusiasts can seamlessly manage their portfolio of collections. Moreover, the vault ensures secure transaction through eBay’s Authenticity Guarantee, insurance, fractional ownership, affordable shipping and a tax-free storage location.
The vault is accessible to those trading cards that are being directly purchased on eBay for more than $750 in the United States.
The cards are also needed to be graded by top graders in different categories like Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), Sportscard Guaranty Corporation (SGC), Certified Collectibles Group’s affiliates, CGC Trading Cards, Certified Sports Guaranty (CSG) and Beckett Grading Services (BGS).

More Collectible Initiatives
The recent move is in sync with eBay’s consistent efforts in the collectible space. We believe that eBay vault will help EBAY gain momentum among the millennials and the Gen Z collectors.
Further, it is worth mentioning that eBay plans to expand the vault with additional collectible categories and luxury goods by 2023. Moreover, EBAY expects the vault to hold up to $3 billion worth assets within a few years.
Last month, eBay partnered with OneOf, a green non-fungible tokens (NFTs) company, which caters to the music, sports and lifestyle fraternities. Per the terms of the deal, eBay will leverage OneOf’s eco-friendly Web3 technology to introduce a series of exclusive NFTs for expanding EBAY’s reach to youngsters who are collectible enthusiasts.
The growing initiatives are helping eBay expand its presence in the emerging collectible market where growth is attributed to the rising online sale of antiques and collectibles, and the expanding e-commerce platforms catering to the collectibles trade.
Per a Market Decipher report, the global collectibles market is likely to touch $628 billion by 2031, seeing a CAGR of 6.2% during the 2021-2031 period.
Competitive Collectible Market
In this upbeat scenario, eBay faces severe competitive pressure from the ecommerce giant Amazon AMZN, which is leaving no stone unturned to expand its market share.
Amazon lets shoppers access its platform to purchase collectibles and artworks from a wide variety of prints and posters, figurines, clothing and uniforms, photographs and more.
Collectors can also shop trading cards and memorabilia, including autographed photos, jerseys, balls, helmets, et al. Further, AMZN’s consistent investment in the sports-card marketplace Dibbs to gain momentum in the collectibles market remains noteworthy.
Given the potential in the collectibles market, the ecommerce and digital payment platform Shopify SHOP also started making efforts to dive in this space, creating competition for eBay.
Enthusiasts can start, run and effectively grow their collectible businesses with Shopify’s free resources and training support. With SHOP’s dashboard, business owners can seamlessly manage their collectible store, inventory and customer orders in one place.
Further, Shopify offers smart marketing tools like SEO, integrated blogging and social media campaigns to help businesses attract customers to their collectible store.

2022-06-02 00:00:00+00:00,3 Best Growth Stocks to Add to Your Q2 Buy List,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-best-growth-stocks-to-add-to-your-q2-buy-list,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Our topic for today is which best growth stocks to add to a long-term portfolio. Many Wall Street darlings have come under significant pressure lately and, therefore, present better buying opportunities compared to January.
Growth companies come up with innovative products or services that add to their market share. Thus, their share values typically appreciate more than the market or their industrial averages.
However, when the market turns down, growth stocks are affected worse. This is partly due to growth companies having betas (β) greater than 1. As most InvestorPlace.com readers know, beta is a measure of the volatility of returns of an asset relative to the broader market.
For example, in the case of Wall Street stocks, we can talk about the β of a stock relative to the S&P 500 index. When a stock has a β value larger than 1, such as 1.25, it is assumed to be 25% more volatile than the S&P 500. Most high-growth names and technology stocks have betas over 1.
The S&P 500 index has fallen 12.8% year-to-date (YTD). However, by comparison, the S&P 500 Growth index has declined even further—down 21.1% so far in 2022. Similarly, the Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG), which invests in growth names, is also down 23.7% YTD.
Market headwinds will eventually come to an end. Then growth stocks are likely to bounce back faster and stronger than the market in a bullish environment. 
7 Undervalued Large-Cap Stocks to Buy for June
With that information, here are three best growth stocks that could appeal to readers looking for robust long term opportunities:
ASML ASML $563.66
EBAY eBay $46.97
OLN Olin $64.36
ASML (ASML)

52-week range: $509.55 – $895.93
ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is a Dutch technology company that develops photolithography systems for the semiconductor industry. It also provides the hardware, software, and services required to manufacture silicon computer chips.
In late April, ASML reported Q1 earnings. Net sales totaled 3.5 billion euros, while basic earnings per share (EPS) came in at 1.73 euros. Cash and equivalents ended the quarter at 4,72 billion euros.
Recently, management announced the installation of the first HMI eSCAN 1100 multibeam system, used to detect defects in silicon wafers. This machine can inspect semiconductor chips 15 times faster than current devices.
As a result, chip manufacturers can increase throughput. Therefore, Wall Street is likely to pay close attention to how the new system will contribute to ASML’s bottom line.
Like most other names in the chip space, ASML stock has lost almost 27% YTD. But it has bounced back 15% after trading to 52-week lows on May 12. Shares are changing hands at 31 times forward earnings and 11.6 times sales. Meanwhile, the 12-month median price forecast for ASML stands at $774.50.
eBay (EBAY)

52-week range: $43.28 – $81.19
eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is the leading online marketplace company bringing together worldwide buyers and sellers. Thanks to its competitive positioning, the platform saw significant top line during the pandemic.
Management announced Q1 results on May 4. Revenue came in at $2.5 billion, down 6% on an as-reported basis. Adjusted diluted EPS came in at $1.05. The e-commerce innovator presented solid financial performance, generating $546 million of free cash flow (FCF) from continuing operations.
The marketplace powerhouse is introducing new features to increase market share. For instance, earlier in the year, eBay announced it was launching authentication services for ungraded trading cards purchased on the platform for over $750. This authentication service is now expanded to luxury items in the UK and Australia. 
The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for June 2022
EBAY stock has declined 27% YTD, now trading 13% above its 52-week lows set on May 20. Shares are changing hands at 11.25 times forward earnings and 2.75 times sales, with a dividend yield of 1.82%. In the meantime, the 12-month median price forecast for EBAY is at $55.
Olin (OLN)
Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com
52-week range: $39.90 – $66.96
Petrochemical group Olin (NYSE:OLN) manufactures chlor alkali products, vinyls, epoxy, as well as ammunition. For instance, it produces basic chemicals found in plastics. Those InvestorPlace.com readers looking for a robust basic materials investment have been paying attention to this diversified chemical play.
On April 28, Olin released Q1 results. Revenue was $2.46 billion compared to $1.92 billion in the year-ago quarter. Earnings came in at  $2.48 per diluted share. A year ago it has been $1.51.
Wall Street noted that epoxy demand has been growing as the production of electric vehicles (EVs) as well as wind turbines is on the rise. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine has also benefited U.S. petrochemical names like Olin.
The chemical giant has recently announced a partnership with Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG), which provides turnkey hydrogen solutions. The two will “create a joint venture (JV) to produce and market green hydrogen to support growing fuel cell demand in the global hydrogen economy.”
OLN stock is trading at its 52-week highs, having gained 20% YTD and 31% over the last 12 months. Moreover, the stock generates a dividend yield of 1.20%. Still, shares look undervalued at 6.6 times forward earnings and 1.1 times sales. Lastly, the 12-month median price forecast for OLN stands at $76.5.

Chris Hill: [MUSIC] A week ago when McDonald's announced it's leaving Russia and we asked who's next, today we got the answer, Motley Fool Money starts now. [MUSIC] I'm Chris Hill and I'm joined by Motley Fool Senior Analyst Jason Moser. Happy Monday.
Jason Moser: Hey. Happy Monday indeed.
Chris Hill: We have a Merger Monday ask story we're going to get to vote. Let's start with Starbucks. The coffee chain announced this morning it is leaving Russia and will no longer have any kind of brand presence there. Starbucks committed to paying its Russian workers for six months and helping them transition in new jobs. But from a financial standpoint, Jason, this is not going to have as big an impact as what we talked about last week with McDonald's because for Starbucks, it's a smaller store count and a smaller percentage of their annual revenue.
Jason Moser: Yeah, you're right. I think Starbucks was the example that we used when we were talking about McDonald's recently and thinking, is there another restaurant that will follow suit? Starbucks seemed like an obvious candidate, just giving them a chance to maybe weigh exactly what the reaction to McDonald's actions ultimately was. To me, this makes a lot of sense, following McDonald's lead, generally speaking right there, just look at this they figured, like we said, do you say worth the squeeze. When you look at Starbucks' presence in Russia, this is going to have a negligible impact on the business. I think it's something less than one percent of the company's overall revenue. Remember, when we were talking about McDonald's before, McDonald's in Russia where franchisees operate only 15 percent of the Russian locations the company owned, the rest when you look at Starbucks' presence there, that's all licensed locations.
This is not one of those situations where the company actually owns these stores, but again, less than one percent of revenue, it seems like a very easy decision to make when you look at the big picture. Generally speaking, I think most of the free world is quite opposed to what Russia is doing and rightly so, and so this is, I think, an opportunity for companies to take a little bit of a step back, assess not only where they're doing business and what makes the most sense from an economic perspective, but also what makes the most sense from just their core values perspective. I think with McDonald's, we talked about one of the core values there, being integrity and just doing the right thing, and Starbucks clearly a business that has been built on that type of framework as well. To me, this is a decision that it just feels like a no-brainer. They had suspended operations, I think, since March there, and this is really just putting a stamp on the envelope, so to speak.
Chris Hill: Where do you suppose the bar is now for businesses like McDonald's and Starbucks when thinking about entering new markets? I'm just thinking five years down the line or something, hopefully what's happening in Ukraine is long past the rearview mirror. Maybe someone else is in-charge instead of Vladimir Putin, and they're trying to woo the McDonald's and the Starbucks of the world back like no, no it's going to be better this time around. [LAUGHTER] Does it put these businesses a little bit more in the driver's seat in terms of terms that they can dictate or is that just negligible?
Jason Moser: I feel like it definitely puts the businesses in the driver's seat. They've shown that they don't need to do business there if they don't want to. It certainly depends on the location and perhaps the business and where they source whatever they are sourcing. But for the most part, I think this really is just a testament to the businesses holding more leverage in this case. They can say, ""Hey listen, we just prefer to do business in a place that's going to stay on for the things that we stand for."" It ultimately boils down to determining that line. This is a very easy line, I think for the most part, this is a very debatable issue.
I think that when you get in to the more debatable issues, that's when it becomes a trickier decision, and that's something that remains to be seen. But for the most part, I think, ultimately this puts the leadership of these countries on notice, the companies are going to say, ""Listen, we're going to do business in countries that stand for this, that do this, that take these types of actions,"" and they ultimately, I think have the power whereas as opposed to the countries, particularly with leadership such as Russia and Putin today, it's just a very easy decision for most companies to say, ""No, we don't really want to deal with you, you are way more trouble than you're worth,"" and until things change materially and sustainably, I think that's really one of the bigger point is that you need to be able to see a sustainable change. Not something that's just superficial, but something that's really more in-depth, and meaningful, and longer-lasting.
Chris Hill: Cloud computing business. VMware is reportedly in talks to be acquired by chipmaker Broadcom. The talks are ongoing, so we don't know what terms may be involved here, whether it's all cash or stock or a mix. That information not being available, however, is not stopping some investors because shares of VMware are up 20 percent on these reports. I guess we will see hopefully, in the coming days, if not weeks, whether or not this actually goes through. You and I were talking right before we started recording. Broadcom has grown in part through acquisition, so it is very much in the company's DNA in that sense. Maybe not that surprising that they would go after VMware.
Jason Moser: No, this does feel like it would be a complementary deal if they're able to pull it off. Broadcom being more of a semiconductor oriented business to your point there on growth via acquisitions. Broadcom certainly has grown via acquisitions over the last several years. You look at the business today, they have $43.5 billion in goodwill on the balance sheet, and that's basically doubled over the last five years. Ultimately, goodwill is just essentially overpaying for acquisitions. You're making acquisitions that represents what you pay beyond a fair deal, so to speak, about acquisition. Oftentimes we'll see companies over time, they'll write down a lot of that goodwill and that we can discuss that, debate that for another time. But ultimately, as you see that goodwill number continue to creep up, you have to, at least, keep an eye on that, because you start asking the question, is the company making good acquisitions? Is the company paying fair prices for these acquisitions?
With $43.5 billion of goodwill on the balance sheet, it's at least worth considering that, hey, maybe at some point Broadcom is going to write down some of that goodwill. Who knows, maybe they're making great acquisitions we'll have to wait and see. This to me, it seems like it could be actually a pretty good acquisition if it's able to happen. VMware, being a company that's more focused on becoming a multi-Cloud leader, they're focused more on the Cloud computing market opportunity, and that's something where Broadcom could really benefit. Multi-Cloud is ultimately just, it's that Cloud computing where an organization just utilizes a combination of Clouds, whether it's two or more public Clouds or private Clouds, a combination of public and private or Edge floods. It's ultimately bringing all of those Cloud resources together for their customers.
You look at how this has worked out for VMware and it's so far so good, the company is moving more and more toward a SaaS model, which is something we've seen a bit that's been obviously a big trend over the past several years. If you look at the breakdown of the fiscal year 2022 revenue, you had about 25 percent of the business' revenue, which was from licensing, 50 percent from servicing, and then 25 percent from SaaS, that's Software-as-a-Service. It continues to become more and more of a subscription in servicing that subscription model, and I think that's ultimately a good thing.
Given the direction the world is headed, given the tailwinds in the Cloud computing space, I absolutely understand Broadcom's interest here. It probably is not a bad time to consider doing a deal like this given where valuations are right now because if you hadn't heard, of course, we're in the middle of a bear market. [LAUGHTER] It's having a bit of an impact on some stock prices not all, but most. [laughs] So it's distinctly possible they could end up getting VMware for a very respectable price along with the fact that now that VMware, there was this big Dell relationship where Dell recently spun-off its VMware stake last November, so there's a little bit of uncertainty that's been resolved there. Maybe that's why this interest really is developing now. So yes, it remains to be seen whether this deal actually happens or not, but it does feel like it would be a complementary one for Broadcom, and I guess really then it just depends on what price they are willing to pay.
Chris Hill: Before I let you go, let's broaden this out a little bit. There are a lot of companies that, from a market cap standpoint, are less expensive than they were six months ago. There are also a lot of companies out there with cash on the balance sheet. Do you think we could be entering a period over the next 3-6 months where we see more deal-making going on, more acquisitions. It is not lost on me that there are no names attached to these reports. There are no analyst, there are no executives. I trust the reporting. If Reuters and CNBC are reporting this, I take them at their word. But it just makes me wonder if we're going to see this scenario play out multiple times over the next 3-6 months.
Jason Moser: It feels it should. It feels logic dictates that it should. I don't think it's going to be something where the obvious suspects are the acquirers. I don't think it's something where your Alphabets, and your Amazons, and your Microsofts, Microsoft is in the middle of trying to wrap up this Activision Blizzard deal, but for the most part, I feel those are the companies that are really under the microscope of regulators right now. Maybe there is this lower level echelon. Just that next step below, like your Broadcom's of the world, where they could get away with something like this without necessarily getting right there on regulators radars there.
It does feel it's something that should happen because you're right. Valuations have come down considerably. We live in a world right now where it feels every single headline is bad. [laughs] It really does feel that way. It just feels there's so much bad news out there right now that any spate of good news could really turn things around. It does feel there should be more interest in making some deals happen right now, particularly for those mid large cap companies that aren't necessarily on the radar of regulators. They have the financial resources, they have the wherewithal to get these deals done, and they don't necessarily have to worry about being on regulators radars. It'll definitely be interesting to see how the remainder of this year shakes out because if these market conditions persisted, and it feels they will at least for a little while, it definitely feels we can we can hear more news like this. [MUSIC]
Chris Hill: Jason Moser, thanks so much for being here.
Jason Moser: Thank you. [MUSIC]
Chris Hill: Enough talk about companies involved in Cloud computing and semiconductor chips. Can I interest you in a publicly traded business based on selling vinyl figurines? No, really. Nick Sciple and Asit Sharma are taking a closer look at Funko. Some fundamental reasons they're feeling bullish about bobbleheads and what a new investor group could mean for the company.
Nick Sciple: Welcome everybody. I'm Motley Fool Canada analyst Nick Sciple and I'm here today to talk about why Funko could be a fun company for your portfolio. Joining me to help me do that is Motley Fool analyst, Asit Sharma. Asit, how is it going?
Asit Sharma: Great, Nick. Good to see you and chat with you after a long time.
Nick Sciple: It's been a long time since we've been together in podcast land. It's great to be back here with you and we've got a fun company to talk about today. Funko. If folks aren't familiar with the company, you've probably seen their Funko pop [inaudible] , action figures, figurines in stores. Whether it's a bookstore or Target, or a place like GameStop, they're all over the place. They are one of the biggest pop culture merchandise providers, really, in the world. Asit, for folks who aren't familiar with Funko, what do they do?
Asit Sharma: I like to think of Funko as a company that bridges the physical and digital divide. Some stuff that we experience first digitally, so movies, music, and video games, bringing that into collectible format with their vinyl pop figures, their bobblehead figurines, and an array of other merchandise which includes backpacks, key chains, you name it. This is a company that has very deep partnerships with big intellectual property giants like Disney, Netflix, Warner Brothers, Activision Blizzard. They basically licensed the right to intellectual property and turnout these figurines, which they didn't distribute through big-box retailers, through their own direct commerce channel, and for their products like backpacks through stores and you can even buy them at Disney, which is a big part of this business.
Nick Sciple: Loungefly has been a growing part Funko's business. It's actually up to 16 percent of the business, up over 100 percent year-over-year in the most recent quarter, which is helping diversify the company's revenue. Traditionally, those Funko pop vinyl figures that you mentioned really drove the vast majority of the business and they still drive over half of the business today. Historically, there's been some concern just given that dependence on those Funko pop products and that being a single-product company that perhaps there's a little bit of a risk of Funko being a fad. However, they put up some really impressive growth numbers, Asit. What do you make of that potential fad risk, the dependence on the pop products and maybe prospects for diversification moving into the future?
Asit Sharma: Yeah. I think this is fair criticism of the company, even today if you look at their most recent quarter, their core collectible items make up about 2/3 of revenue. But as you mentioned, Nick, they've got now a good part of their business which comes from an acquisition they made of a company based in the UK, which is Loungefly, what we've been mentioning. They've got some other revenue streams that branch all the way into NFT sales, although no one should hang their hat on that as investment thesis. Call it gravy if they make that more significant part of the business.
These are some risks behind Funko, and I'll say this company has some other risks behind it that traditionally have made it a hard investment to really entertain. But those are falling away one-by-one. First, it had a very large debt load about five years ago. If you look at their net income on the books going all the way back to say, 2017, just the interest expense on their debt took out a big chunk of their earnings. They gradually paid down the debt to more reasonable levels, so it's not affecting their income statement as much and it's not quite the existential threat on their solvency or liquidity than it was in the past. Also, they had a big private equity investor, Acon investments, that at one point owned about 69 percent of this company. Over time that private equity group, which is actually pretty helpful in helping this company grow its business and diversify.
They've sold off their shares bit by bit. We're going to talk about this last buyer that's come to buy shares from Acon in just a moment here. But also want to mention they didn't have a wide enough distribution footprint. Management made the push to get into stores like Walmart and Target and to push their products globally. Another thing is they just really didn't have a great cost structure on the bottom line. But here you look today, they've just moved into a million square foot distribution center, not their headquarters, but their distribution operation. All fronts, this company is looking a lot more investable and I think it is an interesting play. But Nick, what about these most recent investments? So Acon is now selling most of its shares to another group, which is made up of some pretty interesting players.
Nick Sciple: Yeah, Asit. So if you look at the company today, some really promising growth numbers, 58 percent revenue growth year-over-year in 2021 of free cash flow, positive business, a business that's put some of those debt concerns behind it. And then again, you had this significant private equity investor, this overhang that we talked about sometimes when you have these large investors, well, on the same day that Funko reported its first quarter earnings, it reported that Acon was going to sell about 80 percent of its stake, a stake equivalent to 25 percent of Funko's business to an investment consortium led by, among others, The Chernin Group, which is led by Peter Chernin, a private equity investor that's invested in companies in the past like Barstool Sports and other member of that investment consortium was former Disney CEO Bob Iger, someone who probably knows a thing or two about the IP licensing business. And then lastly, Rich Paul, who is LeBron James' sports agent as well as significant super agent in the sports business. Since you had those investors buying a quarter of the company at $21 a share. If you look at where the company is trading today, it's about $19 a share, so we saw a little bit of value out there. It looks like these private equity folks did too. Then not only that, these are folks you could argue, can create potential additional value on top of just the value they recognized in the market at 21.
Asit Sharma: Yeah, I agree, Nick. This isn't your group of financial buyers who are just in there to see if they can squeeze some more out of the bottom line. These are pretty forceful personalities in the business world. They want to bring their talent and their bona fides to bear here with Funko, and they are also extremely well connected people who are used to the power of picking up the phone and getting deals done. I want to point out another investor who is actually not an individual but a company that's part of this consortium, which is eBay. eBay is now an investor in Funko, and the two companies have a new partnership where there will be a nice secondary market for Funko's products on eBay. The two companies will collaborate to create new products. Now, we didn't mentioned that one of the really fun parts of Funko is the fact that these collectibles can often rise in value. So having a secondary market on eBay only makes the whole proposition more valuable, although I should mention in the same breath, Funko's aim is to have products that are affordable to everyone. But what do you think about all these big hitters coming in, Nick? Do you think they will be able to add some juice to this revenue picture and help with some really great creation of IP or might this be just a little hype here?
Nick Sciple: Well, whether it's hype or not, it's something we'll have to find out, what results they produce. I will say I tend to follow the stuff that The Chernin Group does in the past. Again, Barstool Sports investment, they were really transformational in getting that company up to scale. They also have some other investments in the IP space Crunchyroll, Goldin Auctions which is just another kind of collectibles business. Obviously, Bob Iger, Disney, a huge driver of that side of the business. So I think there's lots of value to be created here as well. Then there's some pie in the sky stuff I'll mention. It's not something that I would build into the thesis or anything like that, but if you look back, I think it's 2019, there were some rumors that Warner Media was going to produce a Funko movie using the Funko IP, in the vein of what you've seen with the Transformers Movie or the Lego Movie or the Trolls Movie, that sort of thing.
I could see with folks like Bob Iger, and The Chernin Group has actually been involved in the movie production business as well, those folks get involved, maybe that makes that type of optionality more likely. But in any event, you have really smart savvy investors that know a thing or two about the IP licensing business that have recognized Funko as a smart place to put their money in. Listen, The Chernin Group is a private equity company, they're in the business of making money, they're not buying it just to be flashy. To the extent, it's hype, they put real dollars buying this, trying to make real money. So I think these folks are smart, and listen, I thought the stock was attractive even before that investment took place. It's always nice to get a little bit of confirmation bias too.
Asit Sharma: Yeah, this is a company that looked like a value stock before and still does in some ways, even though it's had a nice pop there's a pun for you who are fans of the company. A nice pop after the announcement with the first-quarter earnings that you mentioned. I'll also say too that this is a fun type of private equity investment because while you do have that PE angle, which is all about making the money, there's a lot of creative energy here. For Funko, that's like oxygen for this company, they spent the last several years figuring out their distribution, getting their costs under control, getting that distribution that I talked about. Now, it's time to capitalize on creative ideas and partnerships they can build. I think all this is good. Any risks to the investment thesis that you see, Nick?
Nick Sciple: Well, one of the big ones is they don't own the IP. To a certain extent, whether it's Loungefly or Funko pops, they own the design for the bag, they don't own the IP that's going in to creating those products. The relationships they have with those other parties are foundational to the business. Maintaining those relationships is always going to be a key. That's one risk that pops to mind for me. What about you, Asit?
Asit Sharma: I see a lot of the risks that I worried over in the past to slowly melt it away. I talked about the balance sheet risks and the fact that they were controlled by this other group and that gradually diminished. Now the replacement group looks pretty capable, will help revenue and earnings as well. But in the near-term, you could see a little bit of deceleration from this very nice pace of revenue growth they've been enjoying. If we go into recession, that obviously hits that consumer discretionary spend. Some would argue that because Funko's products are very accessible, maybe they don't lose that much.
Maybe people choose to buy some Funko collectibles after they've been forced to stay home and not take that vacation because of inflation. That's yet to be seen, but that's a near-term risk. Longer-term is to ever present risk that people will just change the way they consume their pop culture. For the longest time, Funko has benefited from what they call Evergreen Properties. Properties like Star Wars, Harry Potter, the NFL, these deals that enable them to keep churning out products that never go out of style. It could be that in the future, the younger-generation moves to more digital products for collectibles. But here again, we mentioned they are getting a toehold in the NFT markets. So at least they'll be able to maybe compensate if that risk of the physical product does become more prominent in the coming years.
Nick Sciple: Yeah, I will say one thing if you look at the consumer and potential slowdowns as a result of consumer weakening. One of the areas that I think about that's probably a place that's a big demand driver for this type of fandom based pop culture content is Comic Cons and those types of conventions, if you think about it, San Diego Comic Con is the biggest one that's been canceled the past two years. While there are some headwinds when it comes to inflation, potentially weakening consumer. There are some tailwinds when it comes to reopening and then some of these traditional demand drivers for these types of collectible products opening backup.
Asit Sharma: So before we leave, Nick, I've hinted at this, but I'll ask it as if I didn't know. Do you or anyone in your family own any Funko products?
Nick Sciple: Yes. So we don't own any of the Funko pop figurines, but we own three or four of the Funko Loungefly bags. We've got a Marie one from the Aristocats, and we've also got ones with the little mice from Cinderella. Whenever we go on hikes in the park or actually went to Disneyland, Paris a month or two ago, those bags come with us. So yeah, we represent a little bit.
Asit Sharma: Awesome, yeah, I have some in my house as well. Now, I personally don't own any products, but my three sons love their bobblehead Star Wars product. Especially my oldest, he collected a few after he went to college. My two younger sons took his passport photo [MUSIC] and taped it on the front of the bobblehead doll. You can't see it now, because we're taping and this is a radio-type show, but I'm showing it to Nick. When we walk by, we tap the top of the bobblehead now, almost like, ""Hey, call home.""

2022-05-29 00:00:00+00:00,My Favorite Dividend Stock to Buy in June,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/my-favorite-dividend-stock-to-buy-in-june,,,"As we enter June, specific macroeconomic trends are taking center stage. Supply shortages are persisting, inflation is rearing its ugly head, economic reopening is changing spending patterns, and uncertainty about the direction of the pandemic has not ended.
eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is a company that I think can do well in that economic backdrop. The asset-light business model can protect against rising costs, and eBay is where consumers go when things are sold out everywhere else.
More importantly, eBay has done an excellent job at growing earnings over the past decade, which can sustainably fund its dividend payment. Let's look closer at why eBay is my favorite dividend stock to buy in June.
Image source: Getty Images.
eBay has grown earnings at a rapid rate
Indeed, from 2012 to 2021, eBay has grown earnings per share at a compound annual rate of 23.6%. Earnings are vital when determining a company's ability to pay dividends. Sure, a business could fund dividends out of savings or borrowings, but eventually, these sources would be exhausted. The only sustainable source to fund dividends is profits. In that regard, income-seeking investors can be encouraged by eBay's robust earnings growth.
In its most recent quarter, which ended on March 31, eBay's revenue decreased by 6% year over year. The company is losing customers and engagement as economies reopen and consumers shift more of their spending to in-person stores. eBay does not own the inventory sold on its platform and leaves shipping to sellers. The asset-light business model should protect eBay from rising costs plaguing other companies.
What's more, if supply shortages persist, consumers could look to eBay's platform for items sold out elsewhere. eBay has both auction and fixed-price formats for sellers. At times, folks who get their hands on things sold out in stores list the products on eBay for a premium or put them in auctions that garner higher prices. Since eBay takes a percentage of transactions as revenue, the increase in activity is good news.
EBAY Payout Ratio data by YCharts
Note that eBay only started paying a dividend in 2019 at $0.56 per share, but it has already increased it twice to $0.64 in 2020 and $0.72 in 2021. What's more, eBay's dividend payout ratio (dividends per share divided by earnings per share) was just 4.1% most recently, highlighting that eBay has plenty of room to keep increasing its dividend.
Committed to an asset-light business
Income investors can be further encouraged by eBay management's continued focus on an asset-light business model. That means the company does not have to plow back earnings into the business. Instead, it can return profits to shareholders through dividends.
From 2011 to 2021, eBay's total assets decreased from $27.3 billion to $26.6 billion. That means that eBay has taken the billions it has earned in profits and returned it to shareholders. Of course, depreciation could also be attributed to the decrease, but it highlights that management is not investing in fixed assets like fulfillment facilities.
EBAY PE Ratio data by YCharts
Fortunately for investors, eBay is not expensive at a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 16.6 and a price-to-earnings multiple of 2.7. Inexpensive valuation, robust earnings growth, and an asset-light business model are why eBay is my favorite stock to buy in June.

2022-05-27 00:00:00+00:00,Worried About Inflation? This Stock Can Move Higher in an Environment of Rising Prices,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/worried-about-inflation-this-stock-can-move-higher-in-an-environment-of-rising-prices,,,"One only has to visit a grocery store or gas station to see how inflation has eroded the buying power of consumers. This has extended into stocks as the S&P 500 flirts with bear market territory. Moreover, many growth tech stocks have lost more than three-fourths of their value.
However, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) has learned how to prosper in Latin America despite high inflation. More importantly for investors, it serves as an example of how U.S. investors can flourish regardless of whether inflation in the U.S. continues to rise.
Image source: Getty Images.
MercadoLibre and inflation
MercadoLibre is the leading e-commerce platform in Latin America. It's been in business since 1999, and its stock debuted in 2007. Despite that region's reputation as a difficult place to do business, the stock has prospered, moving higher by more than 2,400% since its IPO.
Investors should also note that MercadoLibre is the one e-commerce stock that's still growing in this environment. In the first quarter of 2022, revenue increased by 63% to $2.2 billion. And these figures are in U.S. dollars, not local currencies.
While the U.S.'s current 8.3% inflation rate is higher than in the past, it is lower than inflation in MercadoLibre's largest markets. About $1.25 billion, or 56%, of its revenue came from Brazil, a country with a 12% inflation rate. It also earned $518 million in revenue, around 23% of its total, from its home country of Argentina. Argentina remains a significant revenue driver as measured in U.S. dollars, despite years of runaway inflation in that country.
Data source: International Monetary Fund.
What MercadoLibre does
Fortunately, consumers still need goods in an inflationary environment, and rising prices have not stopped a secular growth trend in e-commerce. This helps support its primary businesses as an e-commerce facilitator. Sellers post their offerings to its marketplace, similar to eBay. MercadoLibre earns revenue by facilitating the transaction. Increasingly, it has built logistics and advertising capabilities that can support sellers and serve as additional sources of revenue.
However, its biggest marketplace coup may have come from serving Latin America's heavily unbanked population. Latin America is a largely cash-based society, complicating e-commerce in a region that depends on electronic payments to sell.
MercadoLibre developed a workaround by creating Mercado Pago. Mercado Pago offers fintech services such as prepaid cards, money transfer services, and other services that enable electronic payments. Such offerings also serve businesses and customers outside MercadoLibre, making the company more of a fintech company in many respects.
Additionally, many of these business segments earn money by percentage transaction fees. Thus, the revenue of such services rises with inflation, so much so that stockholders should also take notice of its massive fintech growth. In the latest quarter, online payments rose 54% year over year, and its digital accounts transacted $7.9 billion, a 178% increase over the last 12 months.
MercadoLibre and inflation
Between its e-commerce and fintech offerings, MercadoLibre can serve as an inflation hedge. Furthermore, understanding the company's business offers lessons on how to drive positive returns in an inflationary environment.
Despite significant inflation in its two biggest markets, the internet and direct marketing retail stock has successfully driven higher e-commerce sales levels when measured in U.S. dollars. Moreover, the revenue model of its fintech business serves as an inflation hedge by tying revenue to transaction volumes. Such a performance not only bolsters the investment case for MercadoLibre stock but also shows that companies can achieve success amid rising prices.

2022-05-26 00:00:00+00:00,Stock Market Sell-Off: 2 Growth Stocks Billionaire Money Managers Bought in Q1,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-sell-off%3A-2-growth-stocks-billionaire-money-managers-bought-in-q1,,,"During the first quarter, the S&P 500 fell more than 5% as rampant inflation and the prospect of rising interest rates sparked fears about a recession. But while many investors were selling out of the market, some professional money managers were buying.
For instance, billionaire Chase Coleman of Tiger Global added over 2 million shares of Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) to his hedge fund, making it the fifth-largest position in his portfolio. Similarly, billionaire David Siegel of Two Sigma Advisors doubled his position in PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), adding nearly 1.8 million shares to his hedge fund.
Image source: Getty Images.
Of course, the stock market sell-off has accelerated since the end of the first quarter. In fact, Sea Limited and PayPal have fallen 79% and 74%, respectively, from their highs. Is this a buying opportunity?
Let's dive in.
1. Sea Limited
Singapore-based holding company Sea Limited operates primarily in Southeast Asia and Taiwan, though it has expanded into Latin America and Europe. Its video game business Garena is the developer of Free Fire, the highest-grossing mobile game in Southeast Asia and Latin America for the past 11 quarters. Better yet, Garena is highly profitable, and that cash flow allows Sea to invest aggressively in its e-commerce and fintech businesses.
On that note, Shopee is the largest online marketplace in Southeast Asia in terms of monthly visitors, and it was the most downloaded shopping app globally in the first quarter. To reinforce its leadership, Sea offers a number of value-added services to merchants. That includes digital payments through its fintech business Sea Money, as well as solutions for logistics, fulfillment, and advertising.
In the first quarter, Sea's revenue rose 64% to $2.9 billion, but its GAAP loss widened to $1.04 per diluted share as operating expenses outpaced sales. In particular, R&D spend more than doubled. But given the size and rapidly evolving nature of its addressable market, Sea is investing aggressively to grab share.
Southeast Asia is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, and the number of internet users in the region is rising quickly. By 2025, e-commerce spend is expected to reach $234 billion and digital payment volume is expected to reach $1.2 trillion. That means Sea has a long runway in its core geographies, and its addressable market is even bigger if you include its operations in Brazil, Mexico, and Spain.
From that perspective, Coleman's decision to buy during the first quarter makes sense. And with shares trading at 3.7 times sales, Sea Limited is cheaper today than it has been for the vast majority of its time as a public company. Of course, unprofitable stocks have fallen out of favor on Wall Street in the current economic environment. But if you can handle volatility, now looks like a great time to buy a few shares.
2. PayPal Holdings
PayPal is one of the largest fintech companies in the world. Its network connects 394 million consumers with 35 million merchants, enabling digital transactions across brick-and-mortar shops, branded websites, online marketplaces, and mobile apps. Thanks its broad portfolio and brand authority, PayPal is the most accepted digital wallet in North America and Europe.
In the first quarter, PayPal posted lackluster financial results. Revenue climbed 7% to $6.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings dropped 28% to $0.88 per diluted share. However, the company faced tough year-on-year comparisons, as non-GAAP earnings grew 84% in Q1 2021. Additionally, the loss of eBay's business, high inflation, and supply chain issues presented significant headwinds, but there is light at the end of the tunnel.
PayPal will lap the worst of the eBay impact in the current quarter, and management says it will no longer be an issue in the second half of the year. More importantly, PayPal puts its addressable market at $110 trillion, and management is executing on a robust growth strategy.
In the last year, the company expanded its brick-and-mortar presence with QR Code payments, and it debuted PayPal Zettle point-of-sale software in the U.S. PayPal also redesigned its namesake digital wallet, adding features like crypto trading and shopping rewards. That's particularly noteworthy as the number of consumers using a digital wallet is expected to double by 2025.
Perhaps more exciting, the company is working to monetize Venmo more effectively. It launched the Venmo credit card in 2020, and PayPal has partnered with retailers like Revolve and DoorDash to accept Venmo at checkout. Better yet, Venmo payments are coming to Amazon later this year. With more than 85 million Venmo accounts in the U.S., that could supercharge growth.
All things considered, Siegel's decision to add more PayPal to his hedge fund looks like a smart move. The company benefits from a big market opportunity and a strong competitive position. More to the point, with the stock trading at 3.7 times sales -- near the bottom of its historical range -- now looks like a good time to buy a few shares for your own portfolio.

It is so widespread that neither households nor businesses can avoid getting hit. But not all companies are equally affected.
In fact, eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) might be as close to an inflation-proof stock as an investor can find. The company runs an asset-light business model that might insulate against rising inflation.
Image source: Getty Images.
An asset-light business model could protect against inflation
Indeed, eBay does not own the inventory listed on its platform. Its role is to bring together buyers and sellers and take a percentage commission from each sale. Unlike other e-commerce businesses, it does not own or operate any fulfillment centers. Those are especially exposed to rising wage inflation due to labor shortages since the pandemic's onset. Since eBay leaves shipping and handling to sellers, it also avoids the surging costs for delivery.
Meanwhile, as mentioned earlier, eBay's business of taking a percentage of sales on the platform could benefit from rising inflation. Folks who list items on eBay's website are likely to ask for higher prices. Recall that eBay also offers an auction format for selling items. With widespread inflation, these auctions are likely to attract higher bids. Overall, it could increase gross merchandise sales, from which eBay can derive more significant revenue.
Moreover, folks who shop on eBay are typically looking for lower prices. The site features millions of sellers listing used items that will typically cost less than the new version. With consumer budgets getting pinched from rising prices elsewhere, they could look to lower-priced options on eBay.
Investors can consider eBay an inflation-proof business -- immunized from the downside from rising costs in economies worldwide.
eBay's stock is not expensive
At a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 15.8, eBay is selling at roughly its average valuation, according to this metric. Investors looking to get some protection from inflation in their portfolios could do so with eBay's stock. Besides inflation protection, eBay has done an excellent job growing earnings per share at a compound annual rate of 23.6% in the last decade.
EBAY Price to Free Cash Flow data by YCharts
There is a valid concern with eBay that the economic reopening could hurt revenue and customer retention. eBay shed 21 million active buyers in its most recent quarter (ended in March) from the same time the year before. Similarly, revenue fell by 5% in that same time despite eBay raising the fees it charges sellers. In addition to economic reopening, the drop in sales could partly be explained by eBay's reduced spending on marketing promotions.
EBAY Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts
Before the outbreak, I regularly received a promotional offer that gave me $15 off a $75 or more purchase. Since the pandemic's onset, those have disappeared from my inbox entirely. It's no surprise that sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue have fallen to 18.6% in the quarter ended in March, from 19.9% a year ago.
That kind of prudent management has kept eBay's expenses low and entrenched its asset-light business model. This philosophy could protect investor portfolios, especially if out-of-control inflation proves stubbornly persistent.

OSLO, May 24 (Reuters) - Norwegian advertising firm Adevinta ADEA.OL posted a higher-than-forecast first-quarter core profit on Tuesday, although revenue growth lagged estimates as auto dealers cut ad spends due to a global semiconductor shortage hitting production.
The world's largest classified ads company reported adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 137 million euros ($146.1 million) for the three months ended March 31, up from 136 million euros a year-ago. Analysts on average had expected EBITDA of 120 million euros, Refinitiv data showed.
A shortage of semiconductors has constrained global car production, hampering sales and thus advertising, leading to Adevinta's German Mobile.de unit reporting a 3% revenue drop.

2022-05-23 00:00:00+00:00,Better E-Commerce Stock: Chewy vs. eBay,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-e-commerce-stock%3A-chewy-vs.-ebay,,,"E-commerce businesses thrived at the pandemic's onset as billions of people flocked online to avoid shopping in person. eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) and Chewy (NYSE: CHWY) were no exceptions, and each benefited from the tailwind. The trend is moderating in the near term as economies reopen.
In the longer run, an increasing share of spending is likely to happen online. With that backdrop, which is the better e-commerce stock to buy, eBay or Chewy?
Image source: Getty Images.
Chewy
Chewy is an exclusively online pet retailer. It has had success in rapidly growing sales from $901 million in 2016 to $8.9 billion in 2022. Chewy not only benefited from the shift to online spending during the pandemic, but also from an increase in pet ownership. Folks spending more time at home away from friends, family, and coworkers looked for companionship with pets. Millions of folks brought home furry friends they are likely to keep for a decade or more.
Chewy is not yet profitable on the bottom line, but it's demonstrating excellent economies of scale as its gross profit margin expanded from 16.6% to 24.4% from 2016 to 2022. If sales continue rising, it could only be a matter of time before Chewy's profits turn around. Rising inflation will not make this task any easier in the near term as the company works to pass along these costs to consumers. Longer-term, Chewy is confident it can approach a gross profit margin of 28%.
Chewy boasts 20.7 million active customers as of Jan. 30, a 7.6% increase from the same time the year before. These customers increased their average spending on Chewy.com by 15.6% year over year to $430. The robust and growing user base could also help Chewy reap additional benefits by showing advertisements -- a potentially lucrative source of revenue the company plans to launch in 2023.
eBay
Although eBay is an e-commerce business, it operates on a different business model from Chewy. eBay does not own any of the inventory sold on its platform. Additionally, it leaves shipping and fulfillment arranged between buyers and sellers. In that way, eBay is an asset-lite business. It makes money by taking a percentage of each transaction on the website and app.
EBAY Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts
eBay has been around for a couple of decades and is in the mature stage of its business cycle. It's not growing revenue like Chewy. In the previous decade, eBay's revenue has fallen from $14 billion in 2012 to $10.4 billion in 2021. Note that this includes the effects of divestitures.
That said, eBay has grown earnings per share at a compound annual rate of 23.9% in the time mentioned above. In the last few years, eBay has boosted profits by decreasing promotional activity (fewer coupons and incentives) and increasing the fees it charges sellers on the platform. The aforementioned policies and economic reopening have led eBay to lose millions of active customers. The figure fell to 142 million in its most recent quarter, down from 163 million at the same time the year before.
The verdict
CHWY PS Ratio data by YCharts
Chewy specifically sells pet products, which could limit its upside. eBay's asset-light business model could immunize it from inflationary pressure infecting businesses worldwide. Both are excellent enterprises that are likely to make shareholders wealthier in the long run.
If you had to choose one stock to buy, it should be Chewy; the company is trading at a significant discount to eBay. The valuation difference is enough to overcome the near-term headwinds from supply-chain disruptions likely to hurt Chewy.

2022-05-23 00:00:00+00:00,"Amazon, Ebay, Expedia, Walmart and Target are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-ebay-expedia-walmart-and-target-are-part-of-zacks-earnings-preview,,,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – May 23, 2022 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Amazon AMZN, Ebay EBAY, Expedia EXPE, Walmart WMT and Target TGT.
Breaking Down the Earnings Outlook After Retailers Disappoint
The stock market has been merciless in response to disappointing Q1 results, with Walmart and Target the most recent victims. Walmart and Target are hardly alone in this respect as a number of other prominent operators also got roughed up at the hands of the market after failing to meet Wall Street expectations.
Staying within the broader retail space, it is instructive to recall that the market's reaction to Q1 results from Amazon, Ebay and Expedia was similar to the recent beating Target and Walmart took.
Multiple factors are at play here, ranging from merchandising missteps and failure to accurately read evolving consumer behavior, to coming up short in responding to an admittedly tough operating environment characterized by rising costs. The consumer is still very healthy, supported by low debt loads, adequate savings and rising wages as a result of a tight labor market.
That said, it makes intuitive sense to envision that lower-income consumers will start to feel the squeeze, with rampant inflation eating into, if not altogether offsetting, wage gains. It would make sense for such a consumer to spend less on discretionary items and more on everyday necessities.
There was some of that at play in the Walmart and Target results. But the biggest driver of their disappointing results was weak execution that resulted in compressed margins that forced analysts to lower their outlook for the current and coming quarters.
You can see this in consensus estimates for Walmart and Target, with Walmart's July quarter EPS estimate down -4.2% in the last few days, while Target slipped -9.1%. As bad as these negative revisions to Walmart and Target estimates are, please keep in mind that the Q2 EPS estimates for Amazon have come down -62.8% in the past month.
Stepping back from these major retail operators and looking at the sector's earnings expectations as a whole, we see that expectations have notably been adjusted lower.
The Zacks Retail sector, which includes Walmart, Target, Amazon and all the other digital and brick-and-mortar operators, including restaurants, was expected to -0.7% decline in 2022 Q2 earnings at the start of the year. This expected earnings growth rate for the June quarter declined to -1.1% on March 30th. The 2022 Q2 earnings growth rate has dropped to -14.2% at present.
However, if we look at the revisions trend in the aggregate, at the S&P 500 level, we don't see a lot of movement, as you can see in the chart below that plots the evolution of aggregate Q2 earnings growth estimates for the index since the start of 2022.
In other words, estimates in the aggregate are essentially unchanged since the beginning of April and are actually up since the start of the year.
But as we saw earlier with the revisions trend for the Zacks Retail sector, there are plenty of cross currents at the sector level, with positive revisions to the Energy sector offsetting declines in most other sectors.
The Q2 earnings estimates for the Zacks Energy sector have increased +78.5% since the start of January and +41.7% since the beginning of April.
Energy is not the only sector that has enjoyed positive Q2 estimate revisions; there are 5 other sectors whose estimates have gone up by varying magnitudes. Since the start of Q2 on April 1st, earnings estimates have gone up for the Transportation, Basic Materials, Autos, Construction, and Consumer Staples sectors. Of these 5 sectors, the upgrade to the Q2 earnings outlook is particularly significant for the Transportation and Basic Materials sectors.
If we look at the aggregate Q2 revisions, after excluding the Energy sector from the mix, then the picture changes.
Pretty much the same trend is at play with the revisions on an annual basis, with aggregate estimates stable or even modestly up since the start of the year, but starting to come down on an ex-Energy basis.
I will not share those charts here to keep the length of this piece manageable, but I think it will be useful for you to see what has happened to full-year 2022 earnings estimates for the Energy sector since the start of the year.
Before I started analyzing the aggregate earnings picture some 12 or so years ago, I used to cover the Energy sector for a living. I have never seen this magnitude of estimate revisions for the Energy sector at any other time, or for any other sector for that matter.
Putting It All Together
The Fed's monetary policy tightening is expected to slow down the economy. At the expense of over-simplifying a complex development, this is how the Fed confronts inflation in the economy. Expectations of U.S. GDP growth have come down as a result.
You can see this in consensus GDP growth estimates since the start of the year, with the Zacks Economic team currently projecting 2022 GDP growth at +2.3%, down from +3.5% back in January. Estimates for next year have also come down, but not to the same extent. 
Since the Fed still has some ways to go in its inflation-fighting quest, it is reasonable to expect these GDP growth estimates to come down further.
As you would expect, earnings are a function of the broader economy, though the economy in the earnings discussion is the global economy and not just the domestic one. This is the reason why there is not a perfect correlation between nominal global GDP growth and revenue growth for the S&P 500 index.
Without getting into the debate whether the Fed tightening will push the U.S. economy into a recession or the central bank will be able to engineer the so-called 'softish' landing, it is a given that U.S. economic growth is on track to slow down in the coming quarters.
And so should expectations for S&P 500 companies. We have seen some of that already, but it's reasonable to expect more of that as we move into the second half of the year.

2022-05-20 00:00:00+00:00,Shopify Stock: Bear vs. Bull,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/shopify-stock%3A-bear-vs.-bull-1,,,"Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) was already making waves as an e-commerce enabler before 2020, but it soared to new prominence at the onset of the pandemic when billions of folks were doing their best to avoid shopping in person. The surge in consumer demand for online shopping and the government-mandated closures of brick-and-mortar stores compelled a wave of businesses to establish an online presence. Shopify was there to help and benefited from the trend.
That said, it's not all good news today for Shopify. Let's consider both sides of the argument for investing in this stock -- the bull vs. bear.
Image source: Getty Images.
The bull case for investing in Shopify
Those in favor of investing in Shopify will point to the company's exemplary growth even before the pandemic. Indeed, from 2012 to 2019, Shopify's sales grew from $24 million to $1.6 billion. That should assuage concerns that it is primarily a pandemic stock. The company provides the tools for businesses of all sizes to start and grow their websites. It typically receives a monthly fee and a percentage of sales those websites generate.
As a result, Shopify has benefited from the secular shift toward shopping online -- a trend that still has a long way to go. Even in 2020, at the height of the pandemic, e-commerce sales totaled just 14% of overall sales in the U.S. The market researchers at Statista forecast that will rise to 22% by 2025.
The difference between e-commerce spending and overall spending is an opportunity for Shopify. Of course, not all consumer spending will go online, even in the long run. However, it can be reasonable to assume we're headed toward a more balanced split between online and in-person shopping. To make the investment case for Shopify more compelling, the stock is down a whopping 79% from its high, and selling at nearly its lowest price-to-sales ratio in the last five years.
SHOP PS Ratio data by YCharts
The bear case against Shopify stock
Those arguing against investing in Shopify now may be willing to concede all the wonderful points made above said about the growth of e-commerce. They would probably also agree that Shopify's revenue growth has been impressive over the years. However, the bears will point out that Shopify's stock is still expensive even after falling considerably from its peak.
SHOP PS Ratio data by YCharts
Compare Shopify with its e-commerce rivals, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), and its premium valuation is prominently highlighted. Sure, you can argue for the competitive advantages Shopify boasts against Amazon and eBay. For instance, out of the three, Shopify is the only one that empowers the individual entrepreneur and builds the merchants' brand. Amazon and eBay give sellers access to a large buyer audience, but don't work to build a merchant's relationship with customers. Those differences highlight that this is not an apples-to-apples comparison but it goes to show the valuation gap between them.
That said, it's hard to argue that those advantages justify a three to four times valuation premium. After all, merchants have choices as to how they'll reach consumers online. Not all of them will choose Shopify.
Overall, both the bulls and bears make good points, but I still favor the bull case. Shopify's impressive growth highlights the growing cohort of businesses that are choosing it over its competitors. Its merchant-empowering business model is likely to continue attracting new clients. Given all that, I would be willing to pay today's premium to own shares of Shopify.

2022-05-19 00:00:00+00:00,"With the Nasdaq Down 26% Year to Date, Investors Should Consider Buying These 2 Tech Stocks",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/with-the-nasdaq-down-26-year-to-date-investors-should-consider-buying-these-2-tech-stocks,,,"Technology stocks have been hammered recently by fierce inflation, rising interest rates, and global economic impacts from the war between Russia and Ukraine. With no signs of turning the corner anytime soon, the Nasdaq Composite -- which has already sunk 26% year to date -- could face additional pressure in the near future.
The sell-off has been intense, but it has also introduced some generational buying opportunities for investors with long time horizons. Once the market stabilizes, there are many companies that could deliver massive gains for patient shareholders. Let's check out two beaten-down Nasdaq stocks that should bounce back in the long run.

1. Zoom Video Communications
Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM), the pandemic darling that blossomed during widespread lockdowns, has watched its stock price nosedive 47% year to date. While it's true COVID elevated its business, the company's success story is far from over. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. labor force still works remotely at least part time, and 85% of managers expect this to be the norm moving ahead.
This is great news for Zoom. The videoconferencing juggernaut reigns over almost half of theglobal market solidifying it as the clear frontrunner in the space. And with the industry projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 16% to $24 billion by 2028, you can see the opportunity for Zoom is significant.
In its fiscal 2022, total sales soared 55% to $4.1 billion, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) climbed 52% to $5.07. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the number of clients generating at least $100,000 in annual recurring revenue grew 66% to 2,725, showing the company's ability to rapidly expand its customer base, even in a post-pandemic world.
This upcoming year, analysts are modeling total revenue will increase to $4.6 billion while adjusted EPS retreats 30% to $3.53. While bottom-line growth is forecast to unwind from a year ago, Zoom is well positioned to rebound nicely once comparable metrics normalize. And given that the stock is trading below 19 times earnings today, the company offers investors a favorable risk-reward ratio and a strong margin of safety.
2. PayPal
PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), the global leader in fintech, has crashed 60% year to date despite having a long runway for growth in the coming years. With 429 million active accounts, it controls 50% of the global payment processing software industry, easily making it the most accepted digital wallet across North America and Europe.
In 2021, total revenue surged 17% year over year to $25.4 billion, and adjusted EPS grew 19% to $4.60. Total payment volume surpassed $1 trillion for the first time ever, a remarkable achievement for what I view as the top dog in the fintech space. In its most recent quarter, the company posted a top and bottom line of $6.5 billion and $0.88 per share, respectively, in line with Wall Street estimates but indicating patchy results this year.
Growth is projected to dwindle in 2022 with $600 million of top-line pressure associated with eBay's shift to its own payment platform and 40-year high inflation, which might compress the company's total payment volume.
Analysts are forecasting total revenue of $28.3 billion, equal to 12% growth year over year, while adjusted EPS drops 15% to $3.91. Investors shouldn't fret, though: Growth should pick back up once the eBay transition concludes, and inflationary concerns ease.
PayPal's post-eBay revenue growth has been consistently above 20%, and the company's current price-to-earnings multiple of 25 is more than a 50% discount to the historical average, making this fintech a no-brainer for prudent investors.

2022-05-17 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting EBAY Put And Call Options For August 19th,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-ebay-put-and-call-options-for-august-19th,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options begin trading today, for the August 19th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 94 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new August 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.15. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $41.85 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $46.05/share today.
Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.00% return on the cash commitment, or 27.18% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $45.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.81. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $46.05/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $50.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 12.51% if the stock gets called away at the August 19th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $50.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 9% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.93% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.26% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $46.05) to be 34%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-05-12 00:00:00+00:00,Is Now A Good Time To Buy Stocks? 3 E-Commerce Stocks To Watch,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-now-a-good-time-to-buy-stocks-3-e-commerce-stocks-to-watch,,,"3 Trending E-Commerce Stocks For Your May 2022 Watch List
There’s no question that e-commerce stocks were one of the biggest winners in the stock market during the onset of the pandemic. But over the past six months, most of these stocks plummeted as investors worried about the slowdown in their growth in a post-pandemic world. And as consumers start to spend their money on brick-and-mortar stores and travel experiences, it’s natural that e-commerce spending will take a hit. Thus, such a trend could also be contributing to the downtrend in the shares of e-commerce companies.
What’s more, concerns about inflation and rate hikes have been weighing on sentiments in the broader stock market. Could it be a good idea to purchase financially sound companies with attractive valuations at such times? For instance, we only need to look at the likes of Shopify. Despite showing exceptional growth in 2021, Shopify stock has shed more than 80% from its all-time high level. While it may deter some investors from investing in these tech companies, others may be buying the dips. 
Elsewhere, South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang (NYSE: CPNG) has already provided a glimpse of what’s to come earlier today. Its recent first-quarter earnings were impressive, to say the least. Its total revenues were a record $5.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Meanwhile, it also recorded the highest gross profit and gross profit margin in Coupang’s history. All in all, it may not be the worst idea to bank on the future of e-commerce stocks. If you share the same sentiment, here are some of the top e-commerce stocks to keep an eye on in the stock market today. 
E-Commerce Stock To Watch In May 2022
eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY)
Shopify Inc (NYSE: SHOP)
Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)
eBay
First up, we have the global commerce company eBay. Through its Marketplace platforms, buyers and sellers could connect in more than 190 markets around the globe. Its technology empowers its customers and provides everyone with an opportunity to grow and thrive. No matter who or where they are, the ripple effect of its work creates waves of changes for customers and anyone that uses the company’s platform. Therefore, investors keeping an eye on the e-commerce industry would likely be paying attention to EBAY stock. 
After all, eBay just came off a better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter in 2022. Despite the current macro headwinds, the company remains firm and its long-term strategy is still intact. The company posted revenue of $2.5 billion, down 6% compared to the prior year’s quarter but exceeding most analysts’ expectations. Meanwhile, its Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.05, also exceeding expectations. Consequently, eBay reassured its investors that the company is focusing on the future with an eye toward sustainable growth. 
On top of that, the company started the month of May with the launch of its third annual Up & Running Grants program. This is to provide support to the U.S. small businesses with the resources they need to scale, grow and thrive in the modern commerce era. eBay recognizes that small businesses are essentially the backbone of its platform. Thus, this program is part of the company’s ongoing commitment to empower them as it continues to find ways to make eBay their platform of choice. All things considered, there appear to be plenty of positives to go around. So, would you consider EBAY stock to be a top e-commerce stock to watch?

Shopify
Shopify is a software giant that specializes in the e-commerce space. In detail, the company provides a cloud-based, multi-channel commerce platform for small and medium-sized businesses. Merchants leverage its software to run their business across all of their sales channels, including Web and mobile storefronts. Therefore, giving merchants a single view of their business and customers across all sales channels. For these reasons, Shopify has been the commerce platform of choice for many merchants in any environment. 
Last Thursday, the company announced its first-quarter earnings. Shopify’s total revenue for the quarter improved to $1.2 billion, representing an increase of 22% year-over-year and a two-year compound annual growth rate of 60%. Not to mention, its Monthly Recurring Revenue also improved to $105.2 million, up 17% year-over-year. Admittedly, these figures may not be as exhilarating as the early stages of the pandemic. However, it does not change the fact that Shopify is still growing in the right direction.
Furthermore, the company also announced that it has reached an agreement to acquire Deliverr, Inc. For those unaware, this is a fulfillment technology company that provides simplicity and scale to millions of merchants. It also aims to remove the complexity of fragmented supply chain management. As such, Shopify will gain visibility and control of movement along the supply chain while empowering merchants to achieve fast delivery promises across channels. Given these encouraging developments, should investors be paying more attention to SHOP stock right now?

Amazon
To sum up the list, it is only right to include one of the largest e-commerce companies in the world, Amazon. The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products and subscriptions around the world. For most parts, it sells merchandise and content purchased for resale from third-party sellers. That said, Amazon is now a tech conglomerate that often pushes its boundaries with a focus on innovation. For example, the company’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. 
Although Amazon missed estimates in the recent quarter, AWS has been showing plenty of promise. The cloud computing segment grew 34% annually over the last 2 years, and 37% year-over-year in the first quarter. To say the least, it is the key component that is helping Amazon to weather the storm and move more of its workloads into the cloud. It is also noteworthy that Amazon is still the largest e-commerce company in the U.S. but has only penetrated approximately 13% of overall retail spending. 
Besides that, Amazon introduced “Buy with Prime” in April. This new feature will allow U.S.-based Prime members to shop directly from merchants’ online stores. When shopping with Buy with Prime, checkout is simple and convenient. Prime members will use the payment and shipping information stored in their Amazon account and receive timely shipping and delivery notifications after an order is placed. Overall, there may still be reasons for optimism when it comes to Amazon. With that in mind, could this be an opportunity to invest in AMZN stock at its current valuation?
