2022-05-12 00:00:00+00:00,eBay Is Still Losing Buyers,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-is-still-losing-buyers,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is still working on that soft landing. The online marketplace business recently reported another quarter of weakening growth metrics as e-commerce slows following soaring demand in 2021. Management projected further declines ahead in 2022.
The company had some good news for investors, though, including growing volumes in a few key niches as well as solid cash flow. These wins suggest the business might return to a more normal sales and earnings pace by 2023.
Let's dive right in.

Marketplace revenue
eBay's business is shrinking at an accelerating rate. Its buyer pool declined by 13% compared to a 9% decline in the prior quarter. Sales volumes on its platform fell even faster, down 20% in the first quarter compared to a 10% drop in each of the last two quarters.
It's no surprise that fewer people are conducting business through eBay's platform compared to early 2021 when all shopping was happening online. And executives were happy to stress that the demand drop-off was slightly better than expected.
Non-GAAP profit margin was also surprisingly high although it was down compared to last year. ""Our team has delivered another strong quarter, at the high end of our expectations,"" CEO Jamie Iannone said in a press release.
The bright spots
eBay got a sales lift from its relatively new payments and advertising businesses. There were several niche marketplace businesses that performed well, too, including the luxury watch category, the sneaker platform, and eBay's refurbished consumer electronics categories.
These segments represent competitive advantages for the business since it is difficult for e-commerce peers to duplicate these marketplaces. eBay's main challenge is to extend that advantage into other parts of the business.
eBay's finances continued to impress even though its earnings metrics worsened compared to last year. Free cash flow was $546 million, or 22% of sales. eBay's non-GAAP operating profit margin landed at about 32% of sales, which is far above its vertically integrated rivals like Walmart. eBay used that cash to repurchase its stock, after prioritizing investments into its growth initiatives.
Looking ahead
Management lowered the 2022 outlook slightly, in part because of suspended operations in Russia. Organic sales should now fall by between 3% and 6% rather than rising by as much as 3%. Non-GAAP earnings is now expected to land between $3.90 and $4.11 per share, down from the prior forecast range of $4.20 to $4.40 per share.
That reduction caught some investors by surprise, and so the stock fell in the wake of the announcement. I wouldn't expect shares to start beating the market again until eBay can show that its buyer pool and sales volume trends are no longer weakening.

2022-05-11 00:00:00+00:00,Why PayPal Stock Is Poised to Double by the End of Next Year,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-paypal-stock-is-poised-to-double-by-the-end-of-next-year,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Investors clearly expect PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) to struggle a great deal going forward, as PYPL stock has tumbled nearly 60% so far this year. Yet it appears that investors are largely overlooking the company’s strong growth, high profits, positive catalysts, and relatively low valuation.
Indeed, I believe that the market is now undervaluing the shares to such a great extent that they can easily double in value by the end of next year.
Strong Growth and High Profits
PayPal’s total payments volume jumped 13% year-over-year (YOY) in the first quarter, while its revenue, excluding eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) contribution, climbed 15% YOY. Further the number of transactions carried out on the app soared 18% YOY, and it added a net total of 2.4 million new accounts, increasing its account total by 9% YOY.
For all of 2022, despite slightly cutting its guidance and indicating that its outlook is conservative, PayPal expects its earnings per share to come in at $3.81 – $3.93. What’s more, the payments giant is predicting that it will generate impressive free cash flow of over $5 billion for the year.
Positive Catalysts
PayPal has a few strong, positive catalysts. As I wrote in a previous column, although consumers are currently spending less of their money on e-commerce, I expect that trend to reverse over the longer term. That’s because I believe that “after they have  had their fill of going on vacations, eating at restaurants, and shopping at brick-and-mortar stores,” which they were unable to do over much of the past two years, they will resume spending a higher percentage of their money on e-commerce. And as a digital-payments platform, PayPal will be very well-positioned to benefit from that trend.
7 of the Most Undervalued Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy Now
Indeed, the company will be able to capitalize on increases in e-commerce spending much more than ever before, thanks to its upcoming integration with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
On the macro front, inflation has hurt PayPal, the company’s CEO, Daniel Schulman, said on the company’s Q1earnings conference callheld on April 27. With many, and likely most, experts saying that inflation has peaked in the U.S., lower inflation should help boost PayPal’s results going forward.
How PYPL Stock Can Double
I believe that analysts are likely undervaluing the impact of the upcoming integration with Amazon on PayPal, as the deal is likely to be a huge game-changer for PYPL stock. Meanwhile, as I’ve written in previous columns, I think that the market is overly concerned about the possibility of a ruinous recession.
Therefore, I expect PayPal’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS)to come in close to the highest estimate provided by the analysts covering the stock. The most bullish analyst predicts that the company’s EPS will come in at $6.19. I’ll go with a 2023 EPS estimate of $6. And I believe that PYPL stock, given PayPal’s strong growth and high profitability, should get a premium price-earnings (P/E) multiple of 25 times. That combination would put the stock at $150 by the end of next year, versus its current level of around $75.
Given PayPal’s rapid growth, high profitability, positive catalysts, and potential to double by the end of 2023, long-term investors should buy PYPL stock.

2022-05-10 00:00:00+00:00,Revenue Growth Is Slowing for These Pandemic Winners,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/revenue-growth-is-slowing-for-these-pandemic-winners,,,"The coronavirus pandemic forced consumer behavior to evolve rapidly. Government-mandated closures of non-essential businesses, remote working, and remote learning were all major changes to how society did things.
The unprecedented changes created winners and losers among businesses. Those with a robust digital offering experienced surging customer and revenue growth. Among the winners were Chegg (NYSE: CHGG), Skillz (NYSE: SKLZ), and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY). As economies are reopening, consumer behavior is changing again, and the aforementioned are experiencing slowing revenue growth.
Image source: Getty Images.
Chegg
Chegg is an education technology company that serves mostly college students. At the pandemic's onset, students were sent home for remote learning. Away from valuable on-campus resources, students look to Chegg for help with their college curriculum. As a result, revenue growth surged by over 50% for several quarters.
CHGG Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts.
Interestingly, Chegg's services are helpful for students, regardless of whether they are taking online or in-person courses. Still, when campuses started bringing students back to classrooms, revenue growth slowed significantly, culminating in an increase of just 2% in its most recent quarter, which ended March 31.
Skillz
Skillz is a unique gaming company. It allows players the opportunity to wager real money on the games played on its platform. Unsurprisingly, when billions of folks were cooped up at home during lockdowns, demand for in-home entertainment surged, and Skillz was a beneficiary.
SKLZ Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts.
However, with billions of doses of an effective vaccine administered worldwide, business restrictions have been removed in most parts of the world, and demand for in-home entertainment has declined. Skillz has found it harder to grow revenue despite aggressively investing in marketing. In its most recent quarter, which ended March 31, revenue grew by just 12%, far slower than the rates shown in the chart above.
eBay
eBay needs no introduction. The popular auction and e-commerce site thrived as folks looked to avoid shopping in person. In its quarter that ended in March of 2021, revenue exploded by 42%, surpassing $3 billion in a quarter for the first time in years.
Like the others mentioned earlier, eBays' revenue slowed as economies reopened and consumer behavior resembled closer to pre-pandemic habits. In its most recent quarter, which ended March 31, eBay's revenue decreased by 6%.
A final word
Of course, these businesses did not expect the pandemic-infused surging revenue to sustain long term. That said, it appears as though investors were caught off-guard by the slowdown. Each of these three stocks has experienced considerable decreases over the last year. Admittedly, there are other factors at play here, including the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy. But economic reopening is certainly partly to blame.
EBAY data by YCharts.
Investors should keep an eye on these businesses and how changing consumer behavior affects them over the next several quarters. The key question to keep in mind as you observe this is whether they are emerging from the pandemic stronger than they entered. If so, the sell-off could be an opportunity.

Aterian’s (ATER) history of underperforming sets up a potential short squeeze. 
Its high volatility exacerbates the potential for downward movement.
High growth has led to accolades, bolstering its investment case.

There are a lot of reasons to believe Aterian (NASDAQ:ATER) stock is strictly one to avoid at the moment. That said, let’s find the hope in ATER stock despite the overall environment.
One of the foremost reasons it is considered risky is that it is a stereotypical growth company. 2022 is a year that hasn’t been kind to growth stocks owing to the massive inflation we are currently experiencing. The higher inflation rises, the more likely the Federal Reserve is to increase interest rates.
Historically, when that happens, growth stocks decline. That’s true because growth stocks like Aterian typically have strong top-line growth but also widening losses. Investors become less willing to direct their capital towards such companies as monetary policy becomes tighter as it did on May 4. The tighter monetary policy becomes the harder it is for growth companies to access the capital required for growth because their losses become less acceptable.
ATER Aterian $3.55
A Perfect Growth Play 
Aterian is a perfect example of one such company. In 2021, its revenues increased to above $247 million from $185 million a year earlier. But its net losses of $63 million dollars in 2020 ballooned to nearly $235 million by the end of 2021. 
So, it is a perfect growth play which suggests that it should be avoided presently. But it may have the ability to surprise. And that opens up the possibility for retail investors to make money off of Aterian by playing its short squeeze potential.
4 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for May 2022
For that to happen traders have to bet that the stock will move downward and the stock then moves upward. That could happen when the company releases earnings. Currently less than 20% of the company’s float is shorted.  That’s right near the traditional cut-off where short squeezes typically occur.
All that has to happen is for the company to surprise the market. 
Aterian’s Surprise Potential 
The company has already shown that it can do exactly that. Last quarter, the company was expected to produce earnings per share (EPS) figures of -27 cents per share. It surprised the market, producing an EPS of -11 cents. 
So, if the company does that again this quarter then a short squeeze could ensue. Prices would rise on the EPS beat and that 20% of the float betting against the company might then have to cover their position which could trigger a short squeeze.
And even if the company doesn’t provide an EPS surprise this quarter there could be other news that triggers a sharp upward price spike. Yes, this is somewhat of a perfect storm scenario but the company and its stock are highly volatile. In market terms that’s called beta.
And according to Yahoo Finance, Aterian is a very volatile company based on its beta of 2.7. A beta of 2.7 means that the stock has the potential to move upward or downward 170% quicker than an average stock. That’s another indicator that the stock has the potential for a short squeeze to occur.
Cautious Optimism and What to Do With ATER Stock
Am I saying that retail investors should go out and bet the farm short squeeze in Aterian? No. But I think retail investors are looking for reasons to find optimism and beaten-down growth stocks like this one. In that short squeeze potential is one such reason for optimism.
That said, it’s important to understand what the company does and some of the accolades that it is recently received. The company builds and acquires e-commerce brands end cells those branded products on e-commerce sites such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) among others. 
It’s no secret that supply chains are snarled all around the world. That doesn’t bode well for the company in getting its products to customers easily. However, Aterian recently received recognition for its growth over the last few years. That at least suggests it is a strong performer.
ATER stock is going to remain a short squeeze play and buying now could yield quick gains. Exercise cautious optimism and proceed accordingly.

This video was recorded on May 6, 2022.
Chris Hill: [MUSIC] E-commerce, semiconductors, real estate, fintech, medtech, and a lot more. If you are an investor, there's no time like the present. Motley Fool Money starts now. [MUSIC]
MALE_1: Everybody needs money. That's why they call it money.
MALE-2:[MUSIC] From Fool global headquarters, this is Motley Fool Money.
Chris Hill: It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Chris Hill, and I am joined by Motley Fool Senior Analyst Jason Moser and Ron Gross. Good to see you, as always, gentlemen.
Ron Gross: Hey, how are you doing Chris?
Chris Hill: We've got the latest headlines from Wall Street, Malcolm Ethridge from the Tech Money Podcast is our guest. As always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar, but we begin with the big macro. The US economy added 428,000 jobs in April, making it the 12th consecutive month of adding at least 400,000 jobs. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by a half percent after the rally on Wall Street late Wednesday afternoon. The market promptly tanked on Thursday with the Nasdaq falling five percent. So, Ron, busy week between economic data and the markets. Where do you want to begin?
Ron Gross: Chris, would it help if I said Uncle?
Chris Hill: Yes.
Ron Gross: Because this is no fun at all. Tough times out there for sure. As you mentioned, we did get another strong jobs report, but that, by no means, tells us the whole story. Unemployment does remain low at 3.6 percent, but wages aren't keeping up with that very high inflation rate. As you mentioned, we did have this week's 50 basis-point interest rates hike from the Fed, with definitely more to come in an attempt to fight that inflation. Interestingly, we actually saw GDP decline in the first quarter, with some actually predicting a recession on the horizon, and as in all investors are seeing, we have individual companies digesting lots of stuff. All the things that came as a result of COVID, certain demand for certain products that are now coming back down to Earth, supply chain disruptions, China cautiously returning to work after being on lockdown. We obviously have high inflation, removal of stimulus, higher interest rates, devastation in Ukraine. Thursday, as you said, the market just really tanked. I thought maybe we were on the upswing, but I think, despite all of this, you have to stay invested. You have to keep investing. I guess that's my overall message and advice. Stay in the market. Keep putting money into the market.
Chris Hill: Jason, we come out of April with the Nasdaq year-to-date being down more than at any point this century to start the year. So that makes a day, like Thursday, a little bit more shocking with investors looking around saying, ""Wait, I thought we were at the bottom."" As Ron said, this is one of those times that we all just got to get through, if we want the benefits of long-term investing.
Jason Moser: You're absolutely right I think you put that well. It's a period of time that you need to get through. I said, I think earlier on the week, it's been a tough year for investors so far. If you've made it this far, and you haven't been scared away yet, congratulations. Pat yourself from the back. Be prepared for the next shoe to drop. It's less about predicting the future, and let's focus more preparing for it. Let's admit that there are still some valuations out there that are lofty, that are still out there.
You still see some of these businesses out there that are trading for 15-20 times sales. You can't dismiss that, particularly when you consider the fact that the economic conditions have now changed significantly. We're in a much different time, and so you got to think about that going forward. What's going to be the acceptable valuation that's a bit out of the norm here going forward. So that is a little bit of a trick, trying to come up with that answer, but regardless, being able to stay in, it's a difficult thing to do. But the more you do it, the easier it gets. Chris, as we always say, if you keep money that you need in the near-term out of the market, that allows you to focus on the long term, and history shows us that, in the long term, we should all be just fine.
Chris Hill: It was a rough week for e-commerce stocks, shares of Etsy, eBay, Poshmark, Shopify, and Wayfair, all got hit due to a similar theme, namely, that consumers are pulling back on their spending. Jason, some of those, like Shopify and eBay, also lowered their guidance. Do you see any bright spots in the near-term for this group, or do shareholders of these companies just need to pack a lunch?
Jason Moser: No, I feel like they're bright spots, much as if when you're hungover, you see the bright spot that eventually you won't be hungover. But right now, we're in the middle of a hangover, Chris. We're in the middle of this hangover. We're seeing the after effects of all of the success that we pulled forward over the past couple of years. We've been having that discussion for the past couple of years. A lot of valuations got really out of control and seemed a bit pie in the sky because of the situation, and so we're dealing with the after effects of this. It's being compounded by everything else that's going on the world right now.
With that said, I do think it's a reasonable take that, while the pendulum swung too far to the glass half-full side over the past couple of years for a lot of these businesses, it is starting to feel like it's swinging too far to the glass half-empty side. Now, I'm not calling a bottom, but just when you look at the way these businesses are performing, Wayfair, Etsy, Shopify, sure, numbers are down from the past year, but we also know that these management teams were forecasting that to happen. It's not a secret, but when you look at the fundamentals of the actual businesses, they do continue to perform well. We talked about repeat customers with Wayfair being such an important metric. They placed 77.7 percent of total orders here in this most recent quarter versus 74.5 percent in the first quarter a year ago.
You look at Etsy, and sure, you're seeing modest declines in gross merchandise sales. But ad strength is helping them maintain a take rate. Take rate at 17.8 percent was up 17.5 percent from a year ago. Then you look at Shopify. They grew sales 22 percent from the same a year ago, and that's a slowdown. You're talking about these businesses being a little bit more conservative on their guidance going forward as things start to normalize. That makes a lot of sense. We can't hold that against these businesses. So I encourage investors to try to separate the macro from the actual fundamentals of some of these businesses because when you look at these three businesses together, Wayfair, Etsy, and Shopify, for example, good examples of businesses that seem to be doing pretty well, they're doing what management says they're going to do. They're just dealing with a very difficult economic climate right now. It's a lot of these dollars that people were hoarding, and saving, and then spending via e-commerce of these past couple of years. Those dollars now being rediverted to things like travel and entertainment, and that's to be expected.
Chris Hill: Speaking of travel, Booking Holdings and Marriott both out with first quarter reports this week. They also feature this similar theme: a growing demand for leisure travel. Both stocks were flat for the week, but Ron, Marriott and Booking Holdings, these are two of the leaders in this industry.
Ron Gross: Flat for the week. This week is not too shabby. It's pretty good actually. People are replacing online shopping with getting out there and traveling again, and I think that's the story. You can see it in the results. Marriott, for example, solid quarter, beat results, reinstated its dividends, which is a really positive indication for that business, and maybe even the whole industry. Revenue up 81 percent, boom, big number obviously, adjusted profit increased 12 times to 413 million, about. Management didn't offer guidance, but it said it sees a blockbuster summer, so there's some indication for you there. Booking Holdings, very similar story. Stock remains down about 12 percent on the year, but the results are really turning around. Revenue up 136 percent. Similar comments to Marriott. Management said it is preparing for a busy summer travel season ahead, adjusted net income of 160 million. Booking Holdings only trading at 21 times earnings. So that looks interesting to me.
Chris Hill: If there's a chip shortage in the world, someone forgot to tell AMD. First quarter revenue rose more than 70 percent due in part to growth in AMD's high-end server chip business, and the stock, up 12 percent this week, Jason.
Jason Moser: I have said it before. I think, on its own, there are plenty of reasons to like AMD over the coming years. We've looked at this move toward connectivity, and we've got Edge, Cloud, data center opportunities, entertainment opportunities either. These are all drivers that are helping AMD continue to branch out, so they continue to benefit from a lot of these long-term tailwinds. You look at the results for the quarter, they speak for themselves. For first quarter revenue, it grew 71 percent to a record $5.9 billion. But if you back out the Xilinx acquisition, organic revenue was still up 55 percent. They grew gross margins, seven percentage points to 53 percent, and that is in part, thanks to a higher-margin Xilinx business, and that all brought down to the bottom line their earnings-per-share of a $1.13 versus 52 cents from a year ago.
So the two main segments of the business, computing and graphics, saw tremendous performance. Their revenue grew 33 percent from a year ago. The enterprise embedded in semi-custom segment revenue grew 88 percent from a year ago. Some of that was driven by very strong performance in things like Xbox and PlayStation, as a console refresh really took hold, and AMD plays a big role there. You see the Xilinx acquisition is integrating nicely. They announced they are also going to be acquiring another company for about $2 billion called PINsando or Pensando, whichever way you put it. But that's going to give them more exposure to the data center opportunity, which then again speaks to the multiple tailwinds that I think will help drive AMD higher in the coming quarters.
Chris Hill: After the break, we've got the latest on real estate, fintech and more, so stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Chris Hill: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here with Jason Moser and Ron Gross. Zillow's first quarter revenue came in higher than expected, but costs are rising for the online real estate marketplace. Shares of Zillow down more than 10 percent on Friday and hitting a new 52-week low, Ron.
Ron Gross: Weakness in the business and the stock continues, as management attempts to put the house buying and flipping debacle behind them. They are attempting to paint a rosy picture with comments, like well-positioned and prepared to forge ahead. Okey-doke. [laughs] These financials, admittedly, are a little bit hard to decipher because that iBuying business is still flowing through the income statement, but it won't continue going forward. So I think it's best to ignore it from an analytical perspective and just focus on that advertising and marketing business, which is their legacy business.
It's their IMT division that was up about 10 percent, so that's not too bad, but it's not that big a business. It's a $490 million revenue business, but it was up 10 percent. The IMT segment had a $108 million profit. That was actually down 24 percent from last year. To get a picture of Zillow, that's the segment you need to focus on. They do have a billion dollar-share repurchase program in place. This is important. Management has 2025 target of five billion in consolidated revenue and 45 percent EBITDA margins. That would give them $2.25 million of EBITDA in 2025, which would have them trading today at a pretty cheap four times 2025 EBITDA estimates. Do not believe it, folks. [laughs] No way is that going to happen.
Chris Hill: Block, the fintech company formerly known as Square, out with first quarter results that were lower than Wall Street was expecting. But the company said its Cash App business is going well. Jason, what stands out to you when you look at Block?
Jason Moser: How do I follow up doubting Ron there. That was terrific. Block, it was a good quarter. One great, one bad. It was good quarter. They did total net revenue of $3.96 billion. That was down 22 percent from a year ago, but most of that was driven really by the decrease in Bitcoin revenue. If you exclude bitcoin, total net revenue was actually up 44 percent from a year ago, so not bad, gross profit of $1.3 billion, That was up 34 percent from a year ago. If you look at the drivers, their Cash App generating $624 million. That was up 26 percent. Square, generating $661 million. That was up 41 percent a year ago.
You exclude the Afterpay acquisition, those numbers come down a little bit, but regardless, the core business performing very well, transaction-based revenue, $1.23 billion for the quarter. That was up 28 percent. Then gross profit there was $514 million. That was up 19 percent from a year ago. They processed $43.5 billion in gross payment volume. That was up 31 percent from a year ago. So I think this is a business that continues to perform very well. I do think it's worth noting. This is not to say it's a good thing or a bad thing, but it's a bit of a Bitcoin-centric story developing here for sure. So investors just want to be aware of that. Some people feel very strongly about crypto and Bitcoin one way or the other. Just to quantify that, the word Bitcoin was mentioned 81 times in the shareholder letter this quarter. You go back three years, it was just 17. Again, not saying that's good or bad, just trying to understand the direction this business is headed because it is becoming a much more diversified business than what we saw come public several years ago.
Chris Hill: Under Armour started its fiscal year not with a bang, but a whimper. Weak first quarter results came, with the company warning of more supply chain problems in China. On Friday, shares of Under Armour hit their lowest point, Ron, in over a decade.
Ron Gross: Not good, had some decent momentum during the COVID years. But they've basically given all that back, at least in terms of the stock price. Weak quarter, weak guidance, slam in the stock, this quarter largely impacted by reduced demand, supply chain disruptions as COVID caused China and some other areas to basically shutdown 14 percent decline in revenue from their Asia-Pacific region that generate above 15 percent of revenue from that region. Also, shipping delays and labor shortages hurt their ability to get products to [inaudible] stores, forcing them to cancel orders. Overall revenue only up three percent. Adjusted operating income was only 11 million. They reported a net loss of three million. Profit guidance was way below expectations, trading it only 15 times guidance. That's interesting. If they can get some traction, and you want to take a nibble, OK. I honestly have no clarity to see how that would turn out, though. So buyer, beware.
Jason Moser: It's trading at 15 times guidance? It's at an 11-year low. Shouldn't it be trading at like, I don't know, one-times guidance? [laughs]
Ron Gross: [inaudible]
Jason Moser: Under Armour, more like underperformer. Am I right? [laughs]
Chris Hill: Starbucks is suspending guidance for the rest of the fiscal year due to uncertainty in China. But same-store sales in the US rose 12 percent in the first quarter. Shares of Starbucks up a bit this week, Jason, and this new CEO, Howard Schultz, really seems to be off to a good start.
Jason Moser: I tell you, he's an up-and-comer. [laughs] It's funny you see the one thing that really stood out to me in the call is that Schultz seems like he's pumped to be back. You'll love to see the enthusiasm like that from a guy who really has been around the block now a couple of times already. But I think this is a watershed moment for Starbucks here, as it works to really fully adapt to this new hybrid economy. Things have become more digital, more convenient. You can hear a lot of talk in the call about Starbucks becoming this new digital third-place, so to talk of Web 3.0, and NFTs, you even saw on the call there, which is just interesting for a coffee company. But the business itself, I think, really performed very well, given the situation, revenue up 15 percent to $7.6 billion, and earnings-per-share of 59 cents was down just slightly.
Domestically, they saw a good performance. Internationally, they saw a little bit weaker performance, if you look at the five percent growth in transactions, seven percent ticket growth in North America. They're seeing a lot of strong receptions to things like mobile order, pay in advance, drive-through. That's driving a tremendous amount of volume. They are feeling the pinch from the global supply chain issues, no doubt there. I think that going forward, Howard Schultz has a few things on his plate that he needs to knock out, one being leadership. He's not going to be there forever. The idea is to be able to hand this off in 2023, but really making the investments in the workplace and the workforce. We're seeing a lot of headlines regarding unionization.
That's something they are trying to stanch understandably. So they feel like they can make better, more bold investments in their workforce and workplace without the unions. Then China. China is a total black box at this point, revenue there declined 14 percent, sales comps declined 20 percent from the same quarter a year ago, and that forced them to just pull back on guidance because they just don't have the clarity there. But it really does feel like there's a lot of enthusiasm. But behind what Schultz has in play here. So I'm excited to see how Starbucks works out here.
Ron Gross: I felt like Schultz is throwing Kevin Johnson under the bus a little bit. I am on record as being a big fan of Kevin Johnson. If I was wrong, so be it. But I still to this day remain a fan.
Chris Hill: Ron Gross, Jason Moser, guys, we will see you later in the show. Up next, our guest, Malcolm Ethridge weighs in on the Fed commercial real estate and more. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money. [MUSIC] Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Chris Hill. Malcolm Ethridge is a Certified Financial Planner and Executive with CIC Wealth. He is also the host of The Tech Money Podcast, and he joins me now. Malcolm, thanks for being here.
Malcom Ethridge: Thanks for having me. I'm glad to be back.
Chris Hill: It was a brutal April. It was the worst April for the Nasdaq this century. Thursday of this week, more red, especially in the Nasdaq. We'll get into the specifics in a minute. But when you look at the stock market RETE large, what stands out to you?
Malcom Ethridge: As you talk about the brutality of the sell-off, the carnage, in the Nasdaq, the thing that's most surprising to me is how we're getting this wholesale sell-off of quality tech names. We're not talking about going dumpster diving into the 2Q2 and even the ARK Innovation ETF and getting scrabs here. We're talking about companies, like Microsoft, and AMD, and NVIDIA, Apple. They have no business getting sold off into the double-digits the way that they have. But they are just a victim of being connected to the rest of the Nasdaq and the greater tech world, as it were.
Chris Hill: What do you attribute that to? Part of it, obviously, is the last dozen or so years have been for the most part, a bull market. Is that what's driving quality companies getting sold off? People just saying, ""Look, I've had a good run for 10 years or so, and I'm going to take some money off the table,"" so to speak.
Malcom Ethridge: A lot of it is indexing. Most of us own some fund, whether it's in ETF or mutual fund, that has a mandate to it that says, if this, then that. So if the market falls two percent, then sell this much of that, and as the market continues to fall another two percent, sell this much more of that. So we keep seeing these electronic or technological AI-driven triggers down into the market because so much is computer-driven now and not so much driven by fundamentals, or even really technicals, more than just ""I'm now looking for asset preservation."" So if Google, for example is a major holding in my portfolio, and it falls more than two percent on any given day, sell half of it, or sell 25 percent of it, or sell 10 percent of it, or whatever it is. I think that algorithmic trading is what's driving things to fall so quickly and so sharply across the board rather than being very particular about what companies get thrown out.
Chris Hill: Almost like clockwork. You can count on this narrative when, particularly, not the stocks that we were just talking about, Microsoft, Apple, etc., but younger tech companies, unprofitable software companies, that sort of thing. You can count on people on financial television talking about the, ""flight to quality"". Now is the time to move to the blue chips, the Johnson & Johnson, that sort of thing. You were on CNBC earlier this week. You recently said that we're now in a stock pickers market. So where should people be looking?
Malcom Ethridge: I am with you in the sense that there are a lot of companies in the market right now that have no business being in the market. There are a lot of companies that came public in 2020 and 2021 because the SPAC money was there and helped them do it. It made sense for them at the time, and now we're seeing that they're starting to reverse course. A lot of them, I am certain, because we've seen this movie play out before circa 1999, 2000. We're starting to see conversation where more than just Twitter is a big public tech company that's going to go back private by some PE money. I think that that's part of it. But then also as you talk about the ""flight to quality"" and folks wanting to be in the blue chip names.
That means then that there probably is where they should have been in the first place. If I am a person who get spooked by the Nasdaq being down 25 or so percent year-to-date, and I consider myself to be a long-term investor, and I am still looking for the trade button, on the day that I notice my portfolio has dropped significantly, that means I probably had no business in some of those names I was in, anyway, and I let somebody talk me into them, or I talked myself into following a crowd I wasn't really a part of. You should've been in those quality names all along. But then you also have the folks who are in even the blue chip dividend payers, the stalwarts as they were, the Warren Buffett stocks, that the market is down for those two.
I mentioned it's a wholesale sell-off. Everything is getting whacked right now. The folks who are in those bigger blue chip names are even feeling some heartburn in trying to decide should I stay or should I go. You didn't ask me this, but I think what's probably holding the market up, even where it is right now, is just the fact that there is no better place to be. We talk about the fact that the stock market is working against us, but the bond market isn't really all that great right now either. So there is no ""flight to safety"". Flight to quality, sure, I can go find better tech names than some of the things at the bottom of the Nasdaq. But there's no ""flight to safety"" necessarily other than cash, and with inflation roaring above eight percent, even cash is trash. Still the stock market is showing itself as like the least dirty sock in the hamper, and if I got to be somewhere, I might as well, at least, be in the place that is going to pay some dividends, and at some point we imagine we'll reverse course.
Chris Hill: Thank you for the image of the hamper. Let me go back to the SPAC companies that you referenced from the last couple of years because a lot of people are looking at how far the Nasdaq, in particular, has fallen this year. A lot of people are looking around tech, ""Are we at the bottom yet? I'm not asking you to call the bottom, but do you think we get closer to the bottom when those companies, some of whom, as you said, had no business being public in the first place, start to just cash in their chips and say, ""We're not doing this anymore, and we'd like to find a way to exit the public markets.""
Malcom Ethridge: I think two things will happen. One, this is a great time to be in the private equity space, especially if you're a firm who focuses on tech companies because there will be quite a few who are having backroom, back channel conversations about what will it take to take us private, especially those that are founder-led companies, where the CEO was the one who convinced everybody in the first place via S1 and everything else, this is the company to park your chips. For those founder CEOs, who their board is now starting to turn against them and say now what, their saving grace is going to be finding a PE shop that's willing to take them back private, and allow them to catch their breath for a couple of years, and then probably come back and do it again.
But separately from that, I think what we'll also see is a few companies doing the opposite, which is coming public now, still into a terrible market, at a down round. Companies that are VC-backed right now, where their early investors and their VCs are saying, I don't even care if I don't see that 10x, 20x return I was promised once upon a time out of this company anymore. I just need to get something because the day of reckoning is here. They're going to force those companies to come public, even at a down-round, like I said, and that's going to be another thing to look at to say, if this activity is happening, we can be almost as certain as certain can be in the stock market that this is where scraping the bottom looks like. I don't think we're quite there yet, but I have started to read through certain outlets that those conversations have been had in the background.
Chris Hill: We've talked about the market. You mentioned inflation. When you have conversations with your clients, what are the types of things that you're hearing from them? Are there any common themes from what you're hearing?
Malcom Ethridge: For the most part, clients just want to know. ""You've told me how bad it is. You told me where the bad is. Now, where do we look? Where do you see positives in the market?"" As financial planners or asset managers, one of the things that clients are always looking to us for is the better idea, like where do we go now? One of the places that we are pretty overweight and pretty bullish about is commercial real estate, and specifically in the industrial space, and even more specifically distribution centers. Distribution centers are popping up everywhere. I don't even live in the suburbs, I live in the city, and distribution centers are being built less than 20 miles from my house. That's the place where landlords have pricing power. They have the ability to raise rents at a moment's notice almost to keep up with their inflation, and also, the supply chain is still broken. All of the disruptions to air, ground, and sea freight have basically been a tailwind for any company that has distribution centers and industrial RETEs in its portfolio, and so that's a place that we've turned our gaze on behalf of those clients that are like, ""Tell me where we go from here, if you just told me I can't buy Apple and expect that to be the lottery ticket that's going to do it this year"".
Chris Hill: You mentioned the supply chain issues. You add that to inflation. We haven't even touched on the rolling lockdowns in China and how that's affecting global companies as well. When you think about the next few months, even to the end of this year, what are you going to be watching to give you a sense of both the economy and the stock market?
Malcom Ethridge: The main thing for me is going to be what the Fed actually manages to do with this interest rate hike equation that it's trying to solve. If you think about a car going down the highway 20 miles over the speed limit, and all of a sudden, in a distance, you see a police car sticking out. You've got to make this calculus of do I slam on the brakes completely? No, because the car behind me is going to run into the back of me.
Do I keep going as fast as I am? No, because then I'm going to get that ticket. How do I hit the gas just subtly enough that it brings me in under the speed limit before I get to the cop and the radar gun. Not that you'd know anything about this, Chris, but I happen to have a heavy foot. [laughs] I think that's the calculus that the Fed is having to make. How do I land this thing smoothly without causing the bad chain reaction by misslamming on the brakes. Unfortunately, I'm not convinced that they can. I think we let the party go on so long, and the market was appeasing for so long, that we're probably be on the point where they could just climb back down the other side of the mountain carefully.
Now, we're really just, in my opinion, at a point where we've got to say, ""Let's just rip the Band-Aid off, have the pain in the short-term that we know we're going to have, and then get beyond there as quickly as possible"". You're a runner, so I know you'll know this analogy I'll throw at you because you know I love analogies. It's like where I hear sports doctors talk about the plantar fascia injury, where you can keep on running on it and letting it tear slowly until one day it finally pops, or you can just come in here, let us snip that bad boy, it will heal itself backup pretty smoothly, it happens all the time, and you'll get right back to running, like you were in a few weeks time. That's where we are. It's like we're trying to continue to limp along on a bad foot, instead of having the surgery, going through the pain, and getting back on the right side or right sooner than later. We'll see if they do successfully land this thing, through these incremental cuts that they are trying to do. I'm just not as convinced as Jerome Powell and his crew that they will be able to successfully do this, especially not after they gave us transitory for a year and then took it back.
Chris Hill: The last thing before I let you go. Earlier in the year on your podcast, you had an episode called ""Ten Financial Commandments"". You teased a book that you were working on. I'm just wondering if you can share a little bit more about that and possibly provide an update.
Malcolm Ethridge: It's basically a book that I'm finishing up right now. I'm probably guilty of over editing at this point. It could and should have been out already, but it will be out before this year is over. But what it is is essentially 10 of the things I find myself saying to people most commonly. By people, I mean, high earning young professionals, who are trying to get started and figure out where do I go? Basically, my peers who call me and ask for advice on what do I do here? One of the core tenants in the book, for example is, don't invest in things you don't actually understand. So that's pretty apropos for where we are today. It's something I've been saying to them, even through 2020 and 2021, where gain [inaudible] was the thing, and all of a sudden, now it's not. So my focus was only invest in things you can actually understand and if you could explain it to a 10-year old, they would understand it. So the book is basically that. It's me expounding on some of the core things that I find myself talking about all of the time to people to the point where I said, I should probably share this a little more broadly, and not just in my iMessage group chats, and in Slack, and those things.
Chris Hill: You can find the Tech Tonic podcasts wherever you get your podcasts. Malcolm Ethridge, thanks so much for being here.
Malcolm Ethridge: Thanks for having me.
Chris Hill: Doubling up after the break, [MUSIC] Jason Moser and Ron Gross return. They got a couple of stocks on their radar, so stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. [MUSIC]
As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here, once again, with Jason Moser and Ron Gross. Guys, who among us has not, once in his or her life, accidentally poured orange juice on our breakfast cereal? The innovators at Tropicana are trying to help with Tropicana Crunch, a honey almond cereal designed specifically to pair with orange juice, not milk. The company gave away boxes as a promotion on social media. Ron, I don't know, do we give them points for trying here?
Ron Gross: They did it for National Orange Juice Day, which you knew was the thing. It's clever-ish, but I just want to say the idea of maybe getting the extra pulp orange juice and pouring that on, it could literally make me gag, so stick with the no pulp orange juice if you're going to go anywhere near this cereal.
Chris Hill: Jason, can I interest you in this cereal or no?
Jason Moser: No. [laughs] I'm good. Not the biggest orange juice guy. I'll give them points for trying, but I do want to, at least, hark them back. Of course, I'm dating myself here, but some will remember back in the days of yore, the Wheaties commercials, I think at the time it was Bruce Jenner pouring orange juice over his Wheaties in the commercial. That led me to try that once, Chris, and I emphasize, once.
Chris Hill: Let's go to our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd. Dan, before we get to Radar Stocks, any thoughts here?
Dan Boyd: I've read that article that you sent about this, and I do want to say that they're hedging their bets big time [laughs] with this orange juice cereal. Multiple times in the article, they talked about how it's an unforgettable breakfast experience and things [laughs] of that nature without saying, ""This will taste good,"" because even Tropicana knows that no, it will not.
Chris Hill: [laughs] It will be unforgettable. Let's get to the stocks on our radar. Jason Moser, you're up first. What are you looking at this rate?
Jason Moser: I know you'd think I made this company up, but I swear to you I didn't. Outset Medical, the ticker is OM. Everybody I think here has heard at least of dialysis. Outset Medical is in the market of dialysis, and specifically, their Tablo Hemodialysis System, which ultimately is to simplify the process and help make it more accessible. They've got dialysis systems for the home, as well as acute care in hospital settings. But the company just recently announced earnings, and they continue to perform very well. Grew revenue 33 percent, they now project revenue for the full year between 144 and 150 million dollars. That would represent a 43 percent growth at the midpoint there. They are growing that in-home presence, which I think is really important as we move more toward healthcare in the home and virtual healthcare, remote healthcare. They also just announced recently a new source for cartridge production. They had that razor and blade model that will help bring the cost down while helping to inflate those margins. Dan, question about Outset Medical.
Dan Boyd: I'm looking at the stock price here, Jason, and the recent good news for Outset Medical does not seem to be reflected in how the stock is performing.
Jason Moser: Dan, it seems like recent good news for any company is not being reflected in their stock price these days. But you raise a good point. This is a very young company that is still working its way toward gaining market share and profitability. I suspect we'll see a good bit of volatility along the way.
Chris Hill: Ron Gross, we got one minute left. What's on your radar?
Ron Gross: Domino's, DPZ, a long time favorite of mine, but they only recently bought it back in January because it was down 22 percent from its high. Guess what, it's down another 22 percent from that price. But I'm still a believer. I think it's a very well-run company. They're just going through some changes here as a result of COVID waning. They're going to lean on carryout more. They're expanding driver hours using call centers, possibly partnering with third-party delivery apps. I hope that doesn't happen. Now, trading at 25 times, much more reasonable than the 40 times it was trading at for quite some time.
Chris Hill: Dan, question about Domino's?
Dan Boyd: Remember when Domino's did this national ad campaign talking about how their pizza isn't terrible anymore? [laughs] Guess what America, it's still terrible. They tricked you. It's salty cardboard and waxy cheese. It's bad. Go get local pizza.
Chris Hill: [MUSIC] Tell us how you really feel there. Safe to assume you're adding Outset Medical to your watch list.
Dan Boyd: You've got it in one, Chris. [Laughs]
Chris Hill: Jason Moser, Ron Gross, guys, thanks for being here.
Ron Gross: Thank you, guys.
Chris Hill: That's going to do for this week's show. Show's mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Chris Hill. We'll see you next time.

Shares of Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) were getting crushed today as the Southeast Asian video game and e-commerce company was one of many high-growth, unproiftable companies to spiral lower as investors move to safer stocks in preparation for a higher-interest environment.
As of 3:23 p.m. ET, the stock was down 16.6%.
Image source: Sea Limited.
So what
There was no company-specific news out on Sea Limited, but heavy selling last week in sectors like e-commerce carried over this week as investors continue to react to a round of weak earnings reports in e-commerce and other sectors that shined during the pandemic. The Fed's plans to raise interest rates by a half a percentage point also seem to be accelerating the rotation out of growth stocks.
Based in Southeast Asia, Sea Limited doesn't do much business in the U.S., but since it is listed on a U.S. exchange, it's still subject to the same market behavior as its peer stocks, and last week's earnings reports from e-commerce companies like Shopify, Wayfair, Etsy, and Ebay showed that growth had essentially ground to a halt in the e-commerce sector as the pandemic tailwinds fade.
Sea Limited wont reportfirst-quarter earnings until May 17.
Now what
Unlike most e-commerce companies, Sea Limited's business is anchored by the Garena digital video game brand, the maker of Free Fire, which is profitable. The company has used those profits to fund the expansion of its Shopee e-commerce business, and SeaMoney, its digital payments segment.
In its fourth-quarter earnings report, the company showed no signs of slowing down, with revenue up 105.7% to $3.2 billion. However, the company reported an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss of $492.1 million with a loss of nearly $1 billion in the e-commerce segment.
As the market has become wary of high-growth, money-losing companies like Sea Limited, it's not surprising to see the stock crashing. Keep an eye on its first-quarter results to see if management has begun to exercise more financial discipline in response to shifting market demands.

2022-05-09 00:00:00+00:00,FOCUS-Suncor CEO Little faces scrutiny after activist Elliott takes aim,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/focus-suncor-ceo-little-faces-scrutiny-after-activist-elliott-takes-aim-0,,,"By Nia Williams and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
May 8 (Reuters) - Three months ago Mark Little, the chief executive of Canadian oil and gas major Suncor Energy SU.TO, issued a mea culpa.
In January two trucks had crashed at an oil sands mine in northern Alberta, killing one person. This raised the number of on-the-job fatalities at Suncor since 2014 to 12, by far the worst safety record among its Canadian peers.
""I own this,"" Little told anearnings callin February.
Now those words are coming back to haunt him.
The accident in January was the latest in a string of operational incidents at Suncor sites, and came on top of investor dissatisfaction with a major dividend cut in 2020.
As Suncor shares lagged its peers, U.S. investment firm Elliott Management saw an opportunity and built a 3.4% stake. Last month the hedge fund said it would like to see a handful of new directors join the company's board, as well as management and strategic reviews.
Elliott, which is known for pushing companies to improve operations, is expected to meet privately with Suncor next week, sources said.
Elliott's move is bringing scrutiny over Little's performance as CEO, a role he took in 2019 after serving as chief operating officer since December 2017.
""My feeling is Bay Street isn't going to give (Suncor) the benefit of the doubt because it's been a few years of missteps,"" said Laura Lau, chief investment officer at Brompton Group, a Suncor shareholder.
""Will they (shareholders) give Mark Little time? I don't know. There are more questions about whether he is the right guy going forward,"" Lau said.
In its letter to Suncor, Elliott did not refer to Little by name but said the board must be responsible for having a management team in place that can deliver excellence in operating and safety performance.
Suncor, which reports quarterly earnings on Monday, did not respond to a request for comment.
PROFITABLE BUSINESS
Suncor is North America's most profitable refining and marketing company on a per barrel basis and one of Canada's leading fuel retailers. But it has repeatedly missed production guidance and failed to meet a 2018 promise to deliver up to C$2 billion ($1.6 billion) of free funds flow improvement by the end of 2023, instead pushing that target out to 2025.
Little, 57, rose through the ranks after joining Suncor in 2008 and previously worked for Imperial Oil IMO.TO and its majority owner Exxon Mobil XOM.N. Some Canadian energy industry executives said Suncor's recent operational issues stem from a push to automate operations as much as possible, which makes the company less nimble when things go wrong.
""He (Little) is well-liked, he's a bright, brilliant guy... but he's all about procedures,"" said one former Suncor employee who worked with Little.
The source declined to be named because he still consults in the industry.
Elliott, which invests $51.5 billion in assets, has pushed to remove top executives at companies including Twitter TWTR.N , Marathon Petroleum MPC.N and eBay EBAY.O. It launched 17 campaigns in 2021, and in the past year won 11 board seats and has a reputation for steering strategy from inside the boardroom.
Elliott declined to comment for this story.
Suncor's stock price underperformance can be traced back to the early days of the pandemic when, faced with collapsing crude prices, it halved its dividend even as rival Canadian Natural Resources Ltd CNQ.TO held payout steady.
The lagging share price allowed Canadian Natural to overtake Suncor as Canada's most valuable energy company in 2020.
Then came a string of mishaps at Suncor's oil sands and refining operations, including the revelation last July that a critical slope at its new Fort Hills mine, which started operating in 2018, was unstable and required fixing before production could be fully ramped up.
Despite the problems, Little earned 127% of his 2021 annual bonus opportunity after earning 74% of his bonus opportunity for 2020, company documents show. Elliott said in a public presentation that CEO compensation levels over the past few years suggest the board is ""not sufficiently holding management accountable for current performance.""
""If you look at investor feedback over the last two years there's been some frustration on the operations side, and these come down to a frustration with management,"" said Matt Murphy, an analyst with Tudor Pickering Holt in Calgary.

2022-05-08 00:00:00+00:00,2 Growth Stocks You Can Buy Right Now for Under $100,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-growth-stocks-you-can-buy-right-now-for-under-%24100,,,"Consumer sentiment has reached decade-low numbers, owing to 40-year-high inflation levels and lingering concerns surrounding the war between Russia and Ukraine. Following the brief collapse of stock prices at the start of the pandemic, U.S. equities proceeded to go on a massive bull run. From April 1, 2020, through Aug. 31, 2021, the S&P 500 gained a whopping 87%, with the technology sector leading the way.
Since late last year, which is when news of potential interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve first arose, technology stocks have been humbled, to say the least. Consequently, some of the world's most groundbreaking companies have witnessed their stock prices nosedive. The antagonistic view of growth stocks today should serve as a firm buying signal to acute investors.
With that in mind, let's discuss two growth stocks that you can buy right now for under $100 a share.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Teladoc Health
Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC), which trades at $35 a share at the time of this writing, is a leading provider of virtual healthcare services. The stock was performing poorly in advance of its latestearnings call and afterwards, shares of the telehealth commander went on to plummet another 50%. An unexpected net loss of $41.58 a share thanks to a $6.6 billion goodwill impairment charge and slashed full-year revenue guidance for 2022 were the core drivers of the decline.
Were the company's results that bad? I wouldn't say so. After all, first-quarter revenue grew 25% year over year to $565.4 million, and total visits climbed 35% to 4,510. Likewise, Teladoc continues to cash in on its 54.3 million paid U.S. members -- average revenue per member increased 21% year over year, equal to $2.52.
In the wake of management's new guidance, Wall Street analysts are forecasting the company will expand its top line by 20% in 2022. That doesn't necessarily justify a 50% drop, right? And when you pair its results with the company's $225 billion addressable market and measly price-to-sales multiple of 3, Teladoc appears to be an alluring investment opportunity today.
2. PayPal
PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is a mature fintech company with a robust runway for growth. Priced at $93 a share today, the stock has slid 60% over a six-month span. Now trading at just 30 times earnings, or a 62% discount to its historical average price-to-earnings multiple, shares of the fintech steamroller seem remarkably inexpensive.
PayPal delivered forward guidance at the end of 2021 that suggested it would face eBay-related growing pains during the upcoming year. If you aren't familiar with the situation, eBay is undergoing a transition to its own payment platform, which in turn will place up to $600 million of pressure on PayPal's top line in 2022.
What does this mean for the company moving forward? While eBay and high inflation may act as short-term barriers, the mobile payment enterprise is projected by analysts to generate $28.5 billion in sales in 2022, translating to 12% growth from a year ago. Earnings are expected to finish slightly below 2021 levels.
Investors shouldn't worry about PayPal, though -- the company reigns over 50% of the global payment processing software industry. Its elite market positioning, together with its sturdy balance sheet and swiftly improving cash flow generation, make the company a worthwhile investment at the moment.
What should you do now?
Both of these companies carry favorable risk/reward ratios today. As a pacesetter in the virtual healthcare arena, Teladoc is well positioned to sustain a solid market share down the road. And as the war on cash gains more traction, PayPal is sure to benefit from the paradigm shift to digital payments.
Both stocks are trading at a bargain by virtue of the ongoing sell-off, and as a result, investors should exploit the market's irrationality by purchasing shares today.

2022-05-07 00:00:00+00:00,More Than 300 Million Reasons Why Nike Is Dominating Digital,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/more-than-300-million-reasons-why-nike-is-dominating-digital,,,"With stores temporarily closed at various times throughout the past couple of years, Nike's (NYSE: NKE) business was severely impacted. A year-over-year sales increase of 5% in the fiscal 2022 third quarter (ended Feb. 28) shows that the company is continuing to head in the right direction by posting gains.
But ongoing investments the business has made in recent years to bolster its technological foundation are providing a new lever of growth for the world's top athletic apparel brand. Nike currently has more than 300 million members in its booming ecosystem. That massive figure demonstrates the company's digital prowess.
Image source: Getty Images.
Nike's budding ecosystem
Nike has a full suite of digital apps, including the flagship Nike mobile app, the SNKRS app, Nike Training Club, and Nike Running Club. While the last two are activity-based, the first two are where customers can shop for the company's products. What's remarkable is that all of these digital apps work together to reinforce and strengthen the company's ecosystem.
For example, last year Nike collaborated with hip-hop artist Megan Thee Stallion to create workout content. Nike members who took these exercise classes might have then received emails with personalized recommendations of apparel that was inspired by the musician.
But it doesn't end there. Blending the digital experience with in-store shopping is a key facet of Nike's Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy. New store formats, like Nike Live, House of Innovation, and Nike Rise, create a smooth and seamless omnichannel offering. While in stores, shoppers can use their Nike app to pull up product information, pick items to try on in a dressing room, and get one-time discounts to use.
Nike CEO John Donahoe came from eBay, so he knows a thing or two about digital commerce. In the most recent quarter, digital sales represented 26% of the Nike Brand business. Management's objective is to get this figure to half of total revenue one day, which would be a boon for profitability because this channel produces higher margins.
Having a robust digital ecosystem is a key differentiator between Nike and its competitors. The massive amount of data the business collects helps to inform product development and marketing initiatives, ultimately driving higher return on investment. And by creating a frictionless and smooth onboarding process, more consumers will sign up for Nike's apps in the future. This further allows the company to develop deep connections with its customers, an invaluable advantage in today's cutthroat retail environment.
For Nike, it's all about the unquestionable power of the brand. As management focuses relentlessly on continuing to integrate technology into the business, thus strengthening the digital ecosystem, Nike will only become more popular among consumers.
Shareholders can expect the global leader in athletic apparel and footwear to maintain its standing at the top of the industry.

2022-05-07 00:00:00+00:00,This Logistics Leader Could Be the Perfect E-Commerce Stock,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-logistics-leader-could-be-the-perfect-e-commerce-stock,,,"E-commerce stocks have gotten smashed this earnings season.
Normally reliable names like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Shopify (NASDAQ: SHOP) have fallen sharply on earnings, with Amazon even reporting a modest decline in first-party sales. Etsy posted a decline in gross merchandise volume, and eBay and Wayfair both reported lower revenue.
It's clear why the industry is running into a wall. The first quarter of 2021 was the last full period before COVID-19 vaccines were available to the general public in the U.S. In the second quarter, the economy began to ""reopen"" and consumers began to return to pre-pandemic habits like shopping in stores rather than online.
Despite those headwinds, one e-commerce stock delivered a standout first-quarter report. GXO Logistics (NYSE: GXO) just posted 19% organic revenue growth. It raised its revenue guidance for the full year as well, calling for 11% to 15% organic growth in 2022.
Image source: GXO Logistics.
An e-commerce win-win
GXO is the world's biggest pure-play contract logistics company. It operates high-tech warehouses for multinational companies like Apple, Nestle, and Carrefour. Spun off from XPO Logistics (NYSE: XPO) last August, GXO isn't a retailer, but it still offers significant exposure to the e-commerce sector. 70% of the company's sales pipeline is from e-commerce, omnichannel retail, and consumer technology firms.
Those companies turn to GXO to outsource logistics, but the company's exposure to both e-commerce and omnichannel buffered the headwinds in online retail as many of its customers saw demand shift to the brick-and-mortar stores. For GXO, that made little difference to its business as products still got shipped, and GXO will benefit from the growth in both omnichannel and e-commerce.
The company remains bullish on e-commerce, and its investments in areas like reverse logistics, or processing returns, also make it attractive to retailers selling online. Much of its growth from existing customers came from e-commerce in the first quarter.
First-time outsourcing was also the #1 driver of new business for the company, showing that GXO is expanding the third-party logistics market with the help of technology like collaborative robots, robotic picking arms, vision technology, and software.
A recession-resistant company
GXO operates in the cyclical transportation industry, but the company's recent results, including its strongest quarter of new business growth and its increase in guidance, show its confidence in its business over the rest of the year. While there are signs that the economy is weakening, including a pullback in stocks, rising interest rates, and even layoffs from some companies, GXO isn't experiencing any of those headwinds.
If a recession does come, the company is prepared. Nearly 40% of its contracts are ""cost-plus,"" and that will rise to 50% after the Clipper acquisition is completed in the second half of the year. Cost-plus means the company charges customers a price based on a fixed margin on its own costs. That insulates GXO from inflationary pressures and also helps protect its margins. The company also has minimum volume requirements in many of its contracts to protect it on the downside, and uses take-or-pay clauses, ensuring that customers pay a fee if they don't ship the volumes they've committed to.
Chief Investment Officer Mark Manduca also sees a recession as a potential opportunity to grab market share, as a recession would be harder on less efficient competitors, making GXO more attractive by comparison. The company has a history of mergers and acquisitions as a part of XPO Logistics, and another benefit of a downturn would be that target companies would become cheaper, opening up potential acquisition opportunities.
Shopify's own acquisition of Deliverr and Amazon's launch of ""Buy with Prime"" show that the stakes in e-commerce logistics are getting higher as e-commerce companies seek to use logistics to differentiate themselves. That trend will favor GXO, a company with nearly 1,000 warehouses globally and billions of dollars of investments in technology.
GXO is penetrating an addressable market worth $430 billion at a double-digit growth rate, and the stock looks well-priced at the moment, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of just above 20 based on this year's adjusted earnings-per-share forecast of $2.70 to $2.90. The company will continue to benefit from the growth of e-commerce, demand for outsourcing, and growth in areas like reverse logistics.
As other e-commerce stocks face headwinds, GXO looks well-positioned, and should win no matter which companies prosper at the retail level.

2022-05-07 00:00:00+00:00,Nasdaq Bear Market: 2 Unstoppable Growth Stocks to Buy on the Dip,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nasdaq-bear-market%3A-2-unstoppable-growth-stocks-to-buy-on-the-dip,,,"Wall Street is worried about the economy. Supply chain issues and geopolitical conflict have pushed inflation to a 40-year high, but if the Federal Reserve tightens its monetary policy too aggressively -- by raising interest or shrinking it balance sheet too quickly -- it could tip the economy into a recession. Many investors have sold stocks to hedge against that possibility, and the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 25% from its high, putting the index in bear market territory.
That logic makes sense on the surface. Corporate revenues and profits would take a hit during an economic contraction, and those metrics are typically used to value stocks. That being said, the market frequently overreacts to both good and bad news, and many beaten-down growth stocks look like bargains right now. For instance, shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) are down 33% and 70%, respectively, but the future looks bright for both businesses.
Here's why.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Amazon
Wall Street was disappointed with Amazon's first-quarter results, but investors who sold the stock are missing the big picture. Amazon is a powerhouse in two critical industries. Its marketplace averaged 5.2 billion monthly visitors in 2021, three times more than its closest competitor. And Amazon single-handedly powered 41% of e-commerce sales in the U.S. last year, more than the next 14 retailers combined.
Better yet, the company also dominates the cloud computing industry. Last year, Amazon Web Services (AWS) once again ranked as the top cloud vendor, according to research from Gartner. And in the first quarter of 2022, AWS captured 33% market share. That's more than Microsoft and Alphabet combined.
So, why was Wall Street disappointed? High inflation and rising costs were a drag on the bottom line, and Amazon posted its first quarterly loss in several years. But those headwinds are temporary, and Amazon has still grown at an impressive pace over a longer time horizon.

Data source: YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months. CAGR = compound annual growth rate.
With an already-massive $1.3 trillion market cap, some investors may worry about Amazon's prospects for future growth. But eMarketer's forecast suggests that online retail sales will climb 50% by 2025, and Gartner says cloud services spend will more than double over the same time period. That last figure is particularly noteworthy because cloud computing is far more profitable than retail. In fact, AWS typically achieves an operating margin north of 30%, but the operating margin on Amazon's retail business rarely tops 5%.
To that end, Amazon has plenty of room to grow in both of its core industries, and its profitability should accelerate as AWS becomes a bigger piece of the puzzle. And with shares trading at 2.7 times sales, Amazon is cheaper today than at any other point in the last five years. That's why this growth stock is a screaming buy.
2. PayPal
The PayPal brand is synonymous with digital payments. Over 75% of the top 1,500 businesses offer PayPal at checkout, making it the most accepted digital wallet by a wide margin. For context, Apple Pay ranks second with just 27% acceptance. What's driving that success?
PayPal has distinguished itself through the scale and breadth of its portfolio. The company boasts 429 million active accounts, including 35 million merchants, and it provides a wide range of financial products and services to both consumers and businesses. Of particular note, PayPal has recently taken steps to strengthen its brick-and-mortar presence with the Venmo credit card and QR code payments. And it launched PayPal Zettle in the U.S., a point-of-sale solution that helps merchants manage a business across physical and digital storefronts.
In Q1 2022, PayPal continued to battle headwinds from the loss of eBay, high inflation, and geopolitical conflict, all of which caused top and bottom line growth to decelerate. But those headwinds are temporary, and the company has still delivered solid results over a longer time period.

Despite a tough macroeconomic environment, the future looks bright for PayPal. The company will lap the worst of the eBay impact this quarter, so the loss of eBay's business will no longer be a headwind in the second half of 2022. And inflation will begin to fall as supply chains normalize and interest rates rise.
More importantly, PayPal is executing on a strong growth strategy. The company recently redesigned its digital wallet to include tools for shopping rewards, deal discovery, and crypto trading. Additionally, the Venmo digital wallet is now a checkout option through DoorDash, Revolve, and Booking Holdings, and it's coming to Amazon later this year. Those upgrades are particularly timely, because digital wallet usage among consumers is expected to double between 2021 and 2025, according to Juniper Research.
More broadly, PayPal puts its addressable market at $110 trillion, and unstoppable trends like online shopping and digital payments should be tailwinds for the company. And with shares trading at 4.2 times sales, PayPal is cheaper today than it has been since going public in 2015. That's why this growth stock is a smart buy.

2022-05-06 00:00:00+00:00,Why Funko Stock Soared Today,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-funko-stock-soared-today,,,"What happened
Shares of Funko (NASDAQ: FNKO) surged 26.9% on Friday after a star-studded investment group took a large equity stake in the pop culture-focused toy and accessory maker.
So what
In conjunction with its first-quarter earnings report, Funko announced that a consortium of investors led by advisory firm The Chernin Group agreed to acquire a 25% stake in the company. The shares will be purchased from ACON Investments for $263 million, or $21 per share. Members of the consortium include eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), former Disney CEO Bob Iger, and respected sports agent Rich Paul.

As part of the deal, eBay would become the preferred resale platform for Funko. The two companies also plan to work together to create exclusive new products.
Now what
In addition to the news of the investment by the Chernin Group-led consortium, shareholders were likely pleased with Funko's solid first-quarter revenue and profits metrics. The collectible toymaker's net sales jumped 63% year over year to $308.3 million, while its net income climbed 31% to $14.5 million.
Management expects the company's full-year net sales to grow by as much as 29% to roughly $1.3 billion, with adjusted net income of $98.6 million to $103.8 million.
""Our results in the first quarter were broad-based, with ongoing strength across brand categories, geographies, and channels,"" CEO Andrew Perlmutter said in a press release. ""Looking ahead, we remain intently focused on executing against our strategic growth pillars including innovating within our core collectibles category, revenue diversification, growing our DTC [direct-to-consumer] business, and international opportunities.""

However, the major benchmarks all managed to rally in the final minutes of trading and finish with substantial wins, even after the 10-year Treasury yield hit three-year highs. The rally carried over into Tuesday's session, though Wall Street's win was more muted as investors held their breath for an anticipated interest rate hike.
By Wednesday afternoon, attention temporarily turned towards a disappointing ADP private payroll report and a tumble in Big Tech. In the latter half of the session, the Fed followed through with the hike of 50 basis points, but stocks managed to nab a third-straight win after Fed Chair Jerome Powell assured there would not be a more substantial 75-basis-point hike to come. The optimism couldn't last, however, and the Dow finished Thursday more than 1,000 points lower, scoring its worst day since June 2020 along with the Nasdaq, after the 10-year Treasury yield surged back above 3% and disappointing labor productivity rolled in. By midday on Friday, disappointing earnings reports and the elevated Treasury yield have the Dow on track to log its sixth-straight weekly loss, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq head for their fifth-straight.
The Best and Worst Stocks to Own in May
Every month, Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White compiles a list of the best and worst stocks to own, with data looking back 10 years. For May, history says Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) is the Dow component investors should avoid. Conversely, the best performing blue chip is UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which also just pulled back to a historically bullish trendline. Additionally, CME Group (CME) saw its shares pullback to a similarly bullish moving average, and landed on White's list as the third-best stock to own this month. Investors should also expect bearish returns from Marriot International (MAR), while Cintas (CTAS) could prove a good portfolio booster.
  The Week's Biggest Earnings Disappointments 
After a sunny start to earnings season, recent reports did their best to dent sentiment on Wall Street. Despite upbeat earnings and revenue, Expedia (EXPE) nabbed a host of bear notes and fell nearly 10% following its latest report. Similarly, eBay's (EBAY) highly anticipated report came with better-than-expected results, but a lackluster forecast saw analysts chime in with a barrage of price-target cuts. And while Starbucks (SBUX) was also victim to a round of lower price objective adjustments, the equity was luckily able to shake off the bearish sentiment and rise after earnings. Meanwhile, Biogen's (BIIB) CEO stepped down after dismal earnings per share, Etsy (ETSY) was on track for its worst day in two years after its financial results, and Uber (UBER) lost $5.9 billion following a number of equity investments.
What's to Look for Next
Wall Street will tune into inflation data next week. And though earnings seasoning is beginning to cool down, reports from Alibaba (BABA), AMC Entertainment (AMC), Palantir Technologies (PLTR), Walt Disney (DIS), Yeti (YETI), and more, are still due out. In the meantime, traders might want to keep an eye on the SPX's next rally could mean going forward.

2022-05-06 00:00:00+00:00,3 Reasons Carparts.com Is on the Right Track,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-carparts.com-is-on-the-right-track,,,"Shares of Carparts.com (NASDAQ: PRTS) were soaring this week, jumping 27.2% on Wednesday after the auto parts e-commerce company delivered a strong first-quarter earnings report. The company said revenue increased 15% to $166.1 million, beating estimates at $162.1 million. On a two-year window, revenue increased 80% as sales surged in the quarter a year ago when the pandemic was at its peak.
Bottom-line results were also strong, with record adjusted EBITDA of $9.4 million, up from $3.6 million a year ago, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.04, which beat estimates of a $0.02 per-share loss.
Like other e-commerce stocks, Carparts.com surged during the pandemic before falling sharply from its peak early last year. However, the latest round of results and the rebound in the stock should give investors confidence in the stock as the pandemic tailwinds fade. Here are three signs that Carparts.com stock looks like a winner.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. It's bucking the trend in e-commerce
Nearly every other e-commerce stock that's reported earnings this season has plunged following its result's release. That includes Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), Wayfair (NYSE: W) Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY), and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY). The sector is experiencing a painful hangover following the heady growth during the pandemic, and investors were unprepared for the slowdown.
Not only was Carparts.com the only stock in this group to gain on earnings, but its revenue growth also outpaced that of everyone in the group except for Shopify, whose gross merchandise volume grew 16%, essentially equal to Carparts.com's 15% top-line growth. First-party sales at Amazon and gross merchandise sales at Etsy actually declined, and all key growth metrics were down for Wayfair and eBay, showing how difficult the comparisons with the year-ago quarter are in the e-commerce sector.
That Carparts.com was able to outperform those peers is a credit to the company's ability to retain customers and its growth prospects as it adds new warehouses to meet demand. Management also sees auto parts as being resistant to both inflationary and recessionary pressures, giving it an edge over other e-commerce companies that sell more discretionary items.
2. The company is delivering on the bottom line
It's no accident that Carparts.com just delivered record EBITDA in the quarter, and breezed past analyst estimates on the bottom line. New CEO David Meniane has renewed the company's focus on financial discipline, perhaps in light of the recent stock swoon, and those efforts are already bearing fruit. Free cash flow in the quarter was also positive at $1.5 million.
Achieving that kind of bottom-line improvement in an environment with high inflation and significant supply chain constraints shows the company's ability to adapt its business model and pass along price increases when warranted. Management also noted that it's carrying about $40 million more in inventory than it normally would at the current revenue level because of shipping delays, meaning that its cash flow would be even stronger in a normal supply chain environment.
Over the long term, the company is targeting adjusted EBITDA margins of 8%-10%, and it's already made significant progress toward that goal, as its EBITDA margin reached 5.7% in the first quarter.
3. The stock still looks cheap
Carparts.com is targeting long-term annual revenue growth of 20%-25%, yet the stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of just 0.8, which is lower than all of the stocks above except for Wayfair, whose shares have plunged as it's experienced four straight quarters of declining revenue. Based on run-rate EBITDA in the first quarter, Carparts.com stock is currently valued at just 12.4 times forward EBITDA, which looks dirt cheap if it can execute on its long-term growth and profitability targets.
The market seems skeptical that Carparts.com can keep its pandemic-era momentum going, but the company doesn't plan on slowing down. It plans to open a new distribution center in Jacksonville, Florida, at the end of the second quarter and will ramp up inventory there over the rest of the year. With Jacksonville open, the company expects to be able to serve 98% of its customers with two-day delivery and 55% with one-day delivery. Over the long term, it has a goal of reaching 80% of the country with one-day delivery. Separately, Carparts.com is developing a ""Do it for me"" mobile mechanic service, in which customers can order the parts that they need and find mechanics to do the labor at the same time. That would greatly expand its market from just DIY customers to anyone who owns a car, and it has the potential to disrupt the auto parts industry. The company hopes to launch the service later this year.

2022-05-05 00:00:00+00:00,Why eBay Stock Tanked Today,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-ebay-stock-tanked-today,,,"What happened
Even by the standards of an awful trading session for stocks generally, eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) shares took a massive hit on Thursday. The storied e-commerce company published its latest set of quarterly earnings, and some of its numbers greatly dismayed investors.
So what
Optimistically describing its first-quarter performance as ""better than expected,"" eBay unveiled those figures after market hours on Wednesday. These showed that the company earned $2.5 billion in revenue, which was 6% lower than the corresponding period of 2021. The decline in gross merchandise volume (GMV) was even steeper; it fell 20% to $19.4 billion.
Image source: Getty Images.
Non-GAAP (adjusted) net profit also suffered a decline, tumbling at a 16% clip to land at $625 million, or $1.05 per share.
Those headline numbers more or less met the average analyst estimates of $2.5 billion on the top line and $1.03 per share for adjusted net profit.
Reinforcing its optimistic view -- despite mentioning the ""current macro[economic] headwinds"" buffeting its performance -- eBay also declared a fresh quarterly dividend. This is to be $0.22 per share, and it will be paid on June 17 to investors of record as of June 1. That amount yields 1.7% on the latest stock share price, and it matches the company's previous disbursement. Before that, it paid $0.18.
Now what
Investors were probably more disheartened by eBay's guidance than anything else. The company said that for the current quarter, it's expecting $2.35 billion to $2.4 billion in revenue and per-share earnings of $0.87 to $0.91. Both ranges are below the collective analyst projections of $2.54 billion and $1.01, respectively.
As for its full-year 2022 guidance, eBay is forecasting $9.6 billion to $9.9 billion on the top line. But those prognosticators are modeling $10.4 billion. It's the same for per-share earnings; eBay believes it will post $3.90 to $4.10, while analysts are estimating $4.34.

2022-05-05 00:00:00+00:00,US STOCKS-Wall Street slumps as investors fear bigger Fed rate hikes,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-street-slumps-as-investors-fear-bigger-fed-rate-hikes,,,"By David French
May 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed Thursday sharply lower as investor sentiment cratered in the face of concerns that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike would not be enough to tame surging inflation.
All three main Wall Street benchmarks erased gains made during a relief rally on Wednesday.
Technology megacaps slumped, including Google-parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Meta Platforms FB.O, Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O.
However, it was not just high-growth stocks, which have struggled in 2022 as the prospect of rate rises had investors questioning their future earnings potential. The selloff hit all areas of the market, as traders headed for the exits.
""Investors aren't looking at fundamentals (such as earnings) right now, and this is more of a sentiment issue,"" said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors.
The U.S. central bank on Wednesday raised interest rates by half a percentage point as expected and Fed Chair Jerome Powell explicitly ruled out a hike of 75 basis points in a coming meeting.
Traders, however, on Thursday raised their bets on a 75 basis-point hike at the Fed's June meeting. IRPR
Worries about Fed policy moves, mixed earnings from some big growth companies, the conflict in Ukraine and pandemic-related lockdowns in China have hammered Wall Street recently, overshadowing a better-than-expected quarterly reporting season.
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 148.70 points, or 3.51%, to end at 4,149.31 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC lost 635.21 points, or 4.90%, to 12,329.65. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 1,033.07 points, or 3.03%, to 33,027.99.
Only a small number of the S&P 500's constituents were in positive territory, one of which was Twitter Inc TWTR.N.
Elon Musk revealed on Thursday that Oracle's co-founder Larry Ellison and Sequoia Capital were among investors that would back his takeover of the social media giant with $7.14 billion of financing.
All of the 11 major S&P sectors declined, with consumer discretionary .SPLRCD leading the way. The index was dragged by Etsy Inc ETSY.O and eBay Inc EBAY.O, after both forecast Q2 revenue would be below Wall Street's estimates.
The technology sector .SPLRCT also slumped, with Intuit Inc INTU.O among those weighing the heaviest, a day after agreeing to pay a $141 million settlement centered on deception claims around its TurboTax product.
""You're seeing those areas of the market which are purely discretionary, they are the ones getting hit today because everyone is anticipating that this is going to be a challenging period for consumers over the next several quarters,"" said Horneman of Verdence Capital Advisors.
The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, climbed significantly.
The focus now shifts to the U.S. Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday for clues on labor market strength and its impact on monetary policy.

May 5 (Reuters) - The Chernin Group, an investment firm known for backing emerging media, commerce and technology companies, announced on Thursday that it will lead a consortium making a $263 million investment in the lifestyle brand Funko Inc FNKO.O.
TCG and its investor consortium are acquiring 12.5 million shares of Funko Class A stock from ACON Investments, and will own a 25% share of the company following completion of the transaction. Other investors include former Disney CEO Robert A. Iger, Rich Paul, chief executive and founder of Klutch Sports Group, and eBay Inc EBAY.O.
As part of the online marketplace's investment, eBay will become a preferred secondary market for Funko, a maker of toys, stuffed animals, apparel, board games and other collectibles including digital nonfungible tokens.
TCG co-founder and partner Jesse Jacobs said collectors are passionate about the company's Funko Pop! figurines. He said he sees an opportunity for the company to capitalize on this popularity in new ways - as happened with another company in which TCG has invested, Exploding Kittens, whose card game will be adapted into an animated series and a mobile game for Netflix Inc NFLX.O.

May 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes tumbled on Thursday as investors fretted the Federal Reserve's rate hike might not be enough to bring inflation under control and the U.S. central bank might need to take more drastic action.
The Nasdaq dropped 5.1% and the S&P 500 looked set to erase all of its gains from Wednesday after Google-parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Meta Platforms FB.O, Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O fell between 4.9% and 8.1%.

""Yesterday's explosion higher was completely comical. It was ridiculous. His comments did not justify the move that we saw,"" said Kenny Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors.
""Part of what people are recognizing, very deep within his speech yesterday, is the concern that inflation is out of control, and the Fed is behind the eight ball. It is the concern that they may even have to make a more drastic move.""
Worries about Fed policy moves, mixed earnings from some big growth companies, the conflict in Ukraine and pandemic-related lockdowns in China have hammered Wall Street recently, overshadowing a better-than-expected quarterly reporting season.

2022-05-05 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting EBAY Put And Call Options For June 24th,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-ebay-put-and-call-options-for-june-24th,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options become available today, for the June 24th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new June 24th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $49.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.42. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $49.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $46.58 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $49.35/share today.
Because the $49.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.94% return on the cash commitment, or 36.05% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $49.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.00. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $49.35/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $50.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.37% if the stock gets called away at the June 24th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $50.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.05% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.58% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.

In retrospect, Shopify stock probably got ahead of itself. But its valuation is finally showing signs of being more reasonable for investors who have been waiting for the chance to consider Shopify. Here's why Shopify is my top growth stock to buy in May.

A bird's-eye view of e-commerce
Probably the simplest reason for investing in Shopify is a belief in small business and retail sales shifting online. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated e-commerce adoption. But online sales are still a small slice of the total retail pie.
According to the Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce, e-commerce sales were $870.8 billion in 2021 and made up 13.2% of total U.S. retail sales, compared to 13.6% of total retail sales in 2020. In 2021, Shopify supplied 10.3% of e-commerce sales in the U.S. That means that Shopify fueled 1.36% of total U.S. retail sales -- which is amazing, considering how young the company is.
An investment in entrepreneurship
Estimates vary, but small businesses make up roughly 40% to 50% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Shopify has large clients. But the spirit of the company is centered around small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). After all, its mission is ""making commerce better for everyone."" In this sense, Shopify is trying to empower individuals to get creative and build a business without the overhead required of a physical store.
While companies like Wix.com or Squarespace are arguably better than Shopify for websites that aren't centered around selling something, Shopify's easy-to-use cloud-based software takes the cake for serious sellers. Shopify provides optionality when it comes to the look and feel of the site, which payment process to use, which shippers to use, customizing discounts -- you name it. Its three different payment plans make it easy to gain access to more services as a business grows.
For example, the advanced $299 per month option provides more staff accounts, inventory locations, and advanced reporting, as well as automates certain e-commerce functions, connects with third-party shippers to save on rates, and provides discounts on credit card rates and transaction fees.
A business that makes sense
What I love most about Shopify is that it is an easy-to-understand business, even if you've never actually used it from the merchant's perspective. Shopify makes money in two ways -- from Subscription Solutions and Merchant Solutions. Subscription Solutions grow when more customers open a Shopify store or when existing customers upgrade from the $29-per-month basic plan to the $79-per-month Shopify plan or from the Shopify plan to the aforementioned advanced plan. Subscription Solutions accounted for 29.1% of 2021 revenue and 31% of 2020 revenue.
Shopify makes most of its money from Merchant Solutions, which exceeded $1 billion in revenue in Q4 2021. Merchant Solutions are fees that Shopify customers incur for shipping, payment, or point-of-sale tools. The main driver of merchant solutions is gross merchandise volume (GMV). GMV is a fancy way of saying the total dollar amount that passes through Shopify and its related apps and channels.
Like eBay and other e-commerce platforms, Shopify makes money off of transactions. So the more money its merchants make, the more Shopify makes. In this sense, it's not just about customers opening more sites using Shopify -- it's also about those customers' ability to grow their businesses.
What makes Shopify's business model attractive is that Shopify generates a foundational amount of money from subscriptions but then gets upside from its customers via its Merchant Solutions division. Therefore, Shopify's merchants and Shopify have the same interests, and Shopify wins when its merchants win. This is a completely different business model from other software-as-a-service (SaaS) businesses like Adobe -- which doesn't really care if their customers are doing well, so long as they pay their Creative Cloud subscription bill.
An expensive but attractive investment opportunity
As compelling as the buy case is for Shopify, the stock has a forward 2023 price-to-sales ratio of 5.29 and a 2023 forward price-to-earnings ratio of 66.06. It is not cheap by any means, even though, as mentioned, it is down over 70% from its all-time high.
But for investors who feel as though they missed out on Shopify, the pullback could be the perfect time to open a starter position in what is an exciting high-risk, high-reward company with a potentially bright future.

EBAY reported first-quarter 2022 non-GAAP earnings of $1.05 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.9%.

Notably, the bottom line remained flat sequentially but declined 2% year over year.

Net revenues of $2.48 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.46 billion. However, the figure decreased 6% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis and 5% on a FX-neutral basis. Further, it was down 5% from the prior quarter.

This was attributed to softness in transactional activities on eBay’s platform and sluggish marketing services. Further, eBay’s Promoted Listings generated revenues of $222 million, which was down 1% on a reported and 2% on a FX-neutral basis from the prior-year quarter.

Additionally, the company witnessed a year-over-year decline of 13% in the active buyer base, which stood at 142 million at the end of the first quarter.

eBay also witnessed declining gross merchandise volume (“GMV”) in the first quarter, which remained an overhang.

Weakening momentum in online shopping, as a result of normalization to pre-pandemic levels, remained a major headwind.

Nevertheless, the company remains optimistic about its growth initiatives, based on enhancing the seller experience by offering innovative seller tools and delivering a better buyer experience by utilizing structured data. Its deepening focus on strengthening the advertising business also remains noteworthy.
