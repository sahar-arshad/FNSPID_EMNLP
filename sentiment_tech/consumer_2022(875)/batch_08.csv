2022-08-17 00:00:00+00:00,"World Wrestling (WWE) Q2 Earnings Beat, FY22 View Raised",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/world-wrestling-wwe-q2-earnings-beat-fy22-view-raised,,,"World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. WWE posted second-quarter 2022 results, wherein the top line met the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the bottom line beat the same. Impressively, both revenues and earnings grew sharply from the year-ago period. The quarterly performance gained from the return to a full live event schedule, the stellar consumer products business and the monetization of content. The company raised its full-year adjusted OIBDA view.

Premium live events, such as WrestleMania Backlash, Hell in a Cell, Money in the Bank and SummerSlam, witnessed remarkable viewership. These events coupled with solid ratings for flagship programs, Raw and SmackDown continued to expand brand reach and enhance content value. The company also launched a new, enhanced digital platform for e-commerce and licensed merchandise in connection with its long-term partnership with Fanatics.
Q2 Performance Insight
This Stamford, CT-based company reported second-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of 59 cents a share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents. The quarterly earnings increased significantly from the 42 cents a share reported in the prior-year quarter.

WWE’s revenues of $328.2 million came in line with the consensus estimate and surged 24% year over year, driven primarily by higher ticket sales at live events. A rise in the sales of licensed products, including video games and trading cards, also supported revenue growth. A jump in media rights fees related to flagship programs and premium live events also contributed to the top line.
A Look at Margins
WWE’s operating income of $69.3 million jumped 50% year over year, buoyed by higher revenues but partly offset by increased operating expenses due to the return to live event touring and increased production costs related to premium live events. We note that the operating income margin increased to 21% from 17% in the year-ago quarter.

Adjusted OIBDA came in at $91.5 million, up 34% year over year. Again, the adjusted OIBDA margin expanded to 28% from the 26% reported in the prior-year quarter.

Segment Details
Media Division: Revenues in the Media division went up 4% to $243.1 million. The year-over-year increase can be attributed to a jump in domestic and international media rights fees associated with flagship programs and premium live events. These were partly offset by the timing of the delivery of third-party original programming.

Core content rights fees increased to $151.8 million from $141.8 million in the prior-year period. Network revenues came in at $63.7 million, up from the $61.5 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Advertising and sponsorship revenues declined to $17.9 million from $18.7 million in the year-ago period. Other media revenues decreased to $9.7 million from $11.9 million in the prior-year period.
Live Events: Revenues from Live Events came in at $41 million, up meaningfully from $9.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The upside can be attributed to higher ticket sales as the company returned to staging ticketed live events. Higher ticket sales from WWE’s marquee annual event, WrestleMania, also contributed to the segment’s revenues. The company held 59 ticketed live events in the reported quarter consisting of 55 events in North America and four events in international markets. The average attendance at the North America events was roughly 6,800.

Consumer Products Division: The segment’s revenues of $44.1 million zoomed 96% year over year. We note that consumer product licensing revenues came in at $22.6 million, up from $11.3 million in the year-ago period. This was driven by a rise in the sales of licensed products, including video games driven by the franchise game WWE 2K22 as well as trading cards, and other collectibles. E-commerce merchandise sales advanced to $12.9 million from $9.9 million in the prior-year period due to the sale of the existing merchandise inventory to the new operator of WWE’s official e-commerce platform. Venue merchandise sales jumped to $8.6 million from $1.3 million in the year-ago quarter due to the return to ticketed live events.
Other Financial Details
WWE ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $110.1 million, net short-term investments of $333.4 million, long-term debt of $21.1 million and stockholders’ equity of $440.9 million.

Cash flow generated from operating activities during the quarter amounted to $56.9 million, while free cash flow was $9.5 million.

The company paid out $19.1 million to shareholders in the second quarter. This includes $10 million in share repurchases and $9.1 million in dividends paid. As of Jun 30, 2022, the company had approximately $210.9 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization of $500 million.
Outlook
Considering the stellar first-half performance and based on expectations for the second half, management now expects 2022 adjusted OIBDA in the range of $370-$385 million, up from the prior range of $360-$375 million. The upbeat guidance suggests the continued ramp-up of live events, including large-scale international events, and the increased monetization of content. It anticipates higher production, content-related and other expenses. WWE had reported adjusted OIBDA of $324.1 million in 2021.

Management projects third-quarter adjusted OIBDA between $70 million and $80 million compared with the $77.9 million reported in the year-ago period. The guidance indicates a stellar revenue performance due to the contractual escalation of domestic media rights fees for flagship programs and premium events, the increased monetization of content and higher international ticket sales related to the staging of a large-scale event. Management expects higher operating expenses in the third quarter.

2022-08-17 00:00:00+00:00,How Investors Can Grab Better Returns for Retail and Wholesale Using the Zacks ESP Screener,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-investors-can-grab-better-returns-for-retail-and-wholesale-using-the-zacks-esp-34,,,"Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.
The earnings figure itself is key, of course, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb and vice versa.
Hunting for 'earnings whispers' or companies poised to beat their quarterly earnings estimates is a somewhat common practice. But that doesn't make it easy. One way that has been proven to work is by using the Zacks Earnings ESP tool.
The Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained
The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information.
Now that we understand the basic idea, let's look at how the Expected Surprise Prediction works. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.
When we join a positive earnings ESP with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or stronger, stocks posted a positive bottom-line surprise 70% of the time. Plus, this system saw investors produce roughly 28% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
Stocks with a ranking of #3 (Hold), or 60% of all stocks covered by the Zacks Rank, are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. Stocks with rankings of #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy), or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market; Strong Buy stocks should outperform more than any other rank.
Should You Consider Dollar Tree?
The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to quickly look at a qualifying stock. Dollar Tree (DLTR) holds a #2 (Buy) at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.60 a share eight days away from its upcoming earnings release on August 25, 2022.
By taking the percentage difference between the $1.60 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.57 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Dollar Tree has an Earnings ESP of +1.75%. Investors should also know that DLTR is one of a large group of stocks with positive ESPs. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
DLTR is just one of a large group of Retail and Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. MercadoLibre (MELI) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.
MercadoLibre is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 3, 2022. MELI's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.39 a share 78 days from its next earnings release.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MercadoLibre is $2.33, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of +2.47%.
DLTR and MELI's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.

2022-08-16 00:00:00+00:00,Capitalize on a Surging Nasdaq With These 3 Stocks,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/capitalize-on-a-surging-nasdaq-with-these-3-stocks,,,"Following a brutal stretch to start the year, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has surged as of late, putting it in bull market territory. Needless to say, investors have welcomed the rally with open arms.
The rally was boosted by last week’s better-than-expected CPI print, with a strong earnings season further helping to lift stocks. Following the print, some market participants are betting on the Fed to slow down its pace of rate hikes.
Much of the Nasdaq’s struggles year-to-date can be attributed to a hawkish Fed, soaring costs, and geopolitical issues.
Now that buyers have returned, several stocks within the Index could see significant interest, including Adobe ADBE, Microsoft MSFT, and Dollar Tree DLTR. Below is a year-to-date chart of all three companies with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Let’s take a look at each company a little closer.
Adobe
Adobe ADBE is one of the biggest software companies in the world, generating the bulk of its revenue via licensing fees from its customers. The company is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an overall VGM Score of a B.
Adobe’s growth prospects are rock-solid – for the company’s current fiscal year (FY22), the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $13.51 reflects a strong 8.3% year-over-year uptick. And in FY23, earnings are forecasted to grow an additional 16%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The company’s 41.1X forward earnings multiple is undoubtedly on the high side, but this is typical of stocks with high-growth natures. Still, the value is nicely beneath its five-year median of 45.6X.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
In addition, the company has been the definition of consistency within its bottom-line results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in 14 consecutive quarters. Just in its latest quarterly print, ADBE recorded a 1.5% bottom-line beat.
Microsoft
Microsoft MSFT is one of the largest broad-based technology providers in the world, dominating the PC software market with more than 80% of the market share for operating systems. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an overall VGM Score of a C.
Microsoft’s bottom-line projections allude to notable growth – the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $10.14 for the company’s current fiscal year (FY23) pencils in a double-digit 10% uptick in earnings year-over-year. Looking ahead a bit, the $11.67 per share estimate for FY24 reflects a further 15% expansion of the bottom-line.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Microsoft’s forward earnings multiple resides at 28.9X, undoubtedly on the higher side but just above its five-year median of 28.4X and nowhere near highs of 37.5X in 2021. Shares trade at a 14% premium relative to their Zacks Sector.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The company has been on a blazing-hot earnings streak, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in nine of its previous ten quarters. Over its last four, the average surprise has been a respectable 4.5%.
Dollar Tree
Dollar Tree DLTR is an operator of discount variety stores, offering a wide range of quality everyday general merchandise in many categories. The company sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with an overall VGM Score of an A.
Dollar Tree’s growth prospects are fantastic, further bolstered by its Style Score of an A for Growth. For the company’s current fiscal year (FY23), earnings are forecasted to soar by a remarkable 41%. And in FY24, the company’s bottom-line is forecasted to tack on an additional 15% of growth.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
In addition, the company sports solid valuation levels – DLTR’s 20.4X forward earnings multiple is nowhere near highs of 26.5X in 2021 and represents a steep 24% discount relative to its Zacks Sector.
Dollar Tree carries a Style Score of a B for Value.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Dollar Tree has repeatedly reported bottom-line results above expectations, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in 10 consecutive quarters. Just in its latest quarterly release, the discount retailer penciled in a robust 20% bottom-line beat.
Bottom Line
With a better-than-expected CPI print and a strong earnings season, stocks have found many buyers as of late. After a brutal first half, it looks like it could be time for the bears to finally go back into hibernation.
However, there’s still a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, of course. But, we’re still well above 2022 lows, a significant positive.
If the buying remains at this level, Microsoft MSFT, Adobe ADBE, and Dollar Tree DLTR shares stand to benefit massively.
All three companies have stellar growth prospects paired with a well-established nature, perks that any investor would seek in a stock.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Walmart Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
Walmart Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Walmart Inc. Quote
Total revenues of $152.9 billion grew 8.4% and beat the consensus mark of $151.4 billion. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, total revenues climbed 9.1%. Revenue growth was partly aided by inflation.

The consolidated gross profit margin contracted by 132 basis points (bps), primarily due to markdowns and a sales mix in the U.S. segment as well as a LIFO charge at Sam’s Club related to inflation. The gross margin at Walmart U.S. fell 106 bps due increased general merchandise markdowns, a mix shift toward grocery and increased cost inflation, somewhat offset by pricing.

The operating income at cc fell 6% to $6.9 billion. Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined by 45 bps year over year due to solid sales growth, somewhat negated by wage investments.

WMT’s global advertising business soared about 30% due to Walmart Connect in the U.S. segment along with Flipkart advertising.
Segment Details
Walmart U.S.: The segment’s net sales grew 7.1% to $105.1 billion in the reported quarter. U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, improved by 6.5% due to a 5.35% increase in the average ticket, with transactions rising 1% year over year.

The segment continued to see an increased market share in grocery.

4 Solid Stocks to Buy on Soaring Grocery Sales
Rising costs have been worrying retailers for a while now, with many, despite reporting impressive quarterly results, revising their revenue guidance for the next quarter. Despite the existing fears, the retail industry is going strong, with sales increasing almost every month.
The grocery segment particularly has been doing well, with sales soaring. Groceries are necessary and although higher prices of food and essential goods have been hurting people, they have been spending on these. Moreover, higher demand has also been driving grocery sales. Given this situation, grocery stocks like Costco Wholesale Corp., Dollar General Corp., General Mills, Inc. and Dollar Tree, Inc. are likely to do well in the near term.  
Grocery Sales Soaring
According to the latest Mastercard SpendingPulse, retail sales grew 11.2% in July on a year-over-year basis. Sales increased across a variety of segments. However, the grocery segment has been the brightest spot among all.
According to the report, grocery sales jumped 16.8% year over year in July. Moreover, sales were 29.5% higher than July 2019 figures. July was also the fourth straight month in which grocery sales recorded double-digit growth. Grocery sales rose 12.4%, 13.8% and 14% in April, May and June, respectively.
This also shows the constant growth in grocery sales and the continued growth in demand. Although many economists have attributed this growth to higher prices, demand for groceries has also been on the rise.
Interestingly, grocery sales are rising both offline and online. According to a Consumer Trends Tracker report, 45% of consumers who shop for groceries online are omnichannel consumers. Every month, the average amount spent on groceries by online customers is $594 against $388 for in-store customers.
The jump in July grocery sales was primarily driven by high demand for pickup and delivery services, according to research firm Barrington. July's e-grocery sales through pickup totaled $3.4 billion, increasing 17.2% year over year.
People have been limiting their spending on luxury goods, but they cannot stop buying basics. Grocery is one such area. At the same time, demand has also been soaring. The increase in sales shows that the market is holding up despite the Fed's aggressive rate-hike strategy, which is pushing up the cost of commodities.
Sales of groceries are therefore being driven by increased demand as well as rising costs of commodities. In the end, however, sales are increasing, which is a good sign.

2022-08-15 00:00:00+00:00,Comps Growth & Expansion Efforts to Aid Chipotle (CMG),DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/comps-growth-expansion-efforts-to-aid-chipotle-cmg,,,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG is benefiting from comps growth, strength in digital sales, rise in menu prices and new restaurant openings. In the past six months, shares of the company have gained 5.6%, against the industry’s decline of 2.2%. However, supply chain challenges, elevated wage inflation and expenses associated with new menus remain headwinds. Let’s delve deeper.
Growth Drivers
Impressive comps performance continues to drive growth. Despite the pandemic, the company reported comps growth for the eighth straight quarter. During the second quarter, comparable restaurant sales increased 10.1% year over year, following growth of 9% (in first-quarter 2022), 15.2% (in fourth-quarter 2021), 15.1% (third-quarter 2021), 31.2% (second-quarter 2021), 17.2% (first-quarter 2021) and 5.7% (fourth-quarter 2020). Consistent strength in digital sales, solid recovery of in-restaurant sales and positive customer reception to new menu items contributed to the company’s results. For the third quarter, the company expects comps growth, including planned price increases in August, in the mid to high single-digits.

The company’s focus on expansion efforts bodes well. During the first and second quarters of 2022, Chipotle opened 51 and 42 new restaurants, including 42 and 32 Chipotlanes, respectively. The addition of Chipotlane enhanced customer access and convenience and bolstered new store restaurant sales, margins and returns. It continues to expand its digital drive with Chipotlane. The company has opened a digital-only kitchen as well. In 2022, the company expects to open 235-250 restaurants, with at least 80% of them including a Chipotlane. The company currently has 430 Chipotlanes.

Backed by impressive unit economics and the success of small-town locations, the company anticipates operating more than 7,000 restaurants in the long term in North America. CMG emphasized building a real estate pipeline with more than 80% of the restaurants having Chipotlane in it. The company anticipates its annual unit growth rate in the range of 8-10%.

Meanwhile, the company has been focusing on human capital technology to enhance the team member experience in its restaurants, paving the path for a more efficient, consistent and compliant environment. During the first quarter of 2022, the company initiated the testing of an autonomous kitchen assistant – Chippy – that integrates culinary traditions with artificial intelligence to make tortilla chips. The initiative involves robotics collaboration, thereby allowing the company to focus on other culinary tasks in the restaurant without sacrificing the quality and deliciousness of the item. The company plans to implement the initiative in a Southern California restaurant and leverage it with the stage-gate process before deciding its future course of implementation. Apart from this, the company has also rolled out a new labor scheduling program and initiated testing radio frequency identification technology to enhance traceability and inventory systems.

Concerns
The restaurant industry has been facing declining traffic for quite some time. The pandemic has aggravated the scenario. A rapid increase in menu prices and the coronavirus pandemic are the primary reasons behind the traffic erosion. The company said traffic continues to hurt the industry.

The company, like other industry players, has been facing significant supply chain challenges and inflation across most commodities and categories. During second-quarter 2022, food, beverage and packaging costs, as a percentage of revenues, remained flat year over year to 30.4%. In the second quarter of 2022, the benefit of menu price increases was overshadowed by higher costs for avocados, packaging, dairy, beef and chicken. For third-quarter 2022, the company anticipates labor cost to be 25% on account of leverage from the menu price increases.

Chipotle currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
Key Picks
Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector are Potbelly Corporation PBPB, Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. ARCO and Dollar Tree Inc. DLTR.

Potbelly has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), at present. PBPB has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 26.2%, on average. Shares of PBPB have declined 15.3% in the past year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Potbelly’s 2022 sales and EPS suggests growth of 14.1% and 90.4%, respectively, from the corresponding year-ago period’s levels.

Arcos Dorados carries a Zacks Rank #2. ARCO has a long-term earnings growth of 34.4%. Shares of the company have increased 32.5% in the past year.

2022-08-12 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Investors Should Retain McDonald's (MCD) Stock Now,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-investors-should-retain-mcdonalds-mcd-stock-now-0,,,"McDonald's Corporation MCD will likely benefit from digital efforts, robust comps growth, and expansion initiatives. Focus on the loyalty program and drive-thru channels have also been driving sales in the last few quarters. Although overall comps have increased sharply, it is still well below the pre-pandemic level in a few markets.

Let’s discuss the factors highlighting why investors should retain the stock for the time being.
Major Growth Drivers
McDonald's has been focusing on digitalization to drive growth. Before the coronavirus crisis, drive-thru accounted for about two-thirds of all sales in the United States. Despite reopening dining rooms, the company stated that drive-thru sales in its top six markets remain strong compared with pre-pandemic levels. The company noted that in its top six markets, digital sales (including the mobile app, kiosks and delivery) were more than 30% of system-wide sales in second-quarter 2022.
McDonald's continues to impress investors with robust comparable sales growth in second-quarter 2022. Global comps advanced 9.7%, while a gain of 40.5% was reported in the prior-year quarter. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of comps growth.

Concerns
Although overall comps have increased sharply, it is still well below the pre-pandemic level in a few markets. In second-quarter 2022, comps in the China market were negative. Softening economy and COVID-related government restrictions have hurt comps in China.
During the second quarter of 2022, the company announced its exit from the Russian market owing to geopolitical tensions. Also, it cited concerns of a challenging operating environment due to rising inflation, a surge in COVID-19 cases and the return of government restrictions in many markets, exacerbating labor shortages and supply chain challenges. The company stated that rising inflation levels are contributing to weak consumer sentiment worldwide and that the possibility of a global recession cannot be ruled out.

2022-08-11 00:00:00+00:00,FOCUS-Inflation steers budget shoppers away from Walmart. Bringing them back may not be easy,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/focus-inflation-steers-budget-shoppers-away-from-walmart.-bringing-them-back-may-not-be,,,"(Updates graphic)
By Arriana McLymore and Siddharth Cavale
Aug 11 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc could face an uphill battle to reclaim U.S. shoppers who opted for the neighborhood dollar store or Aldi rather than driving farther to a Walmart Supercenter when gasoline was $5 a gallon.
While gasoline prices have dropped nearly 20% over the past month, there are no signs shoppers are returning to the nation's biggest retailer, according to foot traffic data reviewed by Reuters and analysts.
Inflation remains at a 40-year high, devouring a large chunk of the grocery budgets of many Americans, especially Walmart's legions of cost-conscious shoppers.
Foot traffic at Walmart's 3,573 U.S. Supercenters and its 370 discount stores (as of Jan. 31, 2022) fell 2.7% on average from June 1 through July 25 versus a year earlier, according to data from Placer.ai, a location analytics firm.
Meanwhile, traffic rose 11.5% at Aldi [ALDIEI.UL], owned by German discount grocer Aldi Süd, and the number of shopper visits climbed 4.1% at Dollar General.
The question of how to reverse the loss in foot traffic will likely be a focus for analysts when Walmart reports second-quarter earnings on Aug. 16.
It may not be easy - or cheap.
Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, said Walmart needs to invest more in local advertisements to lure people back into stores.
Cutting back on local newspaper ads has become Walmart's ""Achilles heel,"" Flickinger said. If the company wants customers to return, Walmart must spend more money on ""high-value ads"" that highlight promotions and rollbacks.
Walmart shoppers have a median household income of $73,000, according to data from Numerator, a consumer insights firm.
In June, inflation reached 9.1%, a four-decade record, while gasoline prices soared to $5.006 a gallon on average (June 13), up from $3.161 a year earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Higher gas prices shaved hundreds of dollars off the monthly spending budgets of the typical low-income American, according to several economists.
Walmart CEO Doug McMillon has previously characterized the retailer as an ""inflation-fighter"" and a top destination for shoppers in recessionary periods. But Walmart's share as the first choice for grocery purchases dropped to 25.5% in July, from 27.4% in June, according to a Prosper Insights & Analytics monthly consumer survey cited in a Cowen & Co note.
McMillon recently told investors that shoppers - especially from lower-income households - bought fewer items in the three months through April 30, even they also consolidated their trips to the store in response to higher fuel prices.
Monthly spending on gas in July rose to 5.57% of the income of a typical American household - which earns $5,412 per month post-tax - up from 2.79% of income in December 2019, according to GlobalData. Poorer households generally spend a bigger portion of their incomes on gas and essentials.
Walmart Supercenters, which average about 190,000 square feet (17,651.6 square meters) and sell groceries and deli items, alongside clothing, home products, and electronics, tend to be located outside of major metropolitan areas, requiring many shoppers to drive at least several miles. Supercenters do not sell gas.
SAVE MONEY, SHOP CLOSER
Both Walmart and Target Corp issued profit warnings over the past two months, noting that U.S. shoppers responded to the rising cost of living by buying primarily lower-margin food and other essentials, while skipping aisles filled with clothes and sporting goods.
Walmart's warning in late July was “a diagnostic look at the average American household,"" Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink said. It showed the squeeze on shoppers’ monthly budgets that also led many to cut back on their trips to grocery stores, she said.
At Target's 1,937 stores, traffic declined from mid-June through the week of July 25, Placer.ai data shows.
While Walmart has an advantage of offering a larger selection, dollar stores' more convenient locations offer an advantage when fuel prices are high, Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at the Roosevelt Investment Group, said.
Shopper visits to Dollar General stores rose in all weeks of June and for most of July, versus the same period last year, the data shows. Dollar General operates more than 18,400 stores in the United States compared with Walmart's 5,342 U.S stores, according to its latest annual filing.
Placer.ai did not provide data on other dollar store chains, such as Family Dollar and Dollar Tree . However, its quarterly index for dollar stores shows that foot traffic to discount stores in the second quarter increased 8% year-over-year and jumped 13.2% compared with the last quarter.
""The driving distance for a typical shopper across much of the U.S. may be twice as far to reach the nearest Walmart as compared to a dollar store,"" Benowitz said.

The upside was primarily driven by higher sales at company-operated restaurants (which benefited from the acquisition of 93 franchise-operated restaurants in Florida in fourth-quarter 2021) and higher same-restaurant sales. Also, a rise in franchise royalty revenue and advertising funds revenue added to the upside.
The Wendy's Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

 During the quarter under review, same-restaurant sales at International restaurants (excluding Venezuela and Argentina) rose 15.2% year over year compared with growth of 31.4% in the year-ago quarter. Comps at Global restaurants rose 3.7% year over year compared with a 17.4% increase reported in the prior-year quarter. Comps in the United States witnessed an improvement of 2.3% year over year compared with an increase of 16.1% in the prior-year quarter.
In the quarter under review, Wendy’s inaugurated 47 restaurants globally, reflecting an increase of 24 net new units.
System-Wide Sales Discussion
During the fiscal second quarter, global system-wide sales — including company-operated and franchise restaurants — were nearly $3.4 million, up 5.2% year over year. During the quarter under review, system-wide sales in the U.S. and the International segments were approximately $3 million and $0.4 million, up 3.6% and 18.4% year over year, respectively.
Operating Highlights
During the fiscal second quarter, the company-operated restaurant margin came in at 14.5%, compared with 20.3% in the year-ago quarter. The downside was primarily due to higher commodity and labor costs, a decline in customer counts and increased investments (to support the entry into the United Kingdom market). However, this was partially offset by a higher average check.
General and administrative expenses in the quarter were $61.6 million compared with $63.1 million reported in the prior-year quarter. This was primarily on account of a lower incentive compensation accrual.
Quarterly operating profit amounted to $96.3 million, down 24% from the year-ago quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower system optimization gains (driven by lapping the sale of the New York market in the prior year quarter) and a decrease in company-operated restaurant margin. However, this was partially offset by a rise in franchise royalty revenue.
Net income during the fiscal second quarter was $48.2 million, down 26.7% from $65.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was primarily due to a decrease in operating profit and higher interest expense (owing to the company's debt raise in the first quarter of fiscal 2022).
Adjusted EBITDA during the quarter totaled $132.9 million, up 1.4% from $131.1 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside was primarily backed by higher franchise royalty revenue and lower general and administrative expenses. However, this was partially offset by a decline in company-operated restaurant margin.
Balance Sheet
Cash and cash equivalents as of Jul 3, 2022, totaled $700.8 million compared with $741.2 million on Apr 3, 2022. Inventories at the end of the fiscal second quarter amounted to $6.5 million compared with $5.9 million reported in the previous quarter. As of Jul 3, 2022, long-term debt was $2,832.8 million compared with $2,836.8 million at the end of Apr 3, 2022.
The company declared a quarterly dividend of 12.5 cents per share. The dividend will be paid out on Sep 15, 2022, to shareholders on record as of Sep 1, 2022. In the fiscal second quarter, the company repurchased 2.8 million shares.
2022 Outlook
For 2022, the company continues to expect global system-wide sales growth to be 6-8%. Adjusted EBITDA is projected in the band of $490-$505 million. Adjusted EPS for 2022 is anticipated to be 84-88 cents, up from the prior estimate of 82-96 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings is pegged at 82 cents. The company anticipates cash flow from operations in the band of $305-$325 million, while capital expenditures are projected between $90 million and $100 million. Free cash flow is anticipated to be $215-$225 million.

2022-08-11 00:00:00+00:00,Kohl's (KSS) Expands Self-Pickup Option Ahead of Holiday Season,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/kohls-kss-expands-self-pickup-option-ahead-of-holiday-season,,,"Kohl's Corporation KSS is committed to strengthening its omnichannel presence as the busy holiday season approaches. Moving on these lines, the company now provides Kohl’s Self-Pickup service on eligible Kohls.com orders in over 1,100 stores nationwide to make holiday shopping hassle-free and efficient.

The service will aid customers in skipping the line and conveniently pick up eligible orders at a Kohl’s store. Orders will be ready to be collected within two hours and customers will receive a ""Ready for Pickup"" email directing them to the pickup area. The launch of Self-Pickup shows Kohl’s commitment to making customers’ shopping experience easier with technology. The move is in sync with the company’s objective of providing an industry-leading shopping experience.

Apart from the Self-Pickup option, Kohl’s provides other shopping conveniences. Customers can use the Kohl’s App and Kohl’s Pay for on-the-go shopping. Shoppers can find the option to scan and store Kohl’s gift cards, Kohl’s Cash coupons and savings offers in the Kohl’s App. Kohl’s Pay helps customers with fast and easy payment by connecting to Kohl’s Card account to apply offers and coupons with a scan. All said, the company is continuously innovating and investing in more productive store experiences using technology to accelerate growth, as evident from the aforementioned roll-out of the Self-Pickup option. 
Partnerships Boost Performance
The company has been benefiting from the rollout of Amazon’s AMZN Amazon returns program nationwide. Per this program, Kohl’s stores accept free, unpackaged and easy returns for customers of Amazon. The company is impressed with the performance of AMZN’s Amazon returns program. One of the prime objectives of this program is to convert more customers into loyal Kohl’s shoppers. Incidentally, the company has been benefiting from the rollout of its Amazon returns program nationwide

The company's solid partnership with Sephora to create a new era of elevated Beauty at Kohl's, is noteworthy and is generating impressive results. In its first-quarter earnings release, management remained encouraged about its updated stores (with Sephora at Kohl’s shops), generating positive comparable store sales (comps) in 200 of these locations. Management expects continued business growth in the second half as it gains from the roll-out of another 400 stores, more store investments and improved loyalty rewards.
Wrapping Up
In a recent strategic review release with Franchise Group, Kohl’s stated that it is witnessing soft consumer spending patterns owing to increased inflationary pressure. Consequently, management now anticipates second-quarter 2022 net sales decline in the high-single digits, compared with the low-single-digit decline projected earlier.

In addition, Kohl’s continues to witness a rise in SG&A expenses due to greater investments toward strategic initiatives. Management expects SG&A expenses to be high in the full year, wherein the gross margin is likely to contract due to product and freight cost inflation.

2022-08-11 00:00:00+00:00,"Jack in the Box (JACK) Q3 Earnings Lag Estimates, Revenues Top",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jack-in-the-box-jack-q3-earnings-lag-estimates-revenues-top,,,"Jack in the Box Inc. JACK reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues beating the same.

Comps Discussion
In the quarter under review, comps at Jack in the Box’s stores increased 3.5% year over year compared with 9% growth reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside in comps was primarily due to an increase in average checks partially offset by a decline in traffic.

Same-store sales at franchised stores fell 1% year over year against 10.3% growth reported in the prior-year quarter. System-wide same-store sales fell 0.6% year over year against a 10.2% gain reported in the year-ago quarter.
Del Taco Performance
During third-quarter 2022, same-store sales rose 3.5%, comprising of franchise same-store sales growth of 4.8% and company-operated same-store sales growth of 2.3%. During the quarter, the company closed five restaurants.
Operating Highlights
During the fiscal third quarter, restaurant-level adjusted margin came in at 15.8% compared with 25.4% reported in the prior-year quarter. The downside was driven by a rise in food and packaging costs, wage inflation of 13.2% and higher utilities and maintenance and repair costs.

Food and packaging costs (as a percentage of company restaurant sales) rose 120 bps year over year to 30.6%. Commodity costs during the quarter increased 16.8% year over year. The upside can be attributed to a rise in the price of proteins, sauces, oil and beverages.

2022-08-11 00:00:00+00:00,"Red Robin (RRGB) Q2 Loss Wider Than Expected, Stock Down",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/red-robin-rrgb-q2-loss-wider-than-expected-stock-down,,,"Shares of Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. RRGB declined 11.8% during the after-market trading session on Aug 10 following the company’s lower-than-expected second-quarter 2022 results. The operator of a casual dining restaurant chain reported a loss that widened from the year-ago period. It also witnessed a sharp contraction in the restaurant-level operating profit margin. Citing a tough operating environment, sluggishness in industry sales trends and rising commodity prices, management updated full-year guidance. Red Robin trimmed its adjusted EBITDA view.
Earnings & Revenue Picture
Red Robin posted an adjusted loss of 75 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents. In the year-ago quarter, RRGB reported an adjusted loss of 22 cents a share. The sharp increase in the net loss was due to higher commodity and wage rate inflation, other charges, repairs and maintenance, utilities and marketing expenses. These were partly offset by higher restaurant revenues and a decline in management incentive compensations as well as group insurance costs.
Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. Quote
Total revenues of $294.1 million increased 6.2% from the year-ago period. However, the top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $299.1 million. Restaurant revenues, which comprise primarily food and beverage sales, grew 6.1% year over year to $288.7 million, while Franchise royalties, fees and other revenues jumped 12.8% to $5.4 million.

Restaurant revenues increased due to a 6.7% rise in comparable restaurant revenues. However, sales at non-comparable restaurants declined $1.6 million.

We note that comparable restaurant revenues grew due to a 9.6% jump in the average Guest check, partially offset by a 2.9% drop in the Guest count. The rise in the average Guest check can be attributed to a 3.7% increase in the menu mix, a 6% improvement in pricing and a 0.1% decline due to higher discounts. The increase in the menu mix stemmed from limited time menu offerings and higher dine-in sales volumes.
Margins & Costs
The restaurant-level operating profit margin shrunk 210 basis points year over year to 13.6% due to commodity and wage rate inflation, partly offset by sales leverage and other labor costs. Restaurant labor costs (as a percentage of restaurant revenues) contracted 120 basis points to 35.2%, driven by sales leverage as well as lower group insurance and management incentive compensation costs, partly offset by a higher wage rate.

During the quarter, the cost of sales rose 17.4% year over year to $72.7 million, while, as a percentage of restaurant revenues, the metric increased 240 basis points to 25.2%. While other operating costs, as a percentage of restaurant revenues, jumped 80 basis points to 18%, occupancy costs increased 10 basis points to 8%.

Adjusted EBITDA declined to $11.9 million from $19 million in the year-ago quarter.

2022-08-11 00:00:00+00:00,FOCUS-Walmart's long-lasting challenge: luring budget shoppers back to its stores,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/focus-walmarts-long-lasting-challenge%3A-luring-budget-shoppers-back-to-its-stores,,,"By Arriana McLymore and Siddharth Cavale
Aug 11 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc WMT.N could face an uphill battle to reclaim U.S. shoppers who opted for the neighborhood dollar store or Aldi rather than driving farther to a Walmart Supercenter when gasoline was $5 a gallon.
While gasoline prices have dropped nearly 20% over the past month, there are no signs shoppers are returning to the nation's biggest retailer, according to foot traffic data reviewed by Reuters and analysts.
Inflation remains at a 40-year high, devouring a large chunk of the grocery budgets of many Americans, especially Walmart's legions of cost-conscious shoppers.
Foot traffic at Walmart's 3,573 U.S. Supercenters and its 370 discount stores (as of Jan. 31, 2022) fell 2.7% on average from June 1 through July 25 versus a year earlier, according to data from Placer.ai, a location analytics firm.
Meanwhile, traffic rose 11.5% at Aldi ALDIEI.UL, owned by German discount grocer Aldi Süd, and the number of shopper visits climbed 4.1% at Dollar General.
The question of how to reverse the loss in foot traffic will likely be a focus for analysts when Walmart reports second-quarter earnings on Aug. 16.
It may not be easy - or cheap.
Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, said Walmart needs to invest more in local advertisements to lure people back into stores.
Cutting back on local newspaper ads has become Walmart's ""Achilles heel,"" Flickinger said. If the company wants customers to return, Walmart must spend more money on ""high-value ads"" that highlight promotions and rollbacks.
Walmart shoppers have a median household income of $73,000, according to data from Numerator, a consumer insights firm.
In June, inflation reached 9.1%, a four-decade record, while gasoline prices soared to $5.006 a gallon on average (June 13), up from $3.161 a year earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Higher gas prices shaved hundreds of dollars off the monthly spending budgets of the typical low-income American, according to several economists.
Walmart CEO Doug McMillon has previously characterized the retailer as an ""inflation-fighter"" and a top destination for shoppers in recessionary periods. But Walmart's share as the first choice for grocery purchases dropped to 25.5% in July, from 27.4% in June, according to a Prosper Insights & Analytics monthly consumer survey cited in a Cowen & Co note.
McMillon recently told investors that shoppers - especially from lower-income households - bought fewer items in the three months through April 30, even they also consolidated their trips to the store in response to higher fuel prices.
Monthly spending on gas in July rose to 5.57% of the income of a typical American household - which earns $5,412 per month post-tax - up from 2.79% of income in December 2019, according to GlobalData. Poorer households generally spend a bigger portion of their incomes on gas and essentials.
Walmart Supercenters, which average about 190,000 square feet (17,651.6 square meters) and sell groceries and deli items, alongside clothing, home products, and electronics, tend to be located outside of major metropolitan areas, requiring many shoppers to drive at least several miles. Supercenters do not sell gas.
SAVE MONEY, SHOP CLOSER
Both Walmart and Target Corp TGT.N issued profit warnings over the past two months, noting that U.S. shoppers responded to the rising cost of living by buying primarily lower-margin food and other essentials, while skipping aisles filled with clothes and sporting goods.
Walmart's warning in late July was “a diagnostic look at the average American household,"" Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink said. It showed the squeeze on shoppers’ monthly budgets that also led many to cut back on their trips to grocery stores, she said.
At Target's 1,937 stores, traffic declined from mid-June through the week of July 25, Placer.ai data shows.
While Walmart has an advantage of offering a larger selection, dollar stores' more convenient locations offer an advantage when fuel prices are high, Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at the Roosevelt Investment Group, said.
Shopper visits to Dollar General DG.N stores rose in all weeks of June and for most of July, versus the same period last year, the data shows. Dollar General operates more than 18,400 stores in the United States compared with Walmart's 5,342 U.S stores, according to its latest annual filing.
Placer.ai did not provide data on other dollar store chains, such as Family Dollar and Dollar Tree DLTR.O. However, its quarterly index for dollar stores shows that foot traffic to discount stores in the second quarter increased 8% year-over-year and jumped 13.2% compared with the last quarter.
""The driving distance for a typical shopper across much of the U.S. may be twice as far to reach the nearest Walmart as compared to a dollar store,"" Benowitz said.

2022-08-10 00:00:00+00:00,7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for Safety,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-a-rated-stocks-to-buy-for-safety,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
When it comes to the economy and the stock market, the near term remains murky. It’s possible the market has mostly factored in inflation, interest rate hikes and recession risks. Then again, maybe not. Yet while uncertainty still runs high, that doesn’t mean staying on the sidelines is the best move. Instead, it’s best to seize opportunities, like A-rated safe stocks to buy.
Of course, risky stocks have been hard hit so far this year, but so have their less-risky counterparts. In fact, in some cases, safe, high-quality names have become oversold. Because those stocks are trading at very favorable valuations, now is a great time to lock down long-term positions.
Yes, the market could stay rocky through the rest of the year. Volatility could even carry on into 2023. However, with safe, high-quality stocks, further near-term downside risk is limited. On a longer time frame, each one offers solid upside potential.
So, what are the best safe stocks to buy today? Consider these seven. Each one earns an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.
AA Alcoa $52.98
DLTR Dollar Tree $165.99
ENPH Enphase Energy $303.87
MRO Marathon Oil $22.30
ON ON Semiconductor $66.16
PEP PepsiCo $176.05
ZIM ZIM Integrated Shipping $52.24
Alcoa (AA)

Like other commodity stocks, shares in Alcoa (NYSE:AA) soared earlier this year. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent economic sanctions placed on Russia, resulted in a big spike in aluminum prices and, in turn, a spike in aluminum stock prices.
However, since the spring, aluminum prices have pulled back considerably. That’s when worries about falling demand (from a recession) began to outweigh the impact of tightening supply. Investor sentiment with AA stock has done a 180. After trading for as much as $98.09 per share, it’s fallen nearly 50% to just over $50 per share
But while it’s experienced a big plunge, further volatility may be limited. With its drop, Alcoa now trades at a highly discounted valuation (6.1x estimated 2022 earnings). As aluminum prices remain at multiyear highs, the company remains well-positioned to continue reporting strong earnings results.
Alcoa earns an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Dollar Tree (DLTR)
Source: shutterstock.com/Jonathan Weiss
It’s not surprising that Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) shares are in the green for 2022, while the market at large is in the red. This discount retailer is both inflation-resistant and recession-resistant. Inflationary pressures have not had nearly the impact on discount retailers’ operating results as they have had on the results of big-box retailers.
Challenging economic conditions have helped to increase traffic to Dollar Tree’s stores, as seen from its same-store sales growth last quarter (4.4%). Continuing to deliver strong earnings growth, the nearly 20% rise in the price of DLTR stock since January is justified.
Even with this surge, don’t think you’ve missed out. At 20.3x earnings, it’s still favorably priced relative to its future prospects. Able to pass along rising costs to consumers, all while offering a strong value proposition for consumers squeezed by inflation, its operating results should remain strong going forward.
This stock earns an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Enphase Energy (ENPH)
Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com
Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) may seem like an odd choice to include on a list of safe stocks to buy. High-growth names like this maker of solar energy inverters and battery storage products are not typically considered safe stocks.
Sure, ENPH stock has made wild moves since late last year. After its most recent rally, it now sports a premium valuation (83.3x earnings). Yet while this may make buying it today look like a speculative wager, shares aren’t as risky as they appear.
Why? Trends are highly in Enphase’s favor. It’s experiencing strong demand in Europe, as solar use grows due to high energy prices. The climate bill making its way through Congress right now could also be a boon for its business. As prospects remain very bright, this stock (up 65% this year) could keep climbing.
This stock earns an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Marathon Oil (MRO)

Green energy plays may have performed strongly lately, but 2022 has been a great year for fossil fuel stocks as well. For instance, Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), which is up more than 30% year to date thanks to the massive spike in crude oil and natural gas prices.
Yes, with crude oil falling back below $100 per barrel, MRO stock, like its exploration and production peers, has fallen back as well. However, far from a potential falling knife situation, you may want to consider buying shares after their recent dip.
Crude oil prices could hold steady at current levels through 2023. At least, that’s what the U.S. Energy Information Administration (or EIA) is forecasting. Assuming oil stays elevated compared to prior-year levels, Marathon earnings will stay elevated as well. This will allow it to continue its aggressive stock buyback program, which could move the needle further for shares.
This stock earns an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.
ON Semiconductor (ON)

ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is a safe stock that the market has been overly cautious about. This maker of semiconductors for the auto industry and other industrial end-users has benefited from demand for chips outstripping supply. Last quarter, revenue was up 25% year over year (or YOY). Earnings more than doubled.
Still, it’s future results that are top of mind with investors when it comes to ON stock. Anticipating lower demand in a recession, shares trade at a low multiple (12.39 earnings), despite the recent growth.
However, it’s hardly a given that demand is on the verge of slacking. Add in the potential benefits from the recently passed CHIPS Act (which provides billions in subsidies for domestic chip makers), and the good times are likely to keep on rolling for ON Semiconductor.
This stock earns an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.
PepsiCo (PEP)
Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com
It’s not difficult to see why PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) belongs in the safe stocks to buy category. It’s the type of business that performs well in good economic times and in bad economic times.
The beverage and snack foods giant also has been able to pass along rising costs to consumers, all while continuing to report organic sales growth. In this year’s down market, PEP stock has held steady. At present, it trades for basically what it traded for at the start of 2022.
Once today’s choppy market conditions pass, PepsiCo will likely get back on track delivering solid returns to investors. Shares will continue to move up in tandem with increased earnings. Add in the stock’s dividend (forward yield of 2.64%), which has been raised 49 years in a row, and buy and hold investors could see satisfactory total returns from adding it to their portfolios.
This stock earns an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.
ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM)
Source: Darryl Brooks / Shutterstock.com
With high expectations of an upcoming recession, cyclical stocks have fallen to super-low valuations. Few, however, have fallen to the fire-sale valuation ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (NYSE:ZIM) currently commands.
Currently, it trades for just 1.1x estimated 2022 earnings. Even when comparing its stock price to 2023 earnings forecasts, which call for its earnings to fall by more than 64%, its earnings multiple is extremely low (3.3x). It’s not as if things are set to go from boom to bust for this containership company, which has benefited greatly from the supply chain crisis.
Container shipping rates are declining, but they are not experiencing a precipitous plunge. Earnings could remain very high compared to pre-2021 levels. Put simply, pardon the pun when I say the ship hasn’t sailed with ZIM stock.
This stock earns an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.

A strengthening labor market and strategic endeavors undertaken at company levels are working in tandem for the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry. Moreover, the strategy to sell products at discounted rates has helped industry players draw customers, who are currently feeling the pinch of rising prices.
Meanwhile, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investment to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corp., The TJX Companies, Inc., Dollar General Corp., Dollar Tree, Inc..
About the Industry
The Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, arts and crafts supplies, toys, and seasonal décor products.
These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both. Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.
3 Key Industry Trends to Watch
Consumers Seek Better Bargains Amid Inflation: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices. Under the current circumstances, people in the low-to-middle income groups have been showing a preference for discount stores to get quality products at reasonable prices.
Industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Clearly, companies are leaving no stone unturned to tap any surge in demand.
Digitization is Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives such as building omni-channel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store are worth mentioning.
Simultaneously, companies are investing in the renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers' product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.
Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled a number of players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs.
Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation, tight labor market and supply-chain headwinds.
Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.

Moreover, the strategy to sell products at discounted rates has helped industry players draw customers, who are currently feeling the pinch of rising prices.

Meanwhile, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investment to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corporation COST, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Dollar General Corporation DG, Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR.
About the Industry
The Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, arts and crafts supplies, toys, and seasonal décor products. These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both. Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.
3 Key Industry Trends to Watch
Consumers Seek Better Bargains Amid Inflation: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices. Under the current circumstances, people in the low-to-middle income groups have been showing a preference for discount stores to get quality products at reasonable prices. Industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Clearly, companies are leaving no stone unturned to tap any surge in demand.
Digitization is Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives such as building omni-channel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in the renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.
Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled a number of players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation, tight labor market and supply-chain headwinds. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.

2022-08-08 00:00:00+00:00,11 Consumer Stocks for Inflationary Times,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/11-consumer-stocks-for-inflationary-times,,,"U.S. inflation hit a four-decade peak in June, with prices rising roughly 9.1% according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That has understandably rattled investors who are worried about cutbacks in spending as Americans look to fend off the pain at the gas pump and grocery aisle.
However, there are still many consumer stocks that have a lot to offer despite this period of upheaval. Wall Street analysts have seen the same inflation data that we all have, and yet these experts are quite bullish on a select group of companies right now. That's because they are closely monitoring financial data on individual companies, even as they are watching consumer price data.
The following 11 consumer-related stocks all get top marks from these experts right now. Some companies have seen their share prices rise in a down market, a few seem like bargains after bearish investors overreacted and sold off shares sharply, and others have long-term growth outlooks that make them attractive if you can look past short-term disruptions.
Depending on your personal investing strategy, one of these 11 consumer stocks may be worth an investment even as we face uncertainty in 2022.

Bath & Body Works, Inc. (BBWI)
In mid-2021, consumer conglomerate L Brands split off its Bath & Body Works (BBWI) unit to separate it from Victoria's Secret & Co (VSCO). That initially benefitted BBWI stock as shares rallied strongly through the end of last year; however, BBWI stock is now down about 50% from its 52-week high thanks to a risk-off environment lately.
SEE MORE The Best (And Worst) Stocks for Rising Prices
Still, the long-term outlook is bright for this newly focused stock. As a personal care products company, Bath & Body Works should enjoy more consistent sales than clear-cut discretionary plays that consumers can abandon in tough economies, such as entertainment.  And when it comes to personal care products, customers tend to be brand loyal instead of shopping around to pinch pennies on inferior products or new items that do not fit their personal tastes and routines.
Analysts at Raymond James just put a Strong Buy rating on BBWI stock in July, with a mammoth $45 price target that is nearly double current share prices. They argue that as comparable sales normalize in the wake of the spinoff and as supply chain and shopping trends get back to pre-pandemic levels, this personal-care retailer has much brighter days ahead. Separately, Wells Fargo and Piper Sandler both reiterated Overweight ratings in recent weeks as a sign of Wall Street optimism for this consumer stock.

Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST)
Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) enjoys an almost cult-like following among U.S. consumers. From its deep discounts on bulk products and gasoline to its popular private-label brand Kirkland, ask a longtime member of COST why they prefer to shop there and you will surely get an earful.
This loyalty really matters in a time of rising prices, because consumers are starting to be more judicious about their spending.
SEE MORE 10 Stocks to Buy When They're Down
COST stock was already on an uptrend after it ended its fiscal 2021 in September with a net sales growth of almost 18%. And looking forward, fiscal 2022 is expected to see growth of between 5% to 10% in sales on top of that. But the real story is one of rising profitability, as earnings per share are forecast to jump from $11.09 last year to $13.06 this year and $14.49 next year. That is an expansion of 18% and 11%, respectively.
What's even more compelling is that Costco’s membership model has been proven to reduce ""shrinkage"" (or loss because of shoplifting, for example) and adds a reliable source of cash flow. With 1.3 million members paying $60 or more a pop, this company has a firm foundation that will help it pay the bills regardless of any short-term disruptions in sales.
Jeffries recently maintained its Buy rating on COST stock in June, with Raymond James, Truist and Baird all offering similar bullish ratings in May.

Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR)
It's reductive, but it's true – when times get tough, discounters like Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR) are safe havens in the consumer sector for investors who want to avoid the fallout of a shift in consumer spending.
In 2015, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar joined forces to create one of the biggest staples discounters out there. And with locations that cater to urban customers via strip malls or underserved communities that may not support a full-service supercenter from Walmart (WMT), a Dollar Tree store is often one of the few places where lower-income Americans can get what they need for their pantries, closets and medicine cabinets.
SEE MORE 15 Best Things to Buy at Dollar Stores (Dollar Tree Included)
As a result, DLTR is riding high even while consumer spending disruption is causing many stocks to roll back their forecasts. In the current fiscal year as well as next year, revenue is set to grow by 5% to 10%. More impressive is the earnings per share growth, however, with EPS set to leap from $5.80 last year to a whopping $8.14 this fiscal year if forecasts hold. That's more than a 40% increase in profits.
Wall Street loves to see numbers like this, and the top ratings from analysts are proof. Citigroup, BMO, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and Barclays are just a few of the leading investment firms that have issued Buy or similar ratings on this stock since May.

LCI Industries (LCII)
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been a few big shifts in American consumer culture–and some of the big ones are a reconnection with the great outdoors and a desire to get out of the city.
This trend has been a boon for LCI Industries (LCII), a firm that manufactures and maintains recreational vehicles (RVs). It's not just these big-ticket vehicles either, which run buyers six figures apiece. It is also all the after-market gear that provides big creature comforts for folks looking to get away: portable patio furniture, awnings, premium mattresses, televisions and sound systems.
In fiscal 2022, LCII is riding recent tailwinds to a projected revenue growth rate of 25%. Earnings are growing even faster at a roughly 60% growth rate. And then there's the generous 3.6% dividend on top of the potential for share appreciation driven by these fundamentals, too.
SEE MORE 10 Dividend Growth Stocks Delivering Impressive Increases
There's clearly risk here, as there is for all consumer stocks in 2022. However, RVs are decidedly a luxury purchase given the big price tags, so they tend to see more resilient sales than compact cars or other vehicles in a downturn. That should add some measure of stability, even amid a challenging economic outlook.

Lowe's Companies Inc. (LOW)
When it comes to home improvement retailers, there's pretty much a duopoly in the U.S. right now between Home Depot (HD) and its competitor Lowe's (LOW). But when it comes to Wall Street expectations and bullish forecasts, there's really only one stock to consider – with LOW the clear winner.
Both companies are largely stagnant, with mature domestic operations growing at a single-digit pace for sales and earnings. However, Lowe's boasts a forward price-to-earnings ratio of less than 14 and a price-to-sales of about 1.3 while HD has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 18 and a price-to-sales ratio of 2.0. That makes LOW more attractive from a valuation perspective.
Furthermore, Lowe's has greater support among Wall Street analysts. Wells Fargo recently reiterated its Overweight rating in June, and Truist, Davidson and Jefferies all maintained Buy or better recommendations in May. The consensus price target of about $240 per share predicts about a 30% upside, and presents one of the best opportunities among consumer stocks right now.
SEE MORE The 25 Cheapest U.S. Cities to Live In
Clearly, there is uncertainty around consumer spending trends. The housing market softened in July, but overall inventory is far below demand.  And that means LOW could be a good investment for those who aren't afraid of consumer-oriented plays despite broader volatility.

MercadoLibre, Inc. (MELI)
As one-time darling Amazon.com (AMZN) has crashed and burned over the last several months, many e-commerce plays have been caught up in the negativity, too. However, fast-growing overseas retailer MercadoLibre (MELI) remains highly rated and continues to offer a great long-term outlook despite this volatility.
MELI is often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America, and for good reason. It operates a consumer-focused internet marketplace that dominates the most populous and lucrative regions in the area, including thriving city centers in Brazil and Argentina. Thanks to its rapid expansion, Wall Street is expecting phenomenal revenue growth of nearly 50% this fiscal year and another 30% expansion in FY2023. Profitability is surging too, with consensus forecasts for earnings to grow five-fold in fiscal 2022.
SEE MORE How to Invest for a Recession
To support its maturing e-commerce operations, MercadoLibre is also branching out into other long-term technology solutions including mobile payments. And with Amazon on its heels, worried more about weathering the storm than putting the screws to this smaller competitor, MELI is set up to shine in the months and years to come even if shares haven't done particularly well in the recent past.
Wall Street's outlook is bullish, with New Street Research, Citi, Goldman, Credit Suisse and others all rating the stock Buy or better in the last several months despite broader volatility. That bodes well for investors who can look past the recent headlines and seize the long-term opportunity in this consumer stock.

MillerKnoll, Inc. (MLKN)
Though not exactly a brand familiar to most consumers, MillerKnoll, Inc. (MLKN) operates a furnishings company that sells a host of residential storage solutions and office desks and chairs under brands that include Knoll, HermanMiller, Edelman and Holly Hunt.
MLKN stock was hit hard over the last year or two thanks to the impact of the pandemic and supply chain disruptions. However, the company is on the upswing as measured by its fundamentals; at the end of June, the Michigan-based company reported strong sales growth of 77% over the prior year, and margins that jumped 230 basis points.
SEE MORE How Senate Breakthrough on Climate Could Benefit ESG Investors
Looking forward, the company continues to realize big cost savings and synergies in the wake of the $1.8 billion acquisition of design brand Knoll in 2021. The recovering sales will align very well with this strategic restructuring and should continue to drive shareholder value in the long term.
With a consensus price target of almost $50 right now, Wall Street analysts are projecting shares to nearly double if projections hold. The icing on the cake is a 2.8% dividend that is only about one-third of projected earnings. That means this payout isn't just sustainable, but ripe for future increases down the road.
Getty Images
Nike Inc. (NKE)
As one of the most dominant consumer brands on the planet, Nike Inc. (NKE) clearly has staying power. But beyond its impressive wholesale footwear and sports apparel businesses, it is increasingly proving itself to be a force in direct-to-consume sales in the wake of the pandemic – cutting out middlemen to reap bigger margins, keep inflation at bay and deliver shareholder value.
In fact, the sportswear giant has spent the better part of four years cutting the accounts of its retail partners to have a better hold on its distribution and sales channels – with wholesale accounts declining by as much as 50%, according to some reports, while sales have marched ever higher.
Although COVID-19 restrictions in China have impacted the company via supply chain disruptions and disappointing international sales results, the company is definitely looking up as these situations start to normalize. Right now, Wall Street is forecasting a roughly 10% revenue expansion both this fiscal year and next year.
SEE MORE Kip ETF 20: The Best Cheap ETFs You Can Buy
The analyst community continues to rate NKE stock highly; Goldman, Barclays, Cowen, Deutsche Bank, Wedbush and Guggenheim all have reiterated Buy or better recommendations on this top consumer stock since late June. That kind of consensus support is a tremendous vote of confidence for shareholders.
Getty Images
Patrick Industries, Inc. (PATK)
Specialty manufacturer Patrick Industries, Inc. (PATK) is a mid-cap stock most investors haven't heard of. That's because it doesn't have any directly consumer-facing operations, instead providing a host of materials and products to the marine industry, manufactured home companies and various outdoor and camping product companies.
SEE MORE 10 Bond Funds to Buy Now
As with previously mentioned LCI Industries, outdoor recreation is a great business to be in after the pandemic. Consider that everyone who ran out and purchased a boat during 2020 and 2021 is now a prospective customer of PATK’s Tumac brand, which makes waterproof covers, or its SeaDek flooring and boat dock unit.  And anyone who bought a new or used RV may now be in the market for its premium Williamsburg captain's chairs, couches and décor.
These are niche products, to be sure, but PATK is a dominant company in this particular niche. And judging by its roughly 20% revenue growth that's projected this year, it has a lot of growth still ahead of it.
Both MKM and Truist initiated coverage recently with Buy recommendations, and Patrick Industries remains among the most highly-rated stocks on Wall Street right now.
Getty Images
TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX)
Apparel and home fashions retailers HomeGoods, TJ Maxx and Marshalls all fall under the banner of consumer stock TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX). That makes this company quite sensitive to household spending trends, but based on bullish Wall Street analysis lately, it seems that this is a stock that could be in store for big-time returns after the dust settles.
At the beginning of 2022, TJX operated about 3,500 stores: 1,280 or so T.J. Maxx locations, 1,150 Marshalls and 850 HomeGoods stores.  Up until a few years ago, the company was fairly reluctant to enter e-commerce sales channels and instead continued to rely almost wholly on brick-and-mortar business.
That changed in 2020 thanks to the pandemic, and it has not always been an easy transition. But now that the company has fully embraced the digital future, things are looking bright despite a generally gloomy consumer outlook on Wall Street. TJX is projecting high single-digit growth both this year and next, with margins expanding thanks to e-commerce opportunities and pricing power.
SEE MORE ETFs Are Now Mainstream. Here's Why They're So Appealing.
Morgan Stanley, Baird, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and others all reiterated their ""buy"" rating on the company after a very impressive May earnings report that included higher-than-expected forecasts for the full year even as other big box brands like Walmart (WMT) missed the mark. This bodes well for future performance, making this a top consumer stock in a difficult market.

Tapestry, Inc. (TPR)
Luxury brands parent Tapestry, Inc. (TPR) is the firm behind Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman products and apparel. Product lines include handbags, fashion accessories, jewelry, eyewear and fragrances for sale at department stores. The company also operates nearly 2,000 retail locations that sell these in-demand goods directly to consumers.
This powerful brand family, along with the pricing power that comes with high-quality and luxurious offerings, has allowed Tapestry to weather a rocky environment better than most. Specifically, TPR is projecting 15% to 20% growth in the top line this year even as inflationary pressures and cutbacks take their toll on other consumer stocks. Additionally, strong international sales – including in mainland China, which is about a year behind the U.S. and Europe in the re-opening of its consumer-focused economy after COVID-19 – will allow for opportunities that other wholly domestic consumer stocks don't enjoy.

Thus far in 2022, Tapestry has been able to raise prices to offset inflation on raw materials without impacting demand, growing sales across all three of its brand segments and through its e-commerce operations. And with a reliable dividend yield of about 3% on top of all that, it's hard to overlook this top consumer stock.
That's probably why Wall Street rates TPR so highly, with Wells Fargo reiterating its Overweight rating in July, and Jeffries upgrading the stock in June.
