2022-08-26 00:00:00+00:00,4 Stocks to Buy Before Back-to-School Shopping Ends,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-stocks-to-buy-before-back-to-school-shopping-ends,,,"Schools across the United States are about to start after the break and parents and students are busy with last-minute shopping. This might be good news for retailers that are struggling as rising costs have made consumers spend cautiously.
The back-to-school season is an important shopping window, that retailers bank on every year. Last year, the back-to-school shopping season proved good for retailers and the prediction is that sales will touch 2021 figures this time around. This makes for a good opportunity to invest in stocks like Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR, Dollar General Corporation DG, Costco Wholesale Corporation COST and The Buckle BKE, which are expected to benefit during this shopping period.
Back-to-School Sales to Grow
Higher prices are playing a major role but even then, the back-to-school shopping season is forecast to be good for retailers. According to the National Retail Federation (“NRF”), spending on school clothing and accessories is expected to touch last year’s record of $37 billion.
Sales hit a record high in 2021 after a no-show in 2020 as the pandemic forced students and teachers to shift to remote teaching and learning. The NRF estimates that families will be spending $864 on average per student this year for shopping during this period. This is $15 more than last year, which keeps sales on track to surpass last year’s figures.
Moreover, back-to-college spending is expected to jump 4% to $73.9 billion, according to the NRF. Together, combined spending is projected to hit $110.7 billion, increasing 2% from the 2021 record of $108.1 billion.
Higher prices have been a concern this year and many parents surveyed by the NRF plan to cut down spending on supplies and reuse last year’s stock. However, sales are expected to surpass last year’s figures.
A separate report from Deloitte, titled 2022 Deloitte Back-to-School Survey, shows that parents will spend $661 per student, on average, in grades K-12 this year compared to $612 spent in 2021, reflecting a jump of 8%.
Inflation is at a 41-year high but prices have been cooling lately, which might bring respite for retailers. Despite the inflationary pressures, the retail sector, which many had predicted would take a bad hit, has been trying to hold on to its ground. Retail sales came in unchanged in July after increasing 0.8% in June.
Excluding automobiles, fuel, building materials and food services, retail sales rose 0.8% in July after increasing 0.7% in June. This shows that the other segments have been faring well and driving sales.
Last year’s back-to-school season gave the retail sector a big boost when it was trying to bounce back from the pandemic-induced lows. This time too, it is expected to give retail sales a much-required push.

2022-08-25 00:00:00+00:00,"Dollar Tree (DLTR) Beats Q2 Earnings Estimates, Cuts View",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-dltr-beats-q2-earnings-estimates-cuts-view,,,"Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR has reported second-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while sales missed the same. The top and bottom lines improved year over year. The results benefited from the continued demand for the company’s products, offset by inflationary pressures and an unfavorable product mix due to the demand shift toward low-margin consumable goods from high-margin discretionary items.

Backed by the inflationary pressures, plans for pricing investment at Family Dollar and consumers’ shift toward consumable products, the company slashed its guidance for fiscal 2022.

Shares of DLTR declined 8.4% in the pre-market trading session on Aug 25, driven by the lower-than-expected sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and a lowered view for fiscal 2022. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 18.2% year to date against the industry's decline of 11%.

 Quarter in Detail
Dollar Tree’s earnings improved 30.1% year over year to $1.60 per share and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57. This marked record second-quarter earnings for the company. Bottom-line growth can be attributed to robust top-line growth, as well as improved margins.

Consolidated net sales advanced 6.7% year over year to $6,768.5 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,785 million. Enterprise same-store sales (comps) improved 4.9% year over year on a constant-currency basis and 4.8% after adjusting for the impacts of Canadian currency fluctuations. For the Dollar Tree banner, comps were up 7.5%, while comps for the Family Dollar banner improved 2%. After adjusting for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, comps for the Dollar Tree banner rose 7.4%.

The gross profit increased 14.2% year over year to $2,124.4 million, while the gross margin expanded 200 bps to 31.4%. Gains from improved initial mark-on, and leverage on distribution and occupancy costs aided gross margin. This was partly negated by higher freight expenses, markdowns, shrink and unfavorable product mix related to a shift toward lower-margin consumable products. The gross margin expanded 500 bps to 37.4% at the Dollar Tree banner and contracted 140 bps to 24.7% at the Family Dollar segment.
Dollar Tree, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
  Dollar Tree, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Dollar Tree, Inc. Quote
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 100 bps to 24% due to elevated repairs and maintenance costs, store payroll, stock compensation expenses, general insurance liability, Utilities, and other ongoing inflationary pressures.

While the operating income rose 25.7% to $505.4 million, the operating margin expanded 120 bps to 7.5%, driven by robust gross margin expansion and sales growth. Segment-wise, the operating margin expanded 530 bps to 15.4% for Dollar Tree and contracted 340 bps to 1.7% for the Family Dollar segment.
Balance Sheet
Dollar Tree ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $688.9 million. Net merchandise inventories increased 47.8% year over year to $5,422.2 million. It had net long-term debt (excluding current maturities) of $3,419.3 million and shareholders’ equity of $8,396.5 million as of Jul 30, 2022.

The company bought back 1,664,717 shares for $235.8 million in second-quarter fiscal 2022, reflecting an average price of $141.67 per share. As of Jul 30, 2022, Dollar Tree had $2.25 billion remaining under its existing authorization.
Store Update
In second-quarter fiscal 2022, Dollar Tree opened 127 stores, expanded or relocated 29 outlets, and shuttered 57 stores. The company completed the renovation of 257 Family Dollar stores to the H2 or Combo Store formats. Additionally, it expanded the multi-price plus offerings to another 697 Dollar Tree stores in the quarter. As of Jul 30, 2022, the company operated 16,231 stores in 48 states and five Canada provinces.
Guidance
Dollar Tree announced plans to make competitive pricing investments in the Family Dollar chain to improve store productivity and profitability in the long run. These efforts will also allow the company to accelerate store growth in the long term. Driven by the investments and the shift of consumers’ preference to more need-based consumable goods, the company expects the gross margin to be pressured in the second half of fiscal 2022. Consequently, it lowered the earnings per share view for fiscal 2022.

The company expects consolidated net sales of $27.85-$28.10 billion compared with the $27.76-$28.14 billion mentioned earlier. It anticipates higher comps growth in fiscal 2022 to be offset by slightly reduced square footage growth compared with the prior view. The company anticipates enterprise comps growth of mid-single digits for fiscal 2022, including a high-single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and positive comps in the Family Dollar segment. It expects selling square footage to increase 3.5% compared with 3.9% growth mentioned earlier.

Management envisions earnings of $7.10-$7.40 per share compared with the prior stated $7.80-$8.20 per share. The revised view indicates 25% earnings per share growth at the mid-point.

For third-quarter fiscal 2022, Dollar Tree expects consolidated net sales of $6.75-$6.87 billion, with enterprise same-store sales growth of mid-single digits. It anticipates earnings of $1.05-$1.20 per share.

Rick Dreiling -- Executive Chairman
Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Mike and I and our new board have been together for just over one quarter now. As planned and expected, change is underway, and we are moving at a fast pace.
We are entirely focused on taking the right steps to transform this organization for the long term through growing and improving Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. We are 90 days further down the road from our lastearnings call and the opportunity and action steps needed continue to become more clear. Our main priorities are our associates, the distribution network and supply chain, Family Dollar's pricing and the value proposition in both segments, store standards and technology. Additionally, and Mike will go into more detail, we have a great deal of work underway to improve the company's culture, designed to build an environment of accountability, empowerment, courageous leadership, transparency and fostering two-way dialogue.
And we are orchestrating these changes in one of the most unique and dynamic environments I've experienced in my retail career. Inflation is at its highest in decades as shoppers are experiencing higher costs related to food, fuel, rent and more. Supply chains have been strained and inconsistent. Inventory levels are higher across retail, and consumer shopping patterns continue to zig and zag.
Let me be very clear. We are not here to take half measures or to defer high return capital and operating investments in order to manage earnings. We are honed in on taking steps necessary to seize the great opportunity for us and deliver to our shareholders, our associates and our customers the great company they deserve. And by executing on this commitment, we will deliver the greatest possible risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.
We will not waver from this strategy. You will hear from Mike and Kevin later in the call about some of the actions we're taking to fix Family Dollar. As you know, our new leadership team is taking shape, and the team is moving to accelerate actions to improve the business. The most notable action is our decision to move forward with price investments that began in July and will carry into the second half intended to close our historical GAAP and pricing to key competitors.
We believe this is a necessary action to provide the right value proposition and a foundational step to improve Family Dollar long term and that it will pay off handsomely. There is much more to do to enhance the results of Family Dollar, and you will hear about some positive improvements beginning to be made later in the call. That said, the refreshed team has been together for about a quarter, and we feel very confident in our ability to fix Family Dollar and materially improve its performance long term and in the process, create enormous value. We are a growth company.
We are making change happen to create long-term shareholder value and enable the next waves of profitable growth for Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. On behalf of our board, I want to thank each of our teams for their efforts on delivering very good results for the second quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are dialed in today from our Annual Field leadership summit. More than 1,000 leaders, including every district manager in the company, have gathered for several days to learn, collaborate and focus on all things Family Dollar and Dollar Tree.
This is our first large in-person meeting since 2019. The energy and excitement here makes me and each of us more inspired than ever. We will transform our culture and company, and we will do this together. Rick just mentioned that we are moving at a fast pace.
The theme of our leadership summit is, in fact, lead with speed. I want to publicly thank all of our participants for their commitment, dedication and focus while attending this great event. I'm proud to be part of your team. At these meetings, we typically talk about our company's strategy and share proof points of our collective successes.
But this year is different. This year, I'm speaking to our leaders about something no less important than strategy. It's our company's culture. Every retailer has a playbook when it comes to strategy.
But what sets the winning companies apart is their culture. Just as Rick mentioned, we are committed to developing a culture of accountability, empowerment, courageous leadership, transparency, and fostering two-way dialogue. We have recognized and acknowledged to ourselves that we have substantial opportunity for improvement in this respect. We have the courage to address this head on, and we would deliver the culture necessary to provide our associates, the customers and the shareholders the greatness they deserve.
Also at this summit, our field leaders got their first look at the initial holiday buys purchase for the new $1.25 price point. We are all excited by the compelling and relevant assortment sourced by Rick McNeely's Dollar Tree merchant team and are very confident our shoppers will be wowed by these new items and the great values over the upcoming holiday season. We are undergoing a period of change, exciting change, and we have accomplished a great deal and what I would call the first 100-plus days since our board was reconstituted. A few months ago, we announced a number of leadership changes.
We are actively engaged in recruiting leaders to the organization with the right perspectives, experiences and skill sets to help transform our company. The great opportunity before us has attracted the attention and interest of the strongest leaders in retail. In just a few months, we have already filled several key roles with exceptional talent, including Larry Gatta as Family Dollar's chief merchant, John Flanigan as our head of enterprise supply chain and Bobby Aflatooni now leads our enterprise IT department. This morning, we announced that Jeff Davis will be joining Dollar Tree as our new CFO.
Jeff has many years of experience as a retail CFO and spent nearly a decade in executive leadership roles with one of the largest retailers. And we have carefully reviewed a field of exceptional candidates for our COO and general counsel executive roles. The teams are gelling, and the new leaders are hitting the ground running. I look forward to sharing upcoming announcements as we round out the executive team for the next waves of growth and transformation for Dollar Tree and the Family Dollar business.
In light of the substantial leadership changes, I felt that we could deliver a more useful and productive event if we will defer our investor day from October until the spring of 2023. We will share more details on the event as it takes shape in the months ahead. Our second quarter performance reinforces the relevance of our brands for millions of households as they continue to face cost pressures across the board. The team delivered increases of 6.7% in sales, 14.2% in gross profit, 25.7% in operating profit and 30.1% in EPS while successfully navigating through another quarter of macro uncertainty.
Now to Q2 performance by banner. I am pleased with the quarter delivered by Family Dollar team. The positive 2% comp represented an acceleration from Q1 on a one, two and three-year stack basis. A 3.3% increase in average ticket more than offset a 1.2% decline in transaction count.
Same-store sales were relatively balanced throughout the quarter as monthly comps range from a positive 1.5 to a positive 2.5. Despite supply chain challenges and OTC-related categories, the consumables comp increased 4% for the quarter. Discretionary comps declined 4.1% as shoppers continued to manage through this inflationary environment. Compared to the prior-year's quarter, we saw 150-basis-point swing in product mix from discretionary to consumables.
In Q2, consumables represented 77.3% of Family Dollar sales compared to 75.8% in Q2 of 2021. The turnaround of Family Dollar is an enormous value creation lever, and it is getting a great deal of focus and attention. Components of the transformation include, as Rick mentioned, a focus on our people, the DC network and supply chain, pricing and the value proposition as well as our technology. Additional factors include enhancing our culture, elevating store standards, developing our private brands, improving category adjacencies, enhancing the product mix, optimizing vendor partnerships and much more.
We are pushing forward on each one of these fronts. We are still early in this journey, but I am enthusiastic about the progress we have made just in the last few months. I want to call out, in particular, the important initiative we have taken on our pricing at Family Dollar. With the recent price investments, we believe Family Dollar is now in a better competitive position on price than it has been for over a decade.
We will continue to refine the Family Dollar value proposition to drive store traffic and productivity, and we will fully expect to see great benefits from these and other actions over time. During the quarter for Family Dollar, we opened 95 new stores, renovated 257 stores and relocated 24 stores. We ended the quarter with more than 540 Combo Stores, which continue to resonate with the shoppers while driving more productivity and more profitability. Moving now to the Dollar Tree segment.
The Dollar Tree banner delivered another strong quarter. Among the highlights, a 7.5% comp, a 37.4% gross margin, 500 basis points above the prior-year's quarter and a 15.4% operating margin, more than 500 basis points over Q2 of last year. The 7.5% comp sales increase was driven by a 14.2% increase in average ticket partially offset by a traffic decline of 5.8%. Importantly, the consumable business at Dollar Tree was strong.
Consumables, which represented 46.8% of the mix in Q2, comped at 7.9%, while discretionary increased 6.7%. The last time the consumable comp exceeded discretionary was at the onset of the pandemic in Q1 of 2020. This demonstrates the success we are seeing in key traffic driving categories where our merchants have been active in enhancing value, such as carbonated beverage, snacks and cookies and food. As a reminder, our reassortment consumables has been more immediate than the discretionary merchandise given the purchasing cycle, and our sales performance demonstrates that shoppers are reacting favorably to refine the value proposition.
Renewed consumables momentum is a good indicator for our continued long-term health of the Dollar Tree banner. The discretionary side of the business was strong despite the negative impact of the limited global supply of helium, which hindered sales of balloon products and the party-related merchandise. Regarding cadence, similar to Family Dollar, comps were relatively balanced throughout the quarter with each month's comping increasing between 6.5% and eight and a half percent. During the quarter for Dollar Tree, we opened 32 new stores and relocated five stores, and we added multi-price assortment to another 697 stores, bringing the total to 2,170 stores as we head into the back half of 2022 and the important holiday season.
I would like to speak to what we are seeing in the business as consumers continue to be burdened by levels of inflation not experienced in decades. Overall, sales performance remains in line with our expectations. And in fact, we have modestly increased expectations for Family Dollar for the back half. There are signs of trade down to our stores, and we are focused on the value proposition for both banners in this environment.
Like many retailers, we are seeing a shift in consumable preferences as many shoppers are gravitating to needs-based consumables, which is impacting our margin through product mix. Our suppliers are being hit with -- by inflation as well. This, along with our commitments to competitive pricing and the value proposition, is expected to negatively impact our gross margins in the near term. Over time, we believe our business should be able to protect its merchandising margin from inflation effects.
And regarding supply chains, from a sourcing perspective, a year ago, we had a backlog of thousands of containers we were working to get through the transpacific shipping lanes. This year, we have a small, manageable backlog. Kevin will go into more detail regarding our updated outlook for the back half of the year. Our outlook will be reduced with most of the guidance reduction related to the Family Dollar as we take action to improve that banner.
Of the total, more than half of our guidance reduction is due to pricing actions taken at Family Dollar. The remainder is due to mix shift differences and inflationary cost increases on consumables at both banners. None of this dampens my enthusiasm for our long-term prospects. I'll now hand the call over to Kevin to provide more color on Q2 and our updated outlook.
Kevin Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mike, and good morning. For the quarter, consolidated net sales increased 6.7% to $6.77 billion, comprised of $3.57 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.19 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 4.9%. Comps for the Dollar Tree segment increased 7.5%, and Family Dollar same-store sales increased 2%.
At both banners, the increase in average ticket more than offset the decline in transaction count as shoppers continue to consolidate trips as gas prices are significantly higher than a year ago. Gross profit improved 14.2% to $2.12 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 31.4% compared to 29.4% in the prior-year's quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment increased 500 basis points to 37.4% compared to 32.4% for the same period last year as a result of the net of the following.
Merchandise costs, including freight, decreased 455 basis points primarily due to higher initial mark on, partially offset by higher freight costs and increased sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise. Occupancy costs decreased 50 basis points from leverage on the comp sales increase. Distribution costs decreased 20 basis points from leverage and higher capitalized amounts due to increases in inventory levels partially offset by higher hourly wages and higher DC maintenance and compliance costs. And shrink increased 20 basis points primarily from more favorable results in relation to accruals in the prior-year quarter.
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment decreased 140 basis points to 24.7% compared to 26.1% for the same period last year. The factors include markdown costs increased 80 basis points due to higher promotional and price action markdowns. Shrink increased 45 basis points primarily from more favorable results in relation to accruals in the prior-year quarter. And merchandise costs, including freight, increased 15 basis points, primarily due to higher freight costs and higher sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise, partially offset by higher initial mark on.
Similar to Q1, consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased 100 basis points. The SG&A rate for the quarter was 24% compared to 23% in Q2 last year with Dollar Tree favorable to prior year, more than offset by Family Dollar and slightly higher corporate costs. For the second quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment improved 30 basis points to 22% when compared to the prior-year's quarter. Payroll costs improved 90 basis points from leverage on the 7.5% comp and favorable development of workers' comp claims, partially offset by the annualization of minimum wage increases and investments in store payroll; other SG&A, which increased approximately 40 basis points, resulting from unfavorable development of general liability insurance claims; and inflationary pressure across several expense categories.
Facilities costs increased 10 basis points primarily from higher utility and repairs and maintenance as we focus on improving store conditions. For the Family Dollar segment, the second quarter SG&A rate increased 200 basis points to 23% compared to 21% in the prior-year's quarter. Payroll expenses increased 70 basis points, primarily due to hourly wages and investment in store payroll and an increase in workers' compensation expense due to favorable accrual adjustments in the prior year, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses. Store facility costs increased 50 basis points, primarily from higher utility costs and an increase in repairs and maintenance expense as we focus on improved store conditions for our customers and associates.
Other SG&A expenses increased 45 basis points due to higher legal fees, debit and credit card transaction fees, store supply expense and inflationary pressure across several expense categories. Depreciation and amortization increased 30 basis points related to elevated capital expenditures for store renovations and improvements. Corporate support and other expense as a percentage of total revenue was 1.5% compared to the prior-year quarter of 1.3%. The higher costs primarily consist of increased stock compensation costs.
Operating income improved 25.7% to $505.4 million or 7.5% of total revenue in the second quarter, an improvement of 120 basis points compared to a year ago. Nonoperating expenses totaled $30.7 million, comprised primarily of net interest expense. The effective tax rate was 24.2% compared to 23.5% in the prior-year's quarter, resulting from higher state tax rates and lower work opportunity tax credits as a percentage of pre-tax income in the current year's quarter. Net income for the quarter improved 27.4% to $359.9 million or $1.60 per diluted share.
This compares to net earnings of $282.4 million or $1.23 per diluted share in the prior-year's quarter. Looking at the balance sheet. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $689 million compared to $985 million at the end of fiscal 2021. Outstanding debt as of July 30 was $3.45 billion.
The company repurchased approximately 1.66 million shares at an average price of $141.67 in Q2 or $235.8 million under the share repurchase authorization. Compared to last year, inventory levels at Dollar Tree are up 59.7% in dollars due to increased capitalized freight and distribution costs, additional multi-price Plus inventory and a significant increase in import inventory in transit compared to the prior year. Total units per store are up approximately 20% to prepandemic Q2 2019 levels but are expected to normalize as we go through the back half of the year. The inventory is fresh and basic in nature and does not represent a significant markdown risk.
Inventory levels at Family Dollar increased 35.7% compared to Q2 last year due to increased capitalized freight and distribution costs and an increase in the average unit cost. Total units per store are below prepandemic Q2 2019 levels. Capital expenditures were $276.2 million in the second quarter versus $229.1 million in Q2 of last year. For fiscal 2022, we currently expect that consolidated capital expenditures will be approximately $1.4 billion.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $193.5 million for Q2 compared to $176.1 million in the second quarter of last year. For fiscal 2022, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $770 million. As we look to the back half of 2022, we see the following affecting our business. As Mike mentioned, we are accelerating price investments in our Family Dollar business.
These investments are designed to improve the value proposition for our shoppers and to drive traffic and store productivity. This investment has a near-term impact on profit, but we expect it to accrue long-term benefit. We have seen consumer purchasing shift based on economic conditions to a more consumable-based basket at both banners, which will negatively impact our expected mix and product margin. Dollar Tree's sales continue to be negatively affected by the global helium shortage.
This directly affects balloon sales, but also has a halo effect on the entire party department. In general, stores with helium are comping positive in the party category, while those without helium are running negative comps. The delta is a 10%-plus comp differential in one of our largest high-margin discretionary categories. Our over-the-counter categories are being negatively affected by our supply chain challenges.
This is creating a higher level of out of stocks in this category. We plan to continue to increase our investment in payroll in our stores in the back half. The labor market remains dynamic, and we are proactively addressing select markets to attract and retain associates. We are making investments in our stores and distribution centers through repairs and maintenance as well as compliance programs to ensure a great shopping and working environment.
Based on these factors, diluted earnings per share for the full year is now expected to range from $7.10 to $7.40. This represents a $0.75 per share adjustment to the prior outlook based on the midpoint and is comprised of the following components. Roughly 60% of the change relates to the price investments at Family Dollar. An estimated 20% of the change relates to the margin impact of the mix shift toward needs-based consumables, projected to be a 300-basis-point shift at Family Dollar and a 150-basis-point shift at Dollar Tree in the back half.
Again, the majority of this impact is expected to be on the Family Dollar side of the business. We are experiencing some degree of inflationary-related product cost increases, especially in lower-margin consumables, primarily at Dollar Tree, contributing to approximately 15% of the guide adjustment. As we have for decades, we have the ability to alter or reassort product based on cost changes, but this can take a few quarters, hence the near-term profit impact. And a small component of the guide adjustment relates to other items including our commitment to improve store conditions.
As a result of the aforementioned factors, most notably our accelerated price investment, we are expecting Family Dollar to be approximately breakeven from a segment operating margin perspective in the second half, down from its first half margin of approximately 2%. Consolidated net sales for the year are now expected to range from $27.85 billion to $28.10 billion with slightly higher comps offset by slightly reduced square footage growth relative to prior guidance. We expect to deliver a mid-single-digit comparable store sales increase for the year comprised of a high single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and a positive increase in the Family Dollar segment. Selling square footage is expected to grow by approximately 3.5%, down slightly from prior guidance due to the supply chain delays related to procuring equipment and fixtures for store openings.
For Q3, we estimate consolidated net sales will range from $6.75 billion to $6.87 billion based on a mid-single-digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter is expected to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.20 per share. Other considerations for our updated 2022 outlook include the following. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $31 million in Q3 and $125 million for the year.
Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 23.6% for the third quarter and 23.8% for fiscal 2022. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 224.8 million shares for Q3 and 225.4 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. As of July 30, we had $2.25 billion remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.
And I'll now turn the call back over to Mike.
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Kevin. As we continue to navigate through this dynamic and somewhat uncertain environment, we are excited about the continued progress at Dollar Tree and the material positive changes beginning to be made at Family Dollar. At Dollar Tree, as it relates to our multi-price offering, the team is continuing to refine the $3 and $5 assortment and testing various concepts to enhance the program and build on the very positive long-term impact from our multi-price offering. For example, test of multi-price frozen foods are driving exceptional sales productivity as the new offering is delivering tremendous value and meeting family portion needs such as frozen meals, pizza and ice cream.
At Family Dollar, our Combo Store initiative continues to drive improved store performance at very attractive levels, in line with previous commentary. In fact, we are now exploring various sizes and formats in other markets beyond our rural target locations, pursued in our first iteration of the concept. Some of the initiatives to improve the business will take more time to produce an impact, notably in the supply chain and technology. That said, at Family Dollar, the work being done by Larry Gatta's merchandising and marketing teams has been remarkable and is beginning to be actioned upon more urgently.
In fact, we have made a number of enhancements to our H2 strategic store format. We refer to the new version as H2.5. Among the changes made to improve store productivity, customer satisfaction and to better support our store associates through efficiencies include: adding a linear footage, developing seasonal assortments as a focal point, utilizing deeper shelving on key consumable categories to enhance store efficiencies and improve in-stocks, expanding the direct-to-store delivery offering, enhancing space dedicated to snacks and increasing the beverage offering and optimizing the frozen food assortments. At our leadership summit, the merchandising team shared the field leaders a wide array of consumables and discretionary merchandising initiatives to drive traffic and sales at Family Dollar.
Our marketing teams are currently focused on four key initiatives: refreshing Family Dollar's brand positioning, evolving to a more productive ad program, relaunching our Smart Coupon program and expanding our Boys & Girls Clubs of America partnership to be a good partner in the communities that we serve. We believe that these key initiatives are beginning to have an impact, and consumers are increasingly looking to our stores to meet their needs. We believe the time is right to accelerate actions to better serve customers by providing an exceptional value proposition. We will go into more details on these initiatives and broader plans to transform Family Dollar and continue delivering great success at Dollar Tree in the quarters ahead and at our investor day in the spring of 2023.
And I want to briefly share a few initiatives that Bobby Aflatooni's IT team are focused on to provide better support for our stores. These include: improving DC and store in-stock service levels through refinement of our demand forecasting, allocation and replenishment systems for both banners; improving customer satisfaction and driving through enhanced ability to support more complex promotional offers, such as buy a product A and get a discount on the product B; supporting field leadership and store efficiencies with improved labor systems; and enhancing our enterprisewide data integration platforms. Before we go into Q&A, as I had previously announced, Kevin will be transitioning out of his role as Dollar Tree's CFO. Kevin has been instrumental in the company's growth and success since joining the organization in 2008.
During Kevin's tenure, Dollar Tree has grown from 3,600 stores to more than 16,200 stores, from annual sales of $4.6 billion to more than $26 billion and from annual operating profits of $365 million to more than $1.8 billion. When Kevin joined Dollar Tree in December 2008, shares were trading at a split adjusted price of just $13 or $14 per share. I would like to publicly thank Kevin for his commitment, stewardship and significant contributions to Dollar Tree and its stakeholders over the last 14 years. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.
Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett Research Advisors -- Analyst
Hey, thanks. Good morning. Rick, I'm curious, since you joined the company 90 days ago, what have been the biggest surprises for you, both positive and negative? And when you talk about steps to improve the store standards at Family Dollar and the DC network across both banners, can you elaborate a little bit more for us? And do you see any offsets in the P&L to help fund those actions?
Rick Dreiling -- Executive Chairman
Yeah, I'll start here and then turn it over to Michael. The positive, I have to tell you, the enthusiasm within the organization, and its willingness to embrace change. The interesting thing has been, there's not a lot of things we're talking about that people, Chuck, aren't shaking their head, yes, let's go get it done. So that, to me, is the foundation of this.
And the company has made a major commitment to culture enhancement. In fact, we spent our near whole day just talking about how to manage people and how people need to be managed. And we spent a whole day just listening to people to hear what they're dealing with. Probably on the negative side, the pricing gap was a little bit larger than we thought.
And we also believe this is a great time for customer trial, and we want to be right on our pricing. In terms of the supply chain side, we're looking at everything in the supply chain. We are assembling, I think Mike would agree, probably one of the best supply chain teams in the country. We have a lot of distribution centers that need to be updated and modernized.
So we're feeling really good on how we're approaching that. The IT side, information technology, I might classify as a little bit bigger surprise in that there's a lot of basic things that the operators and the merchants need and the supply chain needs. So with that, Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything?
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
No, I think Rick said it right. On the store side, I think the biggest thing is, is we're focusing the entire organization from a culture perspective on doing everything that we can do to make our store associates successful and enabling them to run better, cleaner, fuller stores. And we've -- I said -- I shared in my opening that we're here right now from our summit with -- every district manager in the country is here, and we are all aligned behind driving better store conditions. And that's going to entail in your question is, yes, we're going to continue to invest, and as Kevin said, into our property management and in everything we need to, to make sure our store conditions are the way -- to our standards for our customers, and we're committed to do that.
And more importantly, our associates are enthusiastic, not only about the culture of supporting them and putting them at the center of everything that we do. But then they see the proof points of we're investing in pricing, we're improving our logistics. Larry is improving the merchandising, and they're seeing better assortment, more linear footage where the customers shop. And then I think Rick nailed it on the supply chain.
We're doing everything we can and turning all the leaves over to drive efficiencies and improvements and really ultimately to supply our stores more efficiently with the product they need and when they need it.
Operator
And we'll go ahead and move on to our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
John Heinbockel -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst
Yeah. I want to drill into pricing and investments at FD here, right. So how do you think the maturity of the price investments will play out, right? Immediately, it's deflationary, right, to comp until people recognize the benefit then traffic picks up. How does that play out? Is it more challenging in an inflationary environment to change your price perception? And then do you think most of the investments at FDO will be limited to '22, right, or do you think there's a bunch that -- other than just a wraparound, a bunch that will occur in '23 as well.
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thanks for the question. And like I said earlier, the time is right right now. And the reason we really looked at it is because we saw new customers shifting our way. In this inflationary environment, we think it's a perfect time to really change the customer's perception and what they're seeing in our stores because we're getting new customers and new eyes in our stores and our existing customers.
They're feeling pressured like they never have before. And in this inflationary environment, with the customer's wallet stretched, our consumers are relying on our stores to meet their budget goals. And we're seeing good demand trends. So this was really an ideal environment to begin to move more quickly than we previously anticipated to more fully meet the customers' value expectation, close the pricing gaps and win them as customers long term in this inflationary budget.
We think the time was right. We -- initially, we talked about it in our outlook, and we were going to do this over time, starting with, of course, our KVIs, the known value items. But then just as we saw the dynamic environment, the pressure on our customers and the inflation, we decided that now is the time to win these customers for the long term and get it right. And to your question, it's now.
It's we are. Like I said, we are in the best price position in over 10 years to the competitive market. So we're there. Now it's just managing it from here.
And getting right on our promotions. And Larry is going to continue rocking the H2.5 in the assortment. So we're in a great place right now.
Operator
And we'll go ahead and move on to our next question with Matt Boss from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Matt Boss -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Great. Thanks. So at the Dollar Tree banner, what was the cadence of top-line trends during the second quarter? Any color on August or just drivers of confidence in holding high single-digit performance in the back half? And then on Dollar Tree banner gross margin, could you just touch on any puts and takes in the back half of the year to consider and how you're thinking about multiyear gross margin at the Dollar Tree banner?
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thanks for the question. And as I shared, it was pretty stable throughout the summer at Dollar Tree on our comp, six and a half to eight and a half percent. And remember that, and Dollar Tree really does well around the seasons. And in the second quarter, the biggest season is graduation.
And you heard Kevin say we were really impacted by helium supply in one of our largest categories. That really has a halo effect over party. So largest category, most profitability for Dollar Tree. So that was one of the impacts.
On the good news, the other big season is lawn and garden, and lawn and garden season was one of the top five categories. So when we had the product, our customer is responding very, very well. And then the other categories that did well is, as Kevin said and I said, the shift to consumables, and our merchants reassorted and reinvested in the consumable items to drive traffic. The other top five categories, again, were beverages, candy, snacks and cookies and food.
So our customers are responding very, very well. And early in -- it's really early into Q3, but we see so far this month trending better than Q2 at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar both. And as you think about the margins in the back, where we're at -- as Kevin shared, our inventory is up. But remember, this time last year, we had thousands of containers at origin, meaning it wasn't even at our system.
It wasn't even at the origin yet. So now all that is in our system. We're getting our seasonal on time. And it's also -- remember, our merchants at Dollar Tree bought for the back half at the $1.25.
The product is amazing. All of our district managers, regional directors, all of our field associates are here with us right now. And they see the exciting items, and they're thrilled. A, we've got the product when we want it.
And B, newly assorted $1.25 will blow the market away, and our customers are going to respond well. And we're very excited about it. Kevin can kind of touch on some of the margin puts and takes in the back half.
Kevin Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. As you look at it, Matt, obviously, as we talked this year, freight, which was a big headwind last year, and to the first half of this year, we said it would still be a headwind as we annualized last year rates, and we've said that into the back half, then it starts to level out. We still see that. Obviously, with -- if diesel continues to move down, that will be helpful as well.
But again, I think as you look at the Dollar Tree gross margin rate, I think Q3 will be a little lower than Q2, but then you'll see it pop back a little bit in Q4, which is highly discretionary quarter for us. So that's kind of the trend you'll see. As I think about the multiyear gross margin, as you think about it, again, looking to build traffic, looking to -- as we build the -- again, really changing the stores. We now have 2,000 Dollar Tree Plus stores as we look at, again, continuing to further the assortment of the $1.25 price point.
And then would look to see that the freight rates do start to come down and have an effect in next year. So there are some things that will play into that. A little early to really talk specifically. But I think those are kind of the moving pieces as we see them.
Operator
We'll go ahead and move on to the next question from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Robby Ohmes -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping we could get a little more color. I think you mentioned trade down.
And maybe some more discussion about the environment. The transactions were up at Walmart, Target and warehouse clubs. And I was just curious why the transactions are so much stronger versus being down at Family Dollar and Dollar Tree and if we should expect some improvement in the transactions. Thanks.
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. We expect improvement in our transactions, especially as the pricing moves that we've made, the assortment changes that Larry Gatta and the merchants are making and bringing in some new adjacencies and our seasonal product that we have ready. Just a little pressure -- as you said, our customer is pressured like none other. And the good news is, is we're excited.
We see third-party data that we do have a lot of new customers coming into both banners over last year. And the majority of them are at a household income of $80,000 or higher. So we feel good about that. We also see a huge shift from cash into credit, which tells us the customer is pressured.
And then inside the store, when they get in there, we've seen in the industry where private brands have outpaced national brands for 24 weeks in a row now, 24 weeks in a row. That hasn't happened in the last five years, that private brands has outpaced national brands. And that's the customer trying to stretch their dollar and manage their budget. And Larry and the team are working hard on our private brands, and we're seeing the same change inside of our store.
And then they're even making decisions on form and function. We see them moving from liquid to powder detergent. We're seeing them even go without softener -- liquid softener in detergents. They're just choosing not to have softener.
And those are the things that our customers are -- and the decisions they're making. And we think right now, with the price investments and the changes that Larry is making and our new assortment at Dollar Tree, we're in a wonderful position to meet their needs in 16,000 stores conveniently located where they don't have to drive far. We'll meet their needs and we're excited about it going forward.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please go ahead.
Scot Ciccarelli -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. So I wanted to revisit the question that I actually asked last quarter. So we know that, in general, retail turnarounds take longer, costs more than what people generally expect.
And last quarter, when I asked about that, your comment was that for the investments for '22, it was all embedded in your outlook. So given the change this morning and the fact that you've now had more time to evaluate the improvements that need to be made, do you have a better view of how much more investment may be needed to get Dollar Tree and Family Dollar where you want them from an operational and technological standpoint?
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And Bobby is -- that's a great question. And our team is forming right now. And I think from an opex perspective, we're going to continue to invest in labor where we need to.
And there will be payroll investments going forward. For this year, as far as we can see with the dynamic markets going on, it is embedded in our forecast. From the IT and supply chain, I think those are the two big ones. And what Bobby is looking at right now, the good news is, and I think Rick mentioned it, Bobby knows every one of our systems.
And he knows exactly what he needs to do because he's done this before at other retailers, and he's worked with the two executives in supply chain and merchandising. So Bobby is working really hard. And I will owe you that number probably up in the spring when we have our investor day because that is going to be a longer-term outlook, and the majority of it is going to be in capex. And then the same thing with supply chain.
We're looking at what is the best way to deliver to our stores, what's the most efficient way to use our network to deliver our Combo Stores, our Dollar Tree Plus stores and, of course, our traditional Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores. And John is working on that now and modeling it out, and we'll probably have more information on the spring as the -- as we have more knowledge from the two leaders. Our CFO that we just announced is going to be coming on board and will certainly have a say in it and will want to look at it. But those are the two big investments.
But in our opex and in our forecast, from a repair and maintenance and store conditions perspective, we have those embedded in and we will probably come back to you if there's any other longer-term initiatives that will impact that.
Operator
We'll move on to our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Hey. Good morning, everyone. It's Simeon Gutman. For Mike and Rick, this is maybe more theoretical on timing and sequencing.
It looks like '23 may end up being more transitional, and that's part one of the question. Is that fair? Because some of these price investments will continue and then we're going to lap some of the multi -- or the breaking the buck at the tree. So if that's a fair assumption, how do you think about maybe speeding up investments, layering -- leaning in, I guess, for '23 to clear the path for '24?
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And in theory, I think you're right. But our pricing investment is in, and then we're just going to manage that going forward on that side of it. I think we will lean in on our investments on supply chain and IT, but these are things that take time just because of the amount of systems that you are touching.
And as Rick said, it's our -- as our store and retail systems, as our supply chain systems and then our merchandising systems. So that will take time, and we will stage that over our capability. And then the supply chain will be -- as we roll out and open new distribution centers, that's when we will continue to rightsize our network and make decisions going forward. So we will continue to move with speed that will give us the highest return as quick as possible.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Kate McShane -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. It looks like the elasticity response improved again sequentially with the $1.25 change.
Just wondered what your expectation for the response is for the second half and if that's changed meaningfully from what you were thinking when we last spoke to last quarter.
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. No, I think the biggest change is the dynamic of the marketplace and the huge shift from discretionary to consumables, not the shift about our $1.25. We did some in-depth customer research and customer intercepts about Dollar Tree at the beginning of the quarter. And we really wanted to dig into our brand and the assortment and in-store experience.
And I was shocked. Not one of them brought up price. Not one of them brought up the $1.25. They were all focused on clean, new assortments, seasonal and the service of the -- what they have when they're in the stores.
So I think the customers move beyond that because as we tested early on, they understand value more than ever. And in today's dynamics, they see that $1.25 is an exceptional value. That's why all these new items and consumables are all taking off. And why I'm excited about the back half -- and to your point, the second quarter did not really have any big season.
Dollar Tree is all about the seasons. We change like the leaves on the trees. Well, in the summer, the leaves aren't changing because you've got lawn and garden and then you've got graduation, and graduation was impacted by helium. On the back half, Kevin said we've got 2,000, 2,100 actually, Dollar Tree Pluses that we didn't have.
So that's going to be -- that's exciting about the back half. And then our inventory. We've got all of our seasonal inventory at $1.25. And they will rally around this seasonal merchandise, just like they did in the first quarter with Valentine's and Easter.
We expect some exciting things and great response from our customers because we're in a great inventory position. The value is spectacular. And then on the basic side, we've answered that on the consumables that we didn't have last year at this time. So I'm pretty excited about the back half of Dollar Tree.
Operator
We'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Please go ahead.
Scott Mushkin -- R5 Capital -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just wanted to get into a little bit more about labor, some of the comments you said about labor and the labor competition and what kind of pressure that might put on you as you try to get that more where you want it to be.
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Scott, and thanks. Early on, we shared that we're investing over $195 million, just under $200 million in our payroll, the majority of it in our store associates and some of it in our DCs. We feel really good where we're at in our distribution centers. We've got all of our roles filled compared to this time last year where we didn't have open positions.
We are continuing to invest in markets in the stores and at retail stores, and we will continue to do that where we see the need. Looking out over the back half of the year, where we need to make adjustments is already in our forecast. So it's a dynamic environment. Now people are coming back to work a little bit just because of what's going on in the economy.
So I think that's going to shift a little bit, but we will continue to invest where we need to. And so far, in the next six months, looking for the rest of the year, we have what we need to invest in the forecast.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Michael Montani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to dig into a little bit further, if I could. The top kind of two to three drivers of traffic for both banners moving forward and kind of what the realistic time line to anticipate the shift.
Obviously, there's pricing actions you're doing at Family Dollar, but then prices have gone up at Dollar Tree. So just kind of talk about, if you could there, Rick and Mike, what gives you the confidence and what's the time line to get those things turned up?
Kevin Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Well, go ahead, Rick.
Rick Dreiling -- Executive Chairman
Yeah, I was just going to say, I just got done saying the excitement on the Dollar Tree side. Our assortment and the investments we've made into the new $1.25 on the consumable side is driving traffic. And just to put that in perspective, we haven't seen that kind of improvement in consumables, which drives traffic since pre pandemic. So that's our investment, and that's how we're driving traffic, along with the unbelievable assortment coming up that they're going to see inside our store for the seasons coming up.
Unlike anybody else, Dollar Tree -- the $1.25 is the best value, the best wow and the most excitement. And then on the Family Dollar side, this pricing, again, we just put ourselves in a position to be the best price to the market in over 10 years. That alone will drive traffic, not even mentioning what Larry Gatta and the merchants are doing with enhancing our H2.5 with a tighter assortment, more meaningful prices, take advantage of more linear foot, so getting more product on the shelf that the customer is looking for. And then getting seasonal upfront and center.
So I'm really excited about the moves that we've made. Now as you know, it takes time for the customer -- we've got new customers coming in that are recognizing it. And then over time, we will see and get credit for being priced right, better assortment, better position on the Family Dollar side. And Larry's -- and I mentioned purposefully on marketing, we've got four great marketing perspectives going on with our digital marketing, with our print ad, and Larry is really working on exactly what do we need to advertise that the customer responds to that drives traffic.
So those are all the levers that the merchants and Larry are pulling on the Family Dollar side, and I'm just thrilled about what we got going on on the Dollar Tree side to keep growing.

And our last question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So Rick, you've been around the value retail space for a long time. Presumably, you came in and over the last 90 days, you said, look, we need to get Family Dollar price perception at a better spot in order to realize the full potential of this asset over the long run and we have this opportunity because Dollar Tree gross margins are expanding, and we can use that expansion to fund investments at Family Dollar.
So now the question is, with Dollar Tree exiting this year at a 37% to 38% gross margin rate and Family Dollar exiting this year with a low 20s gross margin rate, can Dollar Tree sustain the 37% to 38% gross margin rate over the long run? And can you rebuild Family Dollar's gross margin rate over the long run in order to generate a suitable return on these investments?
Rick Dreiling -- Executive Chairman
I think the answer to that is we're very comfortable with where we are on the gross margin in Dollar Tree for the back half of the year and going forward. And I will say we are working our way with the vendor community, with vendor support and we anticipate that the Family Dollar margin will improve over time.
Operator
And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand it back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Randy Guiler -- Vice President, Investor Relations

EAT reported mixed fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues beating the same. Following the announcement, shares of the company declined 4.9% during trading hours on Aug 24. The bottom line was negatively impacted by high inflation.
Earnings & Revenue Discussion
In the quarter under review, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.15, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16. In the prior-year quarter, the company had reported an adjusted EPS of $1.68.

During the fiscal fourth quarter, total revenues of $1,021.5 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,017 million by 0.4%. The top line increased 1.3% on a year-over-year basis. The company gained from the solid performance of Maggiano's.
Chili's
Chili’s revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter decreased 1.1% year over year to $904.2 million. The decline was primarily due to the impact of the additional operating week in the prior year as well as the decline in To-Go sales, marginally overshadowed by dining room sales growth. Moreover, the acquisition of 66 restaurants in fiscal 2022 (previously owned by franchisees) added to the positives in the prior year’s quarter.

Chili's company restaurant expenses (as a percentage of company sales) in the fiscal fourth quarter increased to 89.8% year over year from 82.9% reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside can be attributed to a rise in commodity costs, sales deleverage, advertising, utility expenses, rent expenses and increased restaurant labor costs, which include wage rates.

Chili's company-owned traffic in the quarter decreased 5.7% year over year compared with the 51.2% growth reported in the prior-year quarter.

The segment’s company-owned comps increased 3.1% in the fiscal fourth quarter from the year-ago quarter’s levels.

At Chili's, domestic comps (including company-owned and franchised) rose 0.1% year over year compared with a 62.1% rise reported in the prior-year quarter.

Maggiano's company restaurant expenses (as a percentage of company sales) in the fiscal fourth quarter were 89% compared with 85% reported in the prior-year quarter. The increase was due to a rise in commodity costs, restaurant labor costs, manager bonuses and supervision expenses.

ANF plunged more than 12% before the start of the trading session on Aug 25, following the sluggish second-quarter fiscal 2022, wherein the top and bottom lines fell year over year.

Results were hurt by the current challenging environment and weakness in its Hollister brand, stemming from inflation and the shift in consumer preference, which further led to lower-than-expected conversion and basket size. That said, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company remains on track with its 2025 Always Forward plan.

Going ahead, management expects the headwinds to persist. As a result, it has been making efforts to adjust receipts across brands, improve inventory levels and monitor sales volumes.

Although year-over-year inventory growth peaked in the fiscal second quarter, it is likely to recover in the second half of fiscal 2022. In August, the company witnessed a steady improvement in the weekly sales trend, the uncertain environment is predicted to linger in the back half of fiscal 2022. It also revised its fiscal 2022 view and issued the third-quarter guidance, which seem drab.

Shares of ANF have lost 22.9% in the past three months compared with the industry's decline of 1.4%.

 Sales & Earnings Picture
Abercrombie has reported an adjusted loss of 30 cents per share in second-quarter fiscal 2022 that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 23 cents and reflected a significant decline from earnings of $1.70 in the year-ago quarter.

Net sales of $805.1 million declined 7% year over year and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $848 million. This marked the highest sales since 2015. The metric also fell 4% on a constant currency basis. Also, the company has noted that average unit retail (AUR) improved for the ninth consecutive quarter.
Sales By Region and Brands
Sales were strong in the United States, down 4% year over year to $578.1 million. International sales declined 14% year over year to $227 million. Sales in EMEA fell 13% year over year to $166.8 million. In APAC, sales declined 33% to $27.8 million.

Brand-wise, net sales at Hollister declined 15% year over year to $436.9 million, while at Abercrombie, sales advanced 5% to $368.2 million.
Margins
The gross profit declined 17.3% year over year to $465.9 million. The gross margin contracted 730 bps to 57.9%. The decline can be attributed to 750 bps of higher product costs and 30 bps of unfavorable currency impact, partly offset by AUR growth.

Operating expenses, excluding other operating income, increased 4% from the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to inflation and higher digital fulfillment expenses, which somewhat offset lower incentive-based compensation.

Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
  Abercrombie & Fitch Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Abercrombie & Fitch Company Quote
Outlook
For third-quarter fiscal 2022, management envisions a net sales decline in the high-single-digits from the third-quarter fiscal 2021 reported level of $905 million. The sales view includes a 220-bps impact from adverse currency rates. The company anticipates operating margin to be break-even in the fiscal third quarter mainly due to dismal sales and lower AURs.

For fiscal 2022, the company anticipates a net sales decline in the mid-single digits compared with the prior mentioned flat to up 2%, whereas it reported $3.7 billion in fiscal 2021. The sales outlook assumes a negative impact of 200 bps from foreign currency.

The company expects an operating margin of 1-3%, which reflects a decline from the prior mentioned 5-6%. This can be attributable to lower AURs, which are likely to be partly offset by reduced expenses, adjusted inventory receipt levels and cadence by region in response to current market forces.

Capital expenditure is forecast to be $150 million.

2022-08-25 00:00:00+00:00,MORNING BID-Bond quake,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/morning-bid-bond-quake,,,"A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan
With everyone watching Wyoming, global bond markets have shuddered again this week even as stock markets stabilised.
Whatever signals are sent by Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell or the long list of overseas central bankers at the Jackson Hole conference starting on Thursday, upward pressure on bond yields has intensified regardless.
Energy-driven inflation fears are mounting again, especially in Europe, as natural gas and power prices continue to soar and crude oil prices rebound.
And even though central banks will be forced to keep lifting interest rates, looming recessions this winter are raising doubts about whether monetary authorities will have the scope or willingness to get price rises back to target any time soon.
On top of that, estimates of the bill for governments in easing the household and business energy shocks is mounting - with some reports this week it could cost the British government up to 100 billion pounds ($118.4 billion), most of which would have to be borrowed on bill and bond markets.
While governments have successfully managed such crisis borrowing over the past 15 years, it was done when the cost of that borrowing was falling. With inflation now back in the mix, those borrowing rates are rising sharply while central banks' 'quantitative easing' programmes are being reversed as they unwind balance sheet bond holdings and lean against the bond markets rather than supporting them.
That makes for a potentially bruising further repricing of bonds and questions whether government debt pressures will allow central banks to put inflation back in the bottle.
U.S. 2- and 10-year Treasury yields climbed to their highest levels since June on Wednesday and have held those moves today. Much of the gains were driven by higher 2-, 5- and 10-year inflation expectations, with some citing President Joe Biden's student debt forgiveness plan as aggravating the price outlook.
But the bond yield surge was global and arguably driven by a rise in British gilts, where 2-year yields hit their highest since the crash of 2008 and the 2-10 year yield curve was more inverted than at any time since then too.
German 10-year yields also hit their highest since June, with better-than-expected German second-quarter GDP and August business surveys on Thursday. . European Central Bank policy meeting minutes are due later.
Stocks continued to hold up despite the bond jolt and U.S. futures are up before the open on Thursday, with China's latest $44 billion fiscal stimulus helping the mood in Asia too.
The dollar retreated from recent highs too, with many citing reports that China's FX regulator warned banks against selling yuan.
South Korea's central bank raised its benchmark policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.50%, resuming normal-sized 25 basis point increments after delivering an unprecedented 50-basis point hike in July.
Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:
* U.S. Q2 revision of GDP, core PCE; weekly jobless claims; August Kansas City Fed Manufacturing Activity index
* Annual Jackson Hole central bank forum begins
* ECB minutes of July policy meeting * Earnings: Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Peloton, Affirm, Workday, Marvell Technology
* U.S. Treasury auctions 7-year notes; UK auctions 2025 gilts

Strategic Moves a Key Lever
The recent buyout of myFitment will help eBay expand its presence in the booming motor vehicle parts market.
The underlined market is witnessing significant growth in recent times owing to the growing usage of advanced technology in auto parts fabrication, an increase in consumer and passenger automobile production, and the digitalization of automotive repair and maintenance services.
Per a Research and Markets report, the global motor vehicle parts market is likely to reach a value of $3.81 trillion in 2025, witnessing a CAGR of 8% from 2021 to 2025.
Array of Acquisitions
Strategic acquisitions have been shaping up the growth trajectory of Garmin by expanding its product offerings.
Apart from the recent buyout, eBay acquired UK-based KnownOrigin in June 2022. KnownOrigin is equipped with robust technology, enabling creators to make authentic digital collectibles in the form of NFTs. Its technology helped it attract a significant number of artistes and collectors to its platform, which remains an advantage for eBay.

DKS posted better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2022 top and bottom lines. However, earnings and sales declined year over year. On a two-year basis, DKS witnessed 38% sales growth, driven by strength in its core strategies. The company is also gaining from the favorable shift in consumer behavior to a healthy lifestyle. Also, the company has been benefiting from its structural transformation in recent years.

Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 42.2% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s 10.7% growth.

Adjusted earnings were $3.68 per share in the fiscal second quarter, down 27.6% from the prior-year figure of $5.08. The decline can be attributed to lower sales, dismal gross margins and higher operating expenses in the reported quarter. However, adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.53 per share.

 Net sales of $3,112.4 million declined 5% year over year but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,074 million. However, net sales advanced 38% from second-quarter fiscal 2019, driven by strength in its core strategies.

Consolidated comparable store sales (comps) declined 5.1% from comps growth of 20.2% in the year-ago quarter. However, comps for the quarter reflected a sequential improvement from the first quarter of fiscal 2022. In the fiscal second quarter, transactions declined 8.4%, while the average ticket rose 3.3%. Also, comps improved 40% on a 2-year stack basis in the fiscal second quarter.

The gross margin contracted 388 basis points (bps) year over year to 36.03% in the fiscal second quarter due to a decline in merchandise margin rate from last year, higher supply-chain-related costs and deleverage in fixed occupancy costs. The merchandise margin rate declined 197 bps year over year in the fiscal second quarter.

However, the company’s merchandise margin rate improved 439 bps from the second-quarter fiscal 2019 level on differentiated product assortments, disciplined pricing strategies and a favorable product mix. The company’s favorable product mix was a result of its shift to higher-margin categories, including the reduction of its exposure to the hunting business. The hunt business had margins of 1,700 bps below the company average in 2019.

In the fiscal second quarter, the SG&A expense rate of 21.12% increased 157 bps year over year due to lower sales. SG&A expenses, in dollar terms, increased 2.7% to $657.4 million, driven by continued investment in hourly wage rates and talent to support its growth strategies.

In the reported quarter, net capital expenditure amounted to $84.5 million. The company paid out dividends of $36.9 million and repurchased 3.9 million shares for $319 million at an average price of $80.84.

On Aug 22, DICK’s Sporting declared a quarterly dividend of 48.75 cents per share on common stock and Class B common stock, which is payable on Sep 30 to its shareholders of record as of Sep 9.
Guidance
Management remains confident about the strength of its core strategies, which have been aiding DICK’S Sporting’s quarterly performances. It notes that DKS’ inventory is healthy and well-positioned, with improved in-stock levels in key categories at the end of the fiscal second quarter. It expects to benefit from its assortments for the back-to-school season.

As a result of its robust first half fiscal 2022 performance and improved inventory position for the back-to-school season, the company raised the guidance for fiscal 2022. However, the company remains cautious of the macroeconomic environment and the dynamic global supply chain.

For fiscal 2022, the company expects comps between negative 6% and negative 2% compared with the negative 8% to negative 2% stated earlier. It envisions adjusted earnings of $10.00-$12.00 per share versus the prior mentioned $9.15-$11.70. The adjusted earnings view assumes 88 million shares outstanding as of fiscal 2022. The earnings guidance is based on an effective tax rate of 24%.

The company anticipates GAAP earnings per share of $8.85-$10.55 for fiscal 2022 compared with the $7.95-$10.15 mentioned earlier. The revised view assumes shares outstanding of 102 million shares as of fiscal 2022. The company’s GAAP earnings view does not include share repurchases beyond the $360 million repurchased in the first half of fiscal 2022.

The company expects an EBT (pre-tax income) margin of 10.7%, at the mid-point, for fiscal 2022, suggesting double the 2019 rate. Going forward, the company expects the merchandise margin rate to be meaningfully higher than pre-COVID levels on an annual basis.

2022-08-24 00:00:00+00:00,"Macy's (M) Q2 Earnings Top, Comp Sales Decline, View Cut",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/macys-m-q2-earnings-top-comp-sales-decline-view-cut,,,"Macy’s, Inc. M came up with second-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but declined year over year. Comparable sales also fell on an owned basis and an owned-plus-licensed basis. Inflationary headwinds, changing consumer behavior and inventory gluts hurt the company’s performance. Following the results, Macy’s trimmed the full-year sales and earnings view due to markdowns and promotions needed to offload excess inventories.

Macro-economic pressures, waning consumer confidence and a pullback in spending activity have hit consumer discretionary stocks, and Macy’s is not immune to the same. The company’s inventories were higher 7% at the end of the quarter. Management informed that the inventory remained elevated in certain categories due to lower sales since Father's Day.

Macy’s is resorting to markdowns in seasonal goods, private brand merchandise and pandemic-related categories, such as active, casual sportswear, sleepwear and soft home. On the flip side, the company intends to focus on in-demand categories and is targeting the optimum inventory level by the end of the fiscal year.

The company believes that the Polaris Strategy positions it well to navigate through the dynamic retail landscape. Management highlighted that consumers continued to shop Macy's. Also, both Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury brands outperformed in the said quarter.

Shares of Macy’s were up 3.8% during the trading session on Aug 23. This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has fallen 26.7% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 25.9%.
Sales & Earnings Picture
Macy’s reported adjusted earnings of $1.00 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents and our estimate of 87 cents. However, the bottom line declined sharply from the adjusted earnings of $1.29 reported in the year-ago period.

Net sales of $5,600 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,481 million and our estimate of $5,527 million. However, the top line decreased 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. Comparable sales fell 1.5% on an owned basis and 1.6% on an owned-plus-licensed basis year over year. The metric fared better than our estimate of down 2.1% on an owned basis and down 2.5% on an owned-plus-licensed basis.

The company’s digital sales dropped 5% from the prior-year quarter. The metric surged 37% from second-quarter fiscal 2019 levels. Digital penetration was 30% of net sales in the quarter under review. This reflected a 2-percentage point contraction from the prior-year period’s level but an 8-percentage point improvement over the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Approximately 64% of digital demand sales came from mobile devices. Stores fulfilled 23% of digital sales in the quarter. The second-half digital penetration is anticipated at about 35.5% considering the trends seen at the end of the second quarter.

Digital penetration was 30%, 32% and 19%, respectively, at Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury brands during the quarter under discussion.

Net credit card revenues amounted to $204 million, up $7 million from the year-ago period. The metric represented 3.6% of sales, up 10 basis points year over year.
Brand-Wise Details
Comparable sales across Macy’s declined 2.9% on an owned basis and 2.8% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. On a trailing 12-month basis, 43.9 million active customers shopped the Macy’s brand, up 7% year over year. The company continued to witness a stellar performance in occasion-based categories, including career and tailored sportswear, fragrances, shoes, dresses and luggage.

At the Bloomingdale’s brand, comparable sales increased 8.8% on an owned basis and 5.8% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. Management informed that roughly four million active customers shopped the Bloomingdale’s brand on a trailing 12-month basis, reflecting an increase of 14% from the year-ago period. Under the Bloomingdale’s banner, growth was driven by the robust performance in women’s, men’s and kid’s contemporary and dressy apparel as well as luggage.

Comparable sales at the Bluemercury brand were up 7.6% on an owned and owned-plus-licensed basis. About 700,000 active customers shopped the Bluemercury brand on a trailing 12-month basis, representing a year-over-year increase of 9%.

The company plans to open five to six off mall locations in fiscal 2022, a mix of Market by Macy’s, Freestanding Backstage, Bloomie’s and Bloomingdale’s the Outlet.
Macy's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Margins
The gross margin came in at 38.9%, down from 40.6% in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by a 160-basis point contraction in the merchandise margin due to an increase in permanent markdowns within the Macy’s brand, stemming from pandemic-related categories, seasonal goods and private brand merchandise. Delivery expenses, as a percentage of net sales, climbed 10 basis points to 4.5% due to a rise in fuel costs and an increase in the percentage of digital sales fulfilled by the vendor direct channel.

SG&A expenses increased 4.4% year over year to $1,981 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 180 basis points year over year to 35.4%.

Macy’s reported adjusted EBITDA of $616 million, down significantly from adjusted EBITDA of $836 million in the year-ago quarter. We note that the adjusted EBITDA margin shriveled 380 basis points to 11% from the prior-year period.
Other Financial Aspects
Macy’s ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $300 million, long-term debt of $2,995 million and shareholders' equity of $3,531 million.

Year to date, the company repurchased shares worth $600 million and paid $87 million in dividends. The company has $1.4 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization.

During the 26-week period ended Jul 30, 2022, Macy’s generated cash flow from operating activities of $303 million and incurred capital expenditures of $582 million. It generated negative free cash flow of $206 million. Management expects capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion for fiscal 2022.
Sneak Peek Into Guidance
Macy’s now envisions fiscal 2022 net sales in the bracket of $24,340 million-$24,580 million, down from its prior view of $24,460 million to $24,700 million. It projected comparable owned-plus-licensed sales to be flat to up 1%. Management forecast credit card revenues, net, to be roughly 3.3% of net sales, up from the previous expectation of 3.1% of net sales.

Macy’s foresees the fiscal 2022 gross margin rate to contract approximately 150 basis points from the last year. It expects the SG&A expense rate to be up 120 basis points from the prior year.

It now estimates the fiscal 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin to be 10.5% compared with 13.6% in fiscal 2021. The company earlier projected the adjusted EBITDA margin between 11.2% and 11.7%.

Macy’s now envisions fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings between $4.00 and $4.20 per share, down from the prior projection of $4.53 to $4.95 per share. The current view indicates a decline from the adjusted earnings of $5.31 per share reported in fiscal 2021.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, management anticipates net sales between $5,160 million and $5,230 million. This indicates a decline from net sales of $5,440 million reported in the year-ago period. It guided third-quarter adjusted earnings to be 15 to 21 cents a share. This suggests a decrease from the $1.23 reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Macy’s expects the gross margin rate to shrivel no more than 350 basis points from the prior-year period, reflecting the impacts of markdowns, a promotional environment and higher fuel costs.

2022-08-24 00:00:00+00:00,Should John Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF (JHMM) Be on Your Investing Radar?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-john-hancock-multifactor-mid-cap-etf-jhmm-be-on-your-investing-radar-3,,,"Looking for broad exposure to the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market? You should consider the John Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF (JHMM), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 09/28/2015.
The fund is sponsored by John Hancock. It has amassed assets over $2.59 billion, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
Why Mid Cap Blend
With market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion, mid cap companies usually contain higher growth prospects than large cap companies, and are considered less risky than their small cap counterparts. Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.
Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.
Costs
When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.41%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.92%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 15.90% of the portfolio. Industrials and Financials round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY) accounts for about 0.65% of total assets, followed by Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR) and Republic Services Inc (RSG).
The top 10 holdings account for about 4.54% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
JHMM seeks to match the performance of the John Hancock Dimensional Mid Cap Index before fees and expenses. The John Hancock Dimensional Mid Cap Index comprises of a subset of securities in the U.S. Universe issued by companies whose market capitalizations are between the 200th and 951st largest U.S. company.
The ETF has lost about -11.57% so far this year and is down about -6.81% in the last one year (as of 08/24/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $42.94 and $56.63.
The ETF has a beta of 1.09 and standard deviation of 26.56% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 665 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
John Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, JHMM is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.
The Vanguard MidCap ETF (VO) and the iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF (IJH) track a similar index. While Vanguard MidCap ETF has $51.61 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF has $63.31 billion. VO has an expense ratio of 0.04% and IJH charges 0.05%.
Bottom-Line
An increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.

Top 5 Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates This Month
We are in the last leg of the second-quarter 2022 reporting cycle. Market participants have keenly watched this earnings season as it has provided the most descriptive view of U.S. corporate health amid record-high inflation and an extremely hawkish Fed. So far, earnings results have come in better than expected, with no visible sign of an imminent recession.
Here, we have selected five companies that are slated to report earnings results this month. The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and a possible earnings beat should drive their share prices. These companies are — Ulta Beauty Inc., Dollar General Corp., Dollar Tree Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and Chewy Inc.
Better-Than-Expected Q2 Earnings Results
As of Aug 17, 469 companies within the S&P 500 Index have reported their financial numbers. Total earnings of these companies are up 7.7% year over year on 14.5% higher revenues, with 77.2% beating EPS estimates and 68.4% beating revenue estimates.
Our latest projection is that for the second quarter as a whole, total earnings of the S&P 500 Index will rise 6.7% year over year on 14% higher revenues and net margin compression of 0.86%. These show a notable improvement over 2.1% growth in earnings year over year on 9.7% higher revenues and net margin compression of 0.95% estimated at the beginning of the reporting cycle.
Our Top Picks
Five companies are slated to beat earnings estimates this month. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a positive Earnings ESP. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of an earnings beat is as high as 70%. These stocks are anticipated to appreciate after their earnings releases. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Dollar General remains a compelling growth story in the retail space. Thanks to its value-creating initiatives, defensive product mix and real estate growth strategy, DG has the capabilities to gain market share. Its commitment to better pricing, private label offerings, effective inventory management and merchandise initiative should drive sales.
We also remain encouraged by Dollar General’s host of initiatives such as DG Fresh, Fast Track, non-consumables, digitization and private fleet that should yield same-store sales growth and margin expansion. We expect same-store sales to increase 3.5% and 3% in fiscal 2022 and 2023, respectively.
DG has an Earnings ESP of +1.04%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 13.6% for the current year (ending January 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.3% over the last 30 days.
Dollar General recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 2.8%. The company is set to release earnings results on Aug 25, before the opening bell.

2022-08-23 00:00:00+00:00,What to Expect From Dollar General (DG) in Q2 Earnings?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-dollar-general-dg-in-q2-earnings,,,"Dollar General Corporation DG is likely to register an increase in the top line when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Aug 25 before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $9.39 billion, indicating an improvement of 8.6% from the prior-year quarter’s level.

The bottom line of this discount retailer is also expected to have increased from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share has risen by a penny to $2.93 over the past 30 days, suggesting an increase of 8.9% from the year-ago period’s reported number.

We expect second-quarter total revenues to be up 8.6% year over year to $9,394.1 million and the bottom line to rise 3.9% to $2.80 per share.

Dollar General has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.8%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this Goodlettsville, TN-based player outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 3.9%.
Key Factors to Note
Dollar General’s better pricing, private-label offerings and effective inventory management are likely to have contributed to the to-be-reported quarter’s top line. The company’s operational capabilities, coupled with its real estate growth strategy, position it well to gain market share by targeting low-to-middle-income-group consumers. To boost traffic, Dollar General has been focusing on both the consumable and non-consumable categories.

To make shopping convenient and contactless, the company has partnered with DoorDash, the last-mile logistics platform, to offer the same-day delivery of essential household items. The company has been steadily expanding its self-checkout facility.

We remain encouraged by the company’s host of initiatives, such as DG Fresh, Fast Track, digitization and private fleet, which are likely to have contributed to same-store sales growth and margin expansion. We anticipate same-store sales to increase 3.3% in the second quarter, a sharp acceleration from a decline of 0.1% witnessed in the first quarter.

However, margins remain an area to watch. Product cost inflation, higher labor costs, supply-chain bottlenecks and seasonal markdowns might have weighed on margins. We expect second-quarter SG&A expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, to deleverage 60 basis points to 22.4%. As a result, we anticipate an operating margin contraction of 60 basis points to 9.2%.
