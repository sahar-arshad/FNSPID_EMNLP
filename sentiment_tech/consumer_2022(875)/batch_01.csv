2022-12-30 00:00:00+00:00,Should Investors Buy Dollar Tree (DLTR) or Walmart (WMT) for 2023?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-investors-buy-dollar-tree-dltr-or-walmart-wmt-for-2023,,,"With inflation and the Fed’s tightening cycle still very much the main factors affecting the economy going into the new year investors may want to buy stocks that can benefit from this market environment.
Slower consumer spending could continue in 2023 with shoppers looking to save. Let’s dive into Dollar Tree DLTR and Walmart WMT stock as we round out the year and see if their low-cost offerings can capitalize on this scenario going into 2023.
Recent Performance
Dollar Tree stock was virtually flat this year vs. Walmart’s -2% drop in 2022. While this is not an overwhelmingly strong performance both stocks have been defensive at times and outperformed the broader market with the S&P 500 down -20% this year. Over the last two years, DLTR is up +31% to impressively outperform WMT and the benchmark.

Dollar Tree’s low-price offerings for consumer merchandise at $1.25 per item have been ideal for many consumers to escape higher inflation. Dollar Tree stores raised their price offerings from $1.00 per item to improve margin and combat rising operating costs amid higher inflation. The company’s Family Dollar segment is also a viable option for savings and features a broader range of competitively priced merchandise which usually doesn’t exceed the $10 range.

Dollar Tree has taken advantage of the current market environment beating earnings estimates for all three of its current fiscal year quarterly reports. In fact, DLTR’s earnings have beaten the Zacks consensus for 12 consecutive quarters dating back to March 2020.
Walmart is a well-known option for consumer saving as well, famous for its rollback prices and price match guarantees that cross from basic consumer merchandise and household products to electronics, groceries, and home furnishing.

Unlike Dollar Tree, Walmart hasn’t shown quite the same consistency in its bottom line. Walmart has beat earnings expectations in its last two quarters but missed its fiscal first-quarter expectations earlier in the year after facing excess inventory challenges.
Growth & Outlook
Despite an impressive string of earnings beats even Dollar Tree stock has hit some rough patches throughout the year after lowering its full-year earnings outlook in August.
Still, Dollar Tree earnings are expected to climb 24% in its current fiscal 2023 and jump another 9% in FY24 to $7.85 per share. Earnings estimates have trended down over the last 60 days. Sales are projected to be up 7% in FY23 and rise another 6% in FY24 to $29.85 billion.

Pivoting to Walmart, earnings are forecasted to decline -6% in FY23 but rise 8% in FY24 at $6.55 per share. Even better, earnings estimates have gone up for both FY23 and FY24 over the last 60 days. On the top line, sales are projected to be up 6% in FY23 and rise another 3% in FY24 to $623.76 billion.

Valuation  
With Dollar Tree and Walmart stocks looking like viable investment options in 2023 based on their growth, monitoring their valuation will be important. On that note, both Dollar Tree and Walmart stock trade around $140 per share at the moment with DLTR trading at 19.9X forward earnings and WMT at a 23.3X forward earnings multiple.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Dollar Tree appears to have a slight edge in valuation as it trades 38% below its decade high of 32.5X and near the median of 19.1X. Walmart on the other hand trades 17% beneath its decade-long high of 28.1X but 30% above the median of 18.1X.
Dividends
In the current market environment, dividends also come in handy and Walmart evens the playing field in this regard. Dollar Tree doensn't  offer a dividend to shareholders at the moment as the company continues to focus on growth and expansion of its store fronts. WMT pays a respectable 1.58% annual dividend yield at $2.24 per share.

Bottom Line
Both Dollar Tree and Walmart stock land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. Both stocks look like solid investments going into 2023 and may continue to outperform the broader market. More upside in DLTR and WMT stock may largely depend upon their fourth-quarter earnings reports, but holding these equities could prove beneficial for investors as consumers look to save.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-12-23 00:00:00+00:00,Stock Market Sell-Off: Is Costco a Buy?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-sell-off%3A-is-costco-a-buy,,,"Worry over the potential impact of a recession is weighing heavily on Costco (NASDAQ: COST), as historically high inflation and rising interest rates could impact the warehouse club's future growth.
Costco's stock is down 19% for the year, about in line with the S&P 500. But with a business model that relies upon low-margin, high-volume sales, rising costs -- including those for commodities and transportation -- are putting pressure on profits.
Image source: Getty Images.
While most of its earnings are derived from its membership fees, which typically get raised every few years, Costco will be hard-pressed to raise them again now when consumers are already feeling strapped. Although it would provide an immediate bump to revenue, it might also force customers to not renew or sign up.
There are a number of competing factors affecting Costco's stock, so let's see whether the warehouse club leader can continue growing over the next few years, and if that makes its stock a buy.
Consumers going down market
Inflation is a dual-edged sword for Costco. On the one hand, its business model is vulnerable to the ravages inflation causes to consumer buying power and the effect rising costs have by eating into its margins. But on the other, those same consumers are also seeking out ways to save money and stretch their wallets, and could turn to Costco for its bargains.
But the retailer is facing more competition -- and not just from other warehouse clubs like Walmart's (NYSE: WMT) Sam's Club or BJ's Wholesale Club, but also from non-traditional stores like the dollar store chains. They might not offer bulk-buying opportunities (which isn't always a benefit), but the deep discounters have expanded their assortment of goods, including fresh and frozen foods, which makes them surprisingly effective rivals.
During the Great Recession of the last decade, Dollar General and Dollar Tree saw more upscale customers visit their stores, but they didn't all leave when times got good again. The improved selection and greater perceived value of their merchandise kept them coming back.
Indeed, financial advice guru Dave Ramsey says consumers often find themselves needlessly overspending at Costco to make their membership fees feel worthwhile.
And Walmart itself has said it is seeing higher-income shoppers increasingly going down market to its stores. It used to be that the retail king catered mostly to the low- and middle-income segments, while Costco attracted the mid- to upper-income customer. But Walmart said those earning $100,000 or more are more frequently being found in its aisles.
That could be why Costco's net sales were up 8% in its fiscal first quarter, which ended Nov. 20 while Walmart saw a near 10% rise.
The high cost of free money
Another factor that is affecting Costco's stock is the growth of its physical store footprint. The company operates some 847 warehouses around the world, and it has been expanding rapidly in recent years. This expansion has helped to drive growth for the company, as it has allowed the warehouse club to reach new customers and increase its market share. However, the expansion of Costco's physical stores has also come at a cost, as the company had to invest heavily in new locations and infrastructure.
Moreover, Costco's stores are not just for food, but also contain large amounts of discretionary spending items that consumers can easily set aside when push comes to shove. As CFO Richard Galanti told analysts on the retailer'searnings conference call ""it rains on all of us during these tougher times, particularly with bigger ticket discretionary items."" However, he also maintains that the softness Costco is experiencing is relative to the strength it saw a year ago.
But that was a period marked by consumers splurging on goods after receiving extra stimulus checks, something many economists now count as the match that lit the fuse of inflation. Unfortunately, that free money is no longer available.
Crossing the digital divide
Costco has also struggled to keep pace with other retailers in the e-commerce space. This has been a particular concern in recent years, as the pandemic has led to a surge in online shopping. In response to this trend, Costco has been investing in its online capabilities and expanding its e-commerce offerings, but it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be sufficient to allow the company to compete with other online retailers effectively.
E-commerce sales were down 3.7% in the latest quarter, or 2% on a currency-adjusted basis, while Walmart saw a 16% gain.
That was due in large part to the decline in that discretionary merchandise. Consumer electronics and appliances represent about 40% of Costco's online volume, and they were hit hard this quarter, falling by high-single-digit percentage rates.

Taking the good with the bad
All this may sound bleak, but it's not as bad as all that. First, Costco has a loyal customer base that values the company's low prices and wide selection of goods. This should help the company maintain its market share and attract new customers over time.
Second, Costco has a strong balance sheet, with a healthy level of debt and strong cash flow. This should give the company the financial flexibility it needs to still invest in its business and pursue growth opportunities.
Still, it's not the cheapest stock. Even with its shares down, Costco trades at elevated valuation ratios compared to earnings, sales, and free cash flow. I wouldn't be buying large tranches of Costco stock at this time, but small bites until better prices present themselves will ensure your portfolio can benefit from this fundamentally high-quality business.

2022-12-23 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Dollar Tree (DLTR) Outpaced Its Industry in a Year,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-dollar-tree-dltr-outpaced-its-industry-in-a-year,,,"Dollar Tree Inc. DLTR is an attractive bet for the long term, owing to its strong fundamentals, robust product demand, efforts to evolve assortments to drive the consumables category at Dollar Tree and initiatives to improve the value proposition at Family Dollar. Dollar Tree’s Key Real Estate Initiatives like expansions of H2, Dollar Tree Plus! and Combo Stores are on track and position it for growth in the long term.

However, the company expects the increased demand for consumables and inflationary costs to affect margins and the bottom line.

Shares of Home Depot have gained 2.2% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 11.3%. The stock’s performance also compared favorably against the Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500’s declines of 28.2% and 19.5%, respectively, in the same period.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s current financial year’s sales and earnings suggests growth of 7.2% and 24%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported number.

 Dollar Tree’s Growth Strategies
Dollar Tree is witnessing significant benefits from the continued demand for the company’s products, which is aiding top-line growth, as well as improved margins. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, Dollar Tree’s earnings improved 25% year over year, while consolidated net sales advanced 8.1% year over year. Enterprise same-store sales (comps) improved 6.5% year over year.

For the Dollar Tree banner, comps were up 8.6%, while the same for the Family Dollar banner improved 4.1%. After adjusting for the impacts of currency fluctuations, comps for the Dollar Tree banner rose 8.5%. Comps at Dollar Tree benefited from a double-digit increase in average ticket, partly negated by a decline in traffic. Comps at Family Dollar were aided by increases in both ticket and traffic.

Dollar Tree has made significant progress over the years in optimizing its store portfolio through store openings, renovations, re-banners and closings. It is delivering compelling results for its Key Real Estate Initiatives, which include the expansion of its $3 and $5 plus assortment in Dollar Tree stores, as well as Combo Stores. It also remains on track with H2 Renovations at Family Dollar stores.

Consequently, the company outlined plans to accelerate its key initiatives in fiscal 2022 and beyond. In fiscal 2022, it expects to complete 800 Family Dollar H2 Renovations as part of the Key Real Estate Initiative. Out of this, 190 will be Dollar Tree stores and 400 will be Family Dollar stores. Within the Family Dollar stores, 350 stores will be in the Combo Store format. Also, management intends to expand the $3 and $5 Plus assortments to more than 1,500 Dollar Tree stores. It expects to have at least 5,000 Dollar Tree Plus! stores by the end of 2024.

The company is on track to reach its long-term target of operating 26,000 stores, with more than 10,000 Dollar Tree and 15,000 Family Dollar outlets, across North America. Additionally, it is on track to leverage Family Dollar and Dollar Tree distribution center systems, and combined merchandise. This will help in bringing the latest products into Dollar Tree stores without any disruptions.
Strong View
Dollar Tree is optimistic about its fiscal 2022 top-line performance despite concerns regarding margins and the bottom line. Hence, it raised the fiscal 2022 sales view. The company’s efforts to evolve the assortment to drive consumables’ performance at Dollar Tree and the initiatives to improve the value proposition at Family Dollar remain on track, which are likely to aid the top line.

Backed by these efforts, we anticipate Dollar Tree’s fiscal 2022 total revenues to be $28,179.4 million, which is in sync with the company’s raised guidance of $28.14-$28.28 billion for consolidated net sales. Earlier, the company anticipated consolidated net sales of $27.85-$28.10 billion for the fiscal year. We expect enterprise comp growth to be 5.2% for fiscal 2022, in line with the company’s view of mid-single-digit growth. Our estimate for comps comprises an 8.6% increase in Dollar Tree and 1.4% growth at Family Dollar. The company anticipated comps growth in the high-single digits for the Dollar Tree segment and the low-single digits for the Family Dollar segment.

For fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Dollar Tree expects consolidated net sales of $7.54-$7.68 billion, with enterprise same-store sales growth of mid to the high-single digits. This will comprise a mid-to-high single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and low to mid-single-digit growth in the Family Dollar segment. We expect net sales of $7,568.4 million for the fiscal fourth quarter, with a 4.9% rise in comps. We anticipate comps growth of 7.5% for the Dollar Tree segment and 2.4% for the Family Dollar segment in the fiscal fourth quarter.
Headwinds to Address
Despite the strong sales trends across both banners, Dollar Tree expects the increased demand for consumables and inflationary costs to affect margins and the bottom line in the near term. Consequently, the company has provided a bleak earnings view for fiscal 2022. Notably, its fiscal third-quarter performance reflected headwinds from inflationary pressures and an unfavorable product mix due to the demand shift toward low-margin consumable goods. These headwinds also partly offset growth in the gross margin in the quarter. The gross margin for the Family Dollar segment declined 100 bps largely due to a product mix shift and product cost inflation.

For fiscal 2022, management envisions earnings in the lower half of the previously mentioned $7.10-$7.40 per share. Through the rest of fiscal 2022, it expects to witness continued gross margin pressure across both segments from the inflationary cost situation. Dollar Tree expects consumables to outperform discretionary, which will negatively impact the gross margin. Some of the assumptions for the earnings view include net interest of $30 million for the fiscal fourth quarter and $127 million for fiscal 2022.

Dollar Tree has been witnessing higher SG&A expenses for the past several quarters, owing to elevated payroll, increased repairs and maintenance expenses, and store facility costs. In third-quarter fiscal 2022, SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 170 bps to 24.4%. The increase resulted from elevated professional fees, increased store payroll and stock compensation expenses, and inflationary pressures across many expense categories like utilities, and higher repairs and maintenance costs.
Stocks to Bet on
We highlighted three better-ranked stocks in the Retail - Wholesale sector, namely Ross Stores Inc. ROST, Tecnoglass TGLS and Chico's FAS CHS.

Ross Stores operates as an off-price retailer of apparel and home accessories primarily in the United States. ROST currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The ROST stock has gained 3.5% in the past year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ross Stores’ current financial-year sales and earnings per share suggests declines of 1.6% and 11.7%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures. ROST has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10.5%, on average.

Tecnoglass manufactures and sells architectural glass and windows, and aluminum products for the residential and commercial construction industries. TGLS currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. The TGLS stock has rallied 9.3% in the past year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tecnoglass’ current financial-year sales and earnings per share suggests growth of 43.4% and 82.2%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures. TGLS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 26.9%, on average.

Chico's FAS, an omni-channel specialty retailer of women's private branded casual-to-dressy clothing, intimates, and complementary accessories, currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 87.5%, on average. Shares of CHS have risen 0.2% in the past year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Chico's current financial-year sales and earnings per share suggests growth of 19.6% and 127.5%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.

Shares have lost about 6.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Dollar Tree due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.
Dollar Tree Q3 Earnings & Sales Beat, High Costs Hurt
Dollar Tree has reported third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein sales and earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate. The top and bottom lines also improved year over year. The results have benefited from the continued demand for the company’s products, offset by inflationary pressures and an unfavorable product mix due to the demand shift toward low-margin consumable goods.

The company remains optimistic about its fiscal 2022 top-line performance. Hence, it has raised the fiscal 2022 sales view. Despite the strong sales trends across both banners, the company expects the increased demand for consumables and inflationary costs to affect margins and the bottom line in the near term. Consequently, it has provided a bleak earnings view for fiscal 2022.
Quarter in Detail
Dollar Tree’s earnings improved 25% year over year to $1.20 per share and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17 and our estimate of $1.14. Bottom-line growth can be attributed to robust top-line growth, as well as improved margins.

Consolidated net sales advanced 8.1% year over year to $6,939.9 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,839 million ad our estimate of $6,833.7 million. Enterprise same-store sales (comps) improved 6.5% year over year. For the Dollar Tree banner, comps were up 8.6%, while the same for the Family Dollar banner improved 4.1%. After adjusting for the impacts of currency fluctuations, comps for the Dollar Tree banner rose 8.5%.

Comps at Dollar Tree benefited from a double-digit increase in average ticket, partly negated by a decline in traffic. Comps at Family Dollar were aided by increases in both ticket and traffic.

The gross profit increased 17.5% year over year to $2,071.5 million, while the gross margin expanded 240 bps to 29.9%. Gains from improved initial mark-on, and leverage on distribution and occupancy costs aided the gross margin. This was partly negated by higher markdowns and shrink, inflationary cost pressures, and unfavorable product mix related to a shift toward lower-margin consumable products. The gross margin expanded 520 bps to 35.4% at the Dollar Tree banner and contracted 100 bps to 23.4% at the Family Dollar segment.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 170 bps to 24.4%. The increase resulted from elevated professional fees, increased store payroll and stock compensation expenses, and inflationary pressures across many expense categories like utilities and higher repairs and maintenance costs.

While the operating income rose 22.8% to $381.3 million, the operating margin expanded 70 bps to 5.5%, driven by robust gross margin expansion and sales growth. Segment-wise, the operating margin expanded 480 bps to 13.3% for Dollar Tree. Meanwhile, the Family Dollar segment reported an operating loss of $18.4 million compared with an operating income of $88.6 million in the year-ago quarter.
Balance Sheet
Dollar Tree ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $439 million. Net merchandise inventories increased 31.1% year over year to $5,657.7 million. It had net long-term debt (excluding current maturities) of $3,420.4 million and shareholders’ equity of $8,275.3 million as of Oct 29, 2022.

The company bought back 2,859,200 shares for $397.5 million in third-quarter fiscal 2022, reflecting an average price of $139.04 per share. As of Oct 29, 2022, Dollar Tree had $1.85 billion remaining under its existing authorization. The company anticipates spending $1.2 billion toward capital expenditure in fiscal 2022.
Store Update
In third-quarter fiscal 2022, Dollar Tree opened 102 stores, expanded or relocated 20 outlets, and shuttered 41 stores. The company completed the renovation of 309 Family Dollar stores to the H2 or Combo Store formats. Additionally, it expanded the multi-price plus offerings to another 199 Dollar Tree stores in the quarter. As of Oct 29, 2022, the company operated 16,293 stores in 48 states and five Canada provinces.
Guidance
Dollar Tree has raised its sales view for fiscal 2022 as its efforts to evolve the assortment to drive consumables’ performance at Dollar Tree and the initiatives to improve the value proposition at Family Dollar remain on track.

The company expects consolidated net sales of $28.14-$28.28 billion compared with the $27.85-$28.10 billion mentioned earlier. It anticipates enterprise comps growth in the mid-single digits for fiscal 2022, including a high-single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and low-single-digit growth in the Family Dollar segment. It expects selling square footage to increase 2.8% compared with 3.5% growth mentioned earlier.

The company expects depreciation to be $770 million for fiscal 2022. Interest expenses are anticipated to be $127 million, while the effective tax rate is likely to be 23.7%.

Management envisions earnings in the lower half of the previously mentioned $7.10-$7.40 per share. The company has noted that sales trends are strong across both banners. However, the increased demand for consumables is likely to affect margins in the near term. This, along with the ongoing inflationary cost pressures, has resulted in a soft earnings view for fiscal 2022.

For fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Dollar Tree expects consolidated net sales of $7.54-$7.68 billion, with enterprise same-store sales growth of mid to the high-single digits. This will comprise a mid-to-high single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and low-to-mid single-digit growth in the Family Dollar segment.

The company expects net interest expenses of $30 million for the fiscal fourth quarter, with an effective tax rate of 24.3%.
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?
In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.
The consensus estimate has shifted -5.32% due to these changes.
VGM Scores
At this time, Dollar Tree has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.
Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Dollar Tree has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

2022-12-22 00:00:00+00:00,Is This Growth Stock a Recession-Proof Buy?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-this-growth-stock-a-recession-proof-buy,,,"A U.S. recession could be on the horizon -- 81% of economists are predicting that the U.S. economy will enter into a recession within the next 24 months. And with so many economists and consumers alike holding these beliefs, an economic downturn could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Regardless of when the next recession hits, investors would be savvy to at least begin positioning their portfolios for such an event. And seeing as consumers typically look to get more value out of their money in tough times, Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) could fare well in a recession.
But is the stock a buy for growth investors? Let's dig into the fundamentals of the discount store giant and its valuation to address this question.
A quickly growing business
Dollar Tree is the holding company of two discount store brands that many Americans and Canadians may recognize: the eponymous Dollar Tree as well as Family Dollar. With more than 16,000 stores in 48 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces, Dollar Tree's reach is bested only by competitor Dollar General's 18,000-plus stores throughout 47 U.S. states.
Dollar Tree's consolidated net sales surged 8.1% higher year over year to $6.9 billion during the third quarter ended Oct. 29. What led to the large-cap company's solid top-line growth for the quarter?
Dollar Tree's total same-store sales grew 6.5% over the year-ago period. Since the company's stores are predominantly located in underserved and rural areas, persistent inflation has weighed especially heavily on the minds of consumers in these areas. This is why shoppers have been frequenting retailers that offer strong value propositions like Dollar Tree, which has been a boost to its store traffic.
Along with a 2% increase in the company's total store count to 16,293 in the quarter from new store openings, this explains the respectable net sales growth rate during the quarter.
Dollar Tree recorded $1.20 in diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter, up 25% from the year-ago period. Due to excellent cost management, the company's biggest expense category, known as cost of sales, only increased by 4.6% in the period. Because this was a slower increase than net sales, Dollar Tree's net margin expanded by nearly 50 basis points to 3.8% during the quarter. When paired with a 1.2% reduction in the company's diluted share count from share repurchases, this is how diluted EPS grew faster than net sales for the quarter.
As Dollar Tree expands into more communities and strengthens its product offerings, significant earnings growth should continue in the years ahead. In fact, analysts believe that the company will generate 20.8% annual diluted EPS growth through the next five years. This is well above the discount stores industry average growth estimate of 6.9%.

The company is financially strong
A flourishing business is one thing. But without a well-positioned balance sheet, a company will have a difficult time executing on its growth ambitions. Fortunately, Dollar Tree is financially sound. The company is expected to end the current fiscal year with net debt (net cash minus long-term debt) of $2.6 billion. Compared to the $3 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) that is projected for the year, this is a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 0.9.
This is much better than Dollar General's forecast net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.4 for its current fiscal year. That means that Dollar Tree could hypothetically repay its debt in a little more than 12 months, including interest and tax expenses. This should provide Dollar Tree with ample ability to open new stores, repurchase shares, and repay debt moving forward.
A compelling mix of value and growth
Down just 1% in 2022 thus far, Dollar Tree has fared quite well amid the Nasdaq Composite's 33% plunge during that time. And yet the stock still appears to be an attractive value.
Dollar Tree's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17.7 is far below the discount stores industry average of 22. This is arguably a steal of a valuation for a stock whose growth prospects are superior to those of the discount stores industry -- all of which makes Dollar Tree a great defensive pick.

2022-12-17 00:00:00+00:00,Is Costco Stock Too Expensive for 2023?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-costco-stock-too-expensive-for-2023,,,"Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) is one of the world's most successful retailers today. The king of warehouse retailing has defied the odds in many respects. It delivers sales growth in nearly every economic environment and internationally, and it has successfully adapted to local cultures in markets where many Americentric retail models have failed.
So successful is its business model that investors have come to expect robust earnings reports from Costco, which has probably helped lead to a consistently high P/E ratio. The question for investors is whether the retail stock can still justify its expense.
Just how expensive is Costco?
Costco shares currently trade for around 35 times earnings. This may seem expensive, given that Target, Dollar General, and Dollar Tree trade at lower P/E ratios. Only Amazon and Sam's Club parent Walmart are more expensive, though Walmart has historically sold at a lower multiple than Costco.
COST PE Ratio data by YCharts
Costco has not always maintained such a high P/E ratio. It traded under 30 times earnings for most of the 2010s and even fell to a multiple of 15 during the 2008-09 financial crisis. That marks a stark change from the 2020s, when Costco has maintained a P/E ratio above 30, even during the March 2020 bear market.
That valuation has caused many to deem this stock expensive, and one of those investors is likely Warren Buffett. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, owned Costco for more than 20 years.
But in late 2020, Berkshire's Q3 13-F revealed that the company had sold the entire Costco position, more than 4.3 million shares, despite Charlie Munger's longtime position on Costco's board of directors. At the time, the stock had typically traded for over 40 times earnings.
Does its growth justify its valuation?
The financials have likely helped propel the valuation higher, but the business is slowing down compared to fiscal 2022. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended Nov. 20), net sales rose 8% year over year to $54 billion. Costco's $1.3 billion in net income grew by only 3% during that time as increasing costs wiped out most of the revenue gains.
During fiscal 2022 (ended Aug. 28), revenue of $227 billion amounted to yearly growth of 16%. Also, the $5.8 billion in net income surged 17% higher over the same period.
At that time, Costco's P/E ratio stayed consistently above 40 and peaked at 49, indicating that investors were pricing that growth into the stock. Moreover, Costco stock reached its all-time high, peaking in April of this year at more than $612 per share. The stock has since fallen by almost one-fourth.
Is Costco too expensive?
Investors can probably find more reasonably priced retail stocks than Costco, even on a relative basis. Indeed, Costco is a notable retail success story, having mastered the art of steady growth under various conditions. The company has shown no apparent signs that that will change.
However, retail investors can find similar growth stories in other companies, stocks they can most likely buy more cheaply. And with Buffett having sold his stake in Costco, investors may be more inclined to follow his lead than add shares.

2022-12-02 00:00:00+00:00,Stitch Fix (SFIX) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stitch-fix-sfix-to-report-q1-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-cards,,,"Stitch Fix, Inc. SFIX is expected to register a decrease in both its top and the bottom line from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure in its first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Dec 6, after market close. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues currently stands at $459.7 million, suggesting a 20.9% decrease from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first quarter’s loss is pegged at 44 cents, wider than the loss of 2 cents a share recorded in the year-earlier fiscal quarter. The consensus estimate has been stable over the past 30 days.

This online personal-styling service provider delivered an earnings surprise of 12.5% in the trailing four quarters, on average.
Factors at Play
Stitch Fix’s quarterly performance is likely to be hurt by a tough macroeconomic environment, including headwinds like supply-chain issues, global inflationary pressures and potential shifts in customer demand. These factors coupled with any deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses might have affected SFIX’s performance in the fiscal first quarter. In addition, elevated investments in the Freestyle drive and new channels are concerning.

On its lastearnings call management had projected net revenues of $455-$465 million for the fiscal first quarter, indicating a decline of 20-22% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Stitch Fix anticipated adjusted EBITDA between a negative $10 million and a negative $15 million, with a margin contraction of 2-3%. This view assumes net active clients to decline from the sequential quarter’s level.

However, Stitch Fix has been expanding its digital capabilities and personalized shopping for a while to offer clients the best-in-class service. SFIX’s Freestyle drive offering quite a distinct shopping experience is encouraging. This platform enables customers to discover and buy curated items according to their style, preferences, fit and size.
What Does the Zacks Model Say?
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Stitch Fix this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here as elaborated below.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly sales is pegged at $224.9 million, indicating a decline of 22.3% from the last fiscal-year period’s tally.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings is pegged at 16 cents a share, suggesting an 87% plunge from the year-ago fiscal period’s tally. The consensus mark has been stable in the past 30 days.

This Lynnwood, WA-based player came up with a negative earnings surprise of 46.1% in the trailing four quarters, on average.
Key Factors to Note
Zumiez’s quarterly performance might have been hurt by a challenging operating landscape, including numerous headwinds like supply-chain bottlenecks, inflation, higher logistics costs and a tight labor market. Any deleverage in SG&A costs might have been added deterrents.

On its lastearnings call management had predicted third-quarter fiscal 2022 net sales between $220 million and $228 million, suggesting a decline from $289.5 million reported in the year-ago fiscal period. It had projected consolidated operating margins in the range of 0.5-2.5% with earnings per share of $1.25 for the fiscal quarter under review.

Management had earlier stated that net sales for the fiscal third quarter to date for 37 days ended Sep 5, 2022, tumbled 18.1% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported number and 12.6% from the level during the same period in fiscal 2019. The total comparable sales for the aforementioned period declined 19.7% from the comparable period’s level in the prior fiscal year and 15.3% from the comparable period’s reading in fiscal 2019.

The net sales for the North America business fell 19.5% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally in the 37-day period, while the metric at the Other international business dipped 2.7% from the last fiscal year’s quarterly level. For the fiscal third quarter through Sep 5, all categories were down in total sales from the year-ago fiscal period’s level. The men's category remained the most negative, followed by hard goods, women's, accessories and footwear.

On the positive front, Zumiez’s consumer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives and expense management remain encouraging. ZUMZ’s store-expansion and omni-channel efforts are other positives.

TLYS is likely to register a top- and bottom-line decrease from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s tallies when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 numbers on Dec 1, after the closing bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $166.5 million, indicating a decline of 19.2% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly earnings currently stands at 8 cents a share for the fiscal third quarter, suggesting a decrease from 66 cents reported in the year-earlier fiscal quarter. The consensus mark has been stable in the past 30 days.

This specialty retailer of apparel, footwear and accessories boasts a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 18.5%, on average.
Key Aspects to Note
Tilly’s third-quarter results might have been hurt by the impacts of operating in a tough environment comprising inflationary pressures, evolving customer spending behaviors and ongoing supply-chain cost pressures. These along with any deleverage in selling and administrative expenses and other costs might hurt its overall results in the quarter under review.

On its lastearnings call management had forecast some deceleration in the latter half of the fiscal third quarter. It projected total net sales in the bracket of roughly $165-$170 million for the quarter under review. Further, TLYS anticipated SG&A expenses of $46-$47 million, an operating income of $1.9-$4.6 million and earnings per share of 5-11 cents. Tilly’s recorded net sales of $206.1 million and earnings of 66 cents a share in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.
However, management has been working toward enhancing Tilly’s’ business and delivering growth. TLYS’ home category is also performing well. Additionally, its e-commerce initiatives, including plans to launch its enhanced mobile App, appear encouraging. TLYS’ efforts to boost merchandise assortment and expand stores are other positives. These factors might have provided some cushion to its quarterly performance.

2022-11-24 00:00:00+00:00,Here's How Lands' End (LE) is Poised Ahead of Q3 Earnings,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-how-lands-end-le-is-poised-ahead-of-q3-earnings,,,"Lands' End, Inc. LE is likely to witness an increase in the top line from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 numbers on Dec 1, before the market opens. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $384.8 million, suggesting a 2.4% improvement from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reported figure.

However, the bottom line is expected to decline from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings is currently pegged at 7 cents, indicating a 68.2% plunge from the year-ago fiscal period’s tally. The consensus estimate has been stable over the past 30 days.

This clothing, accessories, footwear and home products retailer has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.8%, on average.
Key Factors to Note
Lands' End’s results for the fiscal third quarter might benefit from its global e-commerce business and brand strength. We note that enhanced data analytics capabilities and improved inventory management are encouraging. LE’s consumer-centric approach, product initiatives, technological advancements and brand awareness are other positives.

In addition, strength in the LE’s Outfitters business, driven by stellar demand across school uniform households, might have been a contributing factor. All the aforesaid tailwinds are most likely to have driven LE’s sales performance during the fiscal quarter under review. On its lastearnings call management had projected net revenues of $375-$390 million for the fiscal third quarter.

However, we cannot ignore the impacts of operating in a challenging environment comprising inflationary pressures, evolving customer-spending behaviors and ongoing supply-chain cost pressures. These along with any deleverage in selling and administrative expenses and other costs might have hurt Lands' End’s profitability in the fiscal quarter under review.

Lands’ End envisioned earnings per share of 3-12 cents and an adjusted EBITDA of $20-$24 million for the fiscal third quarter. This guidance assumes an incremental $9 million transportation expenses stemming from the supply-chain bottlenecks.

Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Lands' End this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here, as elaborated below. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Lands' End, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

lululemon athletica LULU currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.91% and a Zacks Rank #2.

lululemon athletica’s top line is expected to rise from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reported number.

2022-11-23 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting DLTR Put And Call Options For January 2023,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-dltr-put-and-call-options-for-january-2023,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options begin trading today, for the January 2023 expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new January 2023 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.55. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $150.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $144.45 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $151.28/share today.
Because the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.70% return on the cash commitment, or 30.69% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $150.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $152.50 strike price has a current bid of $6.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $151.28/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $152.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.84% if the stock gets called away at the January 2023 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $152.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $152.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.03% boost of extra return to the investor, or 33.45% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $151.28) to be 41%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Investors have been worrying about the surge in fresh COVID-19 cases in China that has led Beijing to tighten restrictions. Also, China reported its first death from the mainland since May over the weekend, which raised fears among investors that leading stocks to end lower on Monday.

Nov 23 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq led gains among major Wall Street indexes on Wednesday, as growth stocks rose after a mixed bag of economic data led to a drop in Treasury yields, while investors awaited minutes from the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting.
The minutes, due at 2 p.m. ET, could show how deep any emerging disagreement has begun to run at the Fed as it ends the push to ""front-load"" rate hikes and begins feeling the way in smaller steps to an eventual stopping point.
Heavyweight stocks, including Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Meta Platforms Inc META.O, rose between 0.1% and 0.9%.
Tesla Inc TSLA.O jumped 5.6% after Citigroup upgraded the electric-vehicle maker's stock to ""neutral"" from a ""sell"" rating.
Data showing a more-than-expected rise in Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week helped bring down the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note US10YT=RR.
Meanwhile, U.S. business activity contracted for a fifth straight month in November, while consumer sentiment ticked higher. New home sales rose more than expected in October.
The disparate data bolstered expectations of a 50-basis point rate increase at the Fed's next meeting in December. FEDWATCH
""It's a perverse move in the markets, that bad news is good news,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.
""Then the next step to that is maybe the Fed stops raising rates faster than what they have been saying, and that's really what is fueling the market.""
Wall Street's three main indexes are on track for their second straight month of gains, riding on a better-than-feared earnings season, signs of cooling inflation and hopes of smaller rate hikes.
Trading volume is likely to be thin heading into the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, with the U.S. stock market open for a half-session on Friday.
Deere & Co DE.N jumped 6.0% to lead the gains on S&P 500 on reporting a higher-than-expected quarterly profit.
Nordstrom Inc JWN.N fell 5.4% as the fashion retailer cut its profit forecast amid steep markdowns to attract inflation-wary customers.
Gloomy forecasts from a slew of retailers including Dollar TreeDLTR.O and Target CorpTGT.N indicate inflation's hold over consumer spending, especially heading into the all important holiday season.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.37-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.29-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded 21 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 76 new highs and 97 new lows.

2022-11-22 00:00:00+00:00,"Nordstrom (JWN) Beats After Close, Stock Sells Off",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nordstrom-jwn-beats-after-close-stock-sells-off,,,"With no market catalysts today, as we mentioned in this space ahead of the open, indices still climbed throughout the day, closing at or around session highs. The Dow, which saw 27 of 30 components close higher, gained +397 points, or +1.18%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose an identical +1.36%, with all 11 sectors in the S&P closing higher (with 10 of 11 up month to date [Consumer Discresh was lower]). Even the small-cap Russell 2000, which has been fighting to keep up of late, added +1.16% for the day.

Despite the overall gains, there didn’t seem to be much focus on market activity. If we want to talk retail — on the brink of holiday shopping season, as we are — we saw Best Buy BBY, fresh off its morning Q3 report, +12.75% for today. But Dollar Tree DLTR, which also beat this morning but was light on earnings forecasts, slipped -7.8% on the session. Thus, our current market appears to want to reward those companies performing strongly, but taking it from those who are doing less well.

Nordstrom JWN is the latest retailer to report earnings this afternoon, posting its fourth-straight bottom-line beat with 20 cents per share outpacing the 14 cents in the Zacks consensus, on revenues of $3.55 billion in the quarter beyond the $3.51 billion analysts were looking for. These expectations had been ratcheted down on earlier guidance, so the beats don’t come as quite as much a surprise. Also, guidance looking ahead has been kept pat — instead of rising — indicating this is as good as it gets for the higher-end big-box retailer. Shares are -4.8% at this hour.

We are in a holiday-shortened week, with most of the possible market catalysts focused on tomorrow morning. This includes regular Thursday morning staple Weekly Jobless Claims, along with Durable Goods, Manufacturing and Services PMI, New Home Sales and the latest Fed meeting minutes. Of these, the biggest capacity for unexpected results may come from jobless claims, which are experiencing hits from select members of Big Tech, to the tune of thousands or tens of thousands of layoffs in the past few weeks or so. Eventually these are going to show up on claims rolls.

John Deere & Co. DE is the final major earnings report expected ahead of Thanksgiving Day (no reports are scheduled for Thursday or Friday this week). The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated machine equipment manufacturer is expected to fetch +72% earnings growth year over year on +33% in revenue growth. Last quarter, the company broke an 11-straight-quarter earnings beat; with these metrics to overcome, it would would likely be a more meaningful beat than Nordstrom’s after the bell today.

NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday in light trading volume as a sales forecast by Best Buy dampened concerns high inflation would lead to a dismal holiday shopping season while a bounce in oil prices helped lift energy shares.
Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N jumped 10.28% as the best performer on the S&P 500 .SPX index, after the retailer forecast a smaller drop in annual sales than previously announced and expressed confidence a ramp up in deals and discounts will entice more customers.

However, Dollar Tree Inc DLTR.O tumbled 8.59% and capped gains for the retail index as the discount retailer cut its annual profit forecast for the second time.
""If you take the continuum of income and consumers out there, the upper half of that is relatively inelastic to some costs going up to some extent or another where the bottom half is going to be more sensitive,"" said Shawn Cruz, head trading strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.

2022-11-22 00:00:00+00:00,Why Dollar Tree Is Tumbling Today,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-dollar-tree-is-tumbling-today,,,"What happened
Shares of Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) are tumbling 10.3% in morning trading Tuesday after the deep discount retailer reported third-quarter earnings.
Although Dollar Tree beat Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines, its profit guidance for the full year was below forecasts, as margins are under pressure because of persistently high inflation.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
The deep discount chain has flourished this year as consumers respond to its cheap prices for name-brand products. While it abandoned its pure-play dollar status several years ago with a $1.25 baseline price and started offering products slightly more expensive than that, it's been a retailer seen as a go-to destination to stretch wallets during inflationary times.
Year to date, net sales are up 7.1% to $20.6 billion as same-store sales have jumped 9.2% from last year and the average ticket size rose by double-digit rates. Dollar Tree's results could have been better, but it's been held back by its sister Family Dollar chain, where comps are up only 1.3% this year.
Rising costs, however, are impacting its bottom line, so although Dollar Tree raised its full-year sales guidance, earnings are only forecast to be in the lower half of its prior outlook range as headwinds from inflation hold it back.
Now what
Retail is already a relatively low-margin business, so when confronted with inflationary cost pressures, it's going to narrow them further. Still, the market's reaction seems overblown.
Dollar Tree's sales are experiencing strong growth, but consumers are buying more consumable goods, which carry lower profits than other goods. That helps to build traffic over time, but it makes for periods such as we're in more tricky when it comes to the retail stock meeting Wall Street expectations.

Nov 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rose on Tuesday as a better-than-feared sales forecast by Best Buy eased worries of a dull holiday season for retailers anxious about consumers turning thrifty due to inflation.
Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N jumped 12.4%, leading gains on S&P 500 .SPX index, after forecasting a smaller drop in annual sales than previously estimated, confident that a ramp up in deals and discounts will lure more customers.
""People are hopeful that consumers can still squeeze out a strong holiday season despite the headwinds they're facing,"" said Brandon Pizzurro, director of public investments at GuideStone Capital Management.
