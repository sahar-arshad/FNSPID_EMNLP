2022-03-01 00:00:00+00:00,Why Kimco Realty Turned Out to Be Pandemic Proof,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-kimco-realty-turned-out-to-be-pandemic-proof,,,"In the middle of 2020, if you had said that a debt-laden retail REIT (real estate investment trust) would be pandemic proof, you would have been laughed out of the room. Economic lockdowns and the general public's aversion to public spaces at the time made brick-and-mortar retail prime candidates for financial trouble.
Despite the initial fears and the pandemic's impact on retail real estate, REIT Kimco Realty (NYSE: KIM) was indeed surprisingly pandemic-proof. Here's how the company was able to withstand the blow, as well as how it is also set up rather well to succeed from here.

Fighting turmoil with quality tenants
Retail real estate comes in many forms, and the type of retail mattered immensely when it came to handling the pandemic. Indoor or enclosed retail, gyms, restaurants, and movie theaters were hit the hardest, but essential retailers like supermarkets, home improvement stores, auto repair, and pet stores, to name a few, weren't socked hard enough to stop paying rent. According to Kimco, rent collections for these essential services remained above 96% throughout the pandemic, and overall rent collections only dipped below 90% for one quarter. Also, occupancy only dipped from a pre-pandemic high of 96.4% to 93.5% at its nadir.
The reason Kimco's portfolio was able to weather the storm so well is that a vast majority of its retail space was anchored by a grocery store. More than 80% of the company's annualized base rent (ABR) comes from grocery-anchored shopping centers, and grocery stores themselves represent about 18% of ABR. Grocery stores may not be high-growth businesses, but they are some of the most stable retail properties and can drive significant traffic to other stores in a shopping center.
Another advantage that Kimco had is the credit quality of its tenants, since 86% of its ABR comes from three kinds of tenants: anchors, such as Costco and Target; mid-tier stores (think Dollar Tree or Trader Joe's); or national or franchise-based small footprint stores -- Starbucks or Panera Bread, for example. These types of tenants tend to have better access to capital and higher credit ratings, making it much more likely that they will continue to pay the rent even when times get tough.
All in all, the company performed surprisingly well through the worst of the pandemic. What should entice investors more, though, is some of the moves it made after the pandemic that could make it look much more attractive in the years ahead.
A lot of baked-in growth
There are several key things that either Kimco has done or are a by-product of Kimco's business that might drive considerable growth in the future:
Last April, the company agreed to merge with Weingarten Realty Investors. The merger gave Kimco an additional portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers and significantly increased its presence in the Sun Belt.
Kimco has the ability to reap big rewards from an investment in Albertsons (NYSE: ACI). At the end of the most recent quarter, Kimco's stake in Albertsons stock was valued at $1.2 billion. That position alone is equivalent to 8% of Kimco's market capitalization and presents several options should it sell.
Kimco has found major traction redeveloping some of its retail centers into multi-use properties that incorporate retail, residential, and hotel components. By 2025, management wants to have entitlements -- real estate parlance for approval to build, which typically involves changes to zoning -- for 12,000 apartment units across 40 of its properties and to receive 15% of ABR from its mixed-use portfolio.
It is also investing alongside its tenants to help many of its anchors leverage their stores into centers for curbside pickup and last-mile fulfillment and distribution of online orders. Giving tenants more ways to increase sales per square foot can lead to significant increases in rental rates when leases are renegotiated.
Speaking of renegotiating leases, many of its anchor tenants are on very old lease agreements (some more than 20 years) that are paying well below market rental rates. Management says 63% of its anchor leases expire between 2022 and 2023, and the average rent per square foot on those leases is more than 25% below current market rates.
Altogether, there is an immense amount of potential sitting in this company's footprint. If management can fully realize the potential here, it's not hard to see the company delivering incredible results over the next few years.
A pandemic-proof company selling for pandemic-panic prices
There is a lot to like about Kimco Realty right now, but it's fair to say that historically, the company hasn't always been a great investment. Since mid-2016, its stock has fallen, although it's been rising since the depths of the lockdown. The company has spent a significant amount of time and capital selling off unprofitable properties and focusing heavily on major coastal or Sun Belt markets while cleaning up its balance sheet. It has been a slog, but the portfolio is in a much better position now to create value for investors.
Shares of Kimco currently trade at 12.2 times funds from operations (FFO) per share. The average price to FFO per share for similarly sized retail REITs is 16.1 times.
So Kimco is trading at a significant discount to its peers. Considering the catalysts coming over the next few years, this is certainly a stock to consider for your own portfolio.

2022-02-28 00:00:00+00:00,Foot Locker's (FL) Shares Down 30% Despite Q4 Earnings Beat,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/foot-lockers-fl-shares-down-30-despite-q4-earnings-beat,,,"Shares of Foot Locker, Inc. FL tumbled 29.8% during the trading hours on Feb 25, despite posting sturdy fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 results. Both the top and the bottom line increased year over year and surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. FL delivered the seventh straight earnings beat and the fourth consecutive sales surprise in the reported quarter.

Starting the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Foot Locker does not anticipate any vendor to represent above 55% of the overall supplier expenditure. This is lower than 65% seen in the year-earlier quarter. This change reflects Nike's strategic shift to direct-to-consumer and Foot Locker's continuous brand and category diversification initiatives. This coupled with a soft view for fiscal 2022 most probably weighed on investors’ sentiments.

Over the past six months, shares of Foot Locker have declined 17.8% compared with the industry’s 9.8% decrease.
Q4 Metrics
The athletic shoes and apparel retailer posted adjusted earnings of $1.67 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43. The bottom line increased 7.7% from adjusted earnings of $1.55 per share recorded in the prior-year quarter.

Total sales of $2,341 million rose 6.9% year over year and came ahead of the consensus estimate of $2,314 million. Excluding the foreign-currency fluctuation impact, total sales grew 8.2%. Digital penetration was 21.6% compared with 27.4% in fiscal 2020 and 18.7% in fiscal 2019.

Comparable store sales (comps) moved up 0.8% in the quarter, with apparel majorly outpacing footwear. The metric in its stores rose 8.8% with store traffic up nearly 25%, while conversion decreased in high teens. North American comps decreased 4.5% while EMEA comps rose high teens and APAC comps increased above 20% with a solid performance across the Pacific and Asia regions.

During the reported quarter, 97% of Foot Locker’s global store fleet was open compared to 87% last fiscal year.
An Insight Into Margins
Foot Locker's gross-margin rate in the reported quarter dropped 10 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter’s tally. Solid merchandise margin gains, offset by occupancy deleverage, mainly reflected higher rent abatements in the year-ago period.

The SG&A rate was 22.4%, deleveraging approximately 140 bps due to increased labor costs, marketing and technology spend.
Store Update
During the fiscal fourth quarter, Foot Locker opened 60 stores, acquired 38 atmos stores and remodeled or relocated 115 outlets. FL closed 76 stores and 120 Footaction of which 45 stores were converted to other banners.

As of Jan 29, 2022, Foot Locker operated 2,956 stores across 27 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand.  Also, FL had 142 franchised stores operating in the Middle East and Asia.

Following the success of its first 50 global community and power stores, management plans to expand to roughly 300 locations in the next three years. For fiscal 2022, management expects opening roughly 100 stores, including 40 community and power outlets, 27 WSS stores and nine atmos stores while shutting down nearly 190 stores.
Other Financial Details
This currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) player ended the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $804 million. Long-term debt and obligations under finance leases amounted to $451 million and shareholders’ equity summed $3,243 million. As of Jan 29, 2022, merchandise inventories were $1,266 million, up 37.2% from the year-earlier quarter’s end-level.

During the quarter, Foot Locker repurchased 4 million shares for $178 million. FL also paid out a quarterly dividend of 30 cents per share or a total cash payout of $29 million. Foot Locker invested $325 million in acquiring atmos and paid down debt of $98 million.

For fiscal 2022, Foot Locker’s board approved a $275-million capital expenditure program. FL also announced a quarterly cash dividend of 40 cents per share, indicating a 33% hike from the prior dividend payout. This will be payable Apr 29, 2022, to its shareholders of record as of Apr 14. The board authorized a new share repurchase program to buy back up to $1.2 billion of the outstanding common stock.
Long-Term Plan
Foot Locker is focused on boosting customer experience, investing in long-term growth and driving productivity. In this regard, management will accelerate efforts, including greater diversification of merchandise and vendor mix, acceleration of the shift to off-mall and rollout of the important growth banners, advancement of omni-channel endeavors and implementation of the cost-savings program.

As part of Foot Locker’s investment in GOAT Group, both companies are in active discussions to design programs with a target set to boost the value proposition and consumer experience. In addition, management expects WSS to hit $1-billion annual sales by 2024, backed by higher store openings and same-store sales growth. Also, FL anticipates atmos’ annual sales to grow 50% to roughly $300 million in the next three years by scaling up the same in the existing markets and enhancing the same internationally.
Outlook
Management exited fiscal 2021 on a solid note reflecting momentum in the business. Going into fiscal 2022, Foot Locker continues to gain from substantial flexibility in its real estate portfolio, store footprints and optimization of its omni-channel offerings. For the full fiscal, management expects a sales decline of 4-6% and a comparable sales decrease of 8-10%.

Gross margin is anticipated in the range of 30.1-30.3% and the SG&A rate is forecast to be 20.2-20.4%. Driven by occupancy deleverage and elevated supply-chain costs, the gross margin is likely to decrease 410-430 bps. SG&A is anticipated to leverage 30-50 bps in fiscal 2022.

Foot Locker envisions adjusted earnings per share of $4.25-$4.60 for the fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2022 earnings is currently pegged at $6.13, which is likely to witness downward revisions in the coming days.

2022-02-28 00:00:00+00:00,Things to Note Ahead of American Eagle's (AEO) Q4 Earnings,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/things-to-note-ahead-of-american-eagles-aeo-q4-earnings,,,"American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. AEO is expected to register robust top-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 results on Feb 2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.52 billion, which indicates growth of 17.6% from the year-ago reported figure.

American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise

Key Factors to Note
American Eagle's fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 performance is expected to have benefited from the significant progress on its Real Power Real Growth value creation plan. The plan is driving profitability through real estate and inventory optimization efforts, omni-channel and customer focus, and investments to improve the supply chain. Robust consumer demand for its merchandise and brands has been aiding its performance.

Strength in the digital business has likely been another driver. The company’s efforts to expand its omnichannel capabilities have been aiding digital sales.

Driven by the trends and progress on its growth plan, American Eagle recently updated its fourth-quarter and fiscal 2021 view. The company expects to achieve an operating income of $600 million in fiscal 2021. This will help it surpass its fiscal 2023 operating income and margin goals two years ahead of schedule.

Additionally, American Eagle’s updated fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 view suggests gains from solid demand and pricing actions. It anticipates fiscal fourth-quarter revenue growth in a mid-to-high teens range on a year-over-year basis and mid-teens growth on a two-year basis. The operating income is likely to be $90-$100 million, inclusive of freight expenses of $80 million stemming from supply-chain disruptions.

The company is also focused on enhancing the supply chain under the Real Power Real Growth plan. Its recent acquisitions of Quiet Logistics and AirTerra to offer affordable same-day and next-day delivery services bode well. The buyouts are expected to have transformed the supply chain and helped expand AEO’s customer base, as well as drive growth, particularly in its online channel. This is expected to have boosted the fiscal fourth-quarter performance.

However, continued SG&A expenses due to higher store payroll, store openings and rising advertising costs are likely to have been worrisome. Elevated freight costs are expected to have been concerning.

Factors to Consider
Dollar Tree has been gaining from strength in the H2, Dollar Tree Plus and the new Combo Stores, which are part of the company’s Key Real Estate Initiatives. It is also poised to benefit from the expansion of the aforementioned stores as part of the plan. The company is progressing well with its store optimization initiatives.

The Family Dollar H2 stores have been performing well, with the newest format store, Combo Store, exceeding expectations. At the Dollar Tree banner, its multi-price point Dollar Tree Plus! concept store has been gaining popularity among customers, particularly for the discretionary categories. This has helped improve store productivity.

Also, its Crafter’s Square offerings have been performing well, driven by the expansion of its Crafter’s Square offerings to include essential and seasonal products. The initiatives are expected to have boosted the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

Dollar Tree’s restructuring and expansion initiatives, including steady store openings and improvement of distribution centers, are likely to have driven revenues. The company has been on track to leverage Family Dollar and Dollar Tree distribution center systems, and combined merchandise. This will help in bringing the latest products into Dollar Tree stores without any disruptions.

The company’s digital and omni-channel capabilities and same-day delivery service with Instacart are also expected to have driven traffic trends in the fiscal fourth quarter.

The aforementioned factors instill optimism regarding the upcoming results. On the last reported quarter’searnings call management predicted consolidated net sales of $7.02-$7.18 billion for fourth-quarter fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2021, the company expected net sales of $26.25-$26.41 billion compared with $26.19-$26.44 billion mentioned previously. Comps growth was forecasted to be in the low-single digits for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2021.

However, DLTR has continued to reel under dismal margins, which has been denting the bottom-line performance. Management, on its last reported quarter’searnings call envisioned fiscal 2021 earnings of $5.48-$5.58 per share, down from $5.40-$5.60 per share mentioned earlier.

The company has also been witnessing elevated industry-wide freight costs, including higher costs for inland transportation by truck and rail. Higher freight and supply-chain disruptions are likely to have acted as deterrents in the fiscal fourth quarter.

Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price and EPS Surprise
  Abercrombie & Fitch Company price-eps-surprise | Abercrombie & Fitch Company Quote
Key Factors to Note
Abercrombie's fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 results are expected to reflect the impacts of the resurgence of COVID-19 cases due to the Omicron variant. On its recent update on the fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 outlook, the company noted that it witnessed weak inventory in key categories due to port congestion and transportation delays.

As a result, it failed to keep up with customer demand, which led to a loss in sales during the peak holiday season sales. Notably, the Hollister and Gilly Hicks brands suffered the most.

Management predicts fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 sales to be flat to down on a two-year basis compared with the earlier mentioned 3-5% rise. This can be attributable to unexpected inventory delays, as well as COVID-related impacts and restrictions. However, the metric is anticipated to grow 4-6% year over year to $1.122 billion.

The company’s gross margin is expected to be flat to the 2019 reported level of 58.2%. The view includes double-digit AUR improvement on both year-over-year and two-year basis, driven by lower promotions and markdowns.

On the flip side, the adverse impacts of $75 million of freight cost pressure due to the increasing ocean and air rates, as well as higher air deliveries, remain concerning. The company anticipates operating expenses, excluding other operating income, to be up in the low to mid-single digits to the adjusted level of $565 million reported in 2019.

For fiscal 2021, net sales are envisioned to rise 19-20% year over year and 2-3% on a two-year basis. The operating margin is estimated to be 9-10%, whereas it reported 1.7% and 2.3% in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The company expects capital expenditure of $90-$95 million, down from the previously communicated $100 million.

Despite the current health situation and ongoing disruptions, Abercrombie is expected to have witnessed strong customer demand in the fiscal fourth quarter, which is likely to result in the highest annual operating income and margin in more than 10 years, along with accelerated sales trend post the holiday season.

Sturdy demand for the company’s winter and holiday collection, particularly in jeans, dresses and sweaters, is likely to have contributed to its sales during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday period.

The company has been gaining from robust digital sales momentum, gross margin expansion and tight expense control. Lower promotions and markdowns, efficient expense management, and strategic investments across marketing, technology and fulfillment are likely to have aided the fiscal fourth-quarter performance.

The digital business is expected to have mainly benefited from the addition of customers in the channel, backed by robust digital marketing efforts. Also, high customer retention and spend per customer are likely to have boosted sales in the to-be-reported quarter. Abercrombie has been on track with its cost minimization measures.

2022-02-28 00:00:00+00:00,How Investors Can Grab Better Returns for Retail and Wholesale Using the Zacks ESP Screener,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-investors-can-grab-better-returns-for-retail-and-wholesale-using-the-zacks-esp-30,,,"Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.
We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.
The ability to identify stocks that are likely to top quarterly earnings expectations can be profitable, but it's no simple task. Here at Zacks, our Earnings ESP filter helps make things easier.
The Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained
The Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate.
With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure. The system also utilizes our core Zacks Rank to provide a stronger system for identifying stocks that might beat their next quarterly earnings estimate and possibly see the stock price climb.
When we join a positive earnings ESP with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or stronger, stocks posted a positive bottom-line surprise 70% of the time. Plus, this system saw investors produce roughly 28% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
Stocks with a #3 (Hold) ranking, which is most stocks covered at 60%, are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. But stocks that fall into the #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy) ranking, or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market. Strong Buy stocks should outperform more than any other rank.
Should You Consider Dollar Tree?
The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Dollar Tree (DLTR) earns a #2 (Buy) two days from its next quarterly earnings release on March 2, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.84 a share.
By taking the percentage difference between the $1.84 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.79 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Dollar Tree has an Earnings ESP of 3.05%. Investors should also know that DLTR is just one of a large group of stocks with positive ESPs. All of these qualifying stocks can be filtered by ESP, Zacks Rank, % Surprise (Last Qtr.), and Reporting date.
Don't forget to head to the Earnings ESP Home Page. There, you'll find lots more earnings-related investing strategies to help build a winning portfolio.

2022-02-28 00:00:00+00:00,Dollar Tree (DLTR) Just Overtook the 20-Day Moving Average,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-dltr-just-overtook-the-20-day-moving-average,,,"Dollar Tree (DLTR) reached a significant support level, and could be a good pick for investors from a technical perspective. Recently, DLTR broke through the 20-day moving average, which suggests a short-term bullish trend.
The 20-day simple moving average is a popular trading tool. It provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period, and is beneficial to short-term traders since it smooths out price fluctuations and provides more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.
Similar to other SMAs, if a stock's price moves above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive, while price falling below the moving average can signal a downward trend.
Over the past four weeks, DLTR has gained 9.5%. The company is currently ranked a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), another strong indication the stock could move even higher.
The bullish case solidifies once investors consider DLTR's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 1 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.
Investors may want to watch DLTR for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.

2022-02-28 00:00:00+00:00,What to Expect Ahead of Pure Storage's (PSTG) Q4 Earnings?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-to-expect-ahead-of-pure-storages-pstg-q4-earnings,,,"Pure Storage, Inc PSTG is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Mar 2.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, management anticipates total revenues of $630 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $631 million, suggesting an increase of 25.5% on a year-over-year basis.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 27 cents per share, up 107.7% from the year-ago quarter’s levels.

The company beat estimates in all of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 101.9%, on average.
Shares of Pure Storage have increased 6.5% in the past year compared with the industry's decline of 5%.
Pure Storage, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  Pure Storage, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Pure Storage, Inc. Quote
 Factors to Note
Pure Storage’s fiscal fourth-quarter performance is likely to benefit from continued momentum in its subscription services, namely Pure as-a-Service subscription (includes Cloud Block Store), Portworx and Evergreen Storage. Portworx specializes in Kubernetes data services and offers its customers extensive data protection along with cloud mobility for containers running on hybrid clouds. Pure Storage acquired Portworx in 2020 for $370 million.

Increasing customer acquisitions (especially large enterprises clients) along with strength in commercial business bodes well. In the last reported quarter, Pure Storage recorded a 12% increase (or 345 new customers) in new customer acquisitions. The company’s customer count stood at 9,500, including 50% of the Fortune 500 companies at the end of the fiscal third quarter.

Incremental gains from the healthy uptake of FlashArray and FlashBlade — particularly the second-generation FlashArray//C (an all-QLC flash array) solutions — might have acted as a tailwind. FlashArray//C is a cost-effective storage array solution that offers clients enhanced performance capabilities and helps them run complex cloud workloads on a single platform.

The company is likely to benefit from recent product launches. In the last reported quarter, Pure Storage unveiled Portworx Data Services, which is the company’s database-as-a-service (DBaaS) Platform for Kubernetes. The platform is designed to make data service management effortless.

Pure Storage also rolled out the Pure Fusion solution in September 2021. The new offering is a self-service and autonomous storage platform with a strong combination of agile enterprise storage and the cloud’s scalability feature. The company is also likely to benefit from the uptake of its Pure FlashRecover offering, which provides all-flash data backup and recovery in case of a ransomware attack.
In December 2021, Pure Storage unveiled a new FlashArray//XL solution, primarily designed for vital enterprise applications like huge databases, cloud-native and containerized applications. The new FlashArray solution safeguards the stored data and enables easy recovery following any adverse situation. FlashArray//XL solution helps in workload consolidation on lesser arrays and streamlines operations along with lowering rack-space requirements. It also helps to slash power consumption and cooling expenses.

The accelerated migration to private and hybrid cloud infrastructure and increasing usage of flash solutions in data centers are driving demand for Pure Storage’s solutions. The continuation of remote work set up due to the COVID-19 crisis is likely to have driven the adoption of Pure Storage’s hybrid multi-cloud offerings and cloud data services.

Higher expenses on product development amid stiff competition from other storage peers might have limited margin expansion in the to-be-reported quarter.

Pandemic-induced global supply chain disruptions and related higher costs are likely to have exerted pressure on fiscal fourth-quarter margins.

2022-02-25 00:00:00+00:00,Can Ross Stores (ROST) Beat Q4 Earnings Amid Cost Headwinds?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-ross-stores-rost-beat-q4-earnings-amid-cost-headwinds,,,"Ross Stores, Inc. ROST is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 results on Mar 1. The off-price retailer of apparel and home accessories is likely to have witnessed revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $5.04 billion, indicating growth of 18.5% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for fiscal 2021 revenues is pinned at $18.9 billion, indicating growth of 51% from the prior-year reported figure.

Ross Stores, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  Ross Stores, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ross Stores, Inc. Quote
Key Factors to Note
Ross Stores has been witnessing robust customer demand, aiding the top line. Sales in the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to have benefited from broad-based growth across merchandise categories and regions, as well as robust comparable store sales. Sales are also expected to have gained from robust trends at the dd's DISCOUNTS business.

On its last reported quarter’searnings call Ross Stores noted that the ongoing strength in consumer demand is likely to continue despite the uncertainty regarding supply-chain woes. It expected to gain market share due to the increased retail closures and bankruptcies in recent months. Ross Stores expected comps to increase 7-9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, while the overall sales are expected to grow 10-13%. Earnings per share are envisioned to be 83-93 cents for the fiscal fourth quarter.

ROST also updated its guidance for fiscal 2021. It anticipated comps to increase 12-13%. Ross Stores expected earnings per share of $4.65-$4.75 per share for fiscal 2021, whereas it reported earnings of $4.60 in fiscal 2019.

Ross Stores has been consistent with the execution of its store expansion plans, which is likely to have aided the top line. The company's store-expansion efforts are focused on continually increasing penetration in the existing as well as new markets. Ross Stores completed its expansion program for fiscal 2021 by introducing 18 Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNTS stores in the fiscal fourth quarter. Gains from the new stores are expected to get reflected in the company's sales for the fiscal fourth quarter.

However, Ross Stores has been witnessing the effects of the worsening of the industry-wide supply-chain congestion, which has been leading to higher freight costs and distribution expenses. This is likely to have partly impacted the company’s cost of goods sold (COGS) rate in the fiscal fourth quarter.

On the last reported quarter'searnings call Ross Stores anticipated greater uncertainty about the worsening of industry-wide supply-chain congestion as the company entered the holiday season. The company’s guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter includes impacts of the ongoing freight pressure related to the supply-chain congestion. Management stated that freight cost headwinds are not likely to subside at least through the first half of fiscal 2022.

JWN is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 numbers on Mar 1, after the closing bell. The fashion specialty retailer is expected to have witnessed revenue and earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter.

Nordstrom, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  Nordstrom, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. Quote
Key Factors to Note
Nordstrom has been gaining from improved merchandise, innovative brand partnerships, solid e-commerce growth and sturdy performance at its Nordstrom banner. The company has been focused on technology advancement by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, and improving its supply-chain channels and marketing efforts.

It has been on track with accelerating delivery speed, in-store shopping enhancements, and expanding other omni-channel capabilities like same-day and next-day pick up, along with increasing labor and fulfillment velocity, and throughput in distribution and fulfillment centers. Gains from these endeavors and robust digital traffic are likely to have driven top-line growth at both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack. Alongside these, the integration of Rack.com onto Nordstrom.com should have contributed to the company's top line in the quarter under review.

The company's fiscal fourth-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from its market strategy, which helps engage with customers through better service and greater access to products, irrespective of the shopping mode. As part of the strategy, Nordstrom expanded facilities like order pickup and ship-to-store to all Nordstrom Rack stores.

JWN also remains focused on the closer-to-you strategy, which aims to link stores and services to expedite deliveries, expand online offerings, and add cheaper merchandise to its Rack off-price stores to improve customers' shopping experiences. A rise in new customers, enhanced personalization and expanded product offering are likely to have aided the fiscal fourth-quarter performance.

On its last reported quarter'searnings call management forecast revenue growth of 35%. It raised its EBIT margin view to 3-3.5% from 3%. For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company envisions significant gross margin improvement on a two-year basis, driven by lower promotional activity and higher regular price sell-through.

However, the company's sales and earnings performances are still short of the pre-pandemic levels. The pre-pandemic period is a more suitable basis for comparison for retailers as elevated COVID-19 impacts related to temporary store closures hurt industry-wide results throughout 2020. Nordstrom is also reeling under higher COVID-related labor and freight costs.

On its last reported quarter'searnings call management expected SG&A expenses related to fulfillment and labor costs to remain high in the fiscal fourth quarter. It also expected supply-chain disruptions to linger throughout fiscal 2022.

2022-02-25 00:00:00+00:00,7 Stocks Reporting Earnings the Week Of February 28,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-reporting-earnings-the-week-of-february-28,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Earnings reports season is winding down. However, there are still a number of household names and closely watched companies slated to report fourth-quarter results next week. These include a marquee electric vehicle maker, several big box retailers and some well-known technology concerns.
In general, fourth-quarter 2021 earnings have been positive. With nearly 85% of companies in the S&P 500 index having now reported their Q4 numbers, 77% have beat earnings per share (EPS) expectations, and 78% have better-than-expected revenues, according to data from FactSet.
However, these facts haven’t prevented stock markets around the world from declining amid the crisis in Ukraine especially with high inflation and the expectation that interest rates are about to rise. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes are now officially in correction territory having each fallen more than 10% on the year.
The 7 Best Web 3.0 Stocks to Buy for March 2022
Here are seven companies with earnings reports on the week of February 28.
Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID)
Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM)
Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)
Target (NYSE:TGT)
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR)
Costco (NASDAQ:COST)
Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL)
 Earnings Reports: Lucid Motors (LCID)

We’ll get an update next week on how the luxury electric vehicle maker is performing relative to other start-ups in the field. The news should be positive now that the company is in full production of its Lucid Air electric sedan.
With plans to begin producing a second vehicle — the Gravity luxury SUV — in early 2023, analysts remain bullish on LCID stock, with Citigroup (NYSE:C) having upgraded the shares to a “buy” rating and a $57 price target, which is more than double its current price of $26.48 per share.
LCID stock has taken a hit amid broader market weakness and reports that the the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating the carmaker’s combination with the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that took it public last July. Lucid has said that it is cooperating with the investigation. Despite the investigation, Lucid Motors has been impressing with its vehicle. MotorTrend magazine named the Lucid Air its 2022 “Car of the Year.”
Wall Street expects Lucid to report an earnings per share loss of -$0.35 on revenues of $36.74 million for the fourth quarter of 2021.
Zoom Video (ZM)

It’s been a tough haul for Zoom Video Communications and its shareholders. In the past six months, ZM stock has declined 64% to $123.68 a share, including a 33% retrenchment since the start of this year.
The stock has been dragged down along with other high-flying technology and stay-at-home stocks that thrived during the pandemic but are now getting dumped by investors in favor or value and defensive stocks. Zoom Video’s share price is now 73% below its 52-week high of $440 a share.
It’s been a stark reversal for ZM stock, which gained 396% in 2020 at the pandemic’s height. However, there maybe room for some optimism for this company and its future outlook. Despite the pandemic coming to an end, Zoom Video continues to grow.
7 of the Top Restaurant Stocks to Serve Up
The company’s revenue was up 71% through three quarters of last year and that growth could continue when it reports Q4 results next week. Analysts are forecasting that Zoom Video will report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.05 on revenues of $1.05 billion.
 Earnings Reports: Salesforce (CRM)

Despite being the largest cloud-based software company in the world, San Francisco-based Salesforce has not been immune to the market downturn this year.
So far in 2022, CRM stock is down 18% to $207.14. That brings its losses over the past six months to 20%. While not as severe as many other tech stocks, it is still disappointing for shareholders who continue to wait patiently for the company’s shares to breakout in a meaningful way.
Salesforce’s leadership team has been heavily criticized lately for their move towards cryptocurrencies, notably non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are often referred to as “digital art.” Company founder Marc Benioff has announced plans to launch an NFT cloud” service.
That plan has been met by an employee backlash, with many staff members having signed an internal letter protesting the move and saying it violates the company’s core values. Analysts are calling for Salesforce to report EPS of $0.75 on revenues of $7.24 billion.
Target (TGT)
Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com
Fourth-quarter results from Target will provide us with a snapshot of how consumer spending is holding up amid an inflation rate that is currently at a 40-year high.
TGT stock was a top performer in 2021, however a year-to-date decline of nearly 15% has erased much of the gains seen over the previous 12-months. However, the big box department store chain that is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota is expected to hold up fairly well in the current inflationary environment given its discounted prices and ability to raise prices as needed.
Analysts will be watching the company’s Q4 print to see how same store sales are holding up and also how Target is executing on its online and e-commerce expansion.

Throughout the pandemic, Target sought to move growing numbers of consumers online to purchase items as many of its physical store locations were shuttered by pandemic safety measures. For the fourth quarter of last year, analysts are forecasting that Target will report EPS of $2.86 on revenues of $31.41 billion.
Earnings Reports: Dollar Tree (DLTR)

Another discount retailer that analysts will be watching closely next week is Dollar Tree. The Chesapeake, Virginia-based company that operates more than 15,000 retail outlets across the U.S. and Canada is expected to announce EPS of $1.77 on revenues of $7.12 billion.
The company’s sales are expected to get a boost from the rapid rise in consumer prices that has pushed many people to seek out cheaper alternatives available at discount stores such as Dollar Tree.
Owing to the expected boost to its business, DLTR stock has held up better than most securities this year. So far in 2022, Dollar Tree’s share price is down less than 1% at $140.38 per share. However, the stock is up 33% over the past six months.
Any beat in its fourth-quarter results could propel the stock even higher. However, it has not been all smooth sailing. It was recently announced that Dollar Tree Executive Chairman Bob Asser will retire following pressure from activist investor Mantle Ridgel, which wants to replace the entire board of directors.
Costco (COST)

Another prominent retailer that will enter the earnings spotlight next week is Seattle-based Costco. The membership-driven, big box retailer continues to be a highly respected company, with legendary investor Charlie Munger recently praising the company’s e-commerce strategy and declaring that Costco will be “an absolute titan on the internet.”
That’s especially high praise since Costco, like many retailers, continues to pour resources into its online sales channels.
Yet the praise and admiration has not been enough to help COST stock avoid the market decline this year. Since the start of January, Costco’s share price has fallen 9% to now trade at $518 a share.
7 Stocks to Buy After Sentiment Slipped to Lows
However, despite the pullback this year, Costco’s share price remains 43% higher today than where it was in February 2021. That speaks to the continued growth and strength of the company and its successful strategy. Analysts are looking for Costco to report EPS of $2.74 on revenues of $51.29 billion for last year’s fourth quarter.
Earnings Reports: Marvell (MRVL)
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com
The week concludes with a Q4 print from semiconductor company Marvell Technology. Like other chip makers and technology stock, MRVL shares have been pulled down this year, dropping 21% since New Year’s Day to $69 a share.
Marvell’s stock has also gotten hit by the ongoing shortage of semiconductors around the world and a general move by investors out of richly valued tech stocks amid a flight to safety in less risky assets such as bonds and gold.
Still, despite the recent decline, Wall Street remains bullish on MRVL stock, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgrading the company’s share price to “buy” from “neutral” and giving it a $95 price target, representing 34% worth of upside potential from current levels.
Many analysts see the current downturn in Marvell’s share price as likely to be temporary and are urging investors to buy the dip. For its fourth-quarter results, analysts are looking for Marvell to report EPS of $0.48 on revenues of $1.55 billion.

2022-02-25 00:00:00+00:00,September 16th Options Now Available For Dollar Tree,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/september-16th-options-now-available-for-dollar-tree,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options become available today, for the September 16th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 203 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new September 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $135.00 strike price has a current bid of $13.70. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $135.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $121.30 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $139.09/share today.
Because the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 10.15% return on the cash commitment, or 18.25% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $135.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $140.00 strike price has a current bid of $15.35. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $139.09/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $140.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.69% if the stock gets called away at the September 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $140.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $140.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 45%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 11.04% boost of extra return to the investor, or 19.85% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 44%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 41%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $139.09) to be 36%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-02-24 00:00:00+00:00,GrowGeneration (GRWG) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/growgeneration-grwg-to-report-q4-earnings%3A-whats-in-store,,,"GrowGeneration Corp. GRWG is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2021 results on Mar 1, after market close.
Q4 Estimates
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter total sales is pegged at $89.2 million, suggesting growth of 44% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for the bottom line is currently pegged at a loss of 8 cents per share. The company reported earnings per share of 3 cents in the fourth quarter of 2020. The estimate has been unchanged over the past 30 days.
Q3 Results
GrowGeneration’s third-quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share of 7 cents marked a 17% improvement from the prior-year quarter. The company generated record revenues of $116 million, reflecting whopping year-over-year growth of 111%. While the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the bottom line beat the same. The company has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 9.4%, on average.
Factors to Note
Last month, GrowGeneration revised its financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021. The company suffered unexpected pressures in fourth-quarter 2021 due to the slowdown in the hydroponics market. An over-supply of cannabis in California and slower-than-initially-anticipated licensing in the newly legalized state has been weighing on the industry currently. Supply-chain disruptions also remained headwinds throughout the quarter.

Nevertheless, GRWG provided revenue guidance between $88 million and $90 million for the to-be-reported quarter. The company reported sales of $62 million in the last year quarter.

GrowGeneration, however, anticipated a decline in same-store sales of 12.3% for the fourth quarter of 2021, whereas it reported an increase of 58% in same-store sales in the prior-year quarter. The sales performance combined with one-time expenses is expected to lead to a loss between $2 million and $4 million in EBITDA on an adjusted basis. Notably, adjusted EBITDA was $5.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2020.

Meanwhile, higher store operating costs due to the opening of stores and acquired stores, and rising salary expenses on account of the increase in corporate staff to support expanding operations are likely to have weighed on the company’s margins in the to-be-reported quarter.
What Our Model Unveils
Our proven Zacks model does not predict a beat for GrowGeneration this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.

Earnings ESP: GrowGeneration has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

2022-02-23 00:00:00+00:00,Earnings Preview: Dollar Tree (DLTR) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-dollar-tree-dltr-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline,,,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Dollar Tree (DLTR) reports results for the quarter ended January 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.
The earnings report, which is expected to be released on March 2, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -16.4%.
Revenues are expected to be $7.13 billion, up 5.3% from the year-ago quarter.
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Dollar Tree?
For Dollar Tree, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.
So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Dollar Tree will beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Dollar Tree would post earnings of $0.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.96, delivering a surprise of +1.05%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
Dollar Tree doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

 Management stated that due to temporary store closures amid the pandemic, the comp-store sales definition was not applicable in the quarter under review. To offer a performance indicator for the stores as they reopen, The TJX Companies came up with a temporary new sales measure — open-only comp-store sales. This includes stores that were initially classified as comp stores (in the beginning of fiscal 2021). This metric reports a rise or decline in sales of stores for the days they were operational in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the same days in fiscal 2020 before the pandemic. Management highlighted that it does not intend to report open-only comparable-store measures for fiscal 2023.

Open-only comp store sales for the company rallied 10% compared with fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 levels. The metric increased 10%, 22% and 1% for Marmaxx (the United States), HomeGoods (the United States) and TJX Canada, respectively. The same declined 2% for TJX International (Europe & Australia).

TJX Companies’ consolidated pretax profit margin came in at 9%, down 1.9 percentage point from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Management highlighted that additional investments to expand distribution capacity as well as wage increases hurt the margin. In addition, net pandemic-induced expenses hurt the pretax margin by 0.5 percentage points. Merchandise margin in the quarter was hurt by rising freight expenses.

Gross profit margin came in at 27.1%, down 1.3 percentage points from fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 levels. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs, as a percentage of sales, was 18%, higher by 0.5 percentage points related to fiscal 2020’s level.
Other Financial Updates
TJX Companies’ ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6,226.8 million, long-term debt of $3,354.8 million and shareholders’ equity of $6,003 million. For 52 weeks ended Jan 29, 2022, the company’s net cash provided by operating activities stood at $3,057.5 million. During the quarter under review, the company returned $1.4 billion to shareholders. Management repurchased and retired 15.2 million shares for $1.1 billion on a trade-date basis, while paying $310 million in shareholder dividends. In Feb 2022, management unveiled a new stock repurchase program, which authorizes the repurchase of up to an incremental $3 billion of the company’s stock. The company plans to repurchase $2.25-$2.50 billion of the company’s stock during fiscal 2023.

Management announced its intentions of increasing quarterly dividend to 29.5 cents per share, reflecting a 13% rise from the current rate. The increased dividend is expected to be announced in March 2022 to be payable in June 2022.

Total inventories as of Jan 29, 2022, were $6 billion. Management is optimistic about its capabilities to provide fresh spring merchandise to its stores and online.

2022-02-21 00:00:00+00:00,Family Dollar Recalls Certain FDA-Regulated Products,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/family-dollar-recalls-certain-fda-regulated-products,,,"(RTTNews) - Family Dollar, Inc., affiliated to Dollar Tree Inc., has recalled certain drug, device, cosmetic, and food products regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in six states citing potential Salmonella contamination due to the presence of rodents and rodent activity.
The affected products were stored and shipped to 404 stores from Family Dollar distribution Center 202 in West Memphis, Arkansas from January 1, 2021 through the present.
The FDA also issued an alert to the public regarding the affected FDA-regulated products, which were sold from Family Dollar stores in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee.
The affected items involves numerous drugs including over-the-counter or OTC medications, medical devices, cosmetics, dietary supplements, and human and animal food products that come under various brand names.
The company said the recall does not apply to products shipped directly to the stores by the distributor or manufacturer, such as all frozen and refrigerated items.
The recall was initiated after an FDA inspection in January, following a consumer complaint, found insanitary conditions, including a rodent infestation, that could cause many of the products to become contaminated. Family Dollar ceased distribution of products within days of the FDA inspection team's arrival on-site.
In its statement, the agency noted that conditions observed during the inspection included live rodents, dead rodents in various states of decay, rodent feces and urine, evidence of gnawing, nesting and rodent odors throughout the facility, dead birds and bird droppings, and products stored in conditions that did not protect against contamination.
Following a fumigation at the facility in January 2022, more than 1,100 dead rodents were recovered. A review of the company's internal records also indicated the collection of more than 2,300 rodents between March 29 and September 17, 2021, demonstrating a history of infestation.
Rodent contamination may cause Salmonella and infectious diseases. Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in infants, young children, frail or elderly people, pregnant persons, persons with pre- existent pathology and others with weakened immune systems.
However, Family Dollar has not received any consumer complaints or reports of illness related to the recalled products to date.
Judith McMeekin, Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs, said, ""Families rely on stores like Family Dollar for products such as food and medicine. They deserve products that are safe. No one should be subjected to products stored in the kind of unacceptable conditions that we found in this Family Dollar distribution facility. These conditions appear to be violations of federal law that could put families' health at risk.""
Consumers are advised not to use and return such products to the Family Dollar store where they were purchased without receipt.
All drugs, medical devices, cosmetics and dietary supplements, from the affected facility are asked to be discarded, regardless of packaging. Food in non-permeable packaging, such as undamaged glass or all-metal cans, may be suitable for use if thoroughly cleaned and sanitized.
