2022-07-07 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting EBAY Put And Call Options For August 26th,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-ebay-put-and-call-options-for-august-26th,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options become available today, for the August 26th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new August 26th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $43.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.27. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $43.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $40.73 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $43.58/share today.
Because the $43.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.28% return on the cash commitment, or 38.54% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $43.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $44.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.45. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $43.58/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $44.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.59% if the stock gets called away at the August 26th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $44.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $44.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.62% boost of extra return to the investor, or 41.04% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $43.58) to be 36%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-07-07 00:00:00+00:00,"Bear of the Day: Etsy, Inc. (ETSY)",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bear-of-the-day%3A-etsy-inc.-etsy,,,"Etsy, Inc. ETSY is an arts and craft fair-style e-commerce firm that soared during covid. The stock has tumbled alongside many other pandemic winners as growth normalizes.
Etsy is also trying to figure out how to stick to its niche roots while expanding into a larger digital commerce player to challenge industry giants.
The Etsy Basics
Etsy is an e-commerce marketplace that allows individuals and small businesses to sell everything from clothing and jewelry to art and home décor. The online retailer was founded in 2005 and went public in 2015. The Brooklyn-based company carved out a solid space within the booming industry by selling items consumers might not be able to find on Amazon AMZN and eBay EBAY.
Etsy also owns musical instrument marketplace Reverb, and it ramped up its growth bet over the last few years. This includes its $1.6 billion purchase of fashion resale app Depop that’s widely popular within the fast-growing resale space, especially with Gen Z. The company also last year purchased fellow online craft seller Elo7 which some have called the Brazilian Etsy.
Etsy makes money from every transaction, as well as advertising, paid search, and more. The firm faced backlash from some of its sellers earlier this year when it raised its transaction fee from around 5% to 6.5%. Etsy executives said that the higher fee—its first increase since 2018—is crucial to help it provide better seller support and expand its marketing efforts.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Etsy closed the first quarter with roughly 5.5 million active sellers on its namesake website, with 7.7 million overall. The company also boasts around 95 million active buyers. Etsy averaged 33% revenue growth in its first five years as a public company. Then its sales skyrocketed 111% in 2020, driven by locked-down spending, face masks, and more.
Etsy followed that up with 35% revenue expansion in 2021. But the covid-boosted growth is over and its faces nearly impossible to compete against periods. Zacks estimates call for its 2022 revenue to climb 8.6% to $2.53 billion, with FY23 projected to pop 16% higher.
Wall Street is frustrated that Etsy’s adjusted earnings are projected to fall 41% YoY to $2.01 per share in 2021. And the company’s FY22 and FY23 consensus earnings estimates have dropped 8% and 9.5%, respectively since its first quarter release on the back of subdued guidance and other macro headwinds.
Bottom Line
Etsy’s downward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. The stock sports “F” grades for Value and Momentum in our Style Scores system. Etsy’s balance sheet is also not as strong as some might hope for an e-commerce player and younger tech company, after taking on a large amount of debt in the past few years to fuel growth.
Etsy stock is still up nearly 500% in the past five years. But it’s down 23% in the last two years and 70% from its November 2021 peaks. Etsy could bounce back, but it might be best for investors to hold off on Etsy until the market shows some willingness to start buying these beaten-down tech stocks and former covid high-flyers.

5 Stocks Set to Double
Each was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2021. Previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.
Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.

Deidre Woollard: It's not easy being a public company. A major software company goes private while airlines battle for acquisitions. Plus, Morgan Housel looks back at the dot-com bubble. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Deidre Woollard, sitting in for Chris Hill, and I am joined by Motley Fool senior analyst Jason Moser. Hey Jason, great to be with you today.
Jason Moser: Hey Deidre, thanks for having me.
Deidre Woollard: I'm excited to talk to you because you've seen cycles in the overall market and we are in this ""let's make a deal"" environment right now. [laughs] There are so many acquisitions. There are rumored acquisitions. It's just all spinning. Some of it is small like eBay buying an NFT platform called Known Origin. But then, last week, you had that larger deal like Zendesk going private for $10.2 billion. We've got the Frontier battle, we've got rumors coming out like PepsiCo and Celsius fitness drinks and FTX and Robinhood. Well, let's start with Zendesk for a minute. So we had a flood of IPOs and SPACs in the last year or two, that flood turned to a trickle and some companies are now going private. What does this Zendesk deal signal to you?
Jason Moser: Well, it signals a couple of things. I think, on one hand, it does feel like clearly the market's appetite for those highfliers has been tempered a bit. That the promise of profits down the line isn't quite as enticing as maybe as it used to be. We saw not all that long ago. So many of these businesses were just trading at 20-30 and 40 times sales, which it wasn't normal, but it kept on going on for a really long time, so it became normalized. All of a sudden, we became a little bit more immune, or just numb to that 20 and 30 times sales multiple. It was really out there though until as market conditions have deteriorated, as the cost of capital continues to go up, you see the market's appetite for those highfliers has been tempered a little bit. So Zendesk going private now around seven times sales, start asking yourself, maybe some of these companies, maybe whether it's private equity or are these larger acquirers, maybe they see where things are headed.
They believe in this digital economy and that is ultimately where we're headed as tech guides more and more of our lives, particularly on that back-end. Maybe these acquirers see that long-term opportunities, these valuation start to come down. I'm not saying they're cheap by any means, 6, 7, 8 times sales is still expensive, I think, conventionally speaking. But it starts to become a little bit more palatable if you can really take that longer view. If you're looking at this as a decade-plus-long play, then all of a sudden, you start seeing these valuations making a little bit more sense. We saw recently private equity firm Thoma Bravo just acquired Anaplan for essentially double that multiple, just a few months back. It does feel like we're starting to see some of these highfliers come back to somewhat palatable valuations.
Deidre Woollard: Well, I think it's interesting because maybe some companies went public, really before they should have in that IPO and SPAC frenzy. I think we saw a lot of younger companies get in the mix before they were really seasoned. Do you think that's some of why we're seeing some of the public companies go private now?
Jason Moser: I think you're absolutely spot on. It's very difficult. If you're a company, particularly exiting that start-up mode and really trying to get your feet underneath there and you're in that type of market that we've been witnessing over the last several years. I'm not saying it's easy money, but you really do want to go public when you have the opportunity to raise as much capital as possible. The enthusiasm has just been there. Enthusiasm bordering [laughs] on speculation in some cases, perhaps yes. But it was an opportunity for a lot of these businesses to raise a lot of capital. I think it's fair to say that a good percentage of them probably weren't necessarily ready to live their lives as publicly trading companies, perhaps witnessed the difficulties that come along with that. When you see an exit strategy, they can maybe let the company get back down to doing what they really want to do. Sometimes, that's a difficult offer to pass.
Deidre Woollard: Yeah. Well, SPAC and spec are just a letter apart. [laughs]
Jason Moser: I like that, it's true. [laughs]
Deidre Woollard: I'm wondering about other targets. I think the whole market is looking at things. I'm thinking about Peloton. We heard a few months ago, that there was all that speculation about who might get them it out. Oatly, Upstart. There are a couple of ones that are bubbling around as potential acquisition targets, any that you're thinking about?
Jason Moser: So Peloton is one that got lit. Just wondering what the end game is for them. It feels like Peloton is an acquisition waiting to happen. I feel like it's a better company than the press is probably giving it credit for right now. It has been raked over the coals a bit, but they make a very good product. I do feel like there probably is the opportunity for them to become part of a bigger family somewhere. I like that you mentioned Oatly. The main reason why I feel like with Oatly, feels like that's a company that probably has a bit of a tricky time on its own as a public traded company.
But, there are a lot of food-related businesses out there with a lot of brands under their umbrella. Where there's this move toward plant-based is real and it's got a lot of legs. I was just thinking the other day, that we saw on the news that Kellogg is going to split off into three different businesses here. While the snacks-related businesses probably what gets most of my attention just because I'm a snack head. They're also going to have a plant-based company that's been out from this. Oatly strikes me as a business that could be a perfect complement to something like that. So it's been a little bit of a tough time for Oatly as a publicly traded company, but I wouldn't be surprised at all to see some food companies that they are really taking a closer look at this. Because again, I do think the plant-based movement is real, it's growing. I think it's difficult to make that journey on your own in that food business.
Deidre Woollard: Yeah. I think that one's interesting, too, of the three businesses that Kellogg's is spinning off. The plant-based one is the turkey of the bunch, unfortunately. [laughs] But thinking about fold-in acquisitions and things like that, as an investor, if you're looking at stocks, does it ever make sense to buy a company just because it might be an acquisition target?
Jason Moser: Well, getting back to speculation, I think if you're buying shares of a company because you thought, well the crux of your thesis is acquisitions. That's certainly a bit more speculative. Everybody's got their own way of doing it. I personally, I would never use acquisition or potential of acquisition as a thesis. But I will say it can be part of the calculus when you're weighing the risk-reward. That's something to keep in mind because ultimately when we make investments, you're really trying to get an idea of what is the risk versus the reward with this investment. Obviously, you want that reward to tilt in your favor as often as possible. So when you see a business where you feel like, this is a good business. If they don't execute, then the worst case is maybe the business gets acquired. I could see that as playing into the calculus for the risk-reward. I would never make it the crux of my thesis, though.
Deidre Woollard: Yeah, that makes sense. But we got some news that this JetBlue, Spirit, and Frontier deal just keeps happening. JetBlue keeps raising its offer. What does this fierce competition mean for shareholders? Any ideas on how this is all going to play out? It's been fascinating to watch.
Jason Moser: It is, and it's not just this market. I think it extends well beyond airlines. Airlines are a bit of a unique market in that the regulatory barriers involved and really the limited, I guess, competition. It is a market where scale really matters. Size really does matter when it comes to building an airline. That's all fine and well. I do appreciate that perspective. I think it's always worth keeping in mind that with investors, you see times when these valuations get stretched, you see how bad a company may want another asset, and then you start to see this bidding war. You have to start asking yourselves, what is a fair value? Do we get to the point where maybe they're paying too much? That could be a big problem. Sometimes, it's nice to see the company step back and say, hey, you know what? No, we're good. We wanted this, but we don't want it at any cost. I think you have to keep that in mind, because for shareholders, overpaying for these acquisitions, No. 1, acquisitions are really hard.
Integrating an acquisition into your business, there are a lot of risks that come with that, business model risk, culture risks, all sorts of financial risks. You see, for shareholders, this can result in bloated balance sheets, lots of goodwill that eventually needs to be written off. You start to question management's actual judgment, does this make sense? One thing that came to mind when we were going through these questions, talking about this a little bit earlier was a good example that comes to mind recently is Teladoc Health. Teladoc Health is a good example of a business that, for a long time, part of its strategy was to grow through acquisition. Now, it was smaller acquisitions. It wasn't doing anything crazy. It was just buying little, small bolt-on acquisitions to expand the comprehensive nature of its offering. To a certain point, it had executed very well. You look at BetterHelp, for example, that they acquired, I think for under $10 million and grew that side of the business up to a $750 million-plus revenue generator.
But then they go, and they acquire Livongo Health for $500 billion. Of course, that's not how much they paid, but that's how much it feels like they paid because they sure paid, it seems like, way too much for something like that. What we've seen since that acquisition is the market just has not been on board. Now, you're seeing essentially the value of that acquisition has completely been erased from the Teladoc Health side of the business. You start to ask yourself, well, this company, they had a really good track record up to that point. Is that a one-off or is that a sign of poor judgment on management that we may expect to continue? We don't know the answer to that yet, but it really just goes back to show that you do like to see management maybe draw a line sometimes and say, we want this, but we don't want it at any cost, because there are real costs to shareholders down the line for companies that do just vote to pay anything for an acquisition.
Deidre Woollard: Yeah. I think this one is really complicated, too, because you have more overlap with JetBlue and Spirit in terms of flights, and you have maybe more regulatory risk. So I think it's going to be interesting to watch the next couple of days and see what happens with that one. Because definitely, we're going to see some more news on that. I want to take it to the other end of the money universe, the private side. There was a report that came out from CB Insights showing that venture capital has just really dropped dramatically, dropped 23% between the first and second quarters of this year. Total funding, down 27%. I'm watching this at the same time that I'm seeing tech layoffs at start-ups and publicly traded companies. I'm wondering, what does this mean as we see this serves a great source of innovation? As this funding starts to dry up, what does that mean for some of those potential unicorns out there?
Jason Moser: Well, you would think in theory this means something slows down, or at least there's a lull in some of this investment, but to steal a line from Jurassic Park, ""Tech finds a way."" [laughs] To steal another line from Arrested Development, ""There's always money in the banana stand,"" Deidre. [laughs] There is always a lot of capital out there to put to work. So I think that what we likely see from this is less waste and more focus, doubling down on the things that work and maybe putting some of those moonshots on hold. That's not to say that we don't see investment in some of those longer-term moonshot-y ideas, but maybe you put those on hold for a little bit and really focus on the things that are working. But it's been a material slowdown for sure. For the first quarter of 2022, the global IPO market saw 321 deals that raised just over $54 billion in proceeds. Those numbers are down 37% and 51% year over year, respectively. So it is real that, that inflow of capital has slowed down. That definitely plays a role in these businesses weighing where they need to allocate that capital because it becomes a little bit more difficult to come by.
Deidre Woollard: Yeah, absolutely. In the report from CB Insights, also mentioned that Series D funding rounds are far down. That makes me wonder if more of those companies that are more mature might IPO or maybe even SPAC to try to raise capital instead.
Jason Moser: It's certainly possible. Going public opens a lot of doors to raising money. That is one of the benefits of being a publicly traded company, you just have a lot of ways that you can raise capital. So I'm sure that's something they're thinking long and hard about.
Deidre Woollard: Well, thanks so much for your time today, Jason. This was fantastic.
Jason Moser: Thanks, Deidre.
Deidre Woollard: Next up, Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp continue their conversation on past market declines with Morgan Housel. In this part of the series, they're going to talk about what was my first scary experience in investing, the dot-com bubble.
Alison Southwick: So, let's get into it. So for me, the dot-com bubble, I was around, I was alive, not an investor. So from my outsider perspective, it seems like this perfect storm of exuberance over this new thing, the internet, and not quite understanding it, and these companies coming in. We know it's big, we don't know exactly why. But then also, investing in these companies also becomes a lot easier. That's my quick take, but you're going to give us the longer take, if I'm right.
Morgan Housel: No. I think that's exactly it. Those two points coming together at the same time is really what made it crazy, versus other times in history when there was a new industry that was coming along that was going to change the future. One in the 1960s was plastics, which is almost funny to say. In the 1960s, plastic was, this is going to change the world. The companies that were making plastic were the big, innovative companies that had huge growth in front of them. But plastics didn't change how anyone invested at all. You had a lot of excitement, you had overvaluation. But with the internet, it was, hey, not only is this going to change the world, but now, you can invest way easier, faster, and cheaper, and you're just bombarded with more information than ever before. So you put those two together, and I think that's the backbone of what led everything to get out of control so quickly. The other thing about this period is that, when people talk about the dot-com boom, they talk about the late '90s. This is how they say it, or sometimes they say the 1990s. It was really only a 12 or 18-month period in 1998 and 1999 that it got really out of hand.
It really happened pretty quickly. For most of the '90s, even when this was going on, there was growth, and the stock market was doing well. But it was mostly rational and made a lot of sense from what was going on. It just blew off top right at the end, where things started getting really crazy. A lot of that craziness was really only captured in a small number of companies in that period at the end, where the stock market in general, or if you take a look at the stock market, most individual companies peaked in 1997,1998. It was the gains that the market experienced in 1999 when things were really getting crazy and the market was going up 30, 40, 50 percent was driven by five companies like AOL, Walmart, GE, just a few big tech companies, Cisco, Microsoft, Yahoo!. That's where all of the overvaluations were. But a lot of the hype ended way before that. So there's a lot of nuance in what happened that I think gets missed when we just lump everything into, the '90s were a big, irrational, crazy time to invest. I think that's directionally true, but there's a lot that went on in between that takes the story in different directions.
Alison Southwick: When did things start warming up with the internet? It's, the internet, it's a thing. When was that?
Morgan Housel: I think you have to take it back to personal computers, which was the '70s and '80s. Even then, that's when Microsoft and IBM really started getting into the game, particularly the mid and early '80s. But even then, it was still seen as something that tech hobbyist would have in their house and wasn't really, you had people like Bill Gates who were the visionary saying this is going to be on everyone's desktop, but very few people outside of Bill Gates and his cohort.
Alison Southwick: Core Radio Shack customer.
Morgan Housel: Exactly those people [laughs] really started believing it until the early '90s, which is when, Windows as we know it, took off and the interface of personal computers really started making sense for people who had no tech background whatsoever.
Alison Southwick: Oh yeah, the mouse. Clicking on things.
Morgan Housel: Exactly, not just the mouse. They had the mouse for like a decade before that, but previous versions of personal computers like MS-DOS. You really had to know what you were doing to get any usefulness out of it, and it was really the first version of Windows when it made sense. Like oh, you have folders and you click on the folders and you have stuff in there. That was the early '90s when it really started taking off that average individual people could get something useful out of this. Then in terms of when the internet started, really the first event that gets cited a lot as the birth of the dot-com bubble when people really started opening it up to not just the internet potential, but the investment potential was when Netscape went public. It was I think 1994, and it shares doubled on the first day that it went IPO then went public and that was the first signal, the first example of what was to come. Not just in terms of how this is going to change people's lives or how it's going to change how people invest it as well.
Alison Southwick: Yeah, spoiler. Our young kids listening to podcasts have no idea what Netscape even is.
Morgan Housel: No.
Alison Southwick: [laughs] So you're not the one that started it all.
Morgan Housel: That was a big deal because before that you had the internet, but it was again, it was something that you needed to be at a tech genius to use. The browser was the first one that brought it to average everyday people in a form that they could use.
Alison Southwick: Yeah, I always used Ask Jeeves.
Morgan Housel: I did, too. That was a big one.
Alison Southwick: Ask Jeeves was a good one, too. Then [Alphabet's] Google came along and all those other ones too.
Robert Brokamp: I was a teacher actually when internet first started taking off. I got my first email address in 1994 and I still have that same email address.
Alison Southwick: You do not.
Robert Brokamp: I do.
Alison Southwick: Really?
Robert Brokamp: For me, like being a teacher, that just opened up your world, being able to show kids different things, to be able to pull up a video. YouTube wasn't around at that point, but you could still get videos. It was just mind-blowing. Then from there, I went to the financial services industry and I started becoming a broker in 1997 one of the first jobs you have to do there is cold call people. Every time I would cold call people, they'd say I don't need you. I'm doing better all on my own. This is not something you could say even in the late '80s because you needed a broker to buy a stock. But that gets back to how things just changed so much that you didn't need a financial advisor. They're also looking back on that, too. People were doing well because they were concentrated in tech stocks. Once the downturn came, they probably didn't do so well.
Morgan Housel: What so many people did when they could start investing on their own was not investing on their own, but day trading on their own. Guys come at the first iteration of hey, I don't need a stockbroker, I can do this by myself. I don't have to ask anyone's permission. What am I going to do is we do not buy and hold investors. This is the whole concept of day trading was born in the 1990s. When here's your E*Trade account or TD Ameritrade day tech. That was one of the big ones in the '90s. Here's your day tech account. What are you going to do? Are you just going to trade stocks all day and because there was so much momentum in Tech Stocks that was just going up day after day after day, that just made the concept of day trading that much more enticing. They only had the opportunity to day trade. But hey, maybe you could double your money a day or a week. So it just drew in all people who had no idea what they're doing or no business doing them.
Robert Brokamp: Earlier this year, the Bespoke Investment Group published a table of the composition of the sectors, the S&P 500 over various increments. You look back at 1990, tech stocks made up 6.3% of the S&P 500. By 1995, it was 9.3 so growing. By 1999, it was 29% of the S&P 500, and they have all the sectors going back to 1990 up until 2017 and at no point do you see any other sector making up that much of the S&P 500.
Morgan Housel: Much of the gain in that way back to what we were saying earlier was really just a handful of companies, Yahoo!, Cisco, AOL.
Robert Brokamp: Lucent.
Morgan Housel: Lucent. Those were few companies that were worth hundreds of billions of dollars. They were really driving the bulk of that.
Alison Southwick: So, the internet. It's going to be the next big thing. Everyone's investing in it. At the same time, The Motley Fool is getting swept up in this.
Robert Brokamp: We're going through right along with everyone else. We've talked about this on previous episodes. I joined in '99 the Motley Fool when we were at 150 employees. At one point, we were over 400. Then things changed. By the time at the bottom where we were like 70 people or so, something like that and I'll say living through that one thing that is a part of this in terms of the stock market and how bad it got, part of it was the September 11th attacks happened in 2001. You could look at some things. For example, 2001, small cap-stocks actually did pretty well. It was the tech stocks that were suffering, but you could look elsewhere in the stock market and find good returns. But then September 11th came and I think that changed a lot. I remember being in the company and David Gardner saying, ""There's some things you can't predict when you're running a business and one of them is terrorist attacks.""
Alison Southwick: By law, we also required to talk about the AOL-Time Warner deal.
Robert Brokamp: As we sit here in the Time Life building?
Alison Southwick: Yes. We are in the Time Life building which is crazy.
Morgan Housel: That is true.
Alison Southwick: That feels like such an iconic moment of the dot-com bubble, too.
Robert Brokamp: In 1999, AOL was the 10th-biggest publicly traded company in the country.
Alison Southwick: Again, we all had their floppy disks and CD-ROMs.
Morgan Housel: You've Got Mail.
Alison Southwick: You've Got Mail. It was a movie starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. I mean, come on [laughs]. They peaked. [laughs] They peaked right there, quite literally. What made the bubble burst, in addition to September 11?
Morgan Housel: That's one of the big things you were talking about the crash of '87 and even the crash of 1929 where there's not one specific event that you can pinpoint in the newspaper on the day the stock market peaked and said this is what caused it. It's just things get out of control. I think when enough people start to question what they're doing and enough people start whispering to their coworkers and their cousins and their neighbors like, hey, this is starting to get pretty crazy. I think those moods can shift pretty quickly. Then it just snowballs just as fast and reverse as it did on the way up. You don't need that much momentum on the way down before enough people throw in the towel. Then just as momentum, just as buying begets more buying on the way up, selling does the same thing on the way down.
So stocks peaked in March of 2000 and a lot of you have gone back and said why March 2000? What happened at this time? There's really not any specific event that really triggered it beyond just people's moods and attitudes changing and it was until 18 or some odd months later that 9/11 hit. That's a specific event obviously that took the economy and the stock market down a whole another level. But before that it was really just a big change in moods. There were some events of companies that we're going to go public and their IPO was canceled because there wasn't enough demand. But that in itself is triggered by the same change in investor moods. Just people start giving up at some point.
Alison Southwick: What did we learn from the dot-com bubble?
Morgan Housel: I think a lot. If you look at other new industries that really change the world. One I think of is the birth of the car industry in the early 1900s. There were hundreds, if not, a thousand car makers, and car manufacturers in the early 1900s and three of them survived: Ford, Chrysler, and GM. I think the same thing happened with the internet where you had thousands of people try their hand at this new technology that clearly was going to change the world and a very small handful of them survived. You talked about Ask Jeeves earlier, that was one of the big search engines. Then there was AltaVista and all these other new search engines, dozens of people that could see the opportunity and said, I'm going to try my hand at it. But in end, there was pretty much Google that you have one company that want it in the end. There's always that big, just like a culling of the herd that happens whenever you have a new industry, thousands of people trying and only a few will make it.
Because of that, in hindsight, you're going to have all these horror stories from the 99.9% of companies that didn't make it. Then you have investors that had, lost a ton of money on those. That scars them for a whole another generation. But the car industry itself changed the world, changed how we live and the internet did the same thing, even if along the way it burned not just a few people, but most if not almost everyone who partook in it. So that's the risk of new industries. Even when you can identify that this industry is going to change how we live, identifying the specific company, I don't want to say needle in a haystack, but close to it, that's going to be the survivor is incredibly difficult to do.
If you are going to play that game, I think preparing yourself that the success rate of these companies that are going to not only survive but thrive for decades after it is in the single-digit percentage. In terms of successors, David Gardner is one who is not only good at identifying companies or even doing well, but more importantly, I think he has the disposition to deal with the loss rate that comes along with identifying new industries and he would be, it's not that he's happy about it, but I think he has the disposition to be OK if half the companies in this portfolio do extremely poorly, knowing that one or two are going to do really well and drive that portion of this portfolio.

Fed-up investors who dumped Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) stock in March will regret it. BABA stock bottomed at $73.28 in mid-March 2022. The following month, Premier Li Kequiang said it would pause its crackdown on the sector. The shift to promoting economic growth proved helpful to BABA stock. Shares are up by around 60% from the 52-week low. It only needs less than 50% more in gains to return to yearly highs.

BABA Alibaba Group Holding Limited $115.33
BABA Stock Roars Ahead
China backed off on its push for common prosperity amid the Covid-19 omicron outbreak. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) abruptly shut down Shanghai in late March. At the time, it planned lockdowns that would last no more than a week. Two months later, the economic devastation forced the government to shift its priorities.
7 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next Decade
To ease the devastating economic hardships on its people, the Chinese government will tone down its crackdown on technology firms. The sector not only lost trillions of dollars worth of market capitalization, but also faced a slowdown. To re-accelerate growth in the current quarter, the government must let Alibaba, its rival JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), and internet retail firm Vipshop Holdings (NYSE:VIPS) thrive.
On Jun. 8, China’s gaming regulator approved licenses for 60 game titles. This is the boldest signal from The National Press and Public Administration. Chances are very high that the government has continued to loosen its one-year-long regulatory policies.
Valuation
BABA shares are dirt-cheap. The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is around two times. The internet retailer trades at a steep discount to its American peers. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is on a downtrend and still trades at a 10 times forward P/E. eBay also has a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.18 times, whereas Alibaba has no meaningful debt.
Per Tipranks, the average analyst price target is $162.34. More recently, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) rated Alibaba stock a buy with a $162 price target.
Investors who prefer to build financial models may use this enterprise-value-to-EBITDA multiples model. By comparing Alibaba to JD.com, eBay, and Vipshop, the fair value is $165.47.
Rumors of Ant Financial IPO
Twice in June, rumors circulated that the CCP would accept the Ant Group application. This would allow Ant Group to set itself up as a financial holding company. After the Reuters report, China denied the rumor.
On Jun. 22, Bloomberg reported that Ant Group might apply to become a financial holding company. Within hours after the market opened that day, no one could confirm the rumor. Despite the market’s manipulation of BABA stock, chatter about the initial public offering (IPO) for Ant Financial is a positive development. Markets are warming up to Alibaba again.
Investors cannot expect Alibaba will recover from its glorious growth in mid-2017 and onward. Back then, China enabled technology firms to thrive. Today, the government is limiting its growth.
Is BABA Stock a Buy Now?
After forming an uptrend, Alibaba is becoming a roaring tiger again. This time, it will moderate its growth ambitions. It will not seek more market share in the e-commerce space. Nor will it try to dominate the financial technology market with Ant Group.
Now that the CCP is not watching Alibaba as closely, investors may expect the stock to outperform the markets from here.

While this change doesn't affect Shopify's valuation relative to revenue and earnings, it makes the stock more accessible for smaller investors who don't have much money to put in the market.
That said, is it time to bet on Shopify?

What is Shopify?
Shopify is a global e-commerce platform that allows small business owners to build and customize online stores that can sell through multiple mediums, including online, in-person, and brick-and-mortar. Unlike rivals such as Amazon or eBay, which primarily operate third-party marketplaces, Shopify focuses on the business side of the equation -- making it a unique, well-differentiated way to bet on the industry.
Like most technology-related companies, Shopify has faced significant macroeconomic challenges in 2022. With an inflation rate of 8.6%, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to continue shrinking its balance sheet and hiking interest rates to cool the economy. These moves increase the cost of capital for companies while making investors less willing to buy pricey stocks with future expectations built into their valuations.
Shopify's shares are down by a staggering 74% year to date -- at least partially because of these headwinds. But the company also faces some company-specific challenges that shouldn't be overlooked.
A victim of its own success
First-quarter revenue grew 22% year over year to $1.2 billion, a massive deceleration from the prior-year quarter, when sales jumped 110% over the prior-year period. Management also expects revenue to be ""lower"" in the first half of 2022 but didn't give any exact numbers. While slowing growth is the last thing investors want to see in a growth stock like Shopify, the trend should be seen in the proper context.
The pandemic years of 2020 and 2021 saw an unprecedented surge in online shopping, which is giving companies like Shopify challenging comps in the near term. But the company's long-term thesis as a way to bet on independent e-commerce businesses remains intact. Management is also working on new growth drivers to keep the ball rolling.
In May, Shopify completed its $2.1 billion acquisition of shipping logistics start-up Deliverr. This deal will help it create an end-to-end logistics platform, better enabling its merchants (which are usually small businesses) to compete with giants through features like two-day and next-day delivery. The company's focus on creating a strong economic moat will help it continue to expand in the post-pandemic world.
Should you buy Shopify?
Bear markets are a great time to shop for quality companies at a discount. And with a strong economic moat, combined with healthy growth prospects, Shopify is definitely a company to watch. The recent stock split may also make it more psychologically appealing to small investors.
That said, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of almost 600, the stock isn't as cheap as it now looks. And with the Fed expecting to continue raising interest rates, modestly profitable growth stocks like Shopify are likely to remain under pressure in the near term. Investors may want to wait until some of these issues are resolved before taking a position in the company.

2022-06-30 00:00:00+00:00,August 12th Options Now Available For eBay,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/august-12th-options-now-available-for-ebay,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options begin trading today, for the August 12th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new August 12th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $41.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.13. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $41.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $38.87 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $41.78/share today.
Because the $41.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.20% return on the cash commitment, or 44.10% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $41.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $42.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.45. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $41.78/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $42.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.39% if the stock gets called away at the August 12th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $42.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $42.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.86% boost of extra return to the investor, or 49.78% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $41.78) to be 36%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

This video was recorded on June 24, 2022.
Chris Hill: It's Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Chris Hill and I'm joined by Motley Fool senior analysts Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger. And it's good to see you both.
Jason Moser: Hey.
Matt Argersinger: Hey.
Chris Hill: We've got the latest headlines from Wall Street we'll get an update on the entertainment media landscape, and as always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar. But we begin with the big puzzle. On the one hand, data out Friday indicates that both gas prices and mortgage rates are starting to drop. On the other hand, some major companies are either freezing, hiring or laying people off. Matt, let me start with you. Everyone is looking for clues to where the economy and the stock market are going. But it seems like clarity is weeks, if not months away.
Matt Argersinger: Absolutely. Chris, I'm trying to figure it out myself. But I think what I can say confidently is, that this isn't like 2008. There's not a systemic crisis that is going to bring everything down. Jobs, the economy, asset prices, energy prices, credit markets, and the whole world basically crashed back in 2008. I think we all agree on that. I think what we have today is just really a big jumbled mixed bag. It's the best way I can describe it. Because I think on one hand you've got industries. You've got the homebuilders, you've got manufacturers, you've got technology companies seeing a pretty sharp slowdown. But on the other hand, you've got the energy industry, which is having its best moment in more than a decade. You have hotels and resorts that are charging rates that are higher than before the pandemic, to travel, it feels pretty strong. Retail is doing fine for the most part. It just feels really unsettled. I think you can make good arguments for the economy to go in either direction. I think that's being reflected in the stock market right now, investors have a sense that there are opportunities and there always are opportunities. But they're hesitant because you just don't know what kind of shape the economy is going to be in several months from now, and what higher interest rates are going to mean for a lot of businesses. I think a holding pattern is where the investors and the stock market are right now.
Chris Hill: Jason, I want to key in on one word Matt said at the end there and it hasn't, because I think that as much as anything, that sums up the mood for a lot of individual investors and also for the fund managers and institutional folks on Wall Street, there is a hesitancy to jump into this market with both feet.
Jason Moser: It reminds me of that Larry David GIF or GIF, whatever side of the argument you fall on there. But he is like uncertain. He is like maybe so maybe not. I don't really, we're doing that right now, it does feel that way. I like your use of the word puzzle because it feels like we're trying to just put these pieces together and it's just right now that picture just isn't there. I mean, there's so many signs pointing in so many different directions and consumer sentiment at a record low, personal savings rate is around 4.4 percent now and falling, there's not going to be more stimulus really to help prop up the consumer spending in that regard, credit card balances going up, starting to see some pressure in the jobs market.
Then you look at the way the market has been performing. I'm glad many brought up 2008 because that's an important time to remember. We all lived through that as investors have felt like the prevailing attitude at the time was the world was coming to an end. It felt like it was because there were some fundamentally structural issues at play there that don't exist today. If you look at the way the market performed in 2008, it wasn't good Chris, meaning it was down 36 and a half percent and that's right about in line with the average bear market since 1929. The S and P Blues is on average about 36 percent. We're not even close to that right now. I mean, there is every reasonably we could see the market go lower, but it doesn't necessarily mean it will. Then you add to that this dynamic in play that over the last 20 years, half of the S and P strongest days occurred during a bear market and certainly we're all seeing that play. I mean, there's just some very big moves to the upside on certain days when the headlines look a little bit better than others and so it makes it for a very confusing time I think. Honestly, it really does point back to why we invest the way we do here because it is very difficult sometimes to try to ascertain exactly what's going on on a daily basis.
Chris Hill: Adding to the confusion is the fact that at the close of trading on Friday, the Russell 1,000 Value Index will do some rebalancing. Among the stocks being added to the value index our Netflix, PayPal, and Meta platforms, the parent company of Facebook. Jason those are three of the biggest growth stocks of the past executive. What are they doing in a Value Index?
Jason Moser: Well, other than the obligatory rebalancing that comes from stocks headed to different benchmarks, I think it's interesting to think about why these businesses are where they are today. You look at the performance year-to-date, Meta down 50 percent, PayPal down 59 percent, Netflix down 68 percent. There are reasons why that's happening though. The bigger question investors need to ask themselves as opposed to why are these value stocks? Why are these companies where they are today? I think these are all businesses they're all market leaders in their own right. There is uncertainty about at all three as well. What is that uncertainty and what are the chances that they can turn this conversation around? You look at something like metaphors to me, Meta stands out as the one with the most uncertainty because it seems like it's placing all of its chips on the metaverse. Which right now is just a big fat question mark for a lot of us. We don't know what that's going to look like. We don't know how many people are going to choose to participate. We don't know how really that's going to monetize video streaming and digital and mobile payments. I think the uncertainty is very much just been last. There's just less uncertainty in regard to those long-term tailwinds there. It's going to be interesting to watch how these businesses recover from this value territory. But it's also worth remembering that as businesses get bigger this just becomes more and more of the part of the conversation. We had a point that we're talking about Apple in this light. As it became a dividend-paying stock, wow Chris, that worked out pretty well for investors. I would encourage you to see the glass half full in this case.
Chris Hill: From value stocks to bellwethers shares of FedEx of nearly 10 percent on Friday, fourth-quarter results were mixed, but FedEx escape strong guidance for the new fiscal year. I'm done, shareholder Matt, but this is one of those companies that I root for because of its role in the broader economy.
Matt Argersinger: I'm not a shareholder either Chris, but after these results, I'm thinking about it because, go back to our earlier discussion on the economy. If you want to feel pretty good about things, look at FedEx's earnings. In the quarter just ended in May, revenue was up eight percent year-over-year, get adjusted operating profits up 13 percent, and pretty much better profit margins across the board. This was a quarter by the way, where we had significantly higher fuel prices. That's a huge line item for FedEx, yet they managed through a pretty darn well, and yet the guidance was where the strength was really. You had forecast earnings-per-share growth around 14 percent in the current fiscal year, which just started. Now some of that growth is coming from buybacks. So FedEx, which really hasn't been a big repurchase serve its stock. They bought back more than two billion dollars worth of stock over the last fiscal year. That's really helping the earnings-per-share. They also recently raised our dividend by 53 percent. You step back and you have this bellwether business. There stock is trading for roughly 11, 12 times forward earnings and now the dividend is yielding two percent, and you got double-digit earnings growth potentially this year. Like I said, I don't own shares of FedEx, but I think if you're a shareholder today, you've got to feel pretty good about it, and it tells you a pretty good story about the economy.
Chris Hill: On Tuesday DocuSign announced that CEO, Dan Springer was leaving effective immediately. Board chair Maggie Wilderotter takes over as Interim CEO, as DocuSign looks for a permanent replacement. Jason we've talked before about how a rising stock price provides a halo effect for CEOs were in a bear market. Shares of DocuSign are down more than 50 percent year-to-date. They are not alone, as we have discussed before. I'm wondering if you expect to see more changes in more corner offices.
Jason Moser: I absolutely think it's a possibility. A business that stands out to me as being a part of this conversation is PayPal. It wouldn't shock me at all to see CEO Dan Schulman, at least feeling like the spotlight could be turning his way. You look at what's going on with DocuSign, these companies have found themselves on the tricky spot. I mean, this is a business that's fundamentally far better than it was even just a couple of years ago. If you've look at first quarter of 2019 revenue for DocuSign, 214 million dollars, you fast-forward today, first-quarter of 2022, those revenue of 588 million dollars. I mean, it's, it's the working its way toward profitability, but it is cash flow positive. I mean, this is a business is fundamentally a better shape, but there were some unforced errors along the way that we're committed in regard to forecasting, there's employee attrition.
Dan Springer, to be fair, took his lumps here recently talking about how they did such a great job of fulfilling demand during a tough time. That demand more or less just showed up on their doorstep though. They didn't do as great a job. They took their eyes off the ball in creating demand. I think that could be where the concern for this business is today. Perhaps there's another shoe to drop. It's hard to say. But I do know when you look at the recent language in PayPal's call, there was a tone of humility on the part of Dan Schulman and Singleton, ""We need to rethink our philosophy and methodology around forecasting. We need to get back to where we were before the pandemic, and making sure we give the ball to our teammates and let them develop and run and grow this business as well."" I said it before. It felt like maybe PayPal became a little bit of a Dan Schulman-centric story. It felt like maybe DocuSign became a little bit of a Dan Springer-centric story. That's a sword that can cut both ways. Unfortunately, in this case, it resulted in Mr. Springer having to step down.
Chris Hill: I don't mean to indicate that the sole report card for any CEO should be the stock price. It just seems though that because of the environment we are in, you used the word rethinking, I can see more boards of directors, and in some cases maybe CEOs themselves, evaluating where they are, where their business is, and saying, ""You know what, it might be time for a change.""
Jason Moser: Yeah. It's just no two ways about it. Leadership can make or break a business in certain cases. You can never take these types of situations for granted. A good business is a good business, but you'd still have to have someone leading the way.

Chris Hill: Up next, we've got the latest in housing, restaurants, and more, so stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
[MUSIC]
Chris Hill: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here with Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser. Shares of Darden Restaurants up nearly five percent this week. The parent company of Olive Garden raised their dividend 10 percent and posted higher-than-expected profits in revenue for the fourth quarter. Jason, we talked about this earlier in the week, Olive Garden drives the bus for Darden [LAUGHTER] but they've got a fine-dining segment that's doing much better although management is being cautious with their guidance.
Jason Moser: They are. Darden has always been very good about using its size to its advantage and keeping prices low, maximizing efficiencies, and reaching every level of consumer from the lower-end to the higher. It certainly feels like they've been able to keep that ball rolling here over the last couple of years, which have been a tough time for really all restaurant businesses. But to your point there on the numbers, total sales up 14.2 percent. That was driven by a same-store restaurant sales of 11.7 percent. Now, like you said, Olive Garden drives the bus. That's the biggest contributor to the business, and those comps were up 6 and 1/5 percent. But the fine dining to your point, 34 and 1/5 percent, Chris, people wanted to treat themselves this quarter it sounds like.
That's all very encouraging. I think the 10 percent boost to the dividend from a quarter ago is a sign of strength as well. Interestingly, what Darden does, and you heard the on the call a lot, they continue to under-price inflation and their competition. Inflation has really been a key theme for a lot of these calls. They continue to focus on under-pricing inflation in their compensation to present a value proposition and bring people in. It certainly worked out very well for them on Mother's Day. It was the highest sales day ever for Olive Garden and the second highest guest count day in history. Interestingly also, on staffing, right now they have more managers per restaurant than pre-COVID times. So at the manager level they are doing great. They're back to basically pre-COVID levels on the team member side as well. Though they did note there's some pockets of restaurants where there's some staffing issues. But generally speaking, in a world where staffing in the service industry has been very difficult, it feels like Darden has managed their way pretty well and that is playing out on the business.
Chris Hill: Am I the only who thinks that when earnings season hits up in July and August we're going to hear the phrase staffing issues for more than a couple of retailers and restaurants out there?
Jason Moser: I feel like we will and it feels like Darden's put themselves in a pretty good spot where this is concerned.
Chris Hill: KB Home's second-quarter profits and revenue came in higher-than-expected and shares up nearly 15 percent this week. Matty, you watch real estate and housing more than anyone I know. What, if anything, does a home-builder like KB Home tell us about the housing market?
Matt Argersinger: Well, it tells us a pretty good story, I think. I was looking at KB Home's results and to me they told us exactly what I think most of us think is going on with the housing market, which is housing market is not crashing. It's not falling off a cliff by any stretch. People are still buying homes, especially in strong markets like the Southeast, Southwest, and even California, where KB Home does a lot of its building. There has been some moderation though, as we've seen, interest rates, mortgage rates surge higher really historically over the past few months. If you look at KB's result, even though revenue and margins were higher, that's really mostly reflective of higher home prices. Deliveries, on the other hand, were flat. Orders have actually come down and cancellations have picked up a little bit. To me, KB Home going up as much as it did recently is really just a relief rally because home-builders have just been hit really hard. You got the higher revenue, higher margins, but lower growth. I think that's the same story a lot of home-builders are telling right now.
The one disagreement that I have with KB is their guidance. It has been a little worried. They're guiding that the average selling price is going to keep moving higher to about $500,000. Right now it's around $490,000. That strikes me as pretty optimistic. I expect we're going to see a moderation in prices. We're going to see those orders continue to come down. I feel home-builders are probably going to protect margin more than anything else. They're already facing a lot of pressure on the supply side and the cost side. I'm a little concerned, but I do think the home-builders, are just being beaten down so hard, including KB Home that any decent continues. In other words, housing market is not crashing, good news, is going to send their stocks probably higher.
Chris Hill: Should we be looking for similar guidance from other home-builders as well and essentially compare what they think is going to happen to home prices going forward to what KB Home is saying?
Matt Argersinger: I think that'd be smart to do. We're going to see this coming quarter when the home-builders report what they say about the average selling prices. I expect a lot of the other home-builders, like NVR, and D Horton, are going to come out and say, ""Now we actually think prices are going to stay roughly flat, maybe even slightly lower over the next fiscal year, so we'll have to see.""
Chris Hill: This week, Kellogg announced plans to split into three separate public companies, one for breakfast cereal, one for snacks, and one for plant-based foods. CEO Steve Callahan is planning to run the snack business. Jason, I'm already a consumer [LAUGHTER] of both Cheez-It and Pringles so I might have to invest my money where my mouth is.
Jason Moser: Well, I feel like you're probably right there. The snacks company, to my mind, seems like the more attractive of the three opportunities. When you look at the overall business, Kellogg has been relatively stagnant here over the last five years. Compound annual growth rate on the revenue side of 2.1 percent which is just nothing really to write home about. Although I will say, it's had a very good year to-date, stock is actually up and outperforming the market handily. That's nice. Chris, I just had very strong feelings on the tickers here, OK, in two ways, the cereal company's ticker better be pops, P-O-P-S [LAUGHTER], if not missed opportunity. For the love of God, I'm with you on Cheez-Its, [MUSIC] I'm going extra toasty, and it feels like it's a perfect opportunity for that snacks division ticker to be C-H-Z-T. If it's not Cheez-It, color me disappointed.
Chris Hill: Jason Moser, Matt Argersinger, guys, we'll see you later in the show. Up next we will get the latest on the metaverse and the entertainment industry with Senior Analyst Jim Mueller. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money.
[MUSIC]
Chris Hill: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Chris Hill. Earlier this week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Comcast and Alphabet have emerged as the top contenders to work with Netflix on the ad-supported tier of their service. Joining me to discuss in that and other parts of the entertainment media landscape is Motley Fool Senior Analyst Jim Mueller. Jim, thanks for being here.
Jim Mueller: My pleasure, Chris. How are you done?
Chris Hill: Doing well. I want to get your thoughts on Netflix apart from this, but let's start with this story. Is this a lucrative opportunity for whoever wins the right to work with Netflix on advertising?
Jim Mueller: Not right off, certainly not this year, probably not next year, it's going to take a little bit because Netflix and whoever wins, Google, Comcast, whoever, need to figure out how to serve the ads, who gets to see the ads, etc. It could be, but if Netflix shareholders are thinking this is going to be the savior of their company, it's going to take a few years for this to really get going.
Chris Hill: What do you think is a reasonable success metric? What should people be looking for? Because it seems as though Netflix is very focused on launching this in this calendar year.
Jim Mueller: Look for revenue growth as our management said at the end of the call, last quarter, I think the first quarter call, but for quite a while, Netflix's revenue growth is going to be still subscriber counts. How many subscribers do you have? Because remember anyone who goes to ad-based here and is willing to be served those ads, Netflix is losing money on, because they're going to lower the price. They have to make that up plus whatever extra they can get per person for that. If you're thinking of billions and billions of dollars of revenue from advertising, they're going to have to overcome even more billions of lost revenue because of the drop in the pricing tier.
Chris Hill: Why do you think Netflix is going the route of partnering with someone? Certainly, Google is as experienced at advertising digitally as any business out there. Is it just so that they can launch this sooner? Because I'm sure there are people within Netflix who are making the argument saying, no, we should build this thing ourselves.
Jim Mueller: You answered your own question. Yes, this is to get it out there quicker. Get someone who knows the advertising business because Hastings and Sarandos and those guys, they do not know advertising at all. They know content, they know subscription, they diddly on advertising. Get somebody who is experienced on that, learn from them, and in comments made today in another Wall Street Journal article, Co-CEO Ted Sarandos is quoted as saying that basically they want to end up building their own and iterating and making it their own thing, which means that this partnership is going to be a few years, maybe a decade at most, I think, just from what they were saying. They definitely want to do it themselves, but I think they recognize that in order to start generating more revenue, they need to get in this faster than the two year timeline they mentioned at the end of the first quarter.
Chris Hill: What do you think the current state of Netflix is? Is this a stock that looks, certainly, it's lower priced than it was, say, a year or so ago and it's always fascinating to me when there is a business that is the clear leader. Let's be clear about this, all other subscribing services would love to have the number of subscribers that Netflix has. They're the clear leader in that category, but the stock is really beaten down right now.
Jim Mueller: You're asking is it a value play? No, I think it's a value trap at the moment. They're in trouble. They lost two million subscribers this last quarter. They came in two million subscribers light against what they had guided to Wall Street, and when they issued that guidance in January, it was half of what Wall Street was expecting. They got pounded about that and they couldn't even make it because of a near one percent churn. For the current quarter, Q2, which they report in middle of July, they're guiding to a two million subscriber drop. That's the first time they've ever guided in 16 years. I've been tracking this for 16 years. That's the first time they've ever guided to a subscriber drop, and if they miss on that and the drop is three or four million, you don't want to be buying shares at today's price. That means the virtuous cycle of more subscribers means more revenue, means more spending on great content, which brings in more subscribers. That's been the driver for the company so far, but now if their subscriber count is actually beginning to go down, you're going to start running that backwards and that is death to the company. They need to get revenue, that's why they've finally caved on the advertising campaign, that's why they're starting to focus on very carefully so they don't push people away on the sharing issue of passwords and so on. I think they are reacting to things and in trouble and before investing in it again, I would like to see them start to solve these problems. Full disclosure, I do not longer own any shares of the company.
Chris Hill: Earlier this month, there were reports that Netflix might be buying Roku. Certainly, the more recent reports about Comcast and Alphabet probably put all of that to rest. If you're a Roku shareholder, are you disappointed or are you relieved?
Jim Mueller: As Sarandos confirmed that in the same article, we don't need it, as a quote, declining to comment on reports that Netflix could be interested in buying the streaming of Roku. I was quoting from the Wall Street Journal article, we don't need it. Frankly, anyone who actually thought about it said they've got six billion dollars of cash on the books, how much are they going to spend to buy Roku and what is it going to give them and how else might they use that money? Remember, they are spending a lot of money on that content. I don't think the Roku thing was anything more than a rumor and not even much of one. As a shareholder of Roku, probably relieved. Roku has pretty solid business by itself. They've just hit a little bit of rough patch and I think shareholders give that management team time to get through it, they should be all right.
Chris Hill: Let's move away from streaming video and into the metaverse. Meta Platforms CEO, Mark Zuckerberg said this week, his goal is to have one billion people in the metaverse, each spending hundreds of dollars a year. Let's put aside whether or not you or I think it's going to get to a billion people and how long that will take. I am curious though about the commerce part in all of this. When you think about the metaverse, do you think there are public companies that are among the likely candidates to either enabled e-commerce in the metaverse or provide the entertainment or services or whatever that people are going to actually spend money on?
Jim Mueller: Sure, advertising. That's what Facebook, I'm sorry, I can't say Meta Platforms [laughs] without cracking up. That's obviously where Zuckerberg is going with that, but there's so many ways to play the metaverse. You've got advertising, you've got companies like the Trade Desk that do a good job of placing ads where they do the most good and they'll learn from the patterns of what people do inside, whatever platform they're on about which ads would serve those people well. You've got Google, Alphabet, of course, and their expertise of advertising. Then you've got the platforms. The way a lot of people are talking about it is as if the metaverse is a single thing, it's not. It's scattered all over the place. You've got Facebook's version, you've got Roblox's version, and within that you've got a whole hundreds, if not thousands, of different little worlds to go explore. You've got live baseball that has metaverse. You see what they call stat cast, the arc of the ball, the speed of the pitch, the placement. All of that is using data from the real world and adding a layer of computer-generated imagery and information on top, which is what's called augmented reality, if I've got my terminology right. You could play into, Major League Baseball is not public, but there are companies that collect that data and provide it. Sportradar is probably the biggest player there. Lots of different ways to play it. If I were going to be investing in this long-term trend, I'd want to be willing to sit for at least a decade as it slowly builds out. It took a long time for the Internet to really get going, and this I think is bigger and requires more of a commitment by people to have some hardware permanently on, if they're going to be in it all the time. That is going to take longer for this to come into reality for most people.
Chris Hill: You mentioned live baseball and that's actually where I want to wrap up because I know you're a big baseball fan. Apple and Peacock are each paying Major League Baseball $100 million for the rights to stream games. Amazon Prime is doing New York Yankee games on Friday nights. As someone who is a subscriber of ApplePlus, they are pushing the baseball on a regular basis. I'm curious if these are services that you think are going to lure people in because the larger trend, obviously, is something that I think we all talked about for a while and it took a while to get going, but it was this idea that big tech companies like Apple and Amazon would actually start bidding on live sports. There are people back in 2008, '09, and 2010 saying this is coming. It actually took a little bit longer. But do you think Apple and Peacock dipping their toe into major league baseball as waters. Do you think this is a prelude to larger things?
Jim Mueller: Oh, definitely. Apple in addition to that baseball stuff, they are the likely winner of the NFL Sunday ticket. Just hasn't been announced yet but that's the speculation, which means they will have a bunch of American football games on every weekend starting probably next year. I think directed to you. DirecTV has the contract through the end of this year. So not not only baseball but sports in general. I mean, I ran across a story while thinking about this. Sinclair, the television network company there, they just launched, in fact, that went live this past week their regional sports and network valley sports as a independent streaming service to play baseball games for the five baseball teams in their regional sports network and regional sportsmen networks like yes, Yankees. I don't know what the ES stands for but it's the Yankee 1. Any SM covers the Boston Red Sox, all these regional sports networks, they're starting to launch their own little subscription services to this. Major League Baseball, of course has the whole thing, except for your regional teams for 150 a year finally, pulling it up. [laughs] [MUSIC] Just to watch them on my Mariner games. This is definitely happening and this is definitely a thing and you can expect more and more of it to come going forward.
Chris Hill: Jim Mueller, good luck to your Mariner. Thanks for being here.
Jim Mueller: Thanks.
Chris Hill: Up next, Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger return. I got a couple of stocks on their radar, so stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
[MUSIC]
Chris Hill: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talked about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. So don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here once again with Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger. Our email address is podcasts@fool.com. Got a question from Levi in South Dakota who writes, any updates on the activision blizzard buyout? We're saving to build the house and I'm wondering if this is too risky to put some of our house savings into for an arbitrage play. Warren Buffett likes it. So does that indicate safety? Let me just thank you for the question Levi. Let me just review for folks who haven't been following this closely as we have back in January, Microsoft announced it would buy Activision Blizzard for $95 a share. The deal is expected to close next year. At the moment, Activision shares are around $77. At the end of April, Warren Buffett said at the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting that Berkshire owns 9.5 percent of Activision Blizzard, and it's because he said, sometimes I will see an arbitrage jail and I'll do it and I'm coding here, it looks like the odds are in our favor, but absolutely we can lose money on this company, fairly large sums of money depending on what happens if the deal blows up. So map, we can't give specific personalized guidance for Levi, but I don't know. I think the fact that Buffet himself is signaling like, yeah, we like our odds, but there's no guarantee. I feel like that in and of itself provides even more guidance.
Jason Moser: That's the guidance. These can be a dangerous effort through said at first, but it's the metaphor of picking up pennies in front of a steam roller. In this case, it's a little different though the spread is so wide and you've got buffered behind it. I have to say this is one of those arbitrage plays. Just speaking from my own personal perspective, I own shares of Activision Blizzard, not because of the arbitrage play. I've owned the shares for years, but it's one of those situations where I do think there's probably not as much downside because of you said the stock's at 77, well, that is just slightly above where Activision's been trading the last five years. I feel like even if the deal falls through regulatory concerns or what have you, I don't feel like it's a situation where the stock is actually going to plummet. It will fall, but maybe the downside isn't as sharp as it might be, say, for another arbitrage play. So maybe one of small bet for the average investor, I don't know.
Matt Argersinger: Jason, I feel like this is one of those situations. If you're interested, maybe make it a small percentage of your investing dollars.
Jason Moser: Yeah, I think that's fair. The old saw goes if something bookstore seems too good to be true usually is. It feels like in this case I'm with Matt, it does feel like this deal likely happens, and even if it doesn't, I mean, Activision Blizzard around zone is still a good business, so the downside is relatively limited, but you go back to the funds. I mean, it's funds are for building a house. So this is a big deal. You don't want to put that stuff at risk. I think it all goes back to just these are the types of situations. Maybe you have a small portion of your portfolio that's dedicated to special situations investing, which is what this would qualify as. Also remember, there are going to be short-term capital gains taxes here replay depending on the type of account that you use. But I tend to agree with Matt, it feels like the downside in this case is probably somewhat limited.
Chris Hill: Let's get to the stocks on our radar. Our man behind-the-glass, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question. Matt, you are up first. What are you looking at this week?
Matt Argersinger: Chris, I am looking at eBay and the tickers, E-B-A-Y, simple as the comps, everyone knows eBay and it's still an e-commerce powerhouse. I mean, they did 10 billion in annual revenue last year. Still have 147 million active buyers, 17 million active sellers, so it's a huge platform, huge marketplace. It's just a huge big-time cash-generator. Nearly 1.8 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months. They've used a lot of that cash flow to reduce share count by buybacks. They bought back over 50 percent of the stock over the last nine years. Trades at a 4P multiple 11, they start paying a dividend 2019. They've raised that a few times already. I hate disagreeing with the market, but I think eBay is way too cheap right now.
Chris Hill: Dan, question about eBay.
Dan Boyd: You know, it's not too cheap, Chris. All the stuff that I want to buy on eBay [laughs] I got to tell you boys, I do like eBay as-a-service. It is a wonderful way to get things that are out of print or special or signed or anything that is commemorative, remember Bill or whatever. I love the service. I think that as the stock if it's super cheap right now, might be a good opportunity because I don't think eBay it's going anywhere.
Matt Argersinger: There you go, Dan.
Chris Hill: Jason Moser, what's on your radar?
Jason Moser: Keeping an eye on Qualcomm ticker, Q-C-O-M, I'm going to have a good fortune next week to interview CFO Akash Palkhiwala. We'll be talking hopefully about a wide range of topics, things like how they're handling the ongoing supply chain issues, Apple's moves to becoming more vertical. They have an ongoing partnership with Microsoft and of course, their ongoing efforts in building out 5G. But hey, it's also worth noting dairy founding affiliate of 6G and UT, a program at University of Texas that is working on the inevitable rollout of 6G and all of its applications. So it should be very fun and educational interview, and folks probably know I've recommended Qualcomm and both of my services here at the fools. [MUSIC] So I'm especially excited.
Chris Hill: Dan, question about Qualcomm.
Dan Boyd: Now, Qualcomm seems like one of those stocks from the '90s that has just stuck around for whatever reason, I'm sure that they have been very important in developing technology and stuff in the past. But all I can figure when they think of Qualcomm is like a landfill lines.
Jason Moser: Well, Dan, that's not really a question, but I'm going to put it into question forum and added to the interview next week. So thanks for the help. [laughs]
Chris Hill: A love the reference to landlines, Dan, of those two, do you have one you want to add to your watch list?
Dan Boyd: You know what Chris? As much as I like the old rotary phone, I think I'm going to have [laughs] to go with eBay on this one again it's service that I love. I think it's a great site.
Chris Hill: Matt Argersinger, Jason Moser guys, thanks so much for being here.
Matt Argersinger: Thank you.
Jason Moser: Thanks, Chris.
Chris Hill: That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money radio show. Show is mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Chris Hill, thanks for listening. We'll see you next time.

2022-06-29 00:00:00+00:00,Pinterest Is Shooting Itself in the Foot With Its CEO Change,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pinterest-is-shooting-itself-in-the-foot-with-its-ceo-change,,,"Shares of image-based social media company Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) have fallen more than 75% in the past year, as slowing user signups, a reversal of the trends that accelerated its growth early in the COVID-19 pandemic, and worries about the impact of an economic recession on advertising revenue combined to hurt confidence in the stock. The situation finally reached a head late Tuesday, and Pinterest took the aggressive move of bringing in outside help to take over the role of CEO from founder Ben Silbermann.
Pinterest's stock moved up by 4% in premarket trading on Wednesday, so it's clear that many of those who trade the stock agree with the positive view of the leadership change presented in the company's press release. However, despite the short-term appeal of broadening the skill set of the C-suite to include more direct experience with e-commerce, Pinterest is risking the most important aspect of what made it such a distinctive presence in the social media world to begin with.
Pinterest is Ready for change...
Taking over for Silbermann is Bill Ready, who has done extensive work in e-commerce and strategic planning. Ready was chief operating officer of PayPal Holdings before moving to Alphabet's Google, where he served in an executive role in commerce, payments, and boosting user adoption.
Ready said all the right things from a typical investor's standpoint in the release announcing his appointment. Expressing admiration for Pinterest's brand and platform, the new CEO sees himself building up Pinterest's ecosystem. He specifically emphasized creating value for shareholders as he looks to take the social media company to the next level.
Silbermann echoed the change in strategic emphasis, expressing the goal of ""helping Pinners buy, try and act on all the great ideas they see."" With 400 million active users of the Pinterest platform, Ready isn't the first person to have seen plenty of potential to turn Pinterest into a massive money-making machine.
... but are Pinners ready for hard-sell monetization?
Yet to be successful, Ready will have to convince Pinterest users that they, too, can get value from the company's monetization efforts. Silbermann is optimistic on that front, noting that Ready wants to preserve Pinterest's positive vibe. Andrea Wishom, who is Pinterest's lead independent director on its board, sees Ready having similar values to Silbermann and sees the new initiatives as part of a broader strategy to inspire users to build the lives they want to live.
Unfortunately for this bullish case, it's possible that Pinterest's opening efforts to boost advertising and monetization have already started to curtail growth. Although revenue rose 18% year over year in the first quarter of 2022, adjusted net income fell 12%. More worryingly, global monthly active users fell 9% to 433 million, with an even steeper 13% drop in the U.S. and Canada, where Pinterest has historically enjoyed much higher monetization metrics like revenue per active user.
It's unfair to attribute the entire decline in user counts to monetization efforts, as at least some of the drop is simply a natural reversal as more people return to off-line pursuits. But more aggressive tactics to boost sales and profits could turn more Pinterest users off if they start to interfere with the positive inspiration they get from the site.
Don't kill the golden goose
eBay serves as a cautionary tale that Pinterest should take seriously. The online auction pioneer had command of its e-commerce niche, but persistent increases in fees have hurt the platform's appeal. User counts have fallen, and after a pandemic-led boom, eBay's stock is back to where it was in early 2018.
Pinterest built something that eBay never was: a positive influence on the lives of millions of people around the world. Silbermann's vision was instrumental in creating that experience for users. If Ready isn't careful, he could end up being the one who lets a remarkable social media company become a massive disappointment for hundreds of millions of users.

eBay (EBAY)

eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has evolved from a small startup to one of the most valuable companies in the world. It is now one of the world’s leading online auction websites, with over $10.42 billion in annual sales, and it offers millions of products across many categories.
eBay allows buyers to purchase items from sellers, with a wide range of goods available for sale, including antiques, collectibles, vintage goods, electronics, cars, and more. eBay also provides services such as an auction house that enables sellers to list items for sale at fixed prices or auctions with various bidding options and payment methods.
The Covid-19 pandemic hit eBay hard, but it could bounce back quickly. The company was able to create a strategy to target users who were searching for specific items and also promote its category offerings. However, although e-commerce stocks like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has had success before and after Covid 19, eBay was more dependent on the pandemic for its recent success.
However, it’s been showing improvement over the last few years, with a very high velocity of sales and lots of active buyers. Its platform also brought in new improvements, helping it to keep up with its competitors. But keep a long-term investing horizon in mind with this one.
Mastercard (MA)

Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is a credit card company that offers a wide range of services. It has been listed on Forbes as one of the world’s largest companies.
Mastercard has grown to be one of the most popular cards in the world and is now accepted by over 200 countries. It has gradually increased its business in recent years, and as a result, it is now considered one of the most popular cards in the world. It was founded in 1966 by George J. Laurer and named Master Charge but changed its name to Mastercard in 2008.
Mastercard’s growth can be attributed to several factors, such as its powerful marketing strategy, wide acceptance and innovative technology.
However, the growth in the last five years rests largely on the shoulders of its digitalization strategy, which saw it develop mobile apps, an online payment platform, and other digital products for its customers.
Top Stocks: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a holding company that controls Google, Nest, Waymo, X Lab  and CapitalG. Its one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalization of $744 billion.
Alphabet is one of the world’s largest internet companies, with Google at its heart. YouTube is a massive platform, with more than 1 billion hours watched worldwide per day. By Q4 2021, YouTube revenue was $8.6 billion – more than the $7.7 billion  reported by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in the same period. Its biggest potential money-spinner, though, is the cloud division. Revenue for the segment jumped 47% in 2021 to more than $19 billion, a 7% share of Alphabet’s revenue.
However, due to the wider tech sell-off, Alphabet is not doing well. It allows you to purchase the stock at a discount. The company just reported a stellar set of earnings and is gearing up for a 20-for-1 stock split in July. Therefore, the time to buy is now.
Top Stocks: Lowe’s (LOW)

In the last few decades, Lowe’s has expanded its business to include stores in Canada and Mexico and online shopping.
Lowe’s and its competitors will be seeing more homebuilding projects in the coming year, thanks to a tight housing market. We expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. Plus, work from home is becoming more prevalent.
Remote work is on the rise. On a worldwide basis, more than 16% of companies are fully remote, according to a study by Owl Labs. This study found that 61% of the workers 22 to 65 often or always work remotely. The benefits of remote work include increased productivity, improved time management and a better quality of life for workers.
It also means more work around the house since workers will spend a lot of time in and around their premises.
Home improvement is a secular trend that has been growing over the past few years. The industry has seen steady growth in the number of projects undertaken by homeowners, builders, and renovators.
Lowe’s has increased its dividend every year for over 50 years. Its never missed an annual dividend payment or defaulted on its debt. It is hard to see it changing as millennials enter their prime buying years. This rare stock is indeed a safe investment option.

2022-06-25 00:00:00+00:00,3 Dividend Stocks You'll Wish You'd Bought on the Dip,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dividend-stocks-youll-wish-youd-bought-on-the-dip,,,"When a company has a long track record of paying out dividends to shareholders regularly, that tells you a lot about what kind of business you're looking at. Such companies are usually able to produce consistent profits from their operations no matter what is going on with the economy.
Dividends are particularly valuable for investors during bear markets. For example, dividends contributed 73% of the market's total returns during the 1970s, and have averaged 40% of stock returns over all decades since 1930, according to Hartford Funds.
We asked three Motley Fool contributors to recommend dividend stocks they think are well worth considering right now. Their picks: McDonald's (NYSE: MCD), Home Depot (NYSE: HD), and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY). Dividend stocks won't make you rich overnight, but they are good for promoting restful nights during turbulent market environments.
The golden arches still stand tall after 60 years
John Ballard (McDonald's): You usually can't go wrong investing in name-brand companies during bear markets. Over the last 10 years, McDonald's has nearly doubled its quarterly payout to $1.38 per share. That gives it a payout ratio of 55% compared to earnings, so the fast-food giant has plenty of breathing room to keep its dividend up even if its profits drop for a time. Over the last decade, long-term McDonald's shareholders who opted to reinvest their dividends into more shares have earned a 262% cumulative return -- outperforming the S&P 500 index's total return of 242%.
McDonald's strong brand power and consistent growth have allowed it to become a Dividend Aristocrat, with 46 consecutive years of payout hikes. Most importantly, the company is coming out of the pandemic growing faster than it did in 2019. Its global comparable sales grew by 5.9% in 2019, but slipped by 7.7% during the shelter-in-place environment of 2020. Comp sales grew again by 17% in 2021, which comes to 8% when measured on a two-year basis.
Delivering that magnitude of growth is not easy for a global business of this size. What's clear is that McDonald's is a well-managed business. Its Accelerating the Arches strategy has centered around better marketing, focusing on core menu items, and doubling down on digital ordering and delivery, and it's clearly working. A well-run, iconic consumer brand is a recipe for great shareholder returns.
No matter how saturated a company's market might seem, investors shouldn't underestimate how a great brand can find ways to keep delivering market-beating returns to shareholders over many decades. McDonald's stock has outperformed Wall Street year to date, down only 9% compared to the S&P 500's decline of 20%. At the current share price, its dividend yield is an above-average 2.23%. This stock would make a great portfolio addition for those looking to invest in simple businesses that distribute extra cash to shareholders.
A solid and fast-growing dividend
Jennifer Saibil (Home Depot): Home Depot is a no-brainer stock to own for several reasons, but my investment thesis for it centers on two of the most important factors when choosing stocks: potential for gains and dividends.
Investors will commonly categorize equities as either growth stocks or value stocks. Those companies that pay dividends are typically mature and past their high-growth stages, which puts them in the value camp, but as a group, dividend stocks tend to perform better than those that don't pay dividends. Home Depot is a classic example of a well-run organization that distributes a hefty fraction of its excess cash to its shareholders while also funding new ventures. That combination has led to market-beating performance.
The pandemic brought an unprecedented opportunity for the company as people staying at home spent heavily on home improvements. As the largest home improvement retailer in the world -- and with a robust omnichannel program -- it was able to meet surging demand both in stores and online. As was to be expected, its growth is slowing down now. But it beat expectations in 2022's first quarter and raised its outlook for the year. So far, it's managing through inflation and supply chain problems. The strong housing market has also been a tailwind, although things might change on that score with rising interest rates. There's a lot that's up in the air right now with macroeconomic shifts, and that will probably affect Home Depot to some extent the same way it's affecting most retailers and many other companies. At times like these, it's particularly wise for investors to focus on well-managed companies with established track records and clear potential.
As for its dividend, at today's share prices, the stock yields an above-average 2.8%. That's not the highest around, but Home Depot is growing its payout faster than many higher-yielding stocks.
HD Dividend data by YCharts
Home Depot is a dependable stock that offers the chance for both share price gains and steady income. And with the stock down 35% this year, investors have a buying opportunity they won't want to miss.
eBay could be an excellent source of passive income.
Parkev Tatevosian (eBay): My favorite dividend stock to buy on this dip is eBay. It thrived earlier in the pandemic when hundreds of millions of people were looking to avoid shopping in person. But now, as economies are reopening and social distancing efforts have been relaxed, folks are shopping less online. That may be a temporary headwind, but it partly explains why the stock price has fallen by 46.5% from its peak.
That said, eBay has done an excellent job of growing its earnings over the longer run.
Over the past decade, it has grown its earnings per share at an impressive compound annual rate of 23.6%. For income investors, that's a critical point, because dividends are paid out of earnings. Without sufficient profits, no enterprise can sustain those payouts. But eBay's robust earnings growth history suggests that it should be able to continue supplying healthy dividend hikes.
The online marketplace operator only started paying a dividend in 2019, but has already increased the per-share payout twice from its inaugural $0.56 -- first to $0.64 in 2020, and then to $0.72 in 2021. It generated an operating profit margin of at least 20% in each of the last 10 years, so investors can reasonably expect eBay to further increase its payouts over time.
EBAY Price to Free Cash Flow data by YCharts
This year's sell-off has eBay selling at a relatively inexpensive valuation. Income investors can scoop up shares of eBay at a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 15.4, right about its average over the last five years.

2022-06-25 00:00:00+00:00,Here's 2 Reasons Why Adyen Is Rising to the Top in the Payments Industry,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-2-reasons-why-adyen-is-rising-to-the-top-in-the-payments-industry,,,"Netherland-based payments provider Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y) was a relatively unknown player until it got on some investors' radar after replacing PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) on eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) in 2018. But compared to PayPal, Adyen still fails to get name recognition from investors. However, that might soon be changing.
Here are two reasons Adyen is on the way to the top of the payments industry.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Adyen has a data advantage over competitors
Adyen started in 2006 with the idea of developing a modern payments platform. However, Adyen management realized early on that payments processing was already becoming commoditized. And to survive, the company needed to differentiate itself.
Management eventually decided to squeeze more value from the avalanche of transactional data that the company was collecting -- especially after gaining large customers like Uber (NYSE: UBER), Spotify (NYSE: SPOT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Soon after that decision, it began using insights from the analysis of its data stockpile to build new features and products that became extremely popular with merchants.
For example, among the first products to come out of Adyen's data-driven approach was RevenueAccelerate in 2016, which helped increase the payments approval rate for merchants on Adyen's platform. When Adyen introduced the product, few payments companies stressed increasing approval rates to boost merchant revenue. Instead, other payments companies tried to win over merchants by offering lower prices. Consequently, Adyen gained traction, as merchants with a large volume of transactions could gain much more revenue by raising approval rates than the merchants could save through lower costs from competitors.
Adyen continues to innovate beyond RevenueAccelerate. Last year, the company introduced a product called Score that uses artificial intelligence to identify malicious activity on a merchant's platform. The global online fundraising platform GoFundMe became one of the first users of Score.
2. Adyen disrupts the old value chain in the payments process
Historically, credit and debit card payments flow through a patchwork of many intermediaries, increasing the complexity and cost of money traveling across the payment network from shopper to merchant. However, today that old value chain is being threatened by Adyen.
Source: Adyen Capital Markets Day presentation September 2020.
Adyen might have started as a payments gateway and processor, but today it is much more. Adyen has put together the building blocks to become an end-to-end payments platform by replacing the functions of all intermediaries between the customer and the merchant, except for card networks like Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA).
What is the benefit of using Adyen over the legacy system of multiple intermediaries?
First, merchants benefit from Adyen's integrated platform, which is much more efficient and less costly than the solutions offered by traditional payments providers, which often use complex, inefficient technology.
Second, it is very challenging for merchants to integrate the international operations of different intermediaries. Adyen is possibly the only company that can offer a globally integrated payments infrastructure platform to merchants -- which becomes even more important as retailers seek more global sales.
Most of Adyen's competitors are ill-equipped to serve the needs of merchants in a global marketplace -- a possible reason Adyen is outperforming its peers.
Potential slowdown scenarios
While Adyen's second-half 2021 net revenue growth of 47% year over year with an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin of 64% sounds fantastic in this challenging market, investors worry about merchant sales growth slowing in 2022 due to the halt of stimulus checks in the U.S., the Russian-Ukrainian war, and a possible recession.
After investors saw that April's Mastercard SpendingPulse report confirmed fears of slowing e-commerce growth, many e-commerce and payment stocks dropped. And Adyen was not immune to those concerns, with its stock slumping 40% year to date. Additionally, even with the drop, Adyen still sells at a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.73. PEG ratios over 1.0 are considered a high valuation, especially in a bear market. Should a recession occur and merchants' sales growth shrink, Adyen's stock price could fall further.
However, in Adyen's last earnings report at the end of 2021, management said it has yet to see a sales slowdown on its platform. So while it is risky in the short term to invest in a high-growth company like Adyen before a potential worldwide recession, long-term investors should consider squirreling away a few shares of this dominant payments company, especially if shares fall further.

2022-06-24 00:00:00+00:00,3 Inflation-Proof Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-inflation-proof-growth-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-forever,,,"The inflation problem is real. According to the American Automobile Association (AAA), the average price for a gallon of gas is $4.96 compared to just $3.07 last year. And this 61% year-over-year increase has real ramifications on everyday wallets. For example, it costs more to drive to work. And it costs more for grocery stores to receive food shipments, causing end-consumer prices to go up. These inflation problems and others are costing average U.S. households more than $400 per month, according to Moody's Analytics senior economist Ryan Sweet.
If consumers spend $400 more a month on things that they need, then they'll necessarily make cuts elsewhere to keep their heads above water. In short, the longer inflation lasts, the greater the odds that it will hurt businesses. For this reason, it's important for investors to consider stocks that can still grow earnings in an inflationary environment. And Sanderson Farms (NASDAQ: SAFM), Tractor Supply (NASDAQ: TSCO), and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) are three such companies. Here's why.
1. Sanderson Farms: Food spend is essential
If you came to this article expecting a discussion of revenue growth, I'm sorry to disappoint you. Sanderson Farms is the third-largest poultry producer in the U.S. and is unlikely to grow its top line very much. In terms of pounds of chicken processed in past years, the top line only grew between 2% and 5% annually from 2018 through 2020. And the company didn't increase the amount of chicken it processed at all in 2021.
Sanderson Farms is an inflation-proof investment because it sells a must-have product: food. Consumers will continue to purchase necessities like chicken and maybe even with increased frequency in 2022. According to a June survey from Morning Consult, a head-turning 84% of consumers say they're eating at restaurants less often due to inflation.
In short, Sanderson Farms' products will likely stay in demand for a long, long time. And while it might not be the fastest revenue-growth story, don't overlook its earnings potential. The company is consistently profitable, as you would expect. And management in the past has rewarded shareholders with share repurchases. It hasn't bought many shares lately, but it's currently authorized to buy 2 million, or about 9% of shares outstanding.
Food stocks like Sanderson Farms may not be at the cutting edge of innovation. But our goal as investors is to beat the market. And, including dividends, Sanderson Farms stock has beat the S&P 500 average over the past three, five, and 10 years. And I expect it to continue to perform well with or without inflation.
2. Tractor Supply: A history of strong performance in uncertain times
As already noted, inflation is red-hot. To reign it in, Federal monetary policy has shifted, and interest rates are going up. This is designed to slow the economy, but it could lead to an economic recession, giving the U.S. an odd situation called stagflation -- inflation and recession at the same time. And if we're headed for a recession, then you might consider Tractor Supply because it proved its merit during the Great Recession.
It's not immediately obvious but, like Sanderson Farms, Tractor Supply sells many must-have products. Sales for livestock and pets account for 47% of overall company sales. And whether you're a hobby farmer, a single pet owner, or have a large number of animals, you're going to keep spending to keep them fed and healthy. If households cut budgets because of inflation, cuts will likely happen elsewhere than in supplies for livestock and pets.
I believe Tractor Supply can perform well during a recessionary period partly because it did perform well during the Great Recession, as the following chart shows.
Chart shows revenue and net income from January 2005 through December 2010. Recession shaded with gray. TSCO Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.
Tractor Supply grew revenue throughout the Great Recession because it was opening new stores, not because customers were spending more. However, average sales per location in 2009 were only 5% lower than in 2007, showing how resilient this business is during tough times.
Of these three companies, Tractor Supply is the most susceptible to inflation in the near term. The cost of its products and the cost of shipping are rising, and the company may not be able to pass these costs on to consumers fast enough. This would result in a temporary hit to its profits margins, similar to how profits fell in 2008 and 2009. It's certainly something to be aware of. But eventually, retailers like Tractor Supply work this out by raising prices, bringing margins back in line with historical levels.
That said, foreseeing a hit to profitability for Tractor Supply is still speculative on my part. For its part, management is predicting record net income this year of over $1 billion, which is not bad for a company with a market capitalization of just $21 billion.
3. eBay: Surprisingly resilient
This article is about inflation-proof stocks you can hold forever. It's relatively easy to make a ""forever"" pitch with more timeless ideas like Sanderson Farms and Tractor Supply. It's much harder to make this case for eBay. But it's the most inflation-proof stock on this list.
eBay doesn't sell physical products. Rather, it primarily provides a marketplace that connects sellers with bargain hunters. By simply being the middle-party, eBay's profits are stellar -- the company's gross margin was 75% in 2021 and 72% for the first quarter of 2022.
eBay is simply generating revenue with a take rate -- it's cut of sales. If sellers need to increase prices due to inflation, eBay's revenue will increase because it's taking a fixed percentage of the transaction. Moreover, as consumer budgets get squeezed, they'll be more inclined to bargain shop. And eBay's platform has a reputation for having good deals. Therefore, eBay's marketplace seems well poised for both the inflation and recession mix that potential stagflation could bring.
As I said about Tractor Supply, my hunch about how eBay's business would perform in stagflation is supported by how it performed during the Great Recession.
Chart shows revenue and net income from January 2005 through December 2010. Recession shaded with gray. EBAY Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
As a more mature company, eBay isn't a revenue-growth story; management expects a 3% to 6% year-over-year drop in full-year 2022 organic revenue when adjusting for currency fluctuations. However, it is an earnings-per-share (EPS) growth story. Consider that over the past five years, management has repurchased roughly half of its outstanding shares. And it has billions of dollars on the balance sheet and billions more in annual profits, providing ammunition for future repurchases that will boost EPS.
Often overlooked, eBay is still an e-commerce titan. Founded in 1995, it survived the dot-com crash. And today, it's still a top-15 global e-commerce marketplace by sales volume, showing it's surprisingly resilient for an overlooked company nearly 30 years old. Having endured so much to this point, it's reasonable to assume it can keep chugging along for the foreseeable future. So maybe it is a forever stock after all. And as long as the business continues to appeal to a large number of consumers, I expect the EPS growth to continue, leading to market-beating returns.
Don't sit on the sidelines
There are always problems in the economy. Investors can't sit on the sidelines hoping for the day when everything in the outlook looks sunny. That day never comes. Understanding things like inflation and stagflation are important. But there are still good stocks to buy even when things look bad. I believe Sanderson Farms, Tractor Supply, and eBay are good buys today, especially in light of the economic challenges we see. For the curious, there are plenty more ideas out there as well just waiting to be discovered.

2022-06-24 00:00:00+00:00,eBay Makes a Major Move Into NFTs -- Is the Stock a Buy?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-makes-a-major-move-into-nfts-is-the-stock-a-buy,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is taking its massive collectibles business into the digital realm. The e-commerce giant acquired non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace KnownOrigin to turbocharge its digital asset trading ambitions.
NFTs use blockchain technology to verify ownership and prevent duplication of assets such as artwork, music, videos, and literature. In turn, NFT owners can earn royalties and other rewards while also benefiting from their asset's uniqueness. That's made the assets very popular with collectors and investors.
Sales of NFTs soared 21,000% to over $17 billion in 2021, according to data provider Nonfungible.com. Some estimates of the size of the NFT industry are even higher. Market tracker DappRadar places last year's sales of NFTs at roughly $25 billion. Individual NFTs have sold for millions of dollars, with one selling for a stunning $69 million in a transaction facilitated by venerable auction house Christie's.
NFTs are particularly popular among sports fans. Sales on basketball-focused NFT marketplace NBA Top Shot surpassed $1 billion in May. Other professional sports leagues, including the National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB), have also launched NFT offerings for their fans.
KnownOrigin will bring its highly regarded technology to eBay's platform. There it will enable eBay's millions of buyers and sellers across the world to create and trade NFTs.
The deal should help to bolster eBay's collectible-focused initiatives. The company launched a vault service to protect its customers' physical assets, including high-value sports cards, in June. Many trading cards have surged in value during the pandemic, and demand for discovery, grading, storage, and trading services is climbing among collectors and speculators.
""eBay is the first stop for people across the globe who are searching for that perfect, hard-to-find, or unique addition to their collection and, with this acquisition, we will remain a leading site as our community is increasingly adding digital collectibles,"" CEO Jamie Iannone said in a press release. ""KnownOrigin has built up an impressive, passionate, and loyal group of artists and collectors, making them a perfect addition to our community of sellers and buyers.""
So is eBay's stock a buy?
The purchase of KnownOrigin doesn't by itself make eBay a good investment. It's true that NFT transactions could boost sales on eBay's platform. However, it should be noted that the NFT market's growth has slowed considerably in 2022.
Moreover, eBay has been losing buyers in recent quarters. Inflation is driving many consumers to pull back on their discretionary spending. And the collectibles market isn't as hot as it was during the early stages of the pandemic, when stimulus checks and time off from work gave people the means and opportunity to expand their collections.
Outside of the collectibles market, eBay has been surpassed by e-commerce platforms operated by the likes of Amazon.com, Walmart, and Shopify. That makes eBay a less attractive play on the long-term growth of the online retail market.
Thus, rather than buying its stock, investors may be better served by watching eBay's NFT plans unfold from afar.

2022-06-24 00:00:00+00:00,Should You Buy Tech Stocks Right Now?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-tech-stocks-right-now,,,"Tech stocks as a class are going through their most challenging times since the 2008-09 financial crisis. Stocks like Meta Platforms have lost more than half their value over the last 12 months. Moreover, the ARK Innovation ETF, which tracks growth tech stocks, has dropped by more than 65%.
Admittedly, companies such as IBM and Apple have fared better in this tech downturn. Nonetheless, the massive declines in many tech stocks warrant looking at both the bull and bear cases for them to see whether investing in this category still makes sense.
Why investors should consider tech stocks now
Despite painful losses over the last few months, history has shown that it pays for investors to keep their faith in the tech sector. This past-performance factor proves especially true with one of tech's more prominent names, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The company grew quickly following its initial public offering (IPO) in May 1997 and reached a split-adjusted high of $5.65 per share in December 1999.
However, amid the dot-com collapse in 2000 and 2001, investors dumped stocks, which took Amazon to a split-adjusted price of $0.28 per share by October 2001. It would not return to its 1999 high until October 2009, a wait of nearly 10 years!
Still, Amazon sells for around $110 per share as of the time of this writing. That indicates that buying high-quality stocks could bring outsize returns over time, returns that come in even higher when buying at lower prices.
This also brings to mind more recent highfliers such as Roku and Shopify, which have experienced considerable price declines. After the sell-off, Roku now trades at around four times sales. Also, Shopify has fallen below a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of nine, a six-year low. Such companies have not yet proved their ability to succeed. Still, like Amazon in past decades, these stocks could not only return to their previous highs but also possibly exceed them as conditions improve.
The dangers of tech investing
However, investors should also bear in mind that massive declines are no guarantee of a recovery. For every Amazon, the market has experienced several stocks like Pets.com, which began 2000 by sponsoring a Super Bowl commercial. But by November of that year, it was out of business and wiped out its stockholders.
Other stocks could survive but fail to reach their expected potential. One example is eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), which had once challenged Amazon for e-commerce supremacy. Over time, eBay floundered as sellers found other e-commerce sites easier and cheaper to use.
Nearly 24 years after its 1998 IPO, eBay has reached a market cap of only $24 billion. This is a small fraction of Amazon's $1.1 trillion market cap, and eBay's former subsidiary, PayPal Holdings, dwarfs it in size with an $85 billion market cap.
Another factor is valuation. Despite the drop in tech stocks, many still sell for pricey multiples. Data cloud company and Warren Buffett stock Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) is one example. It offers an obvious value proposition as a safe, accessible, and reliable data repository. Also, its year-over-year product revenue growth of 106% in 2021 bodes well for that potential.
However, it sells for 28 times sales despite losing two-thirds of its value. That is significantly cheaper than the 180 multiple at which it traded in December 2020, but the average P/S for the S&P 500 is about 2.4. Consequently, the company could easily have trouble justifying its current valuation in a climate where tech stocks struggle to gain traction.
Should you invest in tech stocks?
Given the history of tech stocks, investors should stay in the sector. Amid the volatility, history has proved the resiliency of these stocks.
A better question is: What type of tech investing should you pursue? Many investors are risk-averse. Assuming that these tech investors do not choose an index or ETF, they should probably lean toward an established giant like Apple or Amazon.
Nonetheless, investors with a higher degree of risk tolerance might want to consider the growth stocks. Such stocks require understanding a company's offerings, competitive advantages, and market leadership position, as well as how these variables could improve or decline.
Admittedly, many of these growth stocks will likely stagnate or even fail. Hence, investors should not pin all of their hopes on any one individual stock. But if they can find the stocks that will succeed, the due diligence could mean buying future tech giants at low prices.

Amid the ongoing volatility in the stock market, investors may be zooming out to look for stocks that can benefit from secular long-term headwinds. One of the segments that may be of interest would be e-commerce stocks. Despite weak market sentiments, e-commerce companies are not resting on their laurels on the operating front. In fact, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) recently announced its first “fully autonomous mobile robot” called Proteus. Its role is to move through facilities to lift up transports used by humans to move packages around. Moving forward, Amazon expects the robot to ease the burden in fulfillment centers and sort centers. 
Elsewhere, independent food and beverage businesses are now able to gain increased access to same-day or next-day delivery via Local Express through Walmart (NYSE: WMT) GoLocal. This new collaboration will allow Local Express to expand its delivery capabilities to service additional businesses in areas such as Chicago, Miami, and Arlington, Texas. As demand continues to rise for delivery, it is essential that retailers have access to these services. Now, this is another step in modernizing the e-commerce experience for the food and beverage industry. With that being said, it could be a reasonable assumption that e-commerce will continue to flourish. So, here are four of the top e-commerce stocks in the stock market today. 
E-commerce Stocks To Watch Before July 2022
Shopify Inc (NYSE: SHOP)
Chewy Inc (NYSE: CHWY)
eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY)
Global-E Online Ltd (NASDAQ: GLBE)
Shopify
Shopify provides a cloud-based, multi-channel commerce platform designed for small and medium-sized businesses. The company’s software is used by merchants to run their business across all of their sales channels. This includes Web and mobile storefronts, physical retail locations, social media storefronts, and marketplaces. With a single view of their business and customers, merchants can manage their products and inventory with great efficiency. SHOP stock has risen more than 10% over the past week. 
So, what has been the catalyst for this movement? Well, Shopify recently announced that it is partnering with Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) to make social media shopping more readily available. Shopify merchants will be able to link their Twitter accounts to their Shopify accounts and sync their product catalogs. Additionally, Shopify merchants can advertise specific products on the Twitter platform. Overall, this could potentially bring more revenue to Shopify in the long run. With that in mind, would you consider investing in SHOP stock?

Chewy
Another top e-commerce name gaining traction among investors lately would be Chewy. For the uninitiated, the company is a pure-play e-commerce company that caters to pet products. Chewy prides itself on delivering the best services as customer satisfaction remains its top priority. Some of its notable brands include A Pet Hub, A Pet’s Life, ABO Gear, Bark, KONG, and others. Impressively, CHWY stock has risen more than 30% over the past month. Keen investors will be on the lookout to see if the stock could keep up its momentum. 
Chewy started the month of June by announcing its first-quarter financials. Its net sales came in at $2.43 billion, up 13.7% year-over-year. Meanwhile, its quarterly earnings were $0.04 per share, exceeding the expectations of analysts. These encouraging results are a testament to the company’s resilience in the pet category. Moreover, an analyst from Wedbush, Seth Basham, also boosted his rating on the stock from Neutral to Outperform. He believes that Chewy’s ability to retain its customers and their spending is one of its strong suits. Coupled with the lower valuation of e-commerce stocks right now compared to a few months ago, could CHWY stock be an intriguing investment opportunity?

eBay
Following that, we have the global commerce company, eBay. Through its Marketplace, buyers and sellers connect in more than 190 markets around the globe. As online shopping continues to be a part of our lives, eBay is showing no signs of complacency. Last week, the company launched eBay Live, a dedicated shopping platform that gives people a new way to browse and buy collectible products. This will let shopping enthusiasts discover, chat, and purchase from anywhere in the world. Now, the first live shopping event just went live on Wednesday, offering a curated selection of rare trading cards from eBay seller Bleecker Trading. 
Not to mention, eBay announced on Wednesday that it has acquired KnownOrigin, an innovative non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace. The addition of KnownOrigin is an important step for eBay’s vision of being the world’s top destination for collectibles. Also, this will allow artists and collectors to create, buy, and resell NFTs. Thus, this could play a role in supporting eBay’s long-term growth. This is not eBay’s first foray into the NFT space. In late May, the company launched a series of exclusive NFTs through a strategic partnership with OneOf, a premier NFT platform. This would contribute to making NFTs more accessible to collectors. Given these exciting developments, should EBAY stock have a place on your watchlist today?

2022-06-23 00:00:00+00:00,eBay (EBAY) to Attract NFT Enthusiasts With KnownOrigin Buyout,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-ebay-to-attract-nft-enthusiasts-with-knownorigin-buyout,,,"eBay EBAY has taken over Manchester, UK-based KnownOrigin, a marketplace for non-fungible token (NFT).
KnownOrigin is equipped with advanced technology, enabling creators to make authentic digital collectibles in the form of NFTs. Its technology helped it attract a significant number of artists and collectors to its platform.
We believe the growing marketplace and robust technology of KnownOrigin are likely to aid eBay in gaining traction among the collectible enthusiasts further.
Moreover, eBay’s portfolio of collectible offerings has expanded with the latest buyout, which will help EBAY gain momentum among the millennials and the Gen Z artists and collectors.

Recent Initiatives Into Collectibles
The latest buyout of KnownOrigin bodes well for EBAY’s growing efforts in the collectibles space.
In addition to the recent acquisition, this month, eBay introduced the shopping platform eBay Live to allow people to browse and buy products in a live mode.
EBAY also unveiled the eBay vault, a digital marketplace for single and top-graded trading cards. With the eBay vault, collectible enthusiasts can seamlessly and securely manage and trade their portfolio of collections.
Last month, EBAY collaborated with OneOf, a green NFT company, to release a series of exclusive NFTs, thereby boosting its presence in the collectible domain.
Strategic Moves a Key Lever
The above-mentioned initiatives are helping eBay penetrate the NFT market, which is significantly growing in recent times owing to increasing demand for digital artworks and the growing usage of blockchain technology.
Per a Technavio report, the NFT market is expected to reach $147.24 billion by 2026, witnessing a CAGR of 35.3% between 2021 and 2026.
Moreover, these endeavours make EBAY well-poised to capitalize on the growth prospects present in the booming collectibles market which is witnessing rising online sale of antiques and collectibles.
According to a Market Decipher report, the global collectibles market is likely to touch $628 billion by 2031, seeing a CAGR of 6.2% during the 2021-2031 forecast period.
However, eBay faces stiff competition from its peer Amazon AMZN, which is also making strong efforts to capitalize on the prospects in the collectible market.
Shares of EBAY have lost 35.1% in the year-to-date period, lagging the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s decline of 27.7%.
AMZN’s shares have been down 34.6% in the year-to-date period.
Amazon allows users to shop on its platform to purchase collectibles and artworks from a wide variety of prints and posters, figurines, clothing and uniforms, photographs and more.
Collectors can also access the Amazon platform to buy trading cards and memorabilia, including autographed photos, jerseys, balls, helmets, etc.
Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider
Currently, eBay carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).
Investors interested in the retail-wholesale sector can consider companies like Arcos Dorados ARCO and AutoNation AN. While Arcos Dorados has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), AutoNation sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Arcos Dorados has gained 19% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for the ARCOstock is currently projected at 34.4%.

2022-06-23 00:00:00+00:00,EBAY August 5th Options Begin Trading,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-august-5th-options-begin-trading,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options become available today, for the August 5th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new August 5th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $42.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.89. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $42.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $40.11 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $42.53/share today.
Because the $42.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.50% return on the cash commitment, or 38.20% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $42.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $43.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.13. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $42.53/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $43.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.11% if the stock gets called away at the August 5th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $43.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $43.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.01% boost of extra return to the investor, or 42.51% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $42.53) to be 36%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

It has been a deplorable start to the year for the stock market. Leading indices such as the S&P 500 are down by more than 20%. The stock selloff intensified with the expected bump in interest rates during last week’s Federal Reserve meeting. Savvy investors will look beyond the carnage find undervalued stocks they could pick for the long haul.
With the current market downturn, many investors are looking too closely at the broader stock market. Such a strategy is unwise, considering how good quality companies are likely to grow regardless of the current market conditions. For example, plenty of Nasdaq stocks are trading at multi-year lows and would make for incredible long-term bets at this time. As such, investors should stop fixating on the broader market and look for high-quality companies trading at huge bargains.

Sirius XM (SIRI)
Radio giant Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) has been a consistent performer in its niche. Its 5-year average revenue and EBITDA growth of 12.30% and 8.60%, respectively, help demonstrate this success. However, it faces some near-term headwinds, with the auto industry struggling from a parts crisis. Nevertheless, its long-term positioning remains attractive.
A couple of growth catalysts are driving the company’s bull case. The first is its music streaming service in Pandora, which averaged over 50 million users during the first quarter. Since its acquisition in 2019, it has been on a downward spiral, but its expansion into podcasting might be a big deal down the line. Top comedian Conan O’Brien’s podcasting company was acquired by SiriusXM recently, which could be the start of something big.
Moreover, there’s also SiriusXM’s 360L service that effectively combines satellite and streaming. Roughly 4 million cars have the service enabled, and new cars will be enabling the modules at a brisk pace in the future. Hence, there’s plenty to be excited about with SIRI stock for the future.
Lucid Group (LCID)
Up-and-coming luxury electric vehicle maker Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) came out with a highly encouraging first-quarter report. It reported a healthy increase in reservations and re-iterated its target to produce 12,000 to 14,000 cars this year.
Furthermore, we saw Lucid generating $57.7 million in sales from just 360 vehicle deliveries, comfortably surpassing analyst expectations. Moreover, its net loss narrowed by 97.2% to $81.3 million. Hence, its net loss of 5 cents per share exceeded analyst estimates by almost 30 cents.

The total reservation count climbed to a whopping 30,000 compared to 13,000 last September. The massive increase shows that Lucid’s EVs are gaining plenty of traction in its target market. These reservations could potentially generate almost $3 billion in sales.
CSX Corporation (CSX)
CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) is one of the largest railroad operators in America. It operates in virtually every economic area in the East. Over the years, it has proven to be an inflation-resistant business, rewarding its shareholders with vigorous dividend payouts and buybacks due to its robust cash flow generation.
Its first-quarter results show resilience in the face of rising fuel costs and supply chain hiccups. Revenues rose 21%, with fuel surcharges and fuel price gains compensating for higher costs. Moreover, the company also acquired regional operator Pan Am Railways to expand its footprint in New England.
Additionally, trucking revenue became part of CSX’s results for the first time after the acquisition of trucking company Quality Carriers. Trucking sales account for just 7% of CSX’s total revenues, but could grow over time. CSX stock trades at under 4.5 times sales, which is significantly lower than its five-year average, adding to its attractiveness.
Comcast (CMCSA)
Comcast’s (NASDAQ:CMCSA) highly diversified revenue stream has helped mitigate the macro-economic risks at this time. It recently reported its first-quarter results, where sales shot up by 14%, while group EBITDA came in over 8.8% from the prior year. Despite the skepticism surrounding the cable business, it yet again delivered during the quarter with 194,000 new net additions.
Moreover, NBCUniversal also saw a considerable bump in sales due to the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics. Additionally, movie studio ticket sales were up, and theme park attendance made a big comeback.
7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks for All the Income Lovers
Overall its results were solid across all business segments, and its profitability is rising despite the competition. Its dividend profile is also in the spotlight, with a robust 2.7% yield and close to five years of growth in payouts.
eBay (EBAY)
EBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is a leading online marketplace giant coming off a tremendous 2021. However, it’s going through a major hangover, which has led to a slowdown in organic sales growth. Due to multiple factors, the business will likely suffer in the interim; however, its long-term outlook looks incredibly bright.
A lot has to do with the platform’s penchant to innovate and move into high-value niches, such as collectibles, sneakers and trading cards. Moreover, it also aims to generate strong sales from advertising and payment processing.
Its asset-light business enables it to generate truckloads of cash from its relatively small revenue base. It sees revenue growth returning in 2023, while it pushes the afterburners in 2024. Margins are likely to expand over time, in line with the increase in sales.
Cisco Systems (CSCO)
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)  has been a leading tech utility that operates a boring yet beautiful cash-rich business with an impeccable dividend profile. Its switching solution and routers have become ubiquitous over time, helping the business generate truck-loads of cash over time. It has expanded into other profitable verticals, including network security, application experiences, the internet for the future and related areas.
Moreover, it plans to shift to a subscription-based business model that has entwined the company with its growing customer base. Subscription sales account for 44% of total revenues and are now the fastest-growing part of the business. Looking ahead, Cisco predicts its annual sales to grow at an annual growth rate of 5% to 7% from fiscal 2021 and 2025, including a similar effect on its adjusted earnings-per-share.

In other words, its higher-margin subscription service will play a huge role in enabling Cisco to achieve its future objectives.
Marvell Technology (MRVL)
Chip-maker Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is flying high after posting stellar first-quarter results. Its revenues jumped 74% year-over-year to a record $1.45 billion, primarily due to stronger-than-expected performance from data centers.

It also reported a strong increase in its bottom line, where non-GAAP earnings came in at 52 cents compared to 29 cents in the prior-year period.

2022-06-21 00:00:00+00:00,eBay (EBAY) to Wind Up GittiGidiyor Business Operations,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-ebay-to-wind-up-gittigidiyor-business-operations,,,"eBay EBAY is set to close its Turkey-based online marketplace business GittiGidiyor, which it acquired in 2011.
EBAY announced that the marketplace platform will remain open for shopping until Jul 18 but new product listings have been restricted since Monday. Further, buyers and sellers will be able to access their My Account page until Sep 5.
eBay’s number of active buyers in GittiGidiyor business stood at 4 million at the end of first-quarter 2022.
The primary reason behind the latest move is the intensifying competitive scenario in Turkey that has been hurting the prospects of eBay, which has been struggling so far in 2022 due to the weakening momentum in online shopping.
Shares of eBay have been down 36.4% in the year-to-date period, lagging the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s decline of 29.2%.
More Into the Move
EBAY expects a minimal material impact of the underlined divestiture on its current-quarter as well as full-year results.
eBay Inc. Price and Consensus
eBay Inc. price-consensus-chart | eBay Inc. Quote
Moreover, the inflow of resources from this divestiture is likely to help eBay strengthen its well-performing businesses and boost its prospects in the growing markets, thus aiding its business diversification strategies.
Further, the recent move will likely help EBAY deepen its focus on its business operations in other countries. Currently, eBay is active in 22 countries and 190 markets around the world.
However, we believe, the loss of a strong buyer base of GittiGidiyor business is expected to get reflected in the overall revenues of eBay wherein performance is hampered by a softness in transactional activities.
eBay generated net revenues of $2.48 billion, declining 6% from the year-ago quarter’s level.
Competitive Turkish E-commerce Market
eBay faces a huge competitive pressure from the e-commerce giant Amazon AMZN, which is consistently making strong efforts to expand its presence in the country. 
In March 2022, Amazon announced plans to open its first fulfilment center in Istanbul, Turkey, in the autumn of this year. AMZN is investing more than $100 million in the new site to cater to growing customer demand in Turkey.
Meta Platforms’ META social media platform Facebook runs Facebook Marketplace in the country.
META’s Facebook Marketplace allows users to buy and sell items within their local communities. Moreover, Facebook is opening store fronts within its app, making it easier for consumers to purchase directly within the app rather than through a separate shopping app. This enables Meta Platforms to expand its reach among customers.
Zacks Rank & Stock to Consider
Currently, eBay carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
Investors interested in the retail-wholesale sector can consider Arcos Dorados ARCO carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Arcos Dorados has gained 20.1% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for the ARCOstock is currently projected at 34.4%.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

For investors searching for the best stocks to buy today, e-commerce stocks could be worth considering. Sure, consumer prices may be gaining at faster-than-expected paces now. However, there remains some credibility to the e-commerce stocks bull theory in the stock market now. After all, e-commerce plays an important role in bringing goods to businesses and consumers globally over the web. All of which played an important role during the era of the pandemic. Even as the world looks to return to normalcy, most would already be accustomed to the conveniences of the e-commerce industry regardless. Because of this, investors may not want to discount the top e-commerce stocks around just yet.
At the same time, there is no shortage of exciting developments coming from the field now. Take the latest operational update from eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) for example. On Thursday, the company launched its eBay Live service. According to eBay, this is a dedicated live shopping platform. This would bring a notable level of interactivity to the shopping experience for eBay. While it is mainly rolling out via a beta version this month, it would suggest that even the e-commerce scene is evolving.
Not to mention, e-commerce titan Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) would also be worth considering. This would be the case as its annual Prime Day sales will be kicking off on July 12. In short, this event is a big revenue driver for Amazon, as it often offers competing discounts to consumers. Last year, the total e-commerce sales during the two-day event topped $11 billion. After reading this far, you might be keen on e-commerce stocks yourself. In that case, here are three more to know in the stock market today.
E-Commerce Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] This Month
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA)
Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT)
JD.com Inc. (NASDAQ: JD)
Alibaba 
First up today we have the global tech company Alibaba. Alibaba is a retailer and wholesaler that offers online and mobile marketplaces. All in all, Core Commerce, Cloud Computing, and Digital Media & Entertainment are some of the company’s primary business segments. The Core Commerce segment consists of platforms operating in retail and wholesale. Meanwhile, the Cloud Computing segment consists of Alibaba Cloud, which offers a complete suite of cloud services.
Worth mentioning, BABA stock is in the spotlight on Friday following reports about its financial arm, Ant Group. In particular, China’s central bank has reportedly accepted Ant Group’s application to set up a financial holding company. This can be seen as a key step in revamping Jack Ma’s fintech business following the abrupt end of its $37 billion IPO back in 2020. Furthermore, the acceptance of Ant’s application shows that Chinese regulators might be easing the crackdown on China’s largest tech enterprises.
Last month, Alibaba released its March quarter financials report. Starting off, revenue for the quarter was $32.18 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year. Additionally, the annual active consumers reached about 1.31 billion, an increase of 28.3 million since the last quarter. For a sense of scale, 1 billion of its consumers are based in China. Not to mention, its income from operations was $2.63 billion, better than its loss of operations from the same quarter of 2021. Given all this, would BABA stock be a buy now?

2022-06-17 00:00:00+00:00,Bidding tops $12.3 mln for Warren Buffett charity lunch,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bidding-tops-%2412.3-mln-for-warren-buffett-charity-lunch-0,,,"By Jonathan Stempel
June 17 (Reuters) - Someone has bid more than $12.3 million at an online auction to win a final, private lunch with billionaire businessman Warren Buffett to benefit a charity that helps the poor, homeless and people battling substance abuse.
The $12,345,678 bid from an unknown bidder in the auction, which ends on Friday night, far surpasses the previous record $4.57 million that cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun paid in a similar 2019 auction.
Proceeds benefit Glide, a nonprofit in San Francisco's Tenderloin district that offers meals, shelter, HIV and hepatitis C tests, job training and children's programs.
Prior to this year, Buffett, the 91-year-old chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N, had helped Glide raise more than $34.1 million by auctioning 20 lunches. He has also pledged to give away nearly all his wealth.
The auctions began in 2000. None were held in 2020 and 2021 because of the pandemic. Bidding this year on eBay ends at 10:30 p.m. EDT Friday (0230 GMT Saturday).
This year's winner can take up to seven guests to dine with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in Manhattan.
Buffett will talk about almost anything, though not where he may invest next.
He became a supporter of Glide after his first wife Susan introduced him to the charity, where she had been volunteering. Susan Buffett died in 2004.
Hedge fund managers David Einhorn and Ted Weschler are among the winners of prior auctions. Weschler became a Berkshire portfolio manager after paying a combined $5.25 million to win the 2010 and 2011 auctions.
Berkshire owns dozens of companies including the BNSF railroad; Geico car insurance; many energy, manufacturing and retail businesses, and stocks such as Apple Inc AAPL.O and Bank of America Corp BAC.N.
Buffett still owns nearly 16% of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, despite having donated more than half of his shares since 2006, including $4 billion this week.
He was worth $92.8 billion on Friday afternoon, making him the eighth-richest person worldwide according to Forbes magazine.

More Collectible Initiatives
The release of eBay Live bodes well with eBay’s consistent efforts in the collectible space. eBay is consistently looking for initiatives to gain momentum among the millennials and the Gen Z.
Apart from the recent move, this month, EBAY introduced the eBay vault, a digital marketplace for single and top-graded trading cards. With the eBay vault, collectible enthusiasts can seamlessly and securely manage and trade their portfolio of collections.
In May, EBAY collaborated with OneOf, a green non-fungible tokens (NFT) company to release a series of exclusive NFTs and, thereby, boost its presence in the collectible domain.
The introduction of advanced capabilities like Price Guide and Collection tools for trading cards remains noteworthy. With the new features, enthusiasts can view, manage and track the value of their trading card portfolios in a single place.
