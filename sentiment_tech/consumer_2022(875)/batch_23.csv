2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00,Is Meta Platforms Stock Attractive At The Current Levels?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-meta-platforms-stock-attractive-at-the-current-levels,,,"Meta Platforms’ stock (NASDAQ: META) has lost 71% YTD as compared to the 20% drop in S&P500. Further, the stock is currently trading around $96 per share, which is 44% below its fair value of $174 – Trefis’ estimate for Meta Platforms’ valuation.  The social media giant posted lower-than-expected earnings in the third quarter of 2022. It reported a decrease of 4% y-o-y in net revenues to $27.7 billion – two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Moreover, the company is expecting to see negative year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter, too. Notably, it issued revenue guidance of $30-$32.5 billion for Q4. This has made investors nervous about the stock. 
Although high-growth technology stocks have suffered this year., META stock is also struggling with additional issues. One of the reasons for investor concern is the very high spending on reality labs (Metaverse). The company has spent more than $9 billion YTD and the trend is likely to continue over the subsequent quarters. Further, a drop in advertising revenues over the last six months has made the matters worse. On the flip side, the firm has a strong user base. Its family daily active people (DAP) was 2.93 billion in Q3 (up 4% y-o-y), followed by a Facebook daily active user base of 1.98 billion (up 3%). 
The drop in advertising revenues was primarily due to macroeconomic conditions. It is expected to improve with the recovery in the economy. Further, the firm is investing in reality labs from a long-term perspective and the segment is unlikely to turn profitable in a year or two. Overall, we estimate Meta Platforms’ revenues to be around $116.4 billion in FY2022. Additionally, the adjusted net income is likely to reduce to $23.9 billion in the year (down 39%). This coupled with an annual EPS of $9.20 and a P/E multiple of just below 19x will lead to a valuation of $174.
What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Our high-quality portfolio and multi-strategy portfolio have beaten the market consistently since the end of 2016.

2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00,Breaking Down Target (TGT) Stock Before Q3 Earnings,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/breaking-down-target-tgt-stock-before-q3-earnings,,,"With Target TGT trading 39% off its high, investors are eagerly looking toward its Q3 earnings report on November 16.
The better than expected consumer price Index (CPI) numbers for October should boost optimism surrounding the retail giant’s report. TGT’s third quarter report will also give further insight into consumer spending amid an economic downturn.
The Basics
Target stock has been hit harder than competitor Walmart WMT, which is also set to report next week. Target struggled during the second quarter due to excess inventory amid slower consumer spending and rising inflation. Profits in Q2 fell by more than 90% as the company was forced to sell the excess inventory at steep discounts.
Like Walmart, Target has evolved into more than just a brick & mortar retailer. Target has strived for technological advancements across its website and mobile apps to compete with e-commerce companies such as Amazon AMZN and eBay EBAY.
The company also sells merchandise through periodic exclusive design, creative partnerships, and shop-in-shop experiences, with partners such as Apple AAPL, Disney DIS, Levi's LEVI, and Ulta Beauty ULTA. Target also generates revenue from in-store amenities such as Target Café, Starbucks SBUX, and Target Optical, becoming a one-stop shop for consumers.
Investors hope that the decline in TGT stock over the last year will turn out to be a long-term buying opportunity. This makes the company’s Q3 report and outlook critical for the stock as Target has now missed earnings expectations for two consecutive quarters.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Q3 Outlook 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TGT’s Q3 earnings is $2.14 per share, which would be a decline of -29% from the year prior quarter. Sales for Q3 are expected to be up 3% at $26.36 billion. This is an indication that operating costs are weighing on Target’s profits although the company says inventory issues are behind it.
Earnings estimates for the period are down from $2.42 at the beginning of the quarter. Year over year, TGT earnings are expected to decline -40% to $8.09 per share. However, fiscal 2024 earnings are projected to stabilize and rise 49% to $12.11 per share.
Top line growth is expected, with sales set to rise 3% in fiscal 2023 and another 3% in FY24 to $113.78 billion. This is after the company has already experienced huge top line growth over the last five years.
Performance & Valuation
Year to date, TGT is down -29% to underperform the S&P 500’s -22%. Despite the recent fall, TGT stock is up +208% over the last five years when including its solid dividend to blast the performance of the benchmark and beat its peer group’s +93%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Target’s performance over the last five years and its current valuation are reasons to believe its drop could indeed be an opportunity for longer-term investors. Trading around $164 per share, TGT has a P/E of 18.9X. This is below the industry average of 22.5X. Even better, TGT trades nicely below its decade-high of 26.8X and closer to the median of 15.9X.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Bottom Line
TGT currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its Retail-Discount Stores Industry is in the top 23% of over 250 Zacks Industries. Trading attractively relative to its past, patient investors may be rewarded for holding Target stock, especially with the approaching holiday season. TGT also offers a generous 2.82% annual dividend yield at $4.32 a share, and the Average Zacks Price Target suggests 26% upside from current levels.
 
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-11-09 00:00:00+00:00,"Etsy Stock Gained 6% In One Week, Where Is It Headed?",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/etsy-stock-gained-6-in-one-week-where-is-it-headed,,,"Etsy stock (NASDAQ: ETSY) has gained 5.6% in the last week, outperforming the S&P 500 (down 1.7%). However, the trend was quite the opposite over the last ten days (-2.8% vs 0.2%) and one month (-10% vs 4.7%).
The company offers an online marketplace for unique and creative goods. It published the third-quarter results last week, which surpassed the consensus estimates. The top line improved 12% y-o-y to $594.5 million, driven by a 12% growth in the marketplace division and a 10% increase in services revenues. While the marketplace segment benefited from higher seller transaction fees, the services revenues were primarily up due to higher on-site advertising income. Further, the firm provided revenue guidance of $700-$780 million for Q4, in-line with the street expectations. Overall, the earnings beat and strong revenue outlook were the main reason behind the stock movement.

2022-11-03 00:00:00+00:00,"eBay (EBAY) Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Dip Y/Y",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-ebay-q3-earnings-beat-estimates-revenues-dip-y-y,,,"eBay Inc. EBAY reported third-quarter 2022 non-GAAP earnings of $1.00 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.5%. The bottom line increased 11% year over year.

Net revenues of $2.38 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.31 billion. However, the figure decreased 5% from the year-ago quarter’s figure on a reported basis and 2% on an FX-neutral basis.

This was attributed to the softness in transactional activities on eBay’s platform and sluggish marketing services. EBAY witnessed a year-over-year decline of 11% in the active buyer base, which stood at 135 million at the end of the third quarter.

eBay witnessed a declining gross merchandise volume (GMV) in the third quarter, which remained an overhang.

Nevertheless, strengthening momentum across advertising offerings of EBAY was a tailwind.

eBay’s Promoted Listings generated revenues of $249 million, up 19% on a reported and 27% on an FX-neutral basis from the prior-year quarter’s respective levels. This drove the momentum across EBAY’s first-party advertising products.

Moreover, total advertising offerings yielded $290 million revenues, which grew 14.6% on a year-over-year basis.

The total GMV is categorized into two parts.

Nov 2 (Reuters) - Ecommerce company eBay Inc EBAY.O on Wednesday beat Wall Street targets for third-quarter revenue as consumers snapped up luxury souvenirs and quirky gifts on its platform.
Shares of the company were up 7% in extended trading, following an about 40% slump so far this year.
Ebay has expanded the categories on its platform to offer pre-owned sneakers and jewelry, as it looks to tap rising demand for high-value collectibles such as electronics.
However, the company's forecast for holiday-quarter revenue came in below estimates.
Industry bellwether Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O had also forecast a dour holiday season as this year's surge in prices of food, gas and other essentials forced cash-strapped consumers to put casual shopping on the back burner.
Ebay forecast fourth-quarter revenue between $2.42 billion and $2.50 billion, with the midpoint coming in below analysts' estimates of $2.49 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
The company projected adjusted profit between $1.03 and $1.09 per share for the key holiday quarter, compared with expectations of $1.06 per share.
For the third quarter, the company said revenue fell 5% to $2.4 billion, surpassing estimates of $2.32 billion.

2022-11-02 00:00:00+00:00,Breaking Down PayPal (PYPL) Stock Before Q3 Earnings,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/breaking-down-paypal-pypl-stock-before-q3-earnings,,,"With PayPal PYPL still trading 65% off its highs, it is another tech stock investors will be closely eying when it reports Q3 earnings on Thursday, November 3. Despite being one of the largest online payment solution providers, the stock has been far from immune to challenges in the economy.
PayPal’s stock began to falter before increased operating headwinds and rising inflation. During Q1 last year, Wall Street began to question if the company could sustain its impressive growth. Increasing competition from Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Wallet among other alternative payment solution sources started to wear on investor sentiment surrounding the premium paid for PYPL stock. Block SQ and many of the big banks have also become respectable competitors.

Overview
PayPal, previously Confinity, was founded in 1998 and went public in 2002. The company was bought by eBay EBAY shortly after. PayPal is a pioneer in innovating the way consumers can pay for online products. Before PayPal’s services, many payments on retail sites like eBay were being paid by checks and money orders, causing delays for products to be delivered while waiting for checks to be cleared.
In 2014, Wall Street juggernaut and large shareholder Carl Icahn demanded the company split from eBay. This resulted in the company again operating as a single, publicly-traded company the following year. PYPL’s growth continued to accelerate after acquiring Xoom in 2015 which expanded its business internationally.
Recently, PYPL’s growth has started to slow making management of the current economic downturn a pivotal moment for the company. Last quarter, revenue grew 9% to $6.8 billion. PYPL beat earnings expectations by 9% at $0.93 per share. This caused the stock to spike 13% the following day. However, earnings were still down 19% from $1.15 in Q2 2021. Wall Street will be monitoring if the company was able to close the gap during Q3. 
Q3 Outlook
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PYPL’s Q3 earnings is $0.95 per share, which would represent a -14% decline from Q3 2021. Sales for Q3 are expected to be up 10% at $6.82 billion. This is an indication that outside of slowing growth, operating costs are weighing on the stock as well.
Earnings estimates for the period have remained unchanged throughout the quarter. Year over year, PYPL earnings are expected to decline -14% but rebound and climb 20% in FY23 at $4.75 per share. Top line growth is expected, with sales projected to be up 10% this year and rise another 12% in FY23 to $31.27 billion.
Performance & Valuation
Year to date, PYPL is down -58% to underperform the S&P 500’s -20% and the Nasdaq’s -33%. PYPL is still up +114% over the last 8 years since operating independently again but still underperformed the benchmark and the Nasdaq.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Investors are hoping the company can regain its impressive growth. After reaching 52-week highs of $231.92 last November, PYPL now trades around $79 per share. At current levels, PYPL has a P/E of 28.7X. This is near its peer group’s 29.8X. Even better, PYPL trades nicely below its 8-year high of 87.8X and the median of 44.5X since becoming independent.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Bottom Line
PayPal stock could use another strong earnings beat, and stronger than expected guidance could help sustain a rally. Wall Street will want to see if the company can offer any early outlook into FY23 and perhaps confirm what is expected to be a return to growth.
PYPL currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its Internet-Software Industry is in the top 37% of over 250 Zacks Industries. PYPL trades more attractively than it has in the past and long-term investors could be rewarded again for holding the stock. The Average Zacks Price Target suggests 57% upside from current levels.

2022-11-01 00:00:00+00:00,eBay Stock To Beat The Consensus In Q3?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-stock-to-beat-the-consensus-in-q3,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q3 2022 results on Wednesday, November 2, 2022. We expect the stock to edge past the consensus estimates. The company surpassed the street expectations in the last quarter, despite a 9% y-o-y drop in the net revenues. The top line suffered due to lower net transaction revenues driven by a decline in website traffic on a year-on-year basis. Further, the key metric – Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) decreased by 18%. We expect the same trend to continue in Q3.
Our forecast indicates that eBay’s valuation is $54 per share, which is 35% above the current market price of around $40. Our interactive dashboard analysis on eBay’s Earnings Preview has more details. 
(1) Revenues expected to edge past the consensus estimates
eBay’s revenues decreased 8% y-o-y to $4.91 billion in the first half of 2022. The primary source of the company’s income is net transaction revenue, which includes final value fees, feature fees, fees to promote listings, and listing fees from sellers on the platforms. The revenue stream suffered a 6% y-o-y drop in the first half due to lower website traffic. We expect the same trend to drive the third-quarter results. Further, eBay’s revenues are forecast to touch $9.7 billion for FY2022.
Trefis estimates eBay’s fiscal Q3 2022 net revenues to be around $2.36 billion, 2% above the $2.32 billion consensus estimate. 
(2) EPS is likely to beat the consensus estimates
eBay Q3 2022 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) is expected to be $0.95 per Trefis analysis, marginally beating the consensus estimate of $0.93. The company’s adjusted net income decreased from $11.4 billion to -$1.9 billion in the first half of 2022. It was mainly due to a higher loss on equity investments and warrants in 2022 and a one-time gain of $10.5 billion from discontinued operations in 2021. We expect the net income margin to improve in the third quarter. 
(3) Stock price estimate is 35% above the current market price
We arrive at eBay’s valuation, using a revenue per share (RPS) estimate of around $15.99 and a P/S multiple of just above 3x in fiscal 2022. This translates into $54, which is 35% higher than the current market price of close to $40.

EBAY anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share between 89 cents and 95 cents. The consensus mark for earnings stands at 94 cents per share, which has been unchanged over the past 30 days. The consensus mark improved 4.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.
EBAY beat on earnings in all of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 4.8%.

Factors to Consider
eBay’s third-quarter results are likely to reflect strong performance of the advertising business owing to the growing adoption of new products and increased optimization.
Strength in Promoted Listings is expected to have helped eBay gain momentum among sellers. Also, solid promoted listings momentum might have continued driving eBay’s advertising revenues.
EBAY is gaining traction among small business owners who are leveraging the Marketplace to expand their customer reach. The increasing number of small businesses is expected to have attracted more shoppers to the EBAY platform.
Continuous efforts to strengthen the Authenticity Guarantee service for acquiring loyalty of customers are expected to have driven top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.
eBay is consistently adding sellers and expanding categories to its Refurbished program to enhance customer satisfaction. This might have remained another positive.
EBAY is expected to have gained momentum among collectible enthusiasts on the back of its robust tools. This is likely to have benefited its trading card business in the quarter to be reported.
During the third quarter, eBay completed the takeover of the myFitment group of companies to strengthen its parts and accessories category. The acquisition’s impact is likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.
However, the softness in transactional activities on eBay’s platform is expected to have been a headwind during the quarter to be reported.
Rising competitive pressure from e-commerce giants like Amazon is likely to have continued posing a challenge to eBay’s market position.
Uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic, impacts of the Russian-Ukraine war, supply-chain constraints and inflationary pressures are likely to get reflected in the impending quarterly results.

2022-10-27 00:00:00+00:00,EBAY December 9th Options Begin Trading,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-december-9th-options-begin-trading,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options begin trading today, for the December 9th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new December 9th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $39.00 strike price has a current bid of 71 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $39.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $38.29 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $40.38/share today.
Because the $39.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.82% return on the cash commitment, or 15.44% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $39.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $41.00 strike price has a current bid of 68 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $40.38/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $41.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.22% if the stock gets called away at the December 9th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $41.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $41.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.68% boost of extra return to the investor, or 14.28% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $40.38) to be 36%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-10-27 00:00:00+00:00,Earnings Preview: Carvana (CVNA) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-carvana-cvna-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline,,,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Carvana (CVNA) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings call it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $2 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -426.3%.
Revenues are expected to be $3.74 billion, up 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 11.66% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Carvana?
For Carvana, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.92%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.
So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Carvana will beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?
While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Carvana would post a loss of $1.81 per share when it actually produced a loss of $2.35, delivering a surprise of -29.83%.
The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
Carvana doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.
Expected Results of an Industry Player
Among the stocks in the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, eBay (EBAY) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.94 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +4.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.32 billion, down 7.1% from the year-ago quarter.
Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for eBay has been revised 0.3% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -2.96%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.
When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that eBay will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.

2022-10-17 00:00:00+00:00,Better Fintech Stock: PayPal or Upstart,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-fintech-stock%3A-paypal-or-upstart,,,"PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Upstart (NASDAQ: UPST) represent two very different ways to invest in the fintech market. PayPal processes digital payments for businesses and individuals, while Upstart helps lenders approve loans with non-traditional data like a customer's educational history, area of study, GPA, standardized test scores, and work history.
Both stocks attracted a lot of bulls during the pandemic-induced rally in growth stocks last year but fizzled out as rising interest rates and other macro headwinds crushed the market. PayPal's stock hit an all-time high of $308.53 last July, but now trades at about $80. Upstart closed at an all-time high of $390 last October, but it trades at $23 today. Could either of these beaten-down fintech plays bounce back? Let's take a fresh look at their businesses to find out.

How PayPal lost its way
PayPal's problems started in 2018, when eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), its former parent company and major retail partner, started shifting its orders to the smaller Dutch backend software provider Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y) in a three-year transition.
PayPal's revenue rose 19% in 2019 but accelerated to 21% growth in 2020 as the pandemic boosted online sales and temporarily offset its gradual loss of eBay's business. Encouraged by that acceleration, PayPal proclaimed it could nearly double from its active accounts from 377 million in 2020 to 750 million in 2025 during its investor day last February.
However, PayPal's revenue rose only 18% in 2021, and it expects just 10% growth this year. That slowdown prompted it to abandon its target of reaching 750 million active accounts this February. Instead, it admitted that its loss of eBay to Adyen had clipped its top line growth, and it was struggling to fill that void with new customers in a post-pandemic world.
PayPal's adjusted operating margin declined in 2021 and the first half of 2022 as it ramped up its spending on new features, grappled with tough currency headwinds, and faced unfavorable year-over-year comparisons to its release of credit reserves in 2021. That's why it expects its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to decline 14% to 16% for the full year.
PayPal's slowdown was disappointing, but it's still growing and its stock finally looks cheap at 17 times forward earnings. But the departure of its longtime CFO, John Rainey, this May, its aggressive expansion into the risky BNPL (buy now, pay later) market, and its controversial proposal to fine individual accounts $2,500 per infraction for spreading ""misinformation"" (which it hastily walked back) all raise bright red flags for its future.
Why Upstart fell off a cliff
Upstart is trying to disrupt legacy credit scoring companies like FICO (NYSE: FICO), which helps lenders approve loans by assessing an applicant's income level, credit history, and other traditional data. Upstart's non-traditional approach can help those lenders approve additional loans for customers with limited employment and credit histories.
Upstart's revenue rose 42% in 2020, driven by its 40% growth in bank-originated loans, and then skyrocketed 264% in 2021 as its bank-originated loans increased 338% to 1.3 million. Its revenue rose another 70% year over year in the first half of 2022, but analysts expect just 6% growth for the full year as its revenue declines sharply in the second half of the year.
Upstart blames that slowdown on rising interest rates, which have throttled demand for new loans while forcing its partnered banks, credit unions, and auto dealerships to stop funding so many loans. Therefore, its core business -- which charges those lenders service fees for accessing its platform -- will continue to deteriorate as long as interest rates are rising.
Upstart initially only connected its lending partners to potential customers, which kept that debt off its own balance sheet. But this August, it declared it would start funding some of those loans on its own until the macro situation improved. That abrupt shift is risky, since its revenue growth is already decelerating and analysts expect it to turn unprofitable this year.
Upstart's stock looks cheap at just two times this year's sales. However, that depressed valuation suggests that a lot of investors aren't quite convinced that its business model can survive the upcoming rate increases.
The better buy: PayPal
I'm not enthusiastic about either of these stocks right now. PayPal's track record of over-promising and under-delivering has cast a dark cloud over its forward estimates, while Upstart's business model clearly wasn't designed to withstand a sudden spike in interest rates. But if I had to choose one over the other, I'd stick with PayPal because it's growing faster, it's firmly profitable, and its stock is cheap. PayPal's massive user base of 429 million active accounts also gives it plenty of room to roll out new services and grow its revenues -- provided that its management doesn't keep tripping over its own feet.

2022-10-13 00:00:00+00:00,PayPal Stock: Bear vs. Bull,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paypal-stock%3A-bear-vs.-bull,,,"PayPal's (NASDAQ: PYPL) stock price has declined more than 70% since it touched its all-time high in July 2021. The digital payments giant lost its luster as its growth cooled off and margins declined. Rising interest rates have intensified pressure on the company by curbing consumer spending and driving investors away from higher-growth tech stocks.
But with such a steep pullback behind it, is PayPal finally worth buying again ahead of its third-quarter report on Nov. 3? Let's review the bull and bear cases for this polarizing fintech stock.

What the bears will tell you about PayPal
Those who take the bearish view on PayPal believe that the company failed to adequately prepare for three major headwinds: the loss of eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) business to smaller rival Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y) from 2018 through 2021; the inevitable slowdown in digital transactions as people reverted to their pre-pandemic shopping habits and e-commerce sales cooled off; and the impact of rampant inflation on consumer spending.
Instead, PayPal overpromised and underdelivered. In February 2021, management declared it could nearly double its active accounts from 377 million in 2020 to 750 million in 2025. But in February 2022, it abandoned that ambitious goal because its growth in accounts was clearly plateauing.

That stagnation helps explain why last October it was reported that PayPal was interested in buying the social media company Pinterest (NYSE: PINS), which hosted 433 million monthly active users in the second quarter. Talks between the two companies fizzled out, but the fact that they took place suggests PayPal was so starved for growth that it was willing to buy Pinterest just to reach 750 million accounts.
PayPal's decelerating growth in total transactions and total payment volume over the past year also indicates its core business is losing its momentum and that it's struggling to replace the revenues it lost when eBay stopped using it as its primary payments platform.

The departure of longtime CFO John Rainey in May raised more red flags, and so did its expansion into the wobbly ""buy now, pay later"" (BNPL) niche, which primarily doles out subprime microloans to consumers who can't get approved for traditional credit cards.
Its recent proposal to fine individual account holders $2,500 per infraction for using the platform to spread ""misinformation"" -- a policy change it hastily walked back, saying that it was published in error -- also raised troubling questions about PayPal's neutrality as a digital payments platform.
As its growth in users and payments dried up over the past year, PayPal's operating margins declined sharply. Part of that margin compression can be attributed to difficult year-over-year comparisons to 2021, when its results benefited from its release of credit reserves. However, some of that margin compression was also caused by its investments in its digital wallet, e-commerce, cryptocurrency, and BNPL services.

Analysts expect PayPal's revenue to rise by just 10% to $27.9 billion this year, compared to its 18% growth in 2021, and forecast that its adjusted earnings per share will decline by 15% as it absorbs those higher costs.
What the bulls will tell you about PayPal
Those who take a bullish view on PayPal will admit that it faces a lot of near-term challenges, but they expect it to increase its revenue per active account to offset its slowing growth in total accounts. PayPal plans to achieve that by expanding its platform into a ""super-app"" that seamlessly links its digital wallet, e-commerce services, BNPL features, crypto trading tools, and peer-to-peer payments via Venmo.
Venmo's strong growth offset the slower growth of PayPal's namesake services last quarter. Venmo served 90 million active accounts at the end of Q2, compared to its 52 million at the end of 2019, and it could widen the company's moat against Block's (NYSE: SQ) Cash App for peer-to-peer payments and other financial services.
PayPal's growth will also likely accelerate again after it fully decouples from eBay, which only accounted for 2.5% of PayPal's revenue in its latest quarter. It also expects its operating margins to start expanding in the fourth quarter of 2022 and throughout 2023 as it streamlines its business and focuses on expanding its ""highest conviction growth opportunities"" in checkout services, digital wallets, and its Braintree back-end software (which competes against Adyen).
PayPal's growth will likely decelerate this year, but analysts still expect its revenue and adjusted earnings per share to grow by 14% and 22%, respectively, in 2023 after it laps its near-term challenges. The board also authorized a new $15 billion stock buyback, which supports the notion that PayPal shares -- which currently trade at just 19 times forward earnings -- are undervalued.
Which argument makes more sense?
PayPal's longer-term prospects seem bright, but I simply can't trust a company that had to walk back its own guidance and whose management has made such baffling business decisions over the past year. I might be more optimistic if PayPal actually stabilizes its user growth and expands its margins again. But until that happens, I'll stick with more promising tech stocks instead.

2022-10-13 00:00:00+00:00,Is This Video Game the Killer App for Cryptocurrencies?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-this-video-game-the-killer-app-for-cryptocurrencies,,,"Every new technology needs a breakthrough before it truly becomes a success. The PC computer turned heads with early spreadsheet apps like Lotus 1-2-3 and VisiCalc. Where would the internet and its gigantic economy be today without the Mosaic and Netscape browsers of the early 1990s? Digital video streams are currently stealing market share from cable, satellite, broadcast, and movie-theater video options, and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) kick-started that revolution a decade ago. You get the drift. One innovator (or sometimes a small group of them) provides the early excitement that makes the target audience sit up and take notice.
Cryptocurrencies are still looking for that magic moment after a number of false starts. Rumor has it that video game developer Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ: TTWO) might bring the initial fuel to the large-scale crypto fires.
What's the big deal?
Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA 5) is the second best-selling video game of all time, shifting 165 million units since its release in 2013. Even now, nine years later, GTA 5 remains one of Take-Two's most important and profitable titles. According to data from GamesIndustry.biz, GTA 5 was the biggest-selling game title in Europe in August 2022. Yes, that's nine years after the original launch.
Gamers are hungry for the next helping of Grand Theft Auto, of course. You can't leave them hanging forever, even if the current title continues to sell well. Whenever Take-Two gets around to releasing the next tentpole title in this dominant franchise, you can bet that it will break records and set standards.
OK, so what is Take-Two doing?
Last February, Take-Two confirmed that its Rockstar Games studio is actively working on the next installment of the Grand Theft Auto series.
""Our goal is always to significantly move beyond what we have previously delivered,"" the development studio said at the time. ""We look forward to sharing more as soon as we are ready.""
Taking that next big step is quite a challenge, but the rumor mill whispers that Take-Two may be up to that task. GTA 5 includes a simplified stock market with about 80 tickers spread across two stock exchanges. Players can invest in-game cash and earn or lose their (often ill-earned) money over time. This system is tied to real-world dollars because you can always buy a lot of game money for a little bit of cold, hard cash. One-hundred thousand dollars of GTA 5 cash costs $3, and an $8 million game-cash infusion will run you $100 in actual dollars. Going the other way around is tougher. The so-called Shark Cards are changing hands in online marketplaces like eBay, often for less than half of Rockstar's official prices.
Other game companies have improved on this idea over the years, led by Roblox (NYSE: RBLX) and its reasonably liquid Robux currency. In games like Roblox, it's possible to make a real-world living by creating in-game items and experiences that other players want to buy. The Robux system is the lifeblood of that company's business plan.
Against that backdrop, Take-Two could make a real difference to the real crypto market by building blockchain-based features into the next Grand Theft Auto.

How could crypto coins work in Grand Theft Auto?
Crypto could appear in the new GTA game in several different ways. First, Rockstar could rely on actual blockchain ledgers to track in-game data such as items, money, and rewards. Unique characters, vehicles, digital real estate properties, and weapons may be represented by non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This way, the company would create a very real trading platform for its fictional assets.
With or without crypto-based game features, the game could reward gamers for playing the game by sending out small amounts of actual cryptocurrency. This idea could be similar to the Brave web browser, which shows extra advertising on some pages in return for sharing the ad-based revenues with the browser's users. For example, I earned four Basic Attention Tokens (CRYPTO: BAT) last month for using the Brave browser a lot. That's worth about a dollar at current exchange rates, but Take-Two could up the game with a richer revenue-sharing flow. Gamer loyalty is important and valuable, after all.
And of course, Rockstar could skip the real cryptocurrencies altogether and simply make fun of the crypto market instead. Rockstar could even boost its own fortunes by signing a sponsorship deal with an entity like Coinbase or Crypto.com. That would be entirely in the dry humor spirit of the Grand Theft Auto games. This would be the least beneficial form of cryptocurrency inclusion, but the company would still discuss digital assets in front of a massive user base where many gamers tend to engage with the game world on a daily basis. That's still valuable to the crypto market.
Fingers crossed for a serious cryptocurrency feature or two
The rumor mill has not found consistent evidence of cryptocurrency features in the upcoming Grand Theft Auto, but I'll be shocked if that game hits store shelves without even a nod to the popular cryptocurrency sector. Rockstar and Take-Two could become the standard bearers for a new generation of blockchain games, or they might chuckle and snicker over the whole idea. But there will probably be some sort of crypto content, and that's enough to make a significant difference.
Mind you, only the in-game tokens and play-to-earn ideas would make the game count as a killer app for cryptocurrencies. Otherwise, it'll be more of a missed opportunity that leaves the pioneering action in some other innovator's hands. Either way, crypto should get its first real killer app fairly soon.
Crypto may not look cool right now, but the story will probably change again in the next year or two. I think it would be a shame if Take-Two Interactive wasn't jumping on this opportunity to write some real-world history. Grand Theft Auto 6 might become the VisiCalc or Netflix of the crypto market for millions of people.

2022-10-12 00:00:00+00:00,3 Inflation-Resistant Stocks to Buy Right Now,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-inflation-resistant-stocks-to-buy-right-now-1,,,"Anyone who has refueled a car, made a trip to the grocery store, or tackled a home-improvement project in the past year doesn't need to be told that inflation is running red hot. Consumers understand the problem experientially.
Inflation is also a problem for some businesses. Their expenses go up faster than revenue, leaving them with dwindling profits. But fortunately, there are companies that can resist inflation, and online marketplace eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), payments network Mastercard (NYSE: MA), and travel-booking platform Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) are three such companies, in my opinion. And all three stocks are trading at attractive valuations right now.
1. eBay: A growing take rate
Don't scoff at an eBay investment: The company is still relevant after decades of being in business. It might not dominate every e-commerce category, but it's still a go-to platform for niche categories like automotive parts. And it's one of the only places for a large selection of hard-to-find pre-owned items like trading cards.
eBay is inflation-resistant because it doesn't carry inventory. Third-party sellers supply the inventory. If merchandise costs goes up because of inflation, these sellers will raise prices. And if they can't raise prices fast enough, perhaps their earnings will go down. But eBay is agnostic to a third-party seller's profit margin. It takes its cut (referred to as a ""take rate"") either way.
The company generates revenue simply by providing a marketplace that connects buyers and sellers. It's true that activity on the platform is falling -- active buyers in the second quarter of 2022 were down 12% year over year to 138 million. But eBay's take rate has been increasing as it has rolled out proprietary payment services. In the second quarter, its take rate was 12.4%, compared to 11.1% in the prior-year quarter.
As prices go up on its platform because of inflation, eBay is poised to increase its revenue per transaction without necessarily increasing its costs. And this gives reasonable certainty that the company will remain highly profitable. Its operating-profit margin is 25% through the first half of 2022, which is quite good.
With its cash flow, eBay has focused on creating shareholder value through share repurchases and a growing dividend. And its dividend is why I believe the stock is a great buy right now. According to YCharts, the average dividend yield for the S&P 500 is 1.8%, as of September. By comparison, eBay's dividend yield is sitting over 2.2%, its highest ever. And management has plenty of room to grow it from here, just as it has over the past few years.
EBAY dividend yield. Data by YCharts.
2. Mastercard: Impressive growth despite headwinds
Mastercard is inflation-resistant for the same reason as eBay, albeit on a much larger scale. Whereas eBay handled about $38 billion in merchandise volume in the first half of 2022, Mastercard facilitated roughly $4 trillion in worldwide volume on its payment rails. And even though that number is incomprehensibly large already, it's still growing.
Mastercard's gross dollar volume in the first half of 2022 was up 10% from the comparable period of 2021. About two-thirds of this volume came from outside of the U.S. And dollar volume internationally was up 16% year over year in the second quarter of 2022.
This is surprising for two reasons. First, Mastercard suspended operations in Russia in March, so this is a drag on its international volume. Second, the U.S. dollar is the strongest it's been since the early part of this century. This means that volume in local currency looks less impressive after converting it back to dollars. And despite these two headwinds, Mastercard's rest-of-world volume was up 16%.
I believe Mastercard's overall volume strength demonstrates how inflation-resistant it is. And there's a further consideration backing up my point. A recent report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says, ""Food inflation alone has eroded global living standards at the same rate as inflation of all consumption did in the five years immediately before the pandemic."" Even with living standards eroding, Mastercard's volume continues increasing around the world nonetheless. People clearly use its payment rails even in hard times.
There are many ways to value a stock, one of which is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Right now, Mastercard stock trades at a P/E of about 30, which is its second-best valuation in the past five years -- only behind the market crash at the start of the pandemic.
MA PE Ratio. Data by YCharts.
It's reasonable to assume that global economies will stabilize in time, which should bring the U.S. dollar back to traditional levels and consequently boost Mastercard's reported earnings for international revenue. In conclusion, buy Mastercard during these tough times at a reasonable valuation, anticipating better days tomorrow.
3. Airbnb: It still benefits from growing adoption
Of the three businesses in focus here, Airbnb is the least inflation-resistant. Travel is a discretionary-spending category. And as inflation hits consumers in the wallet, there's less leftover cash to splurge on getaways. Therefore, Airbnb's revenue could possibly drop if people cut back. That said, management hasn't noticed any slowdown yet.
Travel spending isn't necessarily inflation-resistant, but Airbnb's business model is. Like eBay, it's just a marketplace. Third-party hosts provide their inventory of homes and experiences to the platform. And these third parties are the ones whose profits are affected when expenses go up on things including utilities, toiletries, and other items necessary for running a short-term rental business. Airbnb is immune to these inflationary pressures; it takes its cut of the transaction regardless.
Over time, the average daily rate (ADR) on Airbnb has crept higher. In the second quarter of 2022, the average stay in an Airbnb listing cost $164 per night, up 1% from last year and 40% from two years ago. And its ADR has continued growing even though there's a greater supply of Airbnb listings.
If inflation starts eating into short-term rental hosts' profits, it's reasonable to assume they'll raise rates and Airbnb's ADR will go up. Some travelers might balk initially. But what affects one host will likely affect many other hosts and even other lodging options like hotels. In short, inflation will increase expenses across the board, leading to increased prices and higher ADRs. And if this happens, Airbnb will generate higher revenue per booking by maintaining the same take rate.
Trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 10, the stock isn't cheap in absolute terms -- you can find companies trading cheaper. But it trades well below its average P/S valuation since it went public nearly two years ago.
ABNB PS ratio. Data by YCharts.
As a closing thought, remember that high inflation won't always be a pressing concern. Whether later this year or a few years from now, I would expect inflation to return to its historical rate. Therefore, while it's nice knowing eBay, Mastercard, and Airbnb have inflation-resistant traits, this isn't the only factor to consider when investing. Indeed, many companies heavily affected by inflation will overcome it and still be good long-term investments from today. So make sure to keep your eyes open to opportunities beyond those discussed here.

BOSTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Two former eBay Inc EBAY.O security employees were sentenced to prison and home confinement on Tuesday for their roles in a cyberstalking campaign that targeted a Massachusetts couple whose online newsletter was viewed as critical of the e-commerce company.
Stephanie Popp, 34, was sentenced to one year in prison while Stephanie Stockwell, 28, was ordered to serve a year of home confinement for participating in an extensive campaign in 2019 that involved sending the couple cockroaches, fly larvae and a bloody Halloween pig mask.
They were sentenced by U.S. District Judge William Young in Boston after pleading guilty in 2020 to cyberstalking-related charges and admitting they facilitated a scheme to intimidate the couple while at the Silicon Valley e-commerce company.
Defense lawyers had no immediate comment.
They are among seven former eBay workers who have admitted wrongdoing over a scheme that targeted David and Ina Steiner, a married couple in Natick, Massachusetts, who produce the newsletter EcommerceBytes.
Prosecutors said senior executives, including then-Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig deemed the newsletter critical of eBay, in mid-2019, and a senior member of its security team, Jim Baugh, implemented a plan to harass and intimidate them.
Prosecutors said Popp, eBay's senior manager of global intelligence, that August sent Ina Steiner a series of anonymous Twitter messages criticizing the newsletter's coverage and at times threatening violence.
She and Stockwell, the manager of eBay’s global intelligence center were involved in sending gross and disturbing and threatening packages to the Steiners' home, which also included spiders, a funeral wreath and a book on surviving the loss of a spouse, prosecutors said.
Popp also traveled to Massachusetts to help Baugh and others surveil their home. Baugh was sentenced last month to 57 months in prison.
Wenig, a former Thomson Reuters executive who stepped down as eBay's CEO in September 2019, was not charged. A spokesman has said Wenig had ""absolutely zero knowledge"" of the actions the employees undertook.

2022-10-11 00:00:00+00:00,The past year for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) investors has not been profitable,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-past-year-for-ebay-nasdaq%3Aebay-investors-has-not-been-profitable,,,"It's easy to match the overall market return by buying an index fund. When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. For example, the eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) share price is down 50% in the last year. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 22%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 2.1% in that time. More recently, the share price has dropped a further 17% in a month. But this could be related to poor market conditions -- stocks are down 11% in the same time.
Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
During the last year eBay saw its earnings per share drop below zero. Buyers no doubt think it's a temporary situation, but those with a nose for quality have low tolerance for losses. However, there may be an opportunity for investors if the company can recover.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
NasdaqGS:EBAY Earnings Per Share Growth October 11th 2022
This free interactive report on eBay's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
A Different Perspective
While the broader market lost about 22% in the twelve months, eBay shareholders did even worse, losing 49% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 1.0% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand eBay better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 3 warning signs with eBay (at least 1 which is a bit concerning) , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

2022-10-03 00:00:00+00:00,Why Etsy Stock Was Up on Monday,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-etsy-stock-was-up-on-monday,,,"What happened
Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) shareholders beat a rising market on Monday, with the stock jumping 5% by 3 p.m. ET, compared to a 2.6% surge in the S&P 500. That boost only erased a small portion of recent losses for owners of the e-commerce platform though, which remains down by over 50% so far in 2022, compared to the wider market's 23% decline.
That prior stock-price slump was the biggest factor behind Etsy's rally on Monday as investors became less pessimistic about its short-term growth prospects.
So what
Monday's rally was a sharp reversal of the bearish trend that has brought most of the market down in 2022. Etsy's shares have been hit especially hard during the down days as investors started worrying about a recession on the way.
Shares dove over 6% on two occasions in late September, for example, amid wider market declines. In that context, it makes sense that the stock would rally when sentiment turned more positive as it did on Monday.
Etsy is also entering the holiday shopping period with solid momentum. Sales volumes on its platform were down only slightly through late June, compared to bigger declines at eBay. Etsy is still adding to its buyer pool as well. Its adjusted-profit margin is holding up well, although the company is not profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis .
Now what
Investors will get one more major update from the management team before the end of the year. Etsy is slated to release third-quarter operating results in early November, and that report could set the tone for the rest of 2022.
Follow changes in Etsy's buyer pool in that announcement for signs of continued market-share gains. If Etsy can maintain that impressive growth, especially in its international markets, then the business has a good shot at taking big steps toward profitability in 2023 and beyond.

2022-09-29 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting EBAY Put And Call Options For November 11th,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-ebay-put-and-call-options-for-november-11th,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options become available today, for the November 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new November 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $37.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.82. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $37.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $35.18 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $37.73/share today.
Because the $37.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.92% return on the cash commitment, or 41.71% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $37.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $38.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.09. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $37.73/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $38.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.25% if the stock gets called away at the November 11th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $38.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $38.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.54% boost of extra return to the investor, or 46.97% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $37.73) to be 37%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

BOSTON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - A former eBay Inc EBAY.O security executive was sentenced on Thursday to 57 months in prison for directing a crusade to harass a Massachusetts couple with threats and disturbing home deliveries after their online newsletter drew the ire of the e-commerce company's then-CEO.
Jim Baugh, 47, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston for running what she called an extensive harassment campaign fueled by eBay's ""toxic culture"" that involved sending the couple cockroaches, a funeral wreath and a bloody Halloween pig mask.
""It was extreme and outrageous, the kinds of things we don't see in civilized society,"" Saris said.
Baugh, eBay's former senior director of safety and security, must also pay a $40,000 fine after pleading guilty to cyberstalking-related charges. ""There’s no excuse for what was done,"" he said.
Another former executive, David Harville, will be sentenced later Thursday.
Seven former eBay workers overall have been charged over a campaign that targeted David and Ina Steiner, a married couple in Natick, Massachusetts, who produce the newsletter EcommerceBytes.
Prosecutors said senior executives deemed the newsletter critical of eBay, and in August 2019 then-Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig texted another executive that it was time to ""take her down,"" referring to Ina Steiner.
Wenig, a former Thomson Reuters executive who stepped down as eBay's CEO in September 2019, was not charged. A spokesman said he had ""absolutely zero knowledge of the actions of Mr. Baugh and the others.""
Overseeing the campaign was Baugh, who previously worked for the Central Intelligence Agency and provided protection to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and, in one instance, now-President Joe Biden when he was vice president.
At Baugh's direction, the Steiners received anonymous, harassing Twitter messages, bizarre emails, and unwanted home deliveries like spiders and a book on surviving the loss of a spouse, prosecutors said.
They said other eBay employees involved included Harville, who Baugh recruited with a contractor for an ""op"" to surveil the Steiners and try unsuccessfully to install a GPS on their car.
