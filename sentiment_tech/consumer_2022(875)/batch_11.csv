2022-07-19 00:00:00+00:00,4 Retail Stocks to Buy as Sales Soar on Rising Costs,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-retail-stocks-to-buy-as-sales-soar-on-rising-costs,,,"U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in June amid surging commodity prices. Higher demand for goods has been driving retail sales and inflationary pressures haven’t yet been able to dent consumers’ sentiment. The retail sector had suffered a lot over the past two years that saw sales plummeting, but the sector has steadily bounced back.
This year, so far, has proved to be great for retailers, as sales have continued to rise almost every month. Given this scenario, retailers like Canada Goose Holdings Inc. GOOS, The TJX Companies, Inc.TJX, Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR and J.Jill, Inc. JILL are likely to do well in the near term.
Retail Sales Bounce Back
The Commerce Department said on Jul 15 that retail sales rose 1% in June, beating economists’ expectations of a 0.9% rise. This comes after a slight decline in sales in May. However, May’s figures were revised to a decline of 0.1% from the earlier reported 0.3%.
Sales grew across several categories in June, the report said. Some of the gains were also attributed to soaring gasoline and food prices. However, the retail sector made a solid comeback in June.
Excluding autos, retail sales grew 1%, beating expectations of a 0.7% rise. The report mentions that sales were widespread as people bought automobiles and furniture, and spent at restaurants.
Auto sales rose 0.9% in June. Sales at gasoline stores jumped 3.6%, playing a major role in driving sales. Sales at bars and restaurants grew 1%.
E-commerce once again played a major role in driving retail sales. Online sales increased 2.2%, while sales at furniture and home sales increased 1.4%.
Retail Sector Still Going Strong
Inflation rose 9.1% in June to reach a 41-year high but demand for goods has continued to rise. Although consumers are spending cautiously, higher food prices are making them spend more, which is translating into higher sales for merchants. However, even then, higher retail sales prove that they haven’t succumbed to inflationary pressure.
A separate Mastercard SpendingPulse report also showed retail sales growth in June. According to the Mastercard SpendingPulse, June retail sales jumped 9.5% year over year. Excluding auto and gasoline, retail sales grew 6.1% year over year in June.
People spent more money on commodities during the pandemic's peak and less on services, since companies remained shuttered or partially open. Following the major immunization effort, things began to change in the beginning of 2021. However, obstacles in the shape of the Omicron and Delta coronavirus subtypes prevented people from confidently leaving their houses.
However, this year, when the economy began to almost fully recover, many people started feeling more secure about leaving their houses. In addition, despite increased costs, people have begun booking vacations and going on trips. Spending on hotel and air travel is up 33.7% and 18.2%, respectively, over the previous year.
Also, despite growing concerns over economic slowdown, consumer sentiment hasn’t hit rock bottom. U.S. consumer confidence is once again above the 50 mark, which is a good sign. The University of Michigan's Consumer Confidence Index edged higher to a reading of 51.5 in July, beating expectations of 49.9.
Our Choices
The retail sector is still performing well, and so long as demand for goods continues to grow, sales should be on the rise.

2022-07-15 00:00:00+00:00,2 Growth Stocks That Could Beat the Market Over the Next 3 Years,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-growth-stocks-that-could-beat-the-market-over-the-next-3-years,,,"Although most stocks are down this year, former high-fliers have been especially hard-hit by the market's shift in preference from growth stocks to more defensive, consumer-oriented companies. So far in 2022, Amazon.com has lost 56% of its value, chipmaker Nvidia is down 48%, and Starbucks is off 33%.
Yet not all growth stocks have been equally affected. A few, in fact, have not only held up well, but are poised to continue doing so over the next three years -- among them, Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) and General Mills (NYSE: GIS).

Deep discount opportunity
The Labor Department on Wednesday announced that inflation hit a whopping 9.1% year over year in June, the steepest run-up in consumer prices since 1981, and higher than most economists' estimates. That alone is a good enough reason to expect deep discount retailer Dollar Tree to perform well in the immediate future and for at least the next few years. In this environment, consumers are going to seek out stores where they can get the most bang for their buck, and the dollar stores will be among the prime beneficiaries.
While it wasn't because of inflation that Dollar Tree in recent years abandoned the everything-for-one-dollar threshold it used to operate at, it was a timely decision, as it gave consumers time to adapt to seeing higher-priced items on its shelves.
When it finally had to announce it was going to let that $1 target slide further because of inflation, its customers were already conditioned to accept the change. They also realized they were getting more name-brand products, better quality, and larger sizes from the retailer, too. And Dollar Tree hasn't really gone overboard on the higher prices: Most of its products are still $1.25 or less, but there is a larger selection of goods that cost $2 or $3, and customers have fully embraced it.
Sales jumped 6.5% in the first quarter while gross profits surged almost 20% higher as comparable sales at its namesake store jumped 11% year over year. Its Family Dollar chain, which always had multiple pricing tiers and enjoyed a large increase in sales last year thanks in part to the federal stimulus checks, saw its comps fall 3%.
Yet that comps decline was also in part the result of a rodent infestation at a distribution center that required the company to temporarily close more than 400 stores and recall a slew of products. That impacted comps by 200 basis points, so the chain's performance was actually better than the headline number would indicate.
Although Dollar Tree stock is up 17% in 2022 and 66% higher over the past 12 months, it still trades at a reasonable 17 times next year's earnings projections and at a price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 1.5, based on the long-term 16.5% earnings growth rate forecast by Wall Street analysts. This deep discounter is still a discount opportunity to buy.
Less is more
Cereal maker General Mills has been socked by inflation, which contributed to margin pressure in its fiscal 2022 fourth quarter (ended May 29). Now, it's taking the opportunity to focus more narrowly on the North American market in brands and categories where it sees the potential for the greatest profits to be made.
As a result, it dumped its European yogurt business last year, sold its majority stake in an Israeli dough-manufacturing joint venture, sold its European dough unit, and is selling its Helper and Suddenly Salad brands to Eagle Family Foods Group for $610 million. At the same time, it's making more acquisitions in the pet snacks space, having added several brands to its Blue Buffalo division in its fiscal 2022 first quarter, as well as a North American foodservice pizza crust business.
General Mills has benefited from the market's rotation away from tech stocks and into consumer discretionary stocks. Its shares have steadily risen over the past year and sit 35% above their 52-week low.
It has a portfolio of over 100 brands -- including some of the best-known in their categories, such as Betty Crocker, Cheerios, and Pillsbury. That, coupled with the fact that food generally tends to be a recession-resistant category, makes General Mills perfectly positioned to capitalize on the current environment as well as the recession many economists see just ahead.

3 Recession-Proof Stocks Up 10% in 2022 to Buy Right Now
Inflation showed no signs of cooling in June, with prices up 9.1% from a year ago to top estimates. Costs were up nearly across the board and are essentially washing away Americans' wage gains. U.S. consumers are already feeling historically beaten down as they watch gas prices and grocery bills surge, and their sentiment is unlikely to improve until prices drop.
The Fed is focused almost exclusively on the stable price side of its dual mandate. The hotter-than-projected CPI print, coupled with the strong June jobs report increases the likelihood that the Fed will raise rates by at least another 75 basis points at its next FOMC meeting on July 26 and 27—its last meeting until September 20-21.
Jay Powell and Co. admittedly stuck to their transitory stance for too long and now they are completely committed to doing all they can to bring prices down and prevent 40-year high inflation from becoming entrenched in the U.S. economy.
Even if the U.S. is headed for a recession, or already in one (depending on who you ask), it doesn't mean we are in for an abrupt, lockdown-style demand evaporation. Life goes on and spending continues, just not to the same extent as it did during the post-covid boom.
Recessions and economic ebbs and flows are part of life, and they impact some industries and sectors more.
Today, we dive into three stocks that are poised to beat inflation and rise above any possible recession. All three names appear worth buying for the second half of 2022 and might be up for consideration as buy-and-hold stocks.  
Dollar Tree, Inc.
Dollar Tree operates over 15,500 stores across much of the U.S. and Canada. The discount retailer late last year raised its prices for the first time in history from $1 to $1.25, and it completed its new pricing rollout a few months ahead of schedule. The higher prices allow Dollar Tree to sell a wider range of merchandise, while maintaining some of the lowest prices in retail, fighting back against inflation, and improving margins.
Dollar Tree owns Family Dollar (purchased in 2015) which offers a wider range of price points, and DLTR's separate ""$3 and $5 plus assortment"" in Dollar Tree stores have performed well. DLTR operates smaller format stores compared to Target and Walmart and it has expanded aggressively.
Dollar Tree steadily grew its revenue for decades and it's poised to thrive as more Americans look to save money. DLTR upped its guidance last quarter in the face of economic downturn fears, with its positive EPS revisions helping it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks estimates call for its revenue to climb 6.7% in 2022 and another 6% in FY23 to $29.76 billion to help lift its adjusted earnings by 41% and 16%, respectively.
DLTR has blown away Walmart and Target over the last 15 years and outpaced its rival Dollar General (DG), soaring 1,200% vs. 975% for DG. This included a nearly 70% run in the past 12 months vs. the market's -13% downturn and the broader Zacks Retail Sector's -31% fall.
DLTR sits around 5% below its April records at around $166 per share. Plus, it trades at a 24% discount to its own decade-long median and offers 15% value compared to its industry's current levels at 19X forward earnings.
Dollar Tree is committed to long-term expansion within a segment of the retail sector that's never going out of style during economic booms or busts. The firm's growth initiatives are supported by a solid balance sheet. And its $1.25 price point is set to boost its earnings and revenue growth over the long haul.
AbbVie
Discount retail is a somewhat recession-proof space, as is the wider healthcare field, for obvious reasons.
AbbVie is a pharmaceutical giant that's more diversified than ever and far less exposed to Humira's growth, through its $63 billion purchase of Allergan in 2020. The deal came as Humira biosimilars hurt sales of one of the world's top-selling drugs. AbbVie now owns Botox and other popular drugs, within a diversified portfolio that features immunology, oncology, neuroscience, a strong R&D pipeline, and beyond.
AbbVie's revenue soared 38% in FY20 and 23% in fiscal 2021, driven by the acquisition. ABBV's adjusted earnings also jumped 20% last year. Zacks estimates call for its adjusted FY22 earnings to pop another 10.2% on 6.1% higher sales that would see it pull in roughly $60 billion. Its revenue and EPS are expected to slip on a YoY basis in FY23 as its Allergan-boosted growth normalizes and it faces tough-to-compete against periods.
AbbVie's earnings outlook has held up rather well recently, and its FY23 consensus EPS estimate is up slightly to help it grab a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The firm's Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry sits in the top 33% of 250 Zacks industries and ABBV lands an overall ""A"" VGM grade. And eight of the 15 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are ""Strong Buys,"" alongside one ""Buy,"" and five ""Holds.""
AbbVie's dividend yield comes in at 3.7% to crush its highly-ranked industry's 2.5% average, as well as Johnson & Johnson's 2.8% and Merck's 2.9%. ABBV is committed to boosting its dividend payout, with the quarterly rate up 250% since its inception in 2013. Crucially, AbbVie's impressive and industry-topping yield isn't bolstered by a falling stock price.  
ABBV has outpaced the market and more than doubled its industry since it began trading in early 2013, up 335%. The stock has climbed 50% in the last two years and 28% in the trailing 12 months vs. Large Cap Pharma's 16%. AbbVie stock is up 11% in 2022, and it's slipped to potentially more attractive price points off its April peaks.
ABBV trades at $150 per share which provides 10% upside to its current Zacks consensus price target. Investors will also love the pharmaceutical stock's valuation. ABBV trades at a roughly 20% discount to its industry, despite its outperformance, at 11.9X forward 12-month earnings. And the stock sits near its historic median and 30% below its own highs.
Sysco Corp.
Sysco is a wholesale food and food products giant with clients across restaurants, healthcare, education, hotels, and nearly the entire away-from-home meal market. SYY's product categories on the food side include meat & poultry, seafood, produce, dairy, bakery & desserts, pantry staples, and beyond. Sysco also sells paper goods, equipment, supplies, and more. And it operates a services unit that ranges from training materials and recipe ideas to cost-based analysis.  
Sysco's food-away-from-home market is almost indestructible and as close to recession-proof as possible. The only time its revenue declined at any point in the past 25 years was a tiny 1.8% dip in fiscal 2009 and slightly larger pullbacks during covid when many of its clients abruptly closed their doors for extended periods.
SYY's FY21 (ended on July 3, 2021) sales slipped 3%. But it's bouncing back as people return to their normal lives. Sysco's Q3 FY22 sales climbed 43% YoY and were up 15% from the pre-covid period in 2019. Sysco raised its guidance in the face of inflation, with it able to pass on higher costs and steer clients to less-impacted segments. Sysco's upward earnings revisions help it capture a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and eight of the 11 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are ""Strong Buys.""
Zacks estimates call for Sysco's FY22 revenue to surge 32.5% to $68 billion to blow away its pre-covid total in 2019 of $60 billion. Its revenue is set to jump another 8.4% in FY23 to $74 billion. At the bottom end of the income statement, its adjusted earnings are expected to climb 124% and 34%, respectively.
In terms of performance, Sysco has climbed roughly 200% during the past decade to match the S&P 500 and destroy its highly-ranked industry's 45%. This run includes a 55% jump in the last two years and a 10% climb in 2022 vs. its industry's -3% drop. SYY currently sits 5% below its April highs. On the valuation side, it's trading at its decade-long median at 19.7X forward 12-month earnings and nearly in line with its industry.
Sysco's standing as a Dividend Aristocrat cements its stability through good economic times and bad. The select group of around 65 stocks includes S&P 500 companies that have both paid and raised dividends for at least 25 straight years. SYY's dividend yield comes in at 2.3% right now to blow away its industry's average and the S&P 500's 1.6%.
Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?
Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021. Amazingly, they soared +40.3%, +48.2%, +67.6%, +94.4%, and +95.3%. Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.

2022-07-14 00:00:00+00:00,3 Recession-Proof Stocks Up 10% in 2022 to Buy Right Now,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-recession-proof-stocks-up-10-in-2022-to-buy-right-now,,,"Inflation showed no signs of cooling in June, with prices up 9.1% from a year ago to top estimates. Costs were up nearly across the board and are essentially washing away Americans’ wage gains. U.S. consumers are already feeling historically beaten down as they watch gas prices and grocery bills surge, and their sentiment is unlikely to improve until prices drop.
The Fed is focused almost exclusively on the stable price side of its dual mandate. The hotter-than-projected CPI print, coupled with the strong June jobs report increases the likelihood that the Fed will raise rates by at least another 75 basis points at its next FOMC meeting on July 26 and 27—its last meeting until September 20-21.
Jay Powell and Co. admittedly stuck to their transitory stance for too long and now they are completely committed to doing all they can to bring prices down and prevent 40-year high inflation from becoming entrenched in the U.S. economy.
Even if the U.S. is headed for a recession, or already in one (depending on who you ask), it doesn’t mean we are in for an abrupt, lockdown-style demand evaporation. Life goes on and spending continues, just not to the same extent as it did during the post-covid boom.
Recessions and economic ebbs and flows are part of life, and they impact some industries and sectors more.
Today, we dive into three stocks that are poised to beat inflation and rise above any possible recession. All three names appear worth buying for the second half of 2022 and might be up for consideration as buy-and-hold stocks.  
Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR
Dollar Tree operates over 15,500 stores across much of the U.S. and Canada. The discount retailer late last year raised its prices for the first time in history from $1 to $1.25, and it completed its new pricing rollout a few months ahead of schedule. The higher prices allow Dollar Tree to sell a wider range of merchandise, while maintaining some of the lowest prices in retail, fighting back against inflation, and improving margins.
Dollar Tree owns Family Dollar (purchased in 2015) which offers a wider range of price points, and DLTR’s separate “$3 and $5 plus assortment” in Dollar Tree stores have performed well. DLTR operates smaller format stores compared to Target TGT and Walmart WMT and it has expanded aggressively.
Dollar Tree steadily grew its revenue for decades and it’s poised to thrive as more Americans look to save money. DLTR upped its guidance last quarter in the face of economic downturn fears, with its positive EPS revisions helping it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks estimates call for its revenue to climb 6.7% in 2022 and another 6% in FY23 to $29.76 billion to help lift its adjusted earnings by 41% and 16%, respectively.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
DLTR has blown away Walmart and Target over the last 15 years and outpaced its rival Dollar General DG, soaring 1,200% vs. 975% for DG. This included a nearly 70% run in the past 12 months vs. the market’s -13% downturn and the broader Zacks Retail Sector’s -31% fall.
DLTR sits around 5% below its April records at around $166 per share. Plus, it trades at a 24% discount to its own decade-long median and offers 15% value compared to its industry’s current levels at 19X forward earnings.
Dollar Tree is committed to long-term expansion within a segment of the retail sector that’s never going out of style during economic booms or busts. The firm’s growth initiatives are supported by a solid balance sheet. And its $1.25 price point is set to boost its earnings and revenue growth over the long haul.
AbbVie ABBV
Discount retail is a somewhat recession-proof space, as is the wider healthcare field, for obvious reasons.
AbbVie is a pharmaceutical giant that’s more diversified than ever and far less exposed to Humira’s growth, through its $63 billion purchase of Allergan in 2020. The deal came as Humira biosimilars hurt sales of one of the world’s top-selling drugs. AbbVie now owns Botox and other popular drugs, within a diversified portfolio that features immunology, oncology, neuroscience, a strong R&D pipeline, and beyond.
AbbVie’s revenue soared 38% in FY20 and 23% in fiscal 2021, driven by the acquisition. ABBV’s adjusted earnings also jumped 20% last year. Zacks estimates call for its adjusted FY22 earnings to pop another 10.2% on 6.1% higher sales that would see it pull in roughly $60 billion. Its revenue and EPS are expected to slip on a YoY basis in FY23 as its Allergan-boosted growth normalizes and it faces tough-to-compete against periods.
AbbVie’s earnings outlook has held up rather well recently, and its FY23 consensus EPS estimate is up slightly to help it grab a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The firm’s Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry sits in the top 33% of 250 Zacks industries and ABBV lands an overall “A” VGM grade. And eight of the 15 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys,” alongside one “Buy,” and five “Holds.”

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
AbbVie’s dividend yield comes in at 3.7% to crush its highly-ranked industry’s 2.5% average, as well as Johnson & Johnson’s 2.8% and Merck’s 2.9%. ABBV is committed to boosting its dividend payout, with the quarterly rate up 250% since its inception in 2013. Crucially, AbbVie’s impressive and industry-topping yield isn’t bolstered by a falling stock price.  
ABBV has outpaced the market and more than doubled its industry since it began trading in early 2013, up 335%. The stock has climbed 50% in the last two years and 28% in the trailing 12 months vs. Large Cap Pharma’s 16%. AbbVie stock is up 11% in 2022, and it’s slipped to potentially more attractive price points off its April peaks.
ABBV trades at $150 per share which provides 10% upside to its current Zacks consensus price target. Investors will also love the pharmaceutical stock’s valuation. ABBV trades at a roughly 20% discount to its industry, despite its outperformance, at 11.9X forward 12-month earnings. And the stock sits near its historic median and 30% below its own highs.
Sysco Corporation SYY
Sysco is a wholesale food and food products giant with clients across restaurants, healthcare, education, hotels, and nearly the entire away-from-home meal market. SYY’s product categories on the food side include meat & poultry, seafood, produce, dairy, bakery & desserts, pantry staples, and beyond. Sysco also sells paper goods, equipment, supplies, and more. And it operates a services unit that ranges from training materials and recipe ideas to cost-based analysis.  
Sysco’s food-away-from-home market is almost indestructible and as close to recession-proof as possible. The only time its revenue declined at any point in the past 25 years was a tiny 1.8% dip in fiscal 2009 and slightly larger pullbacks during covid when many of its clients abruptly closed their doors for extended periods.
SYY’s FY21 (ended on July 3, 2021) sales slipped 3%. But it’s bouncing back as people return to their normal lives. Sysco’s Q3 FY22 sales climbed 43% YoY and were up 15% from the pre-covid period in 2019. Sysco raised its guidance in the face of inflation, with it able to pass on higher costs and steer clients to less-impacted segments. Sysco’s upward earnings revisions help it capture a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and eight of the 11 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys.”

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Zacks estimates call for Sysco’s FY22 revenue to surge 32.5% to $68 billion to blow away its pre-covid total in 2019 of $60 billion. Its revenue is set to jump another 8.4% in FY23 to $74 billion. At the bottom end of the income statement, its adjusted earnings are expected to climb 124% and 34%, respectively.
In terms of performance, Sysco has climbed roughly 200% during the past decade to match the S&P 500 and destroy its highly-ranked industry’s 45%. This run includes a 55% jump in the last two years and a 10% climb in 2022 vs. its industry’s -3% drop. SYY currently sits 5% below its April highs. On the valuation side, it’s trading at its decade-long median at 19.7X forward 12-month earnings and nearly in line with its industry.
Sysco’s standing as a Dividend Aristocrat cements its stability through good economic times and bad. The select group of around 65 stocks includes S&P 500 companies that have both paid and raised dividends for at least 25 straight years. SYY’s dividend yield comes in at 2.3% right now to blow away its industry’s average and the S&P 500’s 1.6%.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-07-14 00:00:00+00:00,"Red Robin (RRGB) Banks on Menu Innovation, High Costs Ail",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/red-robin-rrgb-banks-on-menu-innovation-high-costs-ail,,,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. RRGB will likely benefit from its menu innovation, Donatos expansion and digital initiatives. Also, emphasis on the new prototype configuration bodes well. However, inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions are a concern.

Let’s discuss the factors highlighting why investors should retain the stock for the time being.
Catalysts Driving Growth
Red Robin’s efforts to improve sales and regain market share via efficient menu innovation, focus on increasing service speed and effective marketing strategy bode well. Despite scaling down its menu (from pre-pandemic levels), it reported solid performance of Cheesy Bacon Fondue Burger and Scorpion Gourmet Burger. Also, it has been witnessing positive customer feedback related to its limited time offer (LTO) menu items. During the fiscal first quarter, the company reported solid performance with respect to its LTO’s comprising cheese levers (featuring Cheesy Bacon Fondue Burger and Mozzarella Cheese Sticks) and the Whiskey River Backyard barbecue menu lineup (including Smokehouse Brisket Burger and Tequila Sunset Cocktail). The company intends to focus on creative recipes to drive higher checks and margins.

Red Robin still considers Donatos as a key growth driver. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company initiated Donatos at approximately 200 restaurants. During the quarter, Donatos generated sales worth $7 million. The company stated that for restaurants with Donatos, comparable restaurant revenues increased by more than 5% over restaurants that did not yet have Donatos. Also, guest checks that included Donatos Pizza were more than $10 (on average) compared with those that did not include pizza. The company anticipates rolling out Donatos to approximately 50 restaurants in 2022 and 150 restaurants in 2023. It intends to leverage Donatos to enhance the Red Robin dine-in experience growth and drive long-term incremental transactions through catering and delivery. Red Robin is optimistic about the success of this partnership.
Red Robin continues to focus on its digital platform to drive growth. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company emphasized on enhancements regarding integration and a seamless digital ecosystem. To this end, the company launched a new website experience with user-friendly enhancements to presentation, navigation and online ordering. It reported increased order conversion on account of the same. Backed by solid customer engagement, the company is optimistic regarding its digital ecosystem and expects it to drive incremental frequency, traffic and guest checks. The company stated that enhancements related to geofencing (which will inform restaurants when the guest is near for pickup) and additional payment options (such as Apple Pay and Google Pay) are in the pipeline to support the same.

During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, the company initiated a new prototype configuration comprising design enhancements (to improve dine-in, off-premises and curbside execution) and an optimized kitchen layout (to boost efficiency). Following the opening, the company reported solid average weekly sales and stated that it is on track to achieve more than $4 million in terms of annual sales. The company intends to develop a real estate pipeline by leveraging its enhanced prototype design and focus on targeting high-return markets to drive growth.
Concerns
Red Robin has been persistently shouldering increased expenses, which are denting margins. During the fiscal first quarter, the company cited concerns about restaurant labor cost inflation. During the quarter, labor costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased 130 basis points year over year to 36.3%. The increase was primarily driven by higher labor inflation and staffing costs, partially offset by sales leverage. In 2022, the company anticipates commodity and restaurant labor cost inflation to be in the mid-to-high single digit.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Shares of Red Robin have plunged 52.5% so far this year, compared with the industry’s 19% fall. The dismal performance was primarily caused by the coronavirus crisis. Notably, pandemic-induced staffing challenges and supply chain disruptions had taken an enormous toll on the company. Although most dining services are open, traffic is still low compared with pre-pandemic levels. The company intends to monitor the situation regularly to gauge the impacts of COVID-19.

Red Robin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2022-07-14 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why You Should Retain Starbucks (SBUX) Despite China Woes,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-you-should-retain-starbucks-sbux-despite-china-woes,,,"Starbucks Corporation SBUX has been banking on successful innovations, digital offerings and expansion efforts to drive growth. The company has been benefiting from robust North America comps. However, the company’s dismal performance in China remains a concern. In the past six months, its shares have fallen 22.2%, compared with the industry’s decline of 11.5%. Let’s delve deeper.
Growth Catalysts
Starbucks has been strengthening its product portfolio with significant innovation around beverages, refreshments, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings. SBUX has been leaning toward fast-growing categories like Cold Brew, Draft Nitro beverages, and plant-based modifiers, including almond, coconut, and soy milk alternatives. Apart from the numerous beverage innovations, Starbucks has been making an effort to offer more nutritional and healthy products to its customers.

The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company continues to focus on digitalization to drive growth. The company made progress with respect to personalized digital relationships to expand its reach among members. This includes program enhancements like Stars for Everyone. Starbucks initiated payment partnerships with PayPal and Bakkt, thereby allowing customers to recharge their Starbucks card through a range of cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin and Ethereum) and the option of converting digital currencies to physical currency. SBUX has been exploring the blockchain platform for ways to connect the Starbucks Rewards program with other merchant rewards programs along with the motive of tokenization of stars.

The company’s North America comps have impressed investors for the fifth straight quarter. North America comps rose 12% in the fiscal second quarter, owing to an increase of 5% in comparable transactions and an improvement of 7% in average ticket. Global comparable store sales rose 7% year over year. The upside was primarily driven by a 3% rise in comparable transactions and a 4% increase in average tickets.

Despite the pandemic, the company has been focusing on expansion efforts. In fiscal 2021, Starbucks opened 1,173 net new stores worldwide. In second-quarter fiscal 2022, Starbucks opened 313 net new stores worldwide in the fiscal second quarter, taking the total store count to 34,630. Global store growth was 5.1% on a year-over-year basis.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Primary Concerns
The pandemic has negatively impacted the company’s performance in China. Due to uncertainty in China, SBUX is unable to predict its performance in the country in the back half of the year. During second-quarter 2022, net revenues in China decreased 14% while sales comp declined 20% compared with the last year, after adjusting for the VAT subsidy. Due to the Shanghai lockdown and resurgence of COVID cases in other cities, the company expects its China performance to worsen in third-quarter 2022. At the end of second-quarter 2022, Starbucks noted that nearly one-third of its stores in China remain temporarily closed or are offering mobile ordering channels only.

Given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding China, increasing inflation and the significant investments that the company has been planning, Starbucks’ management has suspended guidance for the third quarter and the fourth quarter for the time being. SBUX believes its performance will be under pressure for the balance of the year, especially in the third quarter.
Key Picks

2022-07-14 00:00:00+00:00,4 Retail Stocks to Buy Amid Growing Economic Uncertainties,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-retail-stocks-to-buy-amid-growing-economic-uncertainties,,,"The retail sector is slowly feeling the heat of soaring prices as people have started spending cautiously on necessities. Even then, sales are getting a boost as demand for goods continues to rise. Higher demand is helping retailers earn more revenues, proving that people are still willing to spend amid growing economic uncertainties.
According to the Mastercard SpendingPulse, retail sales grew at a solid pace in June, driven by in-store sales. Although e-commerce sales have slightly slowed over the months, it is playing a crucial role in driving overall retail sales. Given this scenario, retailers like Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR, Canada Goose Holdings Inc. GOOS, Signet Jewelers Limited SIG and J.Jill, Inc. JILL are likely to do well in the near term.
Retail Sales Grow in June
According to the latest Mastercard SpendingPulse, retail sales jumped a solid 9.5% year over year in June. Retail sales excluding auto and gasoline grew 6.1% on a year-over-year basis in June.
June’s jump was primarily driven by higher in-store sales. According to the report, in-store retail sales, excluding auto and gasoline, increased 11.7% year over year in June. E-commerce sales, however, slowed down a bit and rose 1.1% year over year.
Rising prices, particularly for necessities such as food and fuel, are one of the reasons behind the sales jump in June. Inflation rose 9.1% in June to hit a 41-year high, according to the latest reading released on Jul 13. People are buying cautiously, but they cannot do away with necessities and are ending up spending more, which is getting reflected in the form of higher revenues for retailers.
Sales of fuel and convenience jumped 42.1%, while grocery sales increased 14% year over year in June. 
Even after excluding these, retail sales saw solid growth in June. Spending on consumer discretionary products, which include fashion products, climbed 16.2% year over year and 86.6% from 2019. Spending on luxury goods increased 4% year over year and 54% from the pre-pandemic times of 2019. Sales at department stores grew 8.6% year over year and 21.4% from 2019.
Retail Sector Still Going Strong
The peak of the pandemic saw people spending more on goods and less on services as businesses remained closed or partially open. Things started changing from the beginning of last year, following the massive vaccination drive. However, disruptions in the form of the Omicron and Delta variants of the coronavirus kept people from moving out of their homes confidently.
There was a palpable hesitance in visiting restaurants and planning holidays. However, beginning this year, as the economy almost fully reopened and people started moving out of their homes more confidently. Thus, people again started spending more on services. While this hurt retail sales slightly, higher demand for goods continued to help the sector hold on to its ground.
Moreover, despite rising costs, people have finally started traveling and planning holidays. Spending on airlines and lodging is up 18.2% and 33.7%, respectively, year over year.
Also, the back-to-school season, which has almost begun, is further likely to help boost retail sales in the coming days.

2022-07-13 00:00:00+00:00,Walmart (WMT) to Buy EVs From Canoo for Online Order Deliveries,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/walmart-wmt-to-buy-evs-from-canoo-for-online-order-deliveries,,,"Walmart Inc. WMT has been doing every bit to enhance its delivery services, thereby boosting e-commerce sales and enriching customers’ experiences. Taking another step in this direction, the omnichannel retailer inked a deal with Canoo Inc. GOEV to buy 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, with a choice of buying up to 10,000 units.

The vehicles purchased from GOEV will be utilized to deliver online orders sustainably, helping Walmart meet its zero-emission goal by 2040. WMT will begin with buying the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle (“LDV”), which is likely to hit the road in 2023. However, Walmart and Canoo intend to undertake advanced deliveries to enhance and confirm vehicle configuration in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in the coming weeks.

Canoo is a high-tech advanced mobility company and its LDV is an all-American commercial electric vehicle (“EV”), which is perfectly suited for sustainable last-mile delivery. The LDV is designed for increased-frequency stop-and-go deliveries and fast vehicle to door drop-off, including food/meal and grocery delivery. Its interiors are engineered for small package delivery at reasonable rates.

Canoo’s EVs will be driven by Walmart workers and utilized to fulfill online orders, ranging from general merchandise to groceries. It also has the potential to be used for Walmart GoLocal, which is the company’s delivery-as-a-service business. This is likely to help Walmart up its delivery game.
Walmart Focused on Strengthening Delivery Services
Walmart has taken robust strides to strengthen its delivery arm, evident from its expansion of the InHome delivery service, investments in DroneUp, a pilot with HomeValet, the introduction of Carrier Pickup by FedEx, the launch of the Walmart+ membership program, drone delivery pilots in the United States with Flytrex and Zipline and a pilot with Cruise to test grocery delivery through self-driven all-electric cars.

Walmart also unveiled an alliance with DoorDash in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 to deliver prescriptions from the pharmacies of Sam’s Club alongside expanding Scan & Go to all fuel stations at U.S. Sam’s Clubs. Before this, WMT unveiled Express Delivery and joined forces with Point Pickup, Roadie and Postmates alongside acquiring Parcel to enhance its delivery service.

Wrapping Up
The industry is currently grappling with supply-chain bottlenecks, and Walmart is not fully immune to these headwinds. The gross margin at Walmart U.S. fell 38 basis points (bps) in the first quarter due to an adverse product mix, high supply-chain costs and increased markdowns. Most of the decline was due to supply-chain, fuel and e-commerce fulfillment expenses. Overall, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s consolidated gross profit margin contracted by 87 bps, primarily due to Sam’s Club, wherein the gross margin fell 219 bps. This was attributable to supply-chain costs, a fuel mix, inflation and markdowns stemming from the delayed inventory. Management expects the gross margin to remain under pressure in the second quarter, though it is likely to improve sequentially.

Shares of the company have declined 20.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s drop of 19.9%. However, moves like the abovementioned tie-up with Canoo are likely to bolster Walmart’s delivery services and boost its e-commerce sales.
Solid Retail Bets
Here are some better-ranked stocks – Dollar Tree DLTR and Kroger KR.

Dollar Tree, a discount variety retail store operator, sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has an expected earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 15.5% for three to five years. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Shares of this Harrisburg, PA-based company have exhibited a decent run on the bourses in the past three months. In the said period, the stock has risen 31.8% against the industry’s decline of 7.9%.
Let’s Introspect
Ollie's Bargain’s focus on value-driven merchandise assortments positioned it well to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace and effectively meet consumer demand. Ollie's Army continued to be a major sales driver, with membership increasing continuously. In first-quarter fiscal 2022, Ollie's Army grew 7.7%, ending the period with more than 12.9 million active members.

On its first-quarterearnings call management highlighted that sales trends have improved substantially in the second quarter, driven by higher demand for warm weather seasonal products coupled with great deals and a healthy inventory position. Management envisions second-quarter total net sales in the bracket of $450-$460 million, up from $415.9 million reported in the year-ago period. It envisions comparable store sales to be flat to up 3%. The company had registered a comparable store sales decline of 28% in second-quarter fiscal 2021.

Fact Checks
Ollie's Bargain’s results are dependent on the availability of the brand name and closeout merchandise at compelling prices. Brand name and closeout merchandise represented about 65%, and non-closeout goods and private label products collectively accounted for roughly 35% of fiscal 2021 merchandise purchases.

As far as the company’s store growth strategy is concerned, management aims for a store count of at least 1,050 in the long run. Ollie's Bargain has increased its store base at a CAGR of 12.6%, from 268 stores in fiscal 2017 to 431 stores in fiscal 2021. We note that the company has opened 42 stores in fiscal 2019 and 46 stores in both fiscal 2020 and 2021. The company intends to open 46-48 new stores, including two relocations, in fiscal 2022.

Taking a cue from the past, we noticed that net sales have surged at a CAGR of 13% from $1.077 billion in fiscal 2017 to $1.753 billion in fiscal 2021, while net income has soared from $127.6 million to $157.5 million during the aforementioned period.
Wrapping Up
Quite apparent, Ollie's Bargain strategic endeavors position the stock firmly for growth. While the company faces supply chain headwinds and high labor costs, we believe that improved closeout opportunities, increased trade down from consumers and significant room for increasing store count should support the stock.

Ollie's Bargain currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Growth Catalysts

During the fiscal first quarter, the company benefitted from the launch of its Late Night Happy Hour initiative - including a series of D&B Night with custom content and daily takeovers (featuring club mixes). Positive customer feedback was witnessed as walk-in comp sales (in the late night segment) increased quarter over quarter and 9% from 2019 levels. Also, the company stated benefits from the rollout of eat and play combo, thereby leading to sequential comps improvement in both food and beverage.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company initiated a partnership with UFC and WWE to unveil their pay-per-view events to the D&B locations across North America. The association with WWE enables the company to launch SummerSlam in July 2022. Also, the company emphasized on the addition of Main Event to the Dave & Buster’s team. The company anticipates achieving nearly $20 million in synergies within the first two years, backed by store support center alliance and supply-chain competency. It expects the acquisition to be accretive both from an earnings and growth perspective.

The company believes it can drive traffic by enhancing in-store and out-of-store customer experience via digital and mobile strategic initiatives and the deployment of better technology. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company reported progress with respect to developing its new website. Scheduled to launch during third-quarter fiscal 2022, the application will likely feature special event capabilities, e-commerce and programming content. The company intends to leverage its growing loyalty database and continue to invest in other mobile applications to build customer connections and drive frequent customer visitation.

So far this year, shares of Dave & Buster's have declined 16.2% compared with the industry’s 18.2% fall.
Concerns
The company has been continuously shouldering increased expenses, which have been detrimental to margins. The rise in labor and commodity cost continues to hurt the company. The industry players expect to witness higher costs due to labor and supply chain shortages for quite some time. The company has been witnessing labor challenges in a handful of markets. At the end of first-quarter fiscal 2022, total operating expenses were $352.4 million, up from $228.3 million reported in the prior-year quarter.

During the fiscal first quarter, the company reported softness in the Special Events business. Despite of sequential improvements during the quarter, the Special Events business were down 34.6% from 2019 levels. The company stated that Special Event comparable-store sales (during the first five weeks of second-quarter fiscal 2022) slumped 27.9% from 2019 levels.

2022-07-11 00:00:00+00:00,The TJX Companies' (TJX) Marmaxx Unit Aids Amid Rising Costs,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-tjx-companies-tjx-marmaxx-unit-aids-amid-rising-costs,,,"Strength in the Marmaxx division has been aiding The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX. The leading off-price retailer is undertaking marketing strategies to fuel growth. Also, its initiatives to enhance offline and online businesses are noteworthy. That being said, The TJX Companies is battling escalated freight costs for a while now.

Let’s delve deeper.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Strength in Marmaxx Unit
During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, The TJX Companies’ Marmaxx (U.S.) division delivered net sales of $6,872 million, up from $6,640 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Comp-store sales rose 3% in Marmaxx, the company’s largest division. The upside was driven by increased customer traffic, up low single digits. Comp sales also gained from Marmaxx’s overall apparel business, which rose 6%. During the quarter, the company witnessed a rise in Marmaxx’s average basket led by increased average tickets stemming from pricing initiatives and apparel sales forming a higher percentage of the mix.
What Else is Working Well for The TJX Companies?
The TJX Companies remains committed to boosting growth through effective marketing initiatives and loyalty programs. Incidentally, its aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums have been adding growth. In its lastearnings call management highlighted that it is sharpening marketing messages in outlets to emphasize on value leadership to consumers. The company strategically targets pockets of opportunity in specific geographies to boost the messaging. It is on track to attract new shoppers of every age, including a large number of Gen Z and millennial shoppers, to fuel growth. Also, the company’s treasure hunt shopping experience is gaining traction among shoppers.

The TJX Companies has been benefiting from its solid store and e-commerce growth efforts. The company has been expanding its footprint fast in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia. During first-quarter fiscal 2023, the company increased its store count by 26 to reach 4,715 stores. It increased square footage by 0.4% year over year during this time. In its lastearnings call management highlighted that it witnessed solid demand for an in-person shopping experience in the last few years. Its flexible buying supply chain and store formats aid the company in opening stores across a wide customer demographic.

With an increasing number of consumers resorting to online shopping, The TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen its e-commerce business. Management is optimistic about its capabilities to provide fresh merchandise to its stores and online during the summer season.
High Costs: A Hurdle
The TJX Companies is grappling with increased freight costs. The company’s merchandise margin was hurt by incremental freight pressure in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2023, management is projecting 150-160 basis points incremental freight expense. Apart from this, The TJX Companies is battling higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for a while now. During the fiscal first quarter, the company’s SG&A expenses came in at $2,094.6 million, up from $2,065 million reported in the year-ago quarter.

That said, we believe that the aforementioned upsides will likely help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company stay afloat amid such hurdles.

Although TSN’s stock has decreased 6.2% in the past three months, it has outpaced the industry’s 15% decline.

2022-07-10 00:00:00+00:00,3 Red-Hot Stocks That Could Continue to Beat the Market,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-red-hot-stocks-that-could-continue-to-beat-the-market-2,,,"Many stocks crumbled this year as inflation, rising interest rates, and other macro headwinds drove investors toward more conservative investments. As a result, it's been difficult to find stocks that can consistently stay ahead of the S&P 500 and generate positive returns.
But if we look back further at the past 10 years, we'll find some well-known stocks that have consistently beaten the market -- and could continue to do so over the next decade. Let's take a look at three stocks which fit that profile: Hermès International (OTC: HESAY), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST), and Dollar General (NYSE: DG).
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Hermès International
Hermès is both a growth play and a recession-resistant investment. Between 2011 and 2021, the French luxury house's revenue rose from 2.84 billion euros to 8.98 billion euros ($9.06 billion), representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%. Its net income also grew at a CAGR of 15%, from 594 million euros to 2.45 billion euros ($2.48 billion).
Hermès continued to flourish, regardless of the macroeconomic conditions, because it mainly served affluent customers who were well-insulated from economic downturns. It also manufactures most of its products in small workshops in France instead of mass-producing them overseas. That approach shields it from supply chain disruptions and reinforces its luxury appeal with a sense of brand-building craftsmanship and scarcity.
Over the past ten years, Hermès' stock soared nearly 300% as the S&P 500 advanced about 190%. The stock isn't cheap right now at 42 times forward earnings, but I believe Hermès' stock will continue to command a premium valuation if a recession starts since its core customers will continue to purchase its pricey leather goods, accessories, watches, perfume, and beauty products as less affluent customers rein in their spending.
2. Costco Wholesale
Costco is another evergreen stock that provides both long-term growth and plenty of downside protection during a recession. Costco's approach is simple: It sells cheaper products in bulk, locks in its shoppers with sticky annual subscriptions, and continues to open new stores in the U.S. and overseas.
Between fiscal 2011 and 2021, which ended last August, Costco's revenue rose from $87.1 billion to $192.1 billion, at a CAGR of 8%. Its net income -- which primarily comes from its higher-margin membership fees -- increased at a CAGR of 13%, from $1.46 billion to $5.01 billion.
Costco ended its latest quarter with 830 warehouse stores worldwide, compared to 592 locations at the end of fiscal 2011, making it one of the few retailers that continuously expanded its brick-and-mortar presence over the past decade as other retailers shuttered their stores to cut costs.
Costco fared well throughout the pandemic as shoppers stocked up on more packaged foods and household products, and it will likely remain a top shopping destination as inflation drives consumers to buy more products in bulk. Costco's stock has already rallied about 430% over the past 10 years -- and it certainly isn't cheap at 34 times forward earnings -- but I believe it will continue to beat the market for years to come.
3. Dollar General
Dollar General is one of the largest ""dollar store"" chains in the U.S. It doesn't sell everything for a dollar anymore, but it still sells most of its products at lower prices than Amazon or Walmart. Unlike its rival Dollar Tree, which mainly serves urban and suburban areas, Dollar General primarily targets rural areas, which are underserved by larger retailers.
Dollar General's business model is simple, and revenue has steadily grown from $14.8 billion in 2011 to $34.2 billion in 2021, representing a CAGR of 9%. Net income rose at a 12% rate from $767 million to $2.4 billion.
Like Costco, Dollar General also continued to open new stores as other brick-and-mortar retailers retreated. It ended its latest quarter with 18,356 locations across the U.S., compared to just 9,937 at the end of 2011.
Dollar General is also well-insulated from macro headwinds because it attracts bargain-seeking shoppers during economic downturns. That's why its stock has outperformed the market over the past 10 years with a stunning gain of nearly 430%. The stock trades at just 21 times forward earnings today, and it could still have plenty of room to run in both future bear and bull markets.

2022-07-08 00:00:00+00:00,Costco's (COST) Impressive Sales & Comps Run Continues in June,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/costcos-cost-impressive-sales-comps-run-continues-in-june,,,"Costco Wholesale Corporation COST has time and again proved its mettle. The company has weathered multiple market gyrations and still delivered returns to investors. Strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives and emphasis on memberships have been the discount retailer’s primary strengths. These have helped post consistent sales growth.
Impressive Sales Trend
Costco’s growth strategies, better price management, decent membership trends and increasing penetration of e-commerce business have been contributing to its upbeat performance. Amid the surging inflation, low-to-middle income consumers prefer discount stores to meet their day-to-day needs. Cumulatively, these have been aiding this Issaquah, WA-based company in registering impressive sales numbers.

Costco’s net sales increased 20.4% to $22.78 billion for the retail month of June, the five-week period ended Jul 3, 2022, from $18.92 billion last year. This followed an increase of 16.9% in May and 13.9% in April.

Management informed that owing to the timing of Independence Day this year’s June retail month had one extra shopping day in the United States compared with the last year. This contributed 2% to overall sales and comparable sales as well as 3% to U.S. sales and comparable sales.

2022-07-08 00:00:00+00:00,"Impressive Comps Growth Aid Chipotle (CMG), Inflation Hurts",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/impressive-comps-growth-aid-chipotle-cmg-inflation-hurts,,,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG benefits from impressive comps performance, digitalization and expansion efforts. However, high inflation is hurting the company. In the past year, the company’s shares have declined 15.2% compared with the industry’s fall of 18.8%. Let’s delve deeper.
Growth Drivers
Impressive comps performance continues to drive growth. Despite the pandemic, the company reported comps growth for the seventh quarter. During the first quarter, comparable restaurant sales increased 9% year over year, following growth of 15.2% (in fourth-quarter 2021), 15.1% (third-quarter 2021), 31.2% (second-quarter 2021), 17.2% (first-quarter 2021) and 5.7% (fourth-quarter 2020). Consistent strength in digital sales, solid recovery of in-restaurant sales and positive customer reception to new menu items contributed to the company’s results. For 2022, the company expects comps growth in the range of 10-12%.

The company is also focusing on Chipotlane expansion. During the fourth, third and second quarters of 2021, Chipotle opened 78, 41 and 56 new restaurants, out of which 67, 36 and 45 had Chipotlane, respectively. During first-quarter 2022, Chipotle opened 51 new restaurants, including 42 Chipotlanes. The addition of Chipotlanes enhanced customer access and convenience and bolstered new store restaurant sales, margins and returns. It continues to expand its digital drive with Chipotlanes. The company has opened a digital-only kitchen as well.

Backed by impressive unit economics and the success of small-town locations, the company anticipates operating more than 7,000 restaurants over the long term in North America. CMG emphasized building a real estate pipeline with more than 80% of the restaurants having Chipotlane. The company anticipates an annual unit growth rate of 8-10%.

Moreover, partnerships with Uber Eats and Grubhub are attracting new customers. The company has also expanded digital capabilities into Canada. Moreover, collaboration with all the major third-party delivery aggregators has increased orders. To boost convenience in the digital ordering platform, the company has also initiated features such as unlimited customization, contactless delivery and group orders. The company is also focused on robotics-based autonomous vehicles for delivery, which will likely enhance the customer experience in the upcoming periods. Digital sales contributed 41.9% to sales during the during first-quarter 2022. The company witnessed a rise in order-ahead transactions, courtesy of enhanced guest access and convenience. This and with Chipotlanes’ add-ons drove the company’s performance.

Hurdles to Cross
The company, like other industry players, has been facing significant supply chain challenges and inflation across most commodities and categories. During first-quarter 2022, food, beverage and packaging costs, as a percentage of revenues, increased 100 basis points (bps) year over year to 31%. The upside was primarily driven by a rise in beef, paper and avocado costs. However, this was partially offset by benefits from menu price increases. Labor costs (as a percentage of revenues) during the quarter came in at 26.3%, reflecting an increase of about 140 basis points from the last year. This increase was driven by its strategy to bolster average nationwide wages to $15 per hour. For second-quarter 2022, the company anticipates labor costs to be in the mid-24% range on account of leverage from menu price increases and seasonally higher sales.

FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.
What if you'd invested in Dollar Tree (DLTR) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to DLTR for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?
Dollar Tree's Business In-Depth
With that in mind, let's take a look at Dollar Tree's main business drivers.
Founded in 1986 and headquartered in Chesapeake, VA, Dollar Tree Inc. is an operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise and other assortments. Its stores successfully operate in major metropolitan areas, mid-sized cities and small towns. The company offers a wide range of quality everyday general merchandise in many categories, including housewares, seasonal goods, candy and food, toys, health and beauty care, gifts, party goods, stationery, books, personal accessories, and other consumer items. Its stores are supported by a nationwide logistics network and distribution centers.

Dollar Tree also owns an e-commerce platform – DollarTree.com – which sells its merchandise in bulk to individuals and small businesses as well as organizations. Through its online platform, the company advertises its in-store events and showcases its special and seasonal promotions for featured products. Further, it acquired Family Dollar Stores, Inc. on July 6, 2015.

The company operates in two reporting business segments: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.

Dollar Tree: Being the major operator of discount variety stores, this segment offers merchandise at the fixed price point of $1.00. The segment has nearly 7,652 stores operating under the Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree Canada banners, 12 distribution centers in the United States and two in Canada. Dollar Tree stores primarily range from 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet.

Family Dollar: This segment operates general merchandise discount retail stores with competitively-priced merchandise in the neighborhood stores. It has nearly 7,827 stores, which sell merchandise at prices ranging from $1.00 to $10.00. These stores primarily range from 6,000 - 8,000 selling square feet. The segment includes store operations under the Family Dollar brand and 11 distribution centers.   
As of Jan 29, 2022, the company operated 16,077 stores in 48 states and five Canada provinces.
Bottom Line
While anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Dollar Tree ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.
A $1000 investment made in July 2012 would be worth $3,109.04, or a gain of 210.90%, as of July 8, 2022, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.
Compare this to the S&P 500's rally of 188.08% and gold's return of 5.54% over the same time frame.
Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for DLTR.
Shares of Dollar Tree have outpaced the industry in the past year on robust earnings surprise trend, which continued in first-quarter fiscal 2022. The company reported 10th startight quarter of earnings beat in the quarter. The also top line beat estimates and improved year over year. Results benefited from the completion of the $1.25 multi-price point initiative at the Dollar Tree stores, as well as robust margins, despite the increase in freight costs and SG&A expenses. Following the robust first-quarter fiscal 2022 performance, Dollar Tree raised its guidance for fiscal 2022 and provided a decent second quarter view. However, the company witnessed soft sales and comps, along with margin declines, for the Family Dollar banner in the fiscal first quarter. Higher freight and supply-chain disruptions are likely to persist in fiscal 2022.
The stock has jumped 5.59% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 9 higher, for fiscal 2022; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.

2022-07-07 00:00:00+00:00,WEN or JACK: Which Stock is Better Placed at the Moment?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wen-or-jack%3A-which-stock-is-better-placed-at-the-moment,,,"The restaurant industry is gradually getting back on track, courtesy of pent-up demand for dine-in experience and robust off-premise sales. However, high inflation, increased cost of employee wages and other operating costs such as rent continue to hurt the industry. Although traffic has been increasing, it is still below the pre-pandemic level.

Restaurant operators' focus on digital innovation, sales-building initiatives and cost savings efforts has been acting as a catalyst. With the growing influence of the Internet, digital innovation has become the need of the hour. Restaurant operators constantly partner with delivery channels and digital platforms to drive incremental sales. Partnerships with delivery channels like DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates and Uber Eats and the rollout of self-service kiosks and loyalty programs continue to drive growth.

In line with the industry's growth, leading restaurant companies — The Wendy's Company WEN and Jack in the Box Inc. JACK — are trying out different strategies to generate profits. With both the companies carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), let's analyze and find out which is poised better with respect to different parameters.
Price Performance and Valuation
Shares of Wendy's have declined 13.5% in the past year, while Jack in the Box stock has plunged 45%.

Based on the forward 12-month P/E ratio, which is a commonly-used multiple for valuing restaurant stocks, the industry is currently trading at 23.3X compared with the S&P 500’s 16.43X. Jack in the Box has an edge with a lower forward 12-month P/E ratio of 8.71 compared with Wendy's figure of 21.42X.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Estimated Earnings & Revenues
Arguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance in determining a stock's potential as surging profit levels indicate strong prospects (and stock price gains).

For the current year, Wendy's earnings per share are expected to remain flat year over year. Year-over-year sales growth for the current year is expected at 9.9%. Jack in the Box’s current-year earnings are likely to decline 17.8% year over year, while sales are likely to improve 26.6% year over year. Hence, this round goes to Wendy's.
Fundamentals
Wendy’s continues to focus on Breakfast daypart Offerings to drive incremental sales. In first-quarter 2022, breakfast accounted for nearly 7% of sales. The company is benefiting from its marketing efforts, high-quality offerings, repeat ordering and high customer satisfaction levels. In 2021, the company’s breakfast business surged 25%. The company expects the breakfast business in the United States to accelerate in 2022 by roughly 10% to 20%. By the end of 2022, it anticipates average weekly U.S. breakfast sales to be $3,000-$3,500 per restaurant.

Wendy’s continues to impress investors with robust global same-restaurant sales growth. After posting global same-restaurant sales growth of 4.3% and 4.7% in third- and fourth-quarter 2020, respectively, the company reported global restaurants comps sales improvement of 13% and 17.4% in first- and second-quarter fiscal 2021. During the fiscal third and fourth quarter, comps at Global restaurants increased 3.3% and 7.3%, respectively, year over year. The uptrend continued in first-quarter 2022, with global comps rising 2.4% year over year. The improvement was driven by continued strength across its U.S. and international businesses. During the quarter under discussion, comps in the United States witnessed growth of 1.1% year over year. The upside was driven by growth in breakfast and digital businesses. Same-restaurant sales at international restaurants (excluding Venezuela and Argentina) rose 14.1% year over year. For 2022, the company now anticipates global system-wide sales growth to be 6-8%.

Jack in the Box is also increasingly focusing on delivery channels, which is a growing area for the industry. Given the high demand for this service, the company has undertaken third-party delivery channels to bolster transactions and sales. The company partnered with DoorDash, Postmates, Grubhub and Uber Eats.

On Mar 8, 2022, the company completed its previously announced acquisition of Del Taco Restaurants for approximately $585 million. The move is in sync with its strategy of expanding the customer base. Del Taco, which has nearly 600 restaurants, serves more than three million guests every week. Following the deal, the companies have more than 2,800 restaurants in 25 states with similar guest profiles, menu offerings and company cultures. It is worth mentioning that 99% of the Del Taco restaurants have a drive-thru, which helps the company in achieving robust off-premise sales. The acquisition will enable Jack in the Box to tap the robust Mexican QSR category, where Del Taco is a major brand with a track record of steady performance.
Our Take

2022-07-07 00:00:00+00:00,DLTR Crosses Above Average Analyst Target,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dltr-crosses-above-average-analyst-target-0,,,"In recent trading, shares of Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $165.27, changing hands for $165.79/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 15 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Dollar Tree Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $115.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $200.00. The standard deviation is $27.952.
But the whole reason to look at the average DLTR price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with DLTR crossing above that average target price of $165.27/share, investors in DLTR have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $165.27 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Dollar Tree Inc:
