This video was recorded on Feb. 4, 2022.
Chris Hill: This is one of those weeks when stocks were setting records for rising and falling. Which is why we're glad we're not short-term traders. We're investors. Motley Fool Money starts now.
It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Chris Hill, and I am joined by Motley Fool Senior Analyst Emily Flippen and Jason Moser. Good to see you both.
Jason Moser: Hey.
Emily Flippen: Chris.
Chris Hill: It's earnings-palooza, we have so much to talk about. We don't even have time for guest this week, but we do have a couple of stocks on our radar. Before we get to the earnings, I think we should start with just how bonkers the market has been lately. By that I mean, some of the whipsaw movements of well-known businesses. A few examples, last week Netflix had its biggest drop in a decade. This week, Snap had its biggest gain ever. PayPal and Facebook had their biggest drops ever, and we will get to Amazon's huge day in a minute. But Jason, we also had a huge jobs report for December that came with a big revision upwards for November. I am so glad I'm a long-term investor because the short-term can just be really confusing at times like this.
Jason Moser: Yeah, I think that's probably the best word confusing. It's a lot of information at once and it seems very contradictory at times. I think to me these are the strategies that really reiterate why we invest the way that we do here. We live in a world of headline-driven markets. They move on the daily and predicting what's going to happen it's flipping a coin I think. If you want to gamble, that's great. Open a FanDuel account and have at it. At least you go in there with the understanding that you're gambling. We are investors obviously, and the stock market is the greatest wealth-generating machine in the world. Now with that said, it rarely, and I mean rarely operates on our desired individual timelines. I think the longer you do it, the more apparent that becomes. For me, it takes me back to this is why we invest the way we do.
Emily Flippen: It really is just volatility being the name of the game right now. I wanted to circle back around to that jobs report because not that I can do any better, but this was such a large miss estimation that it reminds me just how much I dislike economic forecasting, [laughs] at least weather forecasting. I know there's barometers or Doppler radars behind what they predict. But sometimes I feel like economists are just doing the weather person equivalent of licking their fingers and holding it up to the air and it feels like that's what we saw this month. [laughs]
Chris Hill: Let's get it to Amazon's 4th quarter profits being driven by AWS. No surprise there Jason. The advertising division is now so big that Amazon is actually disclosing the number. As we talked about on this show two weeks ago, Amazon announced it will increase the price of its Prime membership to $139, and all of that combined to a big day on Friday for the stock.
Jason Moser: Yeah. It was a big day, it seems for a long time on this show, every earnings season we just say, ""Well, nothing to see here. It's the same old, great Amazon."" I will say, I think we can actually call this quarter a mixed bag. I think mostly it was really good. There are some things I think to keep an eye on though now, we've looked at the numbers, you will get the actual sales numbers there. This was a bit of an attention-getter. Sales up excluding currency, sales grew just 10 percent. For a business that's just routinely chalking up 20-plus percent growth. That to me, it's a little bit curious, I guess. Granted we're operating in unique times, but operating income got cut in half to three-and-a-half billion dollars for the quarter. Net income of $14.3 billion sounds like a really great number, but it is worth remembering that includes a pre-tax valuation gain of $11.8 billion from their investment in Rivian Automotive. Rivian, we know, just went public. This is an electric vehicle company that makes no money. Literally, they are just starting to generate revenues. You've got to take that with a grain of salt, I think as well. When you look at the retail operations, really the core Amazon business retail operations across the board both chalked up. They chalked up operating losses, the US and international. International sales were actually down a tick. Back to your point on AWS, clearly a bright spot. Sales grew 40 percent, operating income, 49 percent. A nice little $31 billion advertising business now, right Chris? Twitter, what? Snap who? Raising the price of Prime to $139 per year, the monthly costs will go up two dollars a month. I don't know why you'd pay for the monthly cost. Anyway, that equates to $180 a year. Just up for the full year, Chris, come on. Everybody just up for the full year, do us a favor. Mix bag, I think, but all-in-all more good than bad.
Chris Hill: Let's get to the timing of the increase. Because I said two weeks ago on the show, they're going to raise the price of Prime this year. I'm actually surprised they raised it this quarter and I'm wondering if you think they might have pulled the trigger now as opposed to later in the year because of the revenue softness that you referred to.
Jason Moser: Perhaps. I think also it's probably a good time to bump that price up now because everybody is bumping prices up. Inflation is top-of-mind for everyone. If they wait 6-9 months, perhaps 12-months to do this when inflation isn't necessarily the forefront of the conversation, maybe that's something that consumers push back on a little bit. But I think right now it's something that people can understand a little bit more because prices are being pushed up everywhere we look.
Chris Hill: Alphabet announced a 20-for-1 stock split, which somehow overshadowed the fact that Alphabet's 4th quarter results were strong across the board. Not surprisingly, Emily, Google Search leading the way.
Emily Flippen: A really amazing quarter for Alphabet, they handedly beat expectations on their bottom line by over 10 percent. Revenue also beat expectations. But all anybody wants to talk about is this stock split. [laughs] At 20-for-1 stock split, which effectively decreases the average price per share to buy a single share of Alphabet. As we all hopefully know, this fundamentally changes nothing for investors in Alphabet. A stock split does nothing except for makes the average price of the share lower. In practice, we see a lot of retail investors often associate the price of a share with valuation, which is to say they see a lower-priced stock to be perceived as cheaper. There may be increased buying from retail investors as a result of this split, we saw this happen with other businesses like Tesla, although there's lots of other factors and play with Tesla as well. Stock split aside, this was an amazing quarter for Alphabet. The weird downside here was actually YouTube ad revenue. This is interesting because as Jason just mentioned, we're looking at Amazon come out with this $31 billion a year at business, while Alphabet has a $61 billion a year ad business. Around doubled what Amazon is experiencing, so smaller I think when you compare it than expectations with something like Amazon. Seeing the weakness come from YouTube ad revenue just makes us all realize how much competition there is for our eyes and entertainment space right now.
Chris Hill: As I mentioned at the top, Facebook, sorry, Meta platforms had its worst day ever. Shares fell 25 percent on Thursday after the company's 4th quarter results reflected what CEO Mark Zuckerberg called an unprecedented level of competition. Part of that Jason is Apple's change to its operating systems, privacy settings that is clearly taking its toll on Facebook's advertising revenue.
Jason Moser: I think you called it Facebook on-purpose, Chris, I don't think that was a slip. [laughs]
Chris Hill: Look, I'm still getting used to it. It took me a full year, if not longer, to get used to Alphabet instead of referring to it as Google. Apologies to the dozens of listeners and I beg for their patience.
Jason Moser: Yeah, and don't even get me started on Block. Let's get back to Facebook, I mean Meta. This is a breathtaking sell-off. I think it took us all by surprise considering the scale of this business, but when you look at the numbers, I think it actually makes some sense. Much like PayPal, this is not a business that's been troubled. We'll talk about PayPal in a little bit, but they've got some work to do here and there's some material risks going forward given this pivot toward the metaverse. When we look at the actual numbers they recorded for the quarter, not all that bad. Revenue up 20 percent for the quarter you compare that to something like Alphabet, 33-34 percent growth. I think you can at least get a better idea of who is winning that race. It's something where Facebook is starting to witness some headwinds there in their model, operating margin fell nine percentage points. Expenses well-outpaced revenue growth at 38 percent. Earnings-per-share down five percent, but it's worth noting actually net income was down eight percent. There's a little bit of a share repurchase effect going on there. Favorable one-two punch there on guidance. I think you've got macro concerns. You got inflation impacting advertising budgets, the new iOS standards that you mentioned as well. They're going to impact the top line of this business to the tune of about $10 billion this year in 2022. The revenue guide of $27-$29 billion was just well below expectations. We know how that goes, the market is going to reprice based on that new set of expectations. But I think looking further out the bigger risk, I think for Meta, and this is going to be something that won't be apparent immediately, they're going to be spending a ton of money on this metaverse investment. Whatever the metaverse may be, Meta is aiming to play a big role in it. They are going to spend tens of billions of dollars on this. If this doesn't pay off the way they think it might, or they think it will, that's going to be a big problem for this business. The tough part for investors here is really understanding that these investments in the metaverse really that's not going to be like flipping a switch either, that's going to be something that just becomes more apparent over time. I think it's fair to say that as much successes Facebook has had, as Meta has had in the social media space, replicating that in the metaverse. I think it's going to be a tougher ask. I think investors are starting to take stuff like that into consideration.
Chris Hill: Coming up right after the break, we've got the poster child for this week's craziness. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here with Jason Moser and Emily Flippen. We don't obsess over short term stock movements, but no business provides a better example of the whipsaw movements we discussed earlier in the show than Snap. A parent company of Snapchat saw its stock fall 25 percent on Thursday, then Snap reported its first ever quarterly net profit and shares on Friday rose 50 percent. Emily, please help me focus on the actual business here.
Emily Flippen: Well, who knew that a social media platform that I exclusively used to take photos of my cat and send it to my mom [laughs] was so monetizable. I say this a little sarcastically because I think part of what we're seeing here is a story of low expectations. The poor earnings reports from other platforms earlier in the week certainly set up expectations, as you mentioned, heading into this earnings reports that were extremely low. When Snapchat came out and said, ""Hey, no we're actually doing pretty well,"" the market was just stunned, and that's a bit of what we're seeing here. But revenue was still up 64 percent year over year, which is incredible and the daily average users, I think is even more impressive, grew 20 percent, to almost 320 million globally. Now it's important to remember that Snapchat is really only monetizing those across North America and Europe, but they see an opportunity to expand monetization across the globe. Really was again, a power of those low expectations for this platform. We talked about Meta or Facebook, whatever you want to call it, they broke down these massive headwinds thanks to Apple's privacy changes and expectations were for Snapchat to say, ""Hey, our guidance is also hit because of this."" But adding into that, we're seeing Snapchat actually come out and say, no, our ad transitions are better because we handle privacy with our ad targeting products a bit more consciously. I think they said something along the lines of, ""Our products are built with privacy in mind."" So we'll see if those realities come to fruition when they continue to report in future quarters. But for the time being, Snapchat is doing pretty well for itself.
Chris Hill: The main story of PayPal's business for the past year has been the company's transition away from eBay as a payment platform. PayPal's 4th quarter results reflected how hard that transition has been. Jason, I think you and I both like the job that Dan Schulman has done in the eight years he's been running PayPal. But I also think, you and I agree, he really hasn't done a great job of communicating this.
Jason Moser: Chris, how the tables have turned, instead of the war on cash, it looks like we've got a war on PayPal instead. I say this as a PayPal shareholder of many years, PayPal 100 percent deserve the butt kicking it got this week. No, the businesses isn't in trouble but we heard three words in the call that we don't like to hear, transformation, investment, and pivot. I think this all goes back to what you said at the top there, leadership really dropped the ball on communicating here. Now, it's not all bad. Let's focus on the good news here because the quarterly numbers were good. If you look at the total payment volume, $340 billion, that was up 23 percent from a year ago and they push through $3.2 billion of buy now pay later total payment volume as well. That's now operating on a $13 billion run rate. So not bad for essentially what is a homegrown offering for them. Venmo processed $60.6 billion in total payment volume up 29 percent. Venmo is now actually helping drive a sequential increase in the overall take rates so total take rate for the quarter was 2.04 percent. That was up from 1.99 percent a quarter ago. But we get to what caused the sell off, what led investors to flee and you've got guidance there for revenue growth of 15-17 percent for the year that was versus an expected 17.9 percent. It's ultimately going to result though, in essentially flat earnings growth, which is a problem and I think that really boils down to the user base. PayPal pulled a lot of success forward, they added a lot of users in a short period of time over the past couple of years for obvious reasons. That's starting to normalize a bit. Management now expects to add 15-20 million net new customers in 2022. Further, they no longer believe that the 750 million user target that they set here over the medium term is even really achievable. It'll probably take a little bit longer to get there. For context, they have 426 million actives today. Nothing to sneeze at, but you can see that the forecasting does matter. So they are focusing more on the quality of the users, they are going to be relying less on incentive programs to bring new users in. This matters because the quality of the user matters for PayPal. Of their massive user base really, the majority of the volume comes from about 1/3 of that user base. They put a lot of information out here that should have been put out long ago and that's frustrating. They have put themselves in a little bit of a position here. We're going for these next few quarters. We're just going to need to pay very close attention to what they say and really hold them accountable.
Chris Hill: Pinterest 4th quarter results showed a small drop in global users, but average revenue per user was up 23 percent. Shares of Pinterest bouncing up nicely on Friday, Emily, but like Snap, it seems like there were some low expectations going into this one.
Emily Flippen: I think the words I'd use to describe myself as a Pinterest shareholder after this earnings report is cautiously optimistic. I've said this before but Pinterest has always been a story about monetization, not user growth. As you just mentioned, we saw monetization this quarter up 23 percent, which is what they need. International monetization, international average revenue per user was even better rising 62 percent in the quarter. It lead to helping the business beat on both the top and the bottom lines here. But management is also realizing their backs are against the wall. They can keep users steady, they can lose a bit of users when they have over 430 million monthly active users. That's OK, but they can't hemorrhage users and this is what you saw this quarter. Users declined globally six percent, in the US by 12 percent. Now they blamed some changes in Google's algorithm as a result of this big decline. But they can't be monetizing at an increasing rate while also decreasing engagement. So finding the way to balance both is going to be critical for Pinterest to perform well from here on out.
Chris Hill: With just a few months remove from PayPal reportedly looking to buy Pinterest, how confident are you Pinterest will still be a stand alone company two years from now?
Emily Flippen: I'd say fairly confident. I think Pinterest is underrated as a social media platform. It's become so integral especially in young American females' lives that I think it's being underappreciated in terms of its market opportunity. But the question mark is right now is what is Pinterest going to do to drive engagement from that audience? They already have this massive user base signed up, but now we're having to compete for the time and there's eyes. So making sure that people are routinely coming back to that Pinterest tab is going to be critical. But I think if they're able to do that then Pinterest in my opinion is better as a stand-alone company than as a potential acquisition.
Chris Hill: Up next, we've got the latest on chips, not the tasty kind, the semiconductor kind. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here with Emily Flippen, and Jason Moser. Qualcomm posted strong profits in the first quarter and gave upbeat guidance. Jason, I'm not a shareholder, but for a variety of reasons I would like the semiconductor chip shortage to end and I know that Qualcomm is one of the companies that can help make that happen.
Jason Moser: Yes, I think you're right. It feels like we're already seeing leadership with these chip companies starting to use language that's putting this stuff in the rear view mirror, hopefully, Chris. Hopefully, 2022 shaping up to be better for you there. But you look at Qualcomm itself, this was a really, really strong quarter in a lead-off with just what CEO Cristiano Amon in the release he said, ""We're at the beginning of one of the largest opportunities in our history with our addressable market expanding by more than seven times to approximately $700 billion in the next decade."" Chris, to me, feels like there's an opportunity brewing here. [laughs] Qualcomm is just treading water here over the last year. But you pan further out, this has been a wonderful investment over the last three years up better than 250 percent. I'm starting to see why revenue growth of 30 percent from a year ago resulted in net income growth of 38 percent, and earnings-per-share growth of 41 percent. Again, a little bit of a share repurchase impact there. But it's nice to see that Qualcomm's repurchases are ultimately having an impact on that overall share count. They brought the share count down over 24 percent over the last five years. The QCT business, the chip side of the business, the other side of business is the licensing side. But the QCT business grew operating income by 62 percent on 35 percent revenue growth. They saw strong performance in handsets with revenues up 42 percent from a year ago, they saw strong performance in IoT revenue. That was up 41 percent from a year ago. All-in-all, it feels like this is a business that has a number of different ways to win, so to speak, because it's handsets, it's IoT, it's automotive, it's radiofrequency; it's all of that. Interestingly, and perhaps sadly, Chris, there was only one solitary mention of the word metaverse on the call. But it is something they're very excited about with partnerships with companies out there including Microsoft and Meta. For the second quarter here they are forecasting earnings to come in at $2.90 in the midpoint versus $1.90 a year ago. They're even so much as guiding it at 30 percent earnings-per-share growth for the 3rd quarter as well. It feels like the tailwinds for this business just continue to grow stronger.
Chris Hill: Spotify showed strong growth in the 4th quarter, but guidance for 2022, sent the stock down this week. Emily, let's face it, most companies are not getting the benefit of the doubt from investors right now and the drama surrounding Joe Rogan certainly does not go in the plus column.
Emily Flippen: I described this as a good earnings report that's really being overshadowed by negativity thanks to the way that this platform has become a beacon, I guess, for misinformation and almost like a political fighting ground in some sense. But looking at the quarter itself, it was all good things from Spotify. Revenue grew 24 percent monthly active users, which is a critical metric as we just discovered with Pinterest. That grew 18 percent to over 400 million, so tons of monthly users, and their adjusted net loss was less than half of what was expected this quarter. The actual earnings report itself was great. Now, the challenges around what has been portrayed in the media with Spotify recently, I think, is adding skepticism mostly because of, as you mentioned, controversy surrounding Joe Rogan and the $100 million relationship that Spotify has with Joe Rogan to be the exclusive distributor of that podcast. It's going to be interesting to see how CEO Dan Ek continues to navigate these challenging waters because being a company that is having to deal both with the impact from users, musicians, and even politicians, is not an easy position to be in.
Chris Hill: It's also a sign of just how big and influential a company Apple is, that, Apple isn't making headlines this week, yet all these companies we're talking about are dealing with Apple in one way or another. Facebook is impacted by the changes to the iOS privacy settings. Spotify has a couple of musical artists who say, hey, we don't want to be in your platform anymore. When I opened up iTunes earlier this week, there's Apple Music just promoting these artists. If you get to be big enough, eventually, you're going to have to deal with Apple one way or the other.
Emily Flippen: That's a fair criticism. But in Spotify's defense, they're so large now that they're ubiquitous. I doubt anyone or two departures from any specific artist is going to do a lot to take away those engaged monthly active users. When Spotify hasn't been able to get those exclusive rights to new albums in the past, it hasn't done anything to prevent users from engaging on the platform even when they've been available in other places. I doubt this will be any difference, but I hesitate to say that because we've seen the continued years-long fall out with Meta and its perception from consumers and the government about its relationship with information on its platform. Spotify certainly doesn't want to find itself in the same situation. Again, it all comes down to being proactive and managing it with tech.
Chris Hill: Jason, stop me if you've heard this before. Another strong quarter for Advanced Micro Devices and strong guidance for the new year. [laughs] Lisa Su has been running AMD since 2014 and not only is she one of the best CEOs in America, she is also one of the most under the radar. She's just quietly going about her business. AMD is just, I don't want to say unstoppable, but this business and this stock has just been on fire for years.
Jason Moser: Well, I agree. I think Dr. Su has just been a tremendous asset for this business and shareholders have really benefited all along the way. You look at the five-year chart, stocks up almost 900 percent. I think that, really, things are poised to get better. I think on its own, there are plenty of reasons to like AMD. Over the coming years, as connectivity continues to proliferate, you see investments in Edge, Cloud, and data center, they're all becoming greater opportunities and they're helping AMD continue to branch out. I think the addition of Xilinx should even open up a few more windows of opportunity for the business. We'll talk about that shortly, but let's look at the quarterly numbers because there's a lot to like, like you said, revenue $4.8 billion grew 49 percent from a year ago. Interestingly, you look at non-GAAP alluded earnings-per-share; $0.92 per share. That was up 77 percent from a year ago. Just amazing, the growth this business continues to chalk up. Strengthened enterprise embedded in semi-custom and segment revenue, I think that was something that really stood out. That segment, the revenue of $2.2 billion is up 75 percent from a year ago and they recorded their sixth straight quarter of greater than 45 percent year-over-year revenue growth. You add to that five percentage point increase in the gross margin side as well, which is just, you got to love that. They continue to capitalize on the data center opportunity as we continue to move more toward the Edge and the Cloud. Then, really, I think the icing on the cake for a lot of folks, the Xilinx acquisition is finally cleared hurdles with Chinese regulators. That deal actually should close any day now. That's really going to catapult their overall opportunity even more. It brings in additional tailwinds and 5G, data center, automotive, industrial aerospace, and defense. Xilinx is a higher-margin business as well, so I think there are a lot of reasons why shareholders should be very optimistic about AMD's future.
Chris Hill: Jason, so many businesses depend on semiconductor chips. With the global shortage, rightly so, so many of them for the past year or so have been talking about that impact on their business. But at some point in the future, we're going to get to that place where the shortage does not exist any longer. Don't you think there's going to be at least one company that comes out in their earnings report instead of, ""It was the shortage of chips that really hit us this quarter."" Analysts will have to be like, ""There is no shortage anymore."" [laughs] Like Qualcomm, AMD, all these businesses at some point there's going to be no more shortage and therefore the excuse is gone.
Jason Moser: That's right. At some point you have to go with Alice In Chains' No Excuses and I think that time is still a ways away. The neat thing about the opportunity for these businesses is that as connectivity continues to grow, there are just so many things out there that really require this technology. Chris, I got a Traeger Grill for Christmas that's connected to the Internet, for crying out loud. The possibilities seem endless at this point. But I think you make a great point there too, as optimistic as this space looks right now because of obvious tailwinds, let's remember those tailwinds don't last forever. Just like we saw a lot of success pull forward here over the last couple of years with the pandemic impact, at some point that party ends and things start to normalize a bit, so there will be a point where these chip companies start to normalize a little bit and that'll be something investors need to pay attention to.
Chris Hill: Starbucks' 1st quarter report was a window into how many headwinds the company is facing. From higher costs to staffing challenges, to say nothing of its 2nd largest market, China. Emily, I'm a big fan of the CEO, Kevin Johnson. Even with the hits that the stock has taken recently, am I wrong to be optimistic about Starbucks?
Emily Flippen: Not at all. In fact, I love the comparison here, against chip businesses for Starbucks, if you'll humor me. Because when you ask the average person, which do you think is more cyclical? Demand for which wanes more, is it something like chips or is it something like Starbucks? I think a lot of people will assume that when economic times get tough, businesses like Starbucks are the ones who face the brunt of that, whereas chips continue in demand. Reality, we see a lot more cyclicality with a business like AMD or Qualcomm than we do with Starbucks. It's become such a blue chip bellweather business. Even though they did miss this quarter in terms of earnings and revenue expectations, and really wasn't a complete surprise given the widely publicized challenges with labor, supply chains, and inflation. But even with the miss, Starbucks does what it does best. It had a great, really impressive quarter. Revenue rose nearly 20 percent. Importantly, same-store sales across the globe were up 13 percent. Domestically, those even higher at 18 percent. The demand for coffee here has not changed. Actually, if you look at the change in price for Starbucks' products since just October, Starbucks has risen prices three times, largely to keep up with all those challenges that I mentioned earlier. It really hasn't done a lot to change demand for its products. While they did update their guidance to be slightly more conservative, which is contributing to some of that skepticism we see today. When you look at the actual business performance itself, Starbucks is doing what it does best, which is sell coffee.
Chris Hill: Up next, we've got a business partnership just in time for Valentine's day. We've got a couple of stocks on our radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. Don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here with Emily Flippen and Jason Moser. A couple of things to get to before we get to the stocks on our radar. McCormick reported 4th quarter results last week, and maybe it took investors a few days to digest the results because on Friday, shares of the spice maker hit a new all-time high. Jason, I know this is one of your favorites.
Jason Moser: It is. I am an owner and I've been behind the stock for a long time for a lot of reasons I've stated before, but it was an impressive quarter. They grew sales nine percent organically for the 4th quarter. They are calling for five percent annual growth here for 2022. Again, very encouraging and I think they've made some acquisitions that have really paid off. They now hold the number 1 and 2 spots in the hot sauce market with Frank's and Cholula respectively. Chris, I'm going to tell you something here, over the holiday season, I was working on a recipe OK. I like to grill, I like to barbecue, I like to smoke stuff, but I was working on a recipe over the season and I perfected it. It utilizes a lot of McCormick's stuff too. I call it big daddy's boy howdy mustard sauce. Okay, this is a mustard barbecue sauce. I made it. It's my recipe I'm not going to tell you what it is. But McCormick give me a call because I got a feeling I've got your number 3 shareholder right there.
Chris Hill: Wow. You went in a direction I was not expecting there.
Jason Moser: You listen every week we're going to give you something new.
Chris Hill: Real quick before we move on. The dividend aristocrat status of this business does not appear to be threatened at all.
Jason Moser: I don't think so. It's just such a reliable business and that's why they really take a lot of pride in that. They raise their dividend again to maintain that status, so I suspect that it is a point of pride for leadership that they will not relinquish anytime soon I'd imagine.
Chris Hill: This week DoorDash and Shake Shack, partnered up to create a limited edition dating app called Eat Cute. From now through Valentine's Day, people can go to letseatcute.com, create a dating profile with a photo and share how spicy they like their food. Once they are matched up with a compatible person, they'll receive a promo code for Shake Shack's buffalo chicken sandwich delivered, of course, by DoorDash. Emily, I'm not saying it's cause and effect, but I will say that shares of both these stocks are up since the promotion started on February 3rd.
Emily Flippen: Let me be clear, I love a good gimmick, but there is no way that I could review this story without experiencing it myself and I apologize to my boyfriend, but I did have [laughs] to go make a profile obviously to get my free chicken sandwich. The experience was interesting. They made it very clear the app was not for chatting, it was only for sending sandwiches. I went through, I liked about 100 profiles and nobody liked me back so I don't get my chicken sandwich, I guess. [laughs]
Chris Hill: We just need to get the word out. Maybe once people hear this episode of Motley Fool Money, get some more people on the app. We'll check back with you next week see if you actually get the sandwich.
Emily Flippen: Dare to dream.
Chris Hill: [laughs] Let's get to the stocks on our radar, our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Jason Moser, you're up first, what are you looking at this week?
Jason Moser: Yeah taking a look at Chipotle ticker, CMG, they've had earnings coming out Tuesday, February 8th, and I'm going to be very interested to see how they frame the state of the consumer and inflation. Last quarter, they talked a good bit about it from wage inflation to construction and everywhere in between. But management is exercising patience in regard to this. But there was an interesting quote from last quarter's call, I have to call this out. They said and I quote, ""There is food inflation as we talked about, we don't know how much of this is temporary or transitional versus permanent. But what we do know is we've got what we believe is great value. Our customers continue to appreciate Chipotle. They love the convenience, they love the value."" Here's the kicker Chris. ""And so we believe we've got pricing power really better than almost anybody, if not everybody in the industry."" I think this is going to be really fascinating to see how they frame this, this quarter particularly as an example, we saw Starbucks just start the past month price increases as well. I'm interested, is my burrito bowl getting more expensive, I want to know Chris because you know what, even if it does, I'll still pay it.
Chris Hill: Dan, question about Chipotle?
Dan Boyd: Yeah. Jason, did you know that I'm a Chipotle shareholder? [laughs]
Jason Moser: Well me too Dan, welcome to the club.
Dan Boyd: I bought in 2011 and I'm having a good time as a Chipotle shareholder. I don't know about you.
Jason Moser: You got to be, I've owned those shares for about that same time and you've got to be feeling really good about that call right now.
Dan Boyd: I am.
Chris Hill: I'm also a Chipotle shareholder. Am I the only one confused that they've got this marketing message out there about their plant-based chorizo that they refer to as this is the best chorizo we've ever made. I'm like wait, so it's better than actual chorizo?
Jason Moser: I'll tell you what, I will say my daughter tried that last week or so when we last had Chipotle and she gave me a bite of it. I will say it is very good.
Chris Hill: I'm still confused. Emily, what's on your radar this week?
Emily Flippen: Well, it's going to be hard for me to compete with plant-based chorizo [laughs] which is the best chorizo, but I have a decent cybersecurity company for you. The business name is Tenable the ticker is TENB. They are a cybersecurity firm, I think its underappreciated by the market. Had a really impressive quarter this past week, generated massive 30 percent free cash flow margins. They're getting more traction with enterprise customers with their Tenable IO and Tenable EP solutions. Now, I know that it's an extremely competitive space, but in some sense a rising tide really does lift all boats. When you compare it to the valuations of other cybersecurity firms in the market, I'm thinking mainly about CrowdStrike here, it is much cheaper. I could see it being added as a basket approach to tackling the cybersecurity industry.
Chris Hill: Dan, question about Tenable Holdings?
Dan Boyd: Yeah. Emily, what kind of plant-based meat [laughs] substitute products is Tenable introducing to the market this year?
Emily Flippen: Well they actually force all of their in-house employees to eat at least one plant-based meal a day. However, they do ensure that it's in salad form. So you can take with that what you will. It's not quite Chipotle, can't get your rice, but as long as you're eating your plant-based salad at Tenable you're OK.
Dan Boyd: Wait is that real?
Emily Flippen: No, I'm being 100 percent sarcastic. [laughs]
Chris Hill: I'll just add Dan, Chipotle is not doing anything to keep your network secure.
Dan Boyd: Yeah, I suppose. [laughs] All right. That makes it harder. Hey, I got one bumper sticker on my car and it says, I love Tacos so much. Here we go, I'm taking Chipotle to the moon baby.
Jason Moser: There we go. Hang on to those shares Dan.
Chris Hill: Emily Flippen, Jason Moser. Thanks so much for being here.
Jason Moser: Thank you.
Emily Flippen: Thanks, Chris.

2022-02-28 00:00:00+00:00,Should Investors Set Money Aside for Pending IPOs?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-investors-set-money-aside-for-pending-ipos,,,"In this clip from ""The Future of Fintech"" on Motley Fool Live, recorded on Feb. 10, Motley Fool contributors Matt Frankel, Jason Hall, and Will Healy discuss their IPO approaches and the factors they weigh when deciding to either invest early or wait one year to evaluate the business's financials and management's performance.

{% sfr %}
Matt Frankel: In viewing [Block, Inc.] Square (NYSE: SQ) and its ecosystem, do you ever consider a peer comparison with Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y) or Stripe? Stripe is also considering a 2022 IPO debut, and is this a factor at all in your investing among the three?"" There's a lot to unpack there. For those who don't know, Adyen is a payment processor that primarily focuses on larger companies. I don't view them as a direct competitor to Square in that sense. They're starting to creep into the small and medium-sized business space but not very much, and even mid-sized businesses make up less than 2% of their payment volume. Their customers are like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY), and they were the one that stole eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) account away from PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) as their primary payment processor. I don't set money aside because I think a company is going to go public like Stripe. I don't know about you guys, but I don't set money aside for pending IPOs. I would have to see what their valuation is going to be and what their business looks like because right now we don't know what their growth numbers look like. It could be a terrible investment for all I know. But I don't know, guys, what do you think about the three as investment opportunities and do you allocate less money to one in anticipation of maybe buying into some of the others. What do you think about it?
Jason Hall: One thing I want to say, I don't really think of Adyen as really like a peer to Square. Yeah, on the payments, they are providing the same services. But like Matt said, they are servicing very different cohorts and, also, Adyen is European and it doesn't hold a U.S. bank charter under any of its subsidiaries. There's two different platforms and I think that was the reason Square renamed itself Block. It wanted to differentiate the Square merchant services ecosystem and banking for businesses from what it wants to do on the consumer side. I think that was a differentiation there. It's, again, more of a pure-play. Again, they do target different markets. I haven't studied Adyen's business close enough to really make a comparison, but I agree completely with Matt on Stripe. I started learning to take more of the Danny Vena's school to IPOs, give them a year, let companies go public, give it time, put management in that quarterly spotlight. How do they handle it? Actually learn about their books, learn about the trajectory of their business, their GAAP and non-GAAP reporting, and then it's a little easier to evaluate.
Will Healy: I've been around enough to see a lot of potential IPOs fizzle. I want to see numbers first and we haven't seen that yet. Until we even see numbers, I'm not interested, frankly.
Frankel: I will say, to piggyback on what Jason said about the wait one year plan, my most successful investment of all time, until the recent downturn, was Square, which I bought three days after its IPO. I use the Peter Lynch method of analyzing Square. Invest in what you know. One day, I went to my local artisan market and a year before no one accepted credit cards and, all of a sudden, everyone was accepting credit cards.
Hall: Everybody had a Square terminal.
Frankel: Everyone had a Square terminal and I said, they're really on to something. I bought some shares. It was a small investment at the time, but it became a big position in my portfolio especially when it peaked. I think it was $285 earlier in 2021. But, I don't necessarily wait to buy an IPO. I do want to see the numbers though like Will just said. I want to see, especially with a company like that, Stripe is so consumer-facing in that sense. You're processing your payments through them when you go to buy things. I want to see visible trends of that being picked up more and more, which is really why I bought into Square so soon after its IPO.

2022-02-26 00:00:00+00:00,Active Buyer Losses Are Accelerating at eBay,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/active-buyer-losses-are-accelerating-at-ebay,,,"When the pandemic struck, eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) business got a serious boost. The online auction and e-commerce site saw a surge of new customers and activity on its platform as tens of millions of consumers avoided shopping in person.
Now that conditions are allowing people to return to brick-and-mortar stores more regularly, those pandemic tailwinds are turning into reopening headwinds. One metric where that is particularly apparent is in eBay's active buyer count, which is falling at an accelerating rate.
Image source: Getty Images.
Buyer losses are partly a result of a strategic shift
As of the end of the fourth quarter, eBay boasted 147 million active buyers on a trailing-12-month basis, down 9% from the 162 million it had a year prior. That also was a loss of 5 million active buyers from the previous quarter. Overall, it was the third consecutive quarter of active buyer declines for eBay.
Undoubtedly, the economic reopening is primarily to blame for these losses. Consumers now have more options for places to spend their money and time. As a result, more of them are choosing options other than eBay. But the company's management is not helping in this respect. They appear to now be focused more on high-value buyers instead of on increasing the total number of buyers.
As CFO Stephen Priest explained during eBay's fourth-quarter conference call:
""Starting with active buyers. We ended 2021 with 147 million active buyers on a trailing 12-month basis, representing a 9% year-over-year decline. The expected decrease in active buyers was primarily driven by low-value buyers, which fell 9% versus Q4 of 2019. Growth in high-value buyers over the same period was 3%. Although fewer buyers sold on eBay as compared to pre-pandemic levels, total high-value buyers were up due to growth in high spending and [inaudible]. And importantly, even as mobility restrictions have been lifted, spend for high-value buyers continues to expand at healthy rates.""
The company shifted its focus to higher-value customers by reducing promotional activity. For instance, eBay formerly sent out coupons on a roughly quarterly basis for $15 off a purchase of $75, but it has largely eliminated these types of promotions. Unsurprisingly, that has meant fewer total active buyers. However, it has also meant a dramatic reduction in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue. That metric fell to 20.2% in the fourth quarter, down from 25% a year earlier.
What this could mean for eBay shareholders
The longer-term impacts of this strategic shift to a greater focus on higher-value customers remain to be seen. That said, the near-term results of it appear to be higher earnings derived from lower marketing spending. Adjusted earnings per share were 24% higher in Q4 2021 than in Q4 2020, despite the e-commerce site attracting fewer customers. It could be that some customers cost more to serve than they are worth in terms of revenue and profits.
Indeed, eBay has a decade-long history of a profit focus. In the past 10 years, eBay has grown its revenue at a compound annual rate of 1.2%. Meanwhile, it boosted earnings per share by 19.2% during that time. A more intense focus on the bottom line can be good news for shareholders.

2022-02-25 00:00:00+00:00,Why Right Now Is a Great Time to Buy Your First Crypto,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-right-now-is-a-great-time-to-buy-your-first-crypto,,,"The crypto revolution reminds me of the internet revolution in the late 20th century. It's that big and that important. While many people are focused on the ""currency"" aspects and worry about how crypto assets like Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) will affect the dollar or the euro, that's only one part of our world that's transforming. The major reason you want to make small investments in crypto now is that it's a revolution in internet technology. The old world of massive international megacaps that control our technological future is facing a new challenge -- peer-to-peer networking. It's entirely possible that our internet future will be decentralized. If this happens, you want to make small investments in the blockchain race now, while it's still early.
Why small investments? If you remember the original internet revolution, you know that the vast majority of internet companies either stumbled or went belly up. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) survived and prospered. But major companies like AOL and Yahoo never recovered from the crash in 2000. And a lot of copycats just disappeared altogether.
AMZN data by YCharts
I expect similar things to happen in crypto. It's an important internet revolution. There will be a few massive winners. And many, many coins will disappear into nothingness. That's why you want your initial investments in this industry to be tiny. And if you own the right blockchain, that tiny investment will be worth a fortune in a decade or two.

You want to own the Tier 1 platform that all these peer-to-peer networks will sit on
Right now, the biggest Tier 1 platform in crypto is Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH). Ethereum, like Bitcoin, has already made a lot of people rich.
Ethereum Price data by YCharts
A tremendous number of dApps have been built on the Ethereum chain. The problem is that Ethereum, like Bitcoin, does not scale very well. These early chains relied upon proof of work to validate transactions on their blockchains. That's an incredibly slow mechanism for transactions. (Imagine having to wait for some Stanford professor to validate a math problem before you can use your credit card to buy a loaf of bread.) This is why almost the entire crypto ecosystem -- with the major exception of Bitcoin -- has switched to proof of stake to validate transactions.
In other words, the first movers (Bitcoin and Ethereum) made a major mistake in their blueprints. Proof of work does not scale very well. In order to get rich from technology, you really want it to be able to get bigger in a hurry. This is why Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) and Fantom (CRYPTO: FTM) zoomed way higher in 2021. These blockchains are super fast, and transactions on them are super cheap.
Ethereum Price data by YCharts
Solana's price skyrocketed in 2021, as crypto investors were amazed at the speed and capacity of its blockchain. Fantom coin had an equally impressive run.
While Ethereum remains the top Tier 1 dog at the moment, it might be that faster technology wins the day. That's how Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) was able to supplant Yahoo as king of internet search. Performance matters. Two of the key attributes you should think about include transactions per second (aka capacity) and time to finality (aka speed per transaction).
CRYPTO TRANSACTIONS PER SECOND TIME TO FINALITY MARKET CAP
Ethereum 15 60 seconds $316 billion
Solana 65,000 13 seconds $27 billion
Fantom 25,000 1 second $4 billion
Data sources: Ethereum.org, Solana, Fantom Foundation, Coinbase, Novum Insights, Messari.io
One of the key questions in the crypto universe is whether the Ethereum network can improve its transactions per second. The lack of capacity on that network has caused gas prices (the cost of getting a transaction validated on the Ethereum blockchain) to soar.
Ethereum Average Gas Price data by YCharts
A charge of $93 per transaction is obscenely high. Both the Solana network and the Fantom network charge much less than a penny. If Ethereum can't improve its capacity, rivals will take market share and win the day.
Why make investments now?
So far in 2022, inflation has been dramatically rising, and the Federal Reserve can and will raise interest rates to combat it. Rising interest rates will strengthen the dollar and make alternative currencies, and investments, less appealing. So expect the crypto universe to see some headwinds as interest rates increase to protect the U.S. dollar.
The Biden administration has also been talking about the need for regulation of crypto. That sort of talk makes a lot of crypto enthusiasts nervous.
Of course the focus is on the most famous crypto, Bitcoin, and also on stablecoins that track the dollar. Right now the market is focused on the currency aspects of crypto. That's why many crypto coins are dropping in value. And these coins might get even cheaper later this year. While this is concerning in the short term, this focus on alternative currencies isn't actually the reason you want to own crypto.
It's the advance in peer-to-peer networks. The computing power and capacity of the blockchain promises to be way higher than a server farm could ever be. While Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) will continue to provide cloud services, those high margins cloud providers enjoy will shrink and contract as the blockchain provides enormous bandwidth at a much lower price. That's why not just the banks but also tech companies are paying attention to the crypto revolution. Small investments now might pay off in huge rewards over the next decade or two.

In comparison, the broader S&P500 index fell by 2.8% over the same period. The online retailer is seeing its stock fall since the start of FY 2022 similar to all growth stocks as U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted that an increase in interest rates will be sooner rather than later, which has shifted investors toward safer assets. The company’s decelerating growth and high valuations have also contributed to its stock fall.  Now, is ETSY stock poised to grow? Based on our machine learning analysis of trends in the stock price over the last seven years, there is a 62% chance of a rise in ETSY stock over the next month (twenty-one trading days). See our analysis on Etsy’s Stock Chance Of Rise for more details.
We estimate Etsy‘s valuation to be around $170 per share which is 34% above the current market price. This represents a P/EBITDA multiple of 23.5x for the company based on our forecast for Etsy’s EBITDA for the current fiscal year.

2022-02-24 00:00:00+00:00,eBay Enters Oversold Territory,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-enters-oversold-territory,,,"The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.
But making eBay Inc. an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Thursday, shares of EBAY entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $49.53 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of eBay Inc., the RSI reading has hit 29.8 — by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel currently has an average RSI of 37.3. A falling stock price — all else being equal — creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, EBAY's recent annualized dividend of 0.88/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 1.61% based upon the recent $54.66 share price.
A bullish investor could look at EBAY's 29.8 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on EBAY is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

Feb 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes slid more than 1% on Thursday, led by losses in bank stocks, as Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine sparked a widespread selloff in global markets.
On the benchmark S&P 500, all the 11 major sectors slipped into the red, with financial stocks .SPSY falling 2.9%, while tech .SPLRCT and consumer discretionary stocks .SPLRCD lost more than 1% each.
Russian forces invaded Ukraine in a massed assault by land, sea and air, the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two.
The escalation in conflict rattled financial markets as global shares slumped and oil prices broke above $100 a barrel, while safe havens gold, government bonds and the dollar surged in the flight to safety. MKTS/GLOB
The United States and its allies promised tough sanctions against Moscow after weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts and an initial wave of modest sanctions.
Most big lenders, including Bank of America Corp BAC.N, Citigroup Inc C.N, Wells Fargo WFC.N and Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N slipped over 4% each.
Tesla Inc TSLA.O dropped 2.5% to lead losses among the mega-cap growth names. Apple AAPL.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O fell over 2% each.
The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, was last trading at 36.81, its highest since Jan. 24.
""Even though the invasion isn't a total surprise, the stock market is still taking a sell first ask questions later approach,"" said Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist at LPL Financial.
""It is just the uncertainty of how serious things could get. Will Europe get involved? Will United States get more involved? We know more serious sanctions are going to come against Russia, but the fallout from that is just uncertain.""
At 10:00 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 646.26 points, or 1.95%, at 32,485.50, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 62.27 points, or 1.47%, at 4,163.23, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 177.33 points, or 1.36%, at 12,860.16.
The risk-off sentiment led investors to look past data that showed weekly jobless claims fell slightly more than expected last week, while a separate report confirmed that U.S. economic growth accelerated in the fourth quarter.
The Dow was set to confirm a correction from its all-time closing high on Jan. 4 and was currently down about 12% below its record closing level.
Oil stocks Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and Chevron Corp CVX.N slipped more than 1% even as crude prices remained elevated as the attack exacerbated worries that a war in Europe could disrupt global energy supplies. O/R
Defense stocks Raytheon Technologies RTX.N and Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N gained over 1.5% and 1.2% each.
EBay Inc EBAY.O fell 3.2% after it forecast bleak first-quarter results, as the e-commerce platform tackles waning online demand, tough competition and global supply chain disruptions.

Feb 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures sank over 2% on Thursday and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 looked set to confirm bear market territory after Russia launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine.
Stock markets around the globe slumped, oil prices broke above $100 a barrel, while safe havens gold and government bonds surged in the flight to safety.
Russian forces invaded Ukraine by land, air and sea, confirming the worst fears of the West with the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two. The United States and its allies promised tough sanctions against Russia in response.
Futures tracking the Nasdaq 100 NQcv1 fell 2.6%. If the losses stick through regular trading hours, the index could confirm bear market territory, or a 20% decline from its November record closing high.

2022-02-24 00:00:00+00:00,"Markets Head to New Lows; EBAY, BKNG Shares Down Post-Earnings",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/markets-head-to-new-lows-ebay-bkng-shares-down-post-earnings,,,"With no economic data reporting today and most of the high-impact companies already past their quarterly earnings reports, it was going to be difficult for pre-market bulls to hand onto the gains they’d managed ahead of today’s opening bell. In this column, we called it a “dead-cat bounce,” but it’s not even that good: this “dead cat” got run over by a Russian tank.

For five straight trading sessions, both the Dow and Nasdaq have posted lower closes. In today’s case, the Dow dropped -464 points or -1.38%; the Nasdaq -344 points or -2.57%. Both indexes closed at their session lows, as did the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 — down -1.84% and -1.82%, respectively. Even more disappointingly, the Dow had been +235 points earlier today at its session high.

The Nasdaq is now nearly -20% from its all-time highs, having taken out the year-to-date intraday low from January 24th today. The S&P is -12% from its own all-time high, which occurred just a short six weeks ago. Ten of 11 sectors closed lower on the day, with only Energy — unsurprisingly, considering the industry’s relationship to Russia — moving higher. It’s a tough slog these days, no doubt; even with overall Q4 earnings season coming up roses, too many question marks on the horizon are causing portfolios to shed equity assets.

And it’s not like the crypto market is faring much better. Bitcoin — lauded by supporters as “digital gold” — is proving less of a hedge against inflation and global turmoil than many people had originally surmised. Much less, in fact. Its price has tumbled to a two-week low on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with the leading crypto having lost nearly half its value from November highs.

eBay EBAY investors will be all too happy to see this trading day end: shares are down -11% following its fiscal Q1 earnings report, which gave softer guidance for next quarter after surprising to the upside on earnings ($1.05 per share versus 99 cents expected) and coming inline on sales ($2.61 billion). Tougher comps year over year were expected, and this company does not miss on the bottom line, ever. But the company has now given back its pandemic gains and is down -30% from its all-time highs.

Booking Holdings BKNG shares had gone up initially following its Q4 earnings report Wednesday afternoon, but have since sunk back into the red, as well. Earnings of $15.83 per share outpaced the $12.73 in the Zacks consensus (and exponentially ahead of the -57 cents per share posted in the year-ago quarter). Revenues of $2.98 billion topped expectations of $2.90 billion. Gross Travel Bookings grew 116% year over year, to $76.6 billion. Clearly a company on the opposite trajectory as eBay currently.

Weekly Jobless Claims and a revised Q4 GDP are on deck for Thursday morning, with New Home Sales out after the opening bell. But these days, such benchmarks pale in comparison to the specter of full-scale war in Eastern Europe. They don’t even stand up well against the idea that interest rates might be near mid-single digits by year’s end, depending on how nasty inflation remains. So buckle up and snap on the chinstrap; it’s going to be a rough-and-tumble near-term period.

Adding insult to injury, some stocks with exposure to the consumer sector kept losing ground even after the market closed. Both Rent-A-Center (NASDAQ: RCII) and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) rely on healthy levels of consumer activity, and both saw sizable declines in after-hours trading following the release of their respective financial reports.
Image source: Getty Images.
Rent-A-Center can't deliver the goods
Shares of Rent-A-Center didn't do all that well in the regular session, falling 8%. However, the rent-to-own specialist saw its stock plunge more than 30% after hours as investors reacted negatively to the company's fourth-quarter financial report.
Rent-A-Center's numbers didn't seem all that bad on their face. Revenue soared more than 63% year over year due largely to a major acquisition. Even accounting for that purchase, pro forma sales were up 10.5% as the company's business segment performed well. Although extraordinary expenses weighed on net income, adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share were up 5% from year-ago levels.
However, investors focused largely on the issues that plagued the consumer side of the business. Rent-A-Center cited the winding down of pandemic-related government relief and elevated inflation levels that sapped customers' ability to buy and make payments. That showed up in higher delinquency and loss rates, which in turn affected bottom-line performance. Moreover, supply chain disruptions hurt Rent-A-Center's ability to get key products, and CEO Mitch Fadel expects these challenges to last for the foreseeable future.
As a result, Rent-A-Center's guidance was somewhat disappointing. Calls for 2022 revenue of $4.45 billion to $4.6 billion would be flat to down slightly from 2021 levels, and earnings of $4.50 to $5 per share would be down markedly from $5.57 per share last year. That reflects consumer challenges, and investors haven't been willing to give companies like Rent-A-Center the benefit of the doubt lately.
eBay misses the bid
Elsewhere, shares of eBay fell 7% in after-hours trading. The online marketplace and auction site saw solid earnings but fell short of expectations on future guidance in its fourth-quarter report.
Again, eBay's backward-looking numbers weren't bad on their face. Revenue moved higher by 5% to $2.61 billion. Net income rose 10% to $647 million, producing adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share.
However, eBay's outlook was particularly poor. The company expects to see organic revenue drop 5% to 7% in the first quarter of 2022, with adjusted earnings of just $1.01 to $1.05 per share. For the full 2022 year, revenue of $10.3 billion to $10.5 billion would be flat to up just 3% year over year, and earnings of $4.20 to $4.40 per share on an adjusted basis would offer only limited growth from 2021's final bottom-line total of $4.02 per share.
eBay benefited from the rise in online shopping during the pandemic, but as people return to brick-and-mortar locations, eBay faces the loss of customers and weaker sales growth. That's a recipe for a weaker stock price in the current environment, and the company will have to fight to regain its positive momentum.

E-commerce companies have raked in large profits as online shopping boomed during the pandemic, but vaccine rollouts could alter their fortunes as people return to brick-and-mortar shopping.
This would mean more trouble for EBay as it already faces stiff competition from larger rivals including Amazon and Walmart Inc's WMT.N online business.

eBay Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
eBay Inc. price-eps-surprise | eBay Inc. Quote
Factors to Consider
eBay’s fourth-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from strong momentum across the Marketplace platform.
Further, growing marketing initiatives might have aided the fourth-quarter performance of the Marketplace platform.
The company has been gaining traction among small business owners who are leveraging the Marketplace to expand their reach to customers. This is expected to have remained a positive in the fourth quarter.
Also, the increasing number of small businesses is expected to have attracted more customers to the platform. This is likely to have aided growth in the active buyer base in the quarter under review.
The growing adoption of EBAY’s Managed Payments might have continued benefiting the to-be-reported quarter’s performance. Also, deepening focus to scale managed payments worldwide is likely to have been a tailwind.
Further, strength across Promoted Listings is expected to have helped eBay gain momentum across sellers in the fourth quarter. Also, solid promoted listings momentum is likely to have continued driving the company’s advertising revenues.
In addition, EBAY has been witnessing growth in sneaker and smartwatch businesses in the United States. This is likely to have contributed well to top-line growth in the quarter under discussion.
During the quarter, the company acquired Sneaker Con’s authentication business named Sneaker Con Digital to strengthen the Authenticity Guarantee service. This might get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.
In addition to these, eBay is expected to have gained momentum among trading card enthusiasts on the back of Price Guide and Collection tools. This is likely to have benefited the company’s performance in the quarter under review.
Yet, rising competitive pressure from e-commerce giants like Amazon is likely to have continued posing challenges to eBay’s market position.
Further, impacts of the global supply chain disruptions are expected to get reflected in its fourth-quarter results.

2022-02-22 00:00:00+00:00,Is Shopify Stock a Buy Now?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-shopify-stock-a-buy-now-0,,,"Shopify's (NYSE: SHOP) stock plunged 16% after it posted its fourth-quarter earnings report on Feb. 16. That slide continued the following day and extended Shopify's year-to-date decline to more than 50%.
That drawdown has erased most of the stock's gains since the onset of the pandemic in early 2020. But does that painful pullback represent a good buying opportunity for investors who missed its previous rally?
Image source: Getty Images.
Why did Shopify's stock rally in 2020 and 2021?
Shopify's e-commerce services enable businesses to set up their own online stores, process payments, fulfill orders, manage marketing campaigns, and more. Those options are attractive to smaller merchants who don't want to join a crowded third-party marketplace like Amazon, Etsy, or eBay.
Shopify was already growing rapidly before the pandemic started, but its growth in revenue, gross merchandise volume (GMV), and gross payment volume (GPV) all accelerated significantly throughout the pandemic as businesses scrambled to sell more products online.
But as the lockdown measures were relaxed, Shopify's growth decelerated against some very difficult year-over-year comparisons to 2020:
GROWTH (YOY)
FY 2019
FY 2020
FY 2021
Revenue
47%
86%
57%
GMV
49%
96%
47%
GPV
55%
110%
59%
Data source: Shopify. YOY = year over year.
That slowdown will continue in 2022
Shopify didn't provide an exact revenue forecast for 2022 during its fourth-quarter report, but it said it would be ""lower than the 57% revenue growth achieved in 2021, but still rapid and outpacing the growth of e-commerce.""
Shopify also said its year-over-year revenue growth would likely be slower in the first quarter of 2022 as it laps the ""COVID-triggered acceleration of e-commerce in the first half 2021."" Those statements were a bit vague, but analysts expect Shopify's revenue to rise 32% in 2022 and 33% in 2023.
Shopify's stock is still richly valued
Based on those expectations and its current price of $660 per share, Shopify trades at 14 times its 2022 sales. That price-to-sales ratio might seem reasonable, but a lot of other high-growth tech stocks with comparable revenue growth are trading at even lower valuations.
For example, Twilio (NYSE: TWLO) -- the cloud communications company that expects to generate at least 30% organic revenue growth for the ""next several years"" -- trades at just eight times this year's sales. MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) -- the Latin American e-commerce giant that analysts have pegged to generate 35% revenue growth in 2022 -- trades at less than six times that estimate. Based on those comparisons, Shopify's stock could still easily drop another 50% before it's considered cheap.
Shopify's margins could decline in 2022
Shopify's adjusted gross and operating margins both expanded in 2021. Its adjusted operating margin has also improved significantly over the past three years, even as it ramped up its investments to expand its ecosystem.
PERIOD
FY 2019
FY 2020
FY 2021
Adjusted gross margin
55.7%
53.5%
54.4%
Adjusted operating margin
2.9%
14.9%
15.6%
Data source: Shopify.
However, analysts expect Shopify's adjusted operating margin to drop to 7.5% in 2022 as its rising investments coincide with its slower revenue growth. Looking ahead, the company says it plans to reinvest ""all"" of its gross profits back into its international expansion, integrated point-of-sale systems, consumer-facing Shop App, and the Shopify Fulfillment Network.
As a result, analysts expect it to turn unprofitable on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) again in 2022 and 2023. All that red ink could make Shopify a risky stock to hold as interest rates rise.
Don't pay the wrong price for the right company
I won't discourage investors from nibbling on Shopify at these levels, since it looks a lot more reasonably priced than it did at the end of 2021.
But a simple comparison against its peers with similar growth rates indicates it could drop a lot further before it bottoms out. Therefore, I think it's better to raise more cash and wait for a better buying opportunity down the road -- preferably when its price-to-sales ratio hits the high single digits.

2022-02-20 00:00:00+00:00,eBay Earnings Preview: Follow the Cash,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-earnings-preview%3A-follow-the-cash,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) investors haven't had much to celebrate over the last several months. While the e-commerce giant is still growing following soaring results in 2020, its sales boost isn't coming from gains in the core business. The expansion prospects aren't exciting for 2022 either, as it might take several quarters before transaction volumes return to positive territory.
There are good reasons to like the stock, though, heading into its fourth-quarter announcement in just a few days. eBay's finances are stronger than ever, and cash returns are set to soar. These trends might support solid returns for shareholders as they wait for the business to start recovering in 2022.
Let's take a closer look at the results set for Feb. 23.
Image source: Getty Images.
Buyer beware
eBay beat Wall Street's sales expectations for a second straight quarter last quarter, with organic revenue rising 11% in Q3. That success convinced management to raise its 2021 outlook -- again -- to target sales growth of between 8% and 10%.
The good news is that eBay is still growing compared to 2020's 19% revenue spike, mainly thanks to higher order values and growth from its payments processing and advertising business lines. On the other hand, transaction volumes are falling hard as consumers shift priorities back toward other niches like restaurants and in-person entertainment.
That's why it will be key to follow changes in eBay's buyer pool over the next few quarters for signs that the business is stabilizing. That metric worsened to a 5% loss last quarter compared to a 2% drop in Q2 and an 8% spike in Q4 of 2020.
Taking on a higher profit
eBay's light operating model makes it much more profitable than integrated peers like Amazon that handle their own inventory, shipping, and warehousing. Operating margin sits above 20% of sales, or more than twice Amazon's rate.
EBAY Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts
eBay has room to keep pushing margins higher, mainly by adding value to the services it offers buyers. The holiday quarter was a busy one on this front, with product pages receiving usability upgrades and eBay's advertising and payments platforms expanding.
Look for signs of success showing up in rising fees for sellers. eBay's ""take rate"" has jumped to a new high above 12% of sales, in fact, but smaller peers like Etsy charge 18% today.
The 2022 outlook
Most investors are looking for eBay to sound a conservative note about growth and earnings in 2022. Peers like Shopify have forecast weak sales, especially early in the year, as e-commerce shopping patterns revert to a more normal cadence following the pandemic. eBay might follow its rivals in announcing significant new spending, too, aimed at building infrastructure around all the extra volume that it has accrued over the last three years.
Those factors imply a weak performance for eBay's stock over the short term. But the company still boasts qualities that make it attractive as an investment, including industry-thumping profitability and cash flow.
As long as the company continues winning buyers over to its platform while boosting the value they receive from the service, then shareholders should be happy that they held on through any volatility around eBay's early 2022 performance.

2022-02-20 00:00:00+00:00,3 Things to Watch in the Stock Market This Week,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-things-to-watch-in-the-stock-market-this-week-10,,,"Stocks fell last week as investors focused on geopolitical risks and the prospect for rising interest rates. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) shed nearly 2% and remain lower so far in 2022.
Earnings season continues to drive individual stock price moves, and several major announcements are on the way over the next few days. Let's take a look at the updates on the way from Home Depot (NYSE: HD), eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), and Wayfair (NYSE: W).
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Home Depot's dividend
Tuesday morning brings Home Depot's fourth-quarter earnings report, which will be packed with important news for investors. We'll learn how well home improvement demand held up through late December as the housing market continued expanding. For context, comparable-store sales rose 6% in the third quarter on top of the prior year's over 20% surge.
Most investors are looking for Home Depot to announce similarly strong gains on Tuesday. Watch for the balance between pricing and customer traffic, though. Growth last quarter came entirely from higher spending as traffic fell over 5%. We'll also get a better picture of market share trends when rival Lowe's announces its results on Wednesday.
The big question is whether Home Depot will announce a major hike to its annual dividend payment. That boost is typically revealed in its Q4 report and, given the nearly 30% surge in earnings this past year, it could be much bigger than last year's 10% payout increase.
2. eBay's buyer growth
Investors are cautiously optimistic heading into eBay's Wednesday earnings announcement. The e-commerce marketplace giant raised growth expectations in each of its prior two reports, most recently following 11% higher organic sales in Q3. Sure, sales volumes are slumping compared to peak results a year ago. But eBay is offsetting those drops with higher order spending and growth in its payments and advertising segments.
The company still sees lots of room for rising volumes as commerce moves online. Niches like collectable sneakers, pre-owned apparel, and luxury watches all have bright growth outlooks. But eBay will need to expand its buyer pool to keep attracting more sellers to the platform (and away from rivals like Walmart, Amazon, and Shopify).
While there should be good news this week on eBay's profitability and cash flow, it's that buyer pool figure that will have the biggest effect on its growth rate over time.
3. Wayfair's new outlook
Wayfair shares have slumped since late 2021, which sets the stage for a potentially big move around its Thursday morning earnings announcement.
Growth won't be pretty. Like eBay, Wayfair is seeing its volumes take a step back after nearly two years of soaring growth. Most investors are expecting sales to drop about 11% for Q4 as solid profits a year ago give way to net losses in late 2021. Shoppers are directing spending toward areas like travel and restaurants following several years of prioritizing home furnishings.
Wayfair's business is still much bigger than it was in 2019. And CEO Niraj Shah and his team still believe they can reasonably target over $100 billion in annual sales over the long term.
But ""it will take a few more quarters"" for expansion rates to get back to normal, Shah warned last quarter. The big question this week is whether a clear path is emerging for that stabilization sometime in 2022.

2022-02-18 00:00:00+00:00,Review: PayPal alumni’s age of innocence,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/review%3A-paypal-alumnis-age-of-innocence,,,"Reuters
Reuters


WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk can be a vulnerable person. That’s one of the surprising insights from a new book about the founding of PayPal and the network of entrepreneurs and venture capital investors it spawned. It’s a dramatic business story about the payments company’s rise. But it’s also a human tale about Musk, Peter Thiel, and Max Levchin before they went on to greater fame and fortune.
In “The Founders: the Story of PayPal and the Entrepreneurs Who Shaped Silicon Valley”, Jimmy Soni captures the heady days of the dot-com bubble in 1999, when it seemed any twentysomething could raise money for a startup. Musk had set up an online bank called X.com while Thiel and Levchin started what would become PayPal. That firm’s first office was in a building’s closet.
While entrepreneurs are often lauded for their single-minded pursuit of an idea, the book demonstrates that adaptability is just as important. Levchin was set on the firm’s original purpose of sending money using Palm Pilots, the popular handheld device at that time. Musk had a vision of revolutionizing traditional banking. But the product that customers wanted was an easy payments service. Both startups found demand at online auction site eBay. X.com and PayPal became fierce competitors, one-upping each other on referral payments and coding feats. Instead of fighting to the death, they decided to merge. 
Thiel’s financial acumen shone through even then. He pushed the company to quickly raise $100 million, a figure that some staff found disappointingly small. Days later, the stock market started its downward spiral. With cash in the bank, PayPal was able to file to go public in 2001 when fewer than 100 U.S. companies joined the stock market.
After countless tales of tech bros behaving badly, the PayPal story shows a more attractive side of Silicon Valley culture. Its founders were nerds in work and in play, creating a meritocracy in which they trusted employees to do big things and were surprisingly forgiving when they made big mistakes. Levchin and Thiel spent hours trying to outdo each other on brain teasers.
EBay looms large throughout the book. PayPal was so dependent on the site that executives continuously feared being cut off. It led to fierce battles, several deal dalliances and a back-and-forth relationship that continues to this day. The auction site bought PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002, spun it off in 2015, and now has shifted most of its payments processing away from its former subsidiary. Meanwhile the $120 billion PayPal is more than three times bigger than its former parent.
While PayPal’s founders were intense, winner-take-all types, they also had surprisingly softer sides. Thiel, who became an early investor in Facebook, had an unofficial rule of not firing employees because he considered it akin to war, which he said was bad. It’s an unexpected conciliatory edict from someone who would later force gossip site Gawker into bankruptcy and back Donald Trump’s presidential bid. Meanwhile, X.com was noted for its diverse staff. If a worker didn’t cut it, “Elon always let them go with dignity and grace”, one female employee recalls. Now Tesla is facing lawsuits for sexual harassment and discrimination.
Musk was one of several people who served as PayPal’s chief executive. Arguments about technology, the company’s name and overall direction led to his ouster while he was abroad. Yet Musk was gracious in his farewell note to employees and praised Thiel, who helped orchestrate the coup, and would later become an investor in SpaceX, Musk’s rocket startup.
It was his second experience of being pushed out of a company and according to Soni this “pained him.” It helps explain why Musk ensured that his later ventures had boards packed with allies including his brother Kimbal, who is a director of both Tesla and SpaceX.
“The Founders” also gives due recognition to Levchin, who is often overshadowed by his more controversial colleagues. He helped create one of the first commercial applications of what’s known as CAPTCHA, which helps determine whether a visitor to a website is human. He was also an early investor in review website Yelp and is now chief executive of Affirm, the $11 billion buy-now-pay-later lender.
The PayPal mafia, as alumni are often called, usually refers to the men. “The Founders” refreshingly also highlights the women who were integral to the company. Amy Rowe Klement, who became a PayPal products executive, is credited with translating engineering vision into practical consumer use cases.
The author had impressive access to the key players, including Musk, Thiel and Levchin, along with those who were closest to them in those early years. It would’ve been enlightening to hear more from them about how they applied their PayPal experiences. Still, the book is rich enough that readers can infer the lessons the founders learned in a more innocent time.

2022-02-17 00:00:00+00:00,7 Stocks With Earnings Reports Next Week,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-with-earnings-reports-next-week,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Fourth-quarter earnings reports continue to come in with mixed results. Overall, companies listed on the S&P 500 index have, so far, reported a 30.3% annual growth rate in earnings per share (EPS) for the fourth quarter of 2021 — marking the fourth-consecutive year-over-year (YOY) reading of 30% or higher.
However, there are clouds forming on the horizon. For Q4, S&P 500 listed companies have issued negative earnings guidance (looking ahead) at the highest level in a decade. High inflation, looming interest rate increases, wage pressures and persistent supply chain bottlenecks are conspiring to dampen sentiment.
7 Hot Stocks That Show No Signs of Cooling Off
Yet, amidst the gloom, many companies continue to outperform and issue earnings and guidance that are better than Wall Street had forecast. Over the next week, we’ll get earnings reports from a number of household names, including big box retailers, pharmaceutical companies and leading technology concerns. With that in mind, here are seven stocks with earnings reports next week that investors should keep an eye on.
Home Depot (NYSE:HD)
eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)
Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)
Block (NYSE:SQ)
Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA)
Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN)
Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B)
Now, let’s dive in and take a closer look at each one.
Earnings Reports Next Week: Home Depot (HD)
Source: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.com
How is the home building market holding up? Are homeowners still upgrading and improving their domiciles? We’ll get an idea when Atlanta, Georgia-based Home Depot reports its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 22.
Analysts are expecting the big-box retailer to report EPS of $3.17 on revenue of $34.85 billion. Key to the company’s success will be if consumer spending on home upgrades has held up in the face of the biggest spike in inflation in 40 years.
Moreover, HD stock is down more than 16% year-to-date (YTD) amid widespread market volatility. However, even with that decline, Home Depot’s share price is up 25% over the past 12 months. The company, and its share price, have benefitted from strong consumer spending throughout the pandemic. For the previous third quarter, Home Depot reported sales growth of about 10%. That was impressive as it came on top of 23% sales growth in the third quarter of 2020.
Additionally, remote work trends and higher home prices have fueled Home Depot’s results. But will it continue?
eBay (EBAY)

The share price of e-commerce giant eBay is also down 16% so far in 2022 to $55.60. The company’s stock has taken a hit as investors reposition their portfolios to move away from technology names and into value and cyclical securities. eBay is also widely viewed as a company that benefitted when stay-at-home orders were in place and shopping malls closed at the height of the novel coronavirus pandemic. However, with economies now reopening, eBay’s growth is expected to slow.
Case in point, from Q2 2020 to Q1 2021, eBay’s total active buyers increased from 182 million to 187 million. However, they have since fallen back to 154 million total active buyers in Q3 2021. Any further erosion of this key metric in the Q4 numbers released on Feb. 23, and EBAY stock is likely to fall further. Also, Wall Street is looking for eBay to report Q4 EPS of $1 on revenue of $2.61 billion.

Earnings Reports Next Week: Alibaba (BABA)

How is embattled Chinese e-commerce juggernaut Alibaba holding up? China’s answer to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been relatively quiet in recent months after experiencing a public drubbing throughout most of 2021. The company founded and run by Jack Ma was targeted by Chinese authorities and regulators as part of their broad and brutal crackdown on publicly-traded companies. In turn, Alibaba was hit with a record antitrust fine and had its planned initial public offering (IPO) of Ant Group canceled.
The crackdown has hurt Alibaba’s finances and its stock. The share price of BABA stock is down 56% over the past year to now trade at $119.60. While hard to bear for shareholders, there is cautious optimism that the stock may have bottomed and is beginning to heal as Chinese authorities start to back off.
YTD, Alibaba stock is basically flat, and seems to have hit a trough of $110.06 in late January. Thus, better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings could go along way to giving BABA stock a boost.
With that in mind, analysts anticipate that Alibaba will report EPS of $2.55 on revenue of $38.84 billion when the company issues its Q4 print on Feb. 24.
Block (SQ)

Speaking of badly beaten down stocks, the company formerly known as Square could use some good news.
It’s been a house of pain for shareholders ever since the fintech and digital payments company announced that it is rebranding to now be called “Block,” reflecting its growing focus on cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that underpins digital coins and tokens. In the past six months, SQ stock has fallen 62%, including a YTD decline of 39%, and now changes hands at under $100 per share. Last August, the share price was at a 52-week high of $289.23.
Moreover, analysts and shareholders will be watching to see how much Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other cryptocurrency assets the company had on its books at the end of 2021, as well as how the volatility in cryptocurrencies has impacted Block’s finances. Also, news from company founder Jack Dorsey that Block plans to go all-in on cryptocurrencies and is developing an open-source Bitcoin mining system has largely overshadowed the company’s bread-and-butter Cash App that enables people to transfer money using a mobile phone app and is popular among small businesses and the self-employed.

Overall, for Q4, Wall Street expects Block to report EPS of 23 cents on revenue of $4.04 billion.
Earnings Reports Next Week: Moderna (MRNA)

Can Moderna get its mojo back? The best performing stock in the S&P 500 index during the first half of 2021, the once high-flying Covid-19 vaccine maker has come back down to Earth in recent months as vaccination levels plateau, the Omicron variant dissipates and governments around the world loosen their vaccine requirements.
Moderna chief executive officer Stephane Bancel made headlines around the world earlier this month when he said that we’re likely approaching the final stages of the pandemic. That’s good news for humanity, but bad news for vaccine manufacturers.
In turn, MRNA stock has been taking it on the chin as expectations that global sales of its Covid-19 vaccine will slow throughout this year. YTD, Moderna’s share price is down 42% to $147.90. And in the past six months, the stock has come down 63%. Nonetheless, Moderna is at a particular disadvantage with its Covid-19 vaccine as it is the first and only product that the Boston-based company has had approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Moreover, coming out of the pandemic, Moderna will have to turn to its pipeline of cancer and HIV drug candidates.
So, with earnings due up on Feb. 24, Wall Street analysts have forecast that Moderna will report EPS of $9.90 on revenue of $6.79 billion.
Coinbase (COIN)

On Feb. 24, we’ll also get a report from cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. This will provide an opportunity to see how bad the volatility in cryptocurrencies has been since the sector turned negative last November.
Furthermore, Coinbase’s earnings will also let Wall Street know if crypto investors continue to remain bullish, or if the ups and downs at the end of last year drove many participants away from the market. At its current price of $40,000, Bitcoin is 40% below the all-time high it reached last fall.
The churn has had an impact on COIN stock, which has declined 25% YTD to now trade at around $190 per share. As a cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase’s fortunes are intimately tied to the prices of digital coins and tokens such as Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH-USD). It will be difficult for the company’s stock to regain its footing while cryptocurrency prices see-saw higher and lower.

Nevertheless, the company continues to improve its platform in hopes of attracting and retaining users. And for its earnings report next week, analysts expect Coinbase to report EPS of $1.85 on revenue of $1.91 billion for the fourth quarter of last year.
Earnings Reports Next Week: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B)

The week concludes with Q4 results from Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company of legendary investor Warren Buffett.
We already got some insight into what the “Oracle of Omaha” has been up to in recent months thanks to the latest 13F filing released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filing showed that Buffett increased his holdings of oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX), and took a well-timed stake in video game maker Activision-Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) just months before Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) bought the company for $68 billion.
Investments aside, the Q4 report will show us how the businesses Berkshire Hathaway owns, which include the Dairy Queen fast food restaurant chain and Geico insurance, held up in the current high inflation environment. Berkshire’s stock has been rejuvenated lately, as investors dump high-valued technology names in favor of more stable and reliable value stocks. YTD, BRK-B stock is up 5% at $314 a share — outperforming the S&P 500 index which is down almost 9% on the year.
So, with its track record of consistent performance, Berkshire Hathaway is the type of stock that attracts money in times of turmoil. For its Q4 report, analysts forecast Q4 EPS of $2.88 on revenue of $68.92 billion.
