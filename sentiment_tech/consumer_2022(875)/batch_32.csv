2022-03-18 00:00:00+00:00,The Smartest People on Wall Street Love This Stock,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-smartest-people-on-wall-street-love-this-stock,,,"When it comes to investing, one great thing you can do is learn from the professionals. One way you can do this is by seeing what the smart money is doing through their Form 13F filings.
The Securities and Exchange Commission requires 13F filings for an institutional investment manager with more than $100 million in qualifying securities. These filings are required quarterly and within 45 days of the end of the quarter.
These disclosures can give investors good insight into how the best minds on Wall Street are positioning their investment portfolios. One stock that major funds have been adding hand over fist is PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL).
These two firms added millions of shares of PayPal in the quarter
During the fourth quarter, Two Sigma Advisers added 1.5 million shares of PayPal, while Clearbridge Investments added 2.6 million shares.
PayPal got beaten up since peaking at about $310 per share in February 2021, when its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) was 86. By the end of 2021, it was down to $190 per share -- a price point that became attractive enough for Clearbridge to build a position, with the firm saying:
Long-term growth drivers remain intact, and it has increased innovation at both Venmo and core PayPal, adding new experiences around shopping and investing that we expect to positively contribute to growth in users and average revenue per user over the next five years.

This is what caused the sell-off
Since the fourth-quarter report, PayPal has continued to sell off and now trades at about $110 per share. Investors had a couple of concerns in the past year. Among the biggest was that PayPal and eBay had begun the planned decoupling of their businesses, impacting PayPal's top-line growth.
According to PayPal, this decoupling took $1.4 billion off the top line, reducing growth by 7% in 2021. The separation will continue to be a headwind for the business this year, putting another $600 million of pressure on the top line. However, these headwinds will taper off, with eBay representing only 3% of its revenue and total payment volume (TPV) at the end of last year.
Investors, meanwhile, have a wary eye on inflationary pressures, which could pressure consumer spending. In 2021, consumer spending ended on a weak note, down 0.6%, while retail sales closed out down 2.5%. As a result, PayPal management was more conservative with its growth expectations, projecting revenue growth of 15% to 17% this year, down from its previous estimate of 18%.
PayPal continues to be a force in digital payments, and it's cheap
PayPal's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has come way down to about 31, and its forward P/E is even lower at 24, making it the cheapest it's been since being spun off from eBay. At prices like this, PayPal stock looks very appealing. Last year was still one of PayPal's best years in its history, as it surpassed $1 trillion in TPV which helped revenue increase 18% to $25.4 billion.
PYPL PE Ratio data by YCharts.
The company continues to grow its business. In recent years, it has expanded into allowing customers to buy cryptocurrencies, cash checks, and use ""buy now, pay later"" options. It also holds the spot as the most accepted digital wallet, with 76% of major retailers accepting PayPal, compared with Apple Pay's 27%, Affirm's 9%, and Afterpay's 6%.
PayPal will also shift its attention from adding customers to increasing customer engagement this year. Unlike subscription revenue models like Netflix, PayPal makes money when customers use the app. The company found that a third of its customers drove most of the spending volume. This shift in focus should help revenue continue to grow at management's 15% to 17% target.
Given PayPal's cheap valuation, strong projected growth, and continued dominance in digital payments, it's no wonder the smartest on Wall Street are buying the stock.

2022-03-18 00:00:00+00:00,Shopify Stock: Bear vs. Bull,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/shopify-stock%3A-bear-vs.-bull-0,,,"E-commerce enabler Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) surged at the pandemic onset as consumers shifted the majority of their spending online. Suddenly an online presence was vital for businesses while they were forced to shut their doors to in-person shoppers temporarily.
Now pandemic restrictions in many places have all but dropped, and folks are reducing online spending and visiting stores in person again. What's more, supply chain disruptions during the pandemic highlighted the limits of online shopping.
Regardless of which side of the fence you're on, it helps to consider the bull and bear cases on an investment.
Image source: Getty Images.
The bull case
Even before the onset of the pandemic, consumers were allocating more of their spending online. The convenience advantages over brick and mortar stores are several, including the fact that online stores are open 24/7, they ship to your doorstep, and they offer a more comprehensive selection, to name a few.
From the first quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2020 (before the outbreak), e-commerce sales as a portion of all retail sales increased from 4.2% to 11.5% in the U.S. That figure surged to 15.7% at the height of the pandemic before falling to 13% as of Q3 2021. And according to Statista, e-commerce spending will grow to $1.3 trillion in the U.S. in 2025, up from $767 billion in 2021.
Shopify's sales rose along with the growth in e-commerce spending. From 2012 to 2021, Shopify's revenue exploded from $24 million to $4.6 billion. If consumers are moving online, then businesses need to move online. Otherwise, they will lose sales to competitors.
Shopify helps entrepreneurs and even larger brands establish an online presence. It's no surprise, then, that its revenue has increased along with the growth of online spending. And perhaps more impressively, Shopify's revenue grew by 57% year over year in 2021 with the tailwinds from the pandemic receding.
And despite its rapid growth in the last decade, the company has room to go further. Management is working on several initiatives to keep the momentum going, including international expansion, supplying capital to client businesses, retail point of sale systems, and a fulfillment network. These excellent prospects may be why analysts expect Shopify to grow earnings per share at a compound annual rate of 38% over the next five years.
The bear argument
The bears likely concede that Shopify is a phenomenal growth stock. They will even grant that secular tailwinds, including e-commerce growth, are in its favor. But the bear argument centers around valuation. Shopify stock is not cheap. As of this writing, it is selling at price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios of 17 and 178, respectively.
SHOP PS Ratio data by YCharts
Rival e-commerce platforms eBay and Amazon are trading at fraction of the price-to-sales ratios, at 3.4. Admittedly, Shopify is growing faster than the aforementioned and deserves a premium valuation. As mentioned earlier, Shopify is expected to grow earnings at a 38% rate over the next five years, while the same rates for eBay and Amazon are expected at 12.5% and 34.8% respectively.
But the bears will say a nearly 5X multiple is pushing it too far (see chart). The disparity has already been correcting itself, as Shopify's P/S ratio has fallen to 17 from a peak of over 60 reached several times in 2020 and 2021.
Shopify's stock is down 55% so far in 2022 as the bears have had the upper hand. However, it appears that the market has overcorrected. Shopify is now trading at the lowest P/S ratio in three years. What's more, it's selling at a lower price than it did before the outbreak. Since then, Shopify has signed up plenty of new customers who are unlikely to shut down their online businesses even after a pandemic.

2022-03-17 00:00:00+00:00,2 Metaverse Stocks to Buy if the Market Crashes Further,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-metaverse-stocks-to-buy-if-the-market-crashes-further,,,"The stock market correction has turned ugly lately. What started with high-growth tech stocks has now escalated to include most companies amid deepened geopolitical tensions, growing inflation risks, and more.
While unpleasant, a market correction is also an opportunity for long-term investors to buy stocks in good companies with strong tailwinds. One way to do this is to invest in the leading companies in the emerging metaverse. Let's take a look at two companies that are likely winners in the virtual worlds of the metaverse.
Image source: Getty Images.
Roblox (NYSE: RBLX)
Nowadays, having a conversation about the metaverse usually begins with Roblox. It is one of the first companies to foray into the metaverse and has been one of the most successful. Just ask any youngster in the U.S., Europe, and other parts of the world about Roblox, and they will give you an elaborate explanation of its platform and the popular games on it.
The popularity of the Roblox platform is also evident in its numbers. Daily active users (DAUs) more than tripled from 15.8 million in the first quarter of 2019 to 49.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Similarly, bookings surged more than fivefold from $142 million to $770 million during the same period thanks to an increase in DAUs and higher spending per user. In addition, the company has delivered positive operating cash flow in each of the last 12 quarters.
Roblox had some great runs in the past. But can it continue to grow in the future? I think so. For starters, the metaverse is here to stay. Technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality are becoming more mature. Improvement in supporting infrastructures like 5G connectivity, high-performance chips, and low-cost computing will help power the metaverse into the future.
Besides, major tech companies like Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Alphabet are investing heavily in this emerging industry. So it's hard to imagine it not taking off. Even JPMorgan expects the industry to create a trillion-dollar yearly revenue stream.
As the top dog, Roblox already has a head start with around 50 million DAUs as of Dec 2021. Moreover, it has a community of loyal developers who have been growing with the company. By building better games, these developers will help Roblox attract new users and retain existing ones. A growing user base, in turn, motivates game developers to invest even more in building quality games.
Bottom line: I think Roblox can sustain its flywheel of growing user base and innovative games. And as the metaverse industry develops, the gaming company is well-positioned to benefit from potential new-use cases in areas like education, e-commerce, advertising, and others. It is not a company to miss if you want to ride the metaverse wave.
Unity Software
Unity Software is a game-development platform that enables game creators to create and run interactive and real-time 2D and 3D content on almost any platform, including virtual reality and augmented reality devices.
While Unity provides a suite of tools, its most important feature is its game engine. Think of it as software to build games. With Unity's game engine, developers can now create their games at a low cost and with a short development cycle. Unity also enables developers to operate their games on its platform through hosting, customer management, and monetization.
Game developers are pretty much locked into Unity's ecosystem, making it very difficult for them to switch providers. Even if they do switch, the other choice is Unreal Engine. That probably explains Unity's high net-retention rate of 140% in December 2021, up from 138% in 2020.
With a sticky customer base within a limited market, Unity is well-positioned as game developers move toward the metaverse. After all, developers are already familiar with Unity, which understands their needs. Unity just has to sustain its innovation around these needs.
On top of that, Unity is leveraging its software capabilities to develop strategic partnerships with companies beyond the gaming industry. For example, the software provider partnered with Hyundai Motor to improve the efficiency and productivity of the manufacturing process. It also worked with eBay so that sellers can offer customers an interactive, 360-degree view of the items for sale.
In short, Unity has strategically positioned itself to prosper in the growing metaverse. And if investors have an opportunity to buy the stock on the dip (during a market crash, for example), they should grab it.

The market for NFTs is booming.
Otherwise known as non-fungible tokens, they’re turning digital works of art, photos, selfies, even music into tradeable items on the blockchain.
Sounds boring, right?
That is, until you consider how profitable NFTs have become.
Beeple’s Ocean Front NFT sold for $6 million.
Beeple’s Crossroad sold for $6.6 million.
Pak’s “The Merge” sold for an incredible $91.8 million.
An NFT called “Save Thousands of Lives” sold for $4.5 million last May.
CryptoPunk #3100 sold for $7.58 million.
CryptoPunk #7523 sold for $11.75 million.
Even better, analysts at Jefferies say the NFT market could be worth about $35 billion this year, and about $80 billion by 2025.  NFTs may even be a bridge to the metaverse, according to Binance, helping to create virtual identity, community, and social experiences.
So, how can you and I profit from these “boring” non-fungible tokens?
7 Growth Stocks That Trade at Attractive Valuations
One way is to trade or even create your own NFTs.  Or, you can invest in the companies with exposure to the world of NFTs, including:
Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN)
Defiance Digital Revolution ETF (NYSE:NFTZ)
Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO)
NFTs: Coinbase Global (COIN)

Coinbase Global will soon launch Coinbase NFT, according to its site.
While it’s not up and running just yet, about 3.7 million people are now on the company’s waitlist. Even better, Coinbase recently partnered with Mastercard (NYSE:MA), which wants to help simplify the NFT buying experience. According to Mastercard:
Buying digital goods should be as simple as buying a T-shirt or coffee pods on an e-commerce site. You can make your purchase with one click — that’s it. That’s not the case for many NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. Today, if you want to buy an NFT — such as a digital art piece — you first need to open a crypto wallet, buy crypto, then use it to purchase an NFT in an online marketplace.
Recent COIN stock earnings were solid.
For its fourth quarter, EPS came in at $3.32, beating estimates for $1.94.  The company also reported sales of $2.5 billion, beating expectations by 27%.  Monthly transacting users soared to 11.4 million, outpacing forecasts for 9.7 million.
After finding double bottom support around $160, we’d like to see the stock initially refill its bearish gap around $220. From there, should all go according to plan, the COIN stock could rally to $280.
Defiance Digital Revolution ETF (NFTZ)

One of the best ways to diversify in a growing market at less cost is with an ETF, such as the Defiance Digital Revolution ETF (NFTZ).
If NFTs can become an $80 billion market, this ETF could take off.  With an expense ratio of 0.65%, investors can own some of the top crypto and NFT companies on market for less than $15 a share, as of March.
That includes top holdings  eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), Coinbase Global, Hut 8 Mining (NASDAQ:HUT), Canaan (NASDAQ:CAN) and Block (NYSE:SQ), to name a few.
NFTs: Funko (FNKO)

Pop culture product company, Funko recently acquired an ownership stake in TokenWave, a leading mobile app and website for showcasing and tracking NFTs.  That deal accelerates the company’s move into NFTs.
In November, Funko partnered with ViacomCBS to launch Digital Pop NFT collectibles featuring Star Trek characters. Insiders have been buying, too.  In fact, in December, Director Charles Denson bought 99,300 shares of FNKO for $1.7 million.
Earnings have been solid. Net sales increased 40.0% year over year to $267.7 million. Net income increased 17.8% year over year to $18.4 million. Funko also exceeded Q3 expectations and raised full year guidance.

David Gardner: Every once in a blue moon or a new moon or an old moon or a borrowed moon, I queue up a hodgepodge of points that I want to share. They're not really related to each other -- a hodgepodge. As I've done before in the show, I call it ""Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blue."" Each of the four main points fits well, even if I have to shoehorn them into that simple format. You probably know the expression, don't you? It's what brides traditionally are supposed to wear on their wedding day for good luck -- something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue. While I won't be providing this, this podcast, you're also supposed to have a silver sixpence in your shoes. Now, if you want to locate a dime or a quarter, and slip it in your shoe for this week's podcast, I think you might have even better luck. Episode 5: Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blue. Only on this week's Rule Breaker Investing.
Welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing. A lot happening in the world this week. I think I might talk to that a little bit later. But in the midst of so much business, I thought, why not go back to one of my favorite formats? One of the 25 or so episodic series. In this case, old, new, borrowed, blue -- one we have not done for about two years. I skipped it in 2021. Here we are the first week of March, and I thought, let's go back to something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue.
Something old for me is going to be typically something that we've already covered before. Something that I feel like you or at least I should know -- one of these so-called eternal verities usually is something old. Indeed, I will be bringing you, right up front this week, something old that I hope still feels fresh and extremely relevant today.
Something new, well, that's just that. Something borrowed, typically something that I've learned from somebody else or taken from something else somewhere else. Then something blue. Blue has many different meanings. It's a powerful word, in addition to one of my favorite colors. I try to make a different shade of blue each time, and that certainly is the case this week. Without further ado, I say, we get started.
Now, we start with something old. I'm going to call it telltale foolishness -- with the small ""f"" this time around. How can you discover that someone you're watching or speaking to, someone you're listening to, maybe doesn't quite get it when it comes to investing? For me, I see this, everything from water cooler conversations to cocktail party conversations to how the media often talk about the markets. To me, the best telltale has always been the language that we choose. ""Language is the garment of thought."" I had to double-check who said that. I was thinking if it's William Wordsworth, but it was a little bit earlier than Wordsworth. In fact, it was the Scottish cultural critic, essayist, historian, mathematician, the list goes on, novelist, philosopher, Thomas Carlyle, who said, ""Language is the garment of thought,"" and I agree. I think you should too. I think the words that we choose very much both reveal our thinking, and also in some ways, in an interesting way, in future, guide our thinking and our actions.
The language that we choose guides our future actions. It's a telltale. I've always tried to be an acute listener of what are the terms and phrases that you and I are using about money. If we discover we're using something suboptimal, we're probably thinking suboptimally, and that means we're probably acting suboptimally. I'm here to raise my hand just like anybody else saying, ""I'm not perfect."" But one way I've tried to improve over time is by thinking about what is the language you are using, and that I am using, when we talk about money and the markets. I think we can upgrade our language, and upgrade our thinking, and upgrade our future actions.
Now, the reason this is something old is I've done this before. I have certainly spoken on this a number of times in the seven years of this podcast, and guess what? I'm about to do it again. Five terms come to mind here. We'll go with A, B, C, D, and E. There's no particular order to these, but the first term that's a telltale for me, discovering other's foolishness is, of course, the phrase, you'll never hear me use this otherwise, I'm about to invoke the data on Rule, which I'll explain to new listeners in a sec, ""long-term investor."" Investing, by its very nature, is long term. At some point, some years ago, I think in my 20s. I was probably saying long-term investing and long-term investor. I bet you could quote me, or find in the Motley Fool book, maybe the first edition of The Motley Fool Investment Guide, I might, myself, have written ""long-term investor.""
But we do get smarter and wiser over the years, don't we, fellow Fools? For me, long-term investor is a tautology. It is an unnecessary redundancy in our speech, and therefore, in our thoughts. Because the word ""investor"" stands on its own, I don't know, like a beautiful structure, like one of the great pyramids or the Eiffel Tower. Investor. It doesn't need to be modified by any adjectives because it itself means from the Latin that we are putting on the clothes. Like sports fans do for their favorite teams, we are wearing the clothes of the things we're invested in. We are fans. If that company that we've taken part ownership of, let's say Apple, if Apple has a bad quarter or a bad year, we're going to keep that jersey on. We're going to be an investor in the companies that enter our portfolios.
Now, I realize there are many approaches to the markets. I'm here to provide my classical viewpoint. I'm very tolerant of traders. To me, ""traders"" is the opposite of investors, and they have their charm. They're the other side of the same coin. There's a lot of shared exuberance and interest in the markets between investors and traders, but how we behave fundamentally is different. Investors are in it for the only term that counts, as I've always said, the long term.
Whereas, traders are generally trading in and out cycles of the market. Maybe they see a new trend coming, and they're going to rotate sectors, or they're looking at stock graphs, and deciding if it crosses the 35.59 line on my stock graph I'm going to buy or sell. There's a very big difference between investors and traders. In general, traders are acting inside of a year with their speculations, and investors are acting outside of a year -- more like a decade in my experience. That's a lot less speculative. In fact, that's a lot more predictable. Because in any given year, the stock market could go down 20% or up 40%, let's say. It could even be better or worse than those things. But over the long term, the rates of return, typically for the U.S. stock market, as I know, so many of you already know, are somewhere around 9% and 10%.
I like big numbers like that that are predictable, and so I'd like to let time make that happen for me in my portfolio. You will never hear me, going forward, and you haven't heard me for years now, ever say long-term investing or long-term investor. Indeed, if you ever are in my presence, and you hear me use either of those phrases, I license you now to walk up and give me a dead arm. That's the dead arm rule. I've put it out there for years. Nobody has dead-armed me for some time. I watch my language carefully. That's the point with something old, this week: Language counts. The words you choose say a lot about you. They determine, in many ways, how you will act in future, dear Investor.
Well, from A, the sad phrase, ""long-term investor,"" we'll go to B, ""correction.""
One of my favorite observations that I've made over the years, certainly on this podcast -- and I saw it make the rounds again last week on Twitter, thanks to a few of my followers. Might have been you Jam, might have been you, Jason, I can't remember. But thank you for helping everyone remember that the word ""correction"" is wrongheaded. It invariably is used to refer to the market dropping. We say, ""Wow, we're in for a correction,"" or ""that was quite a correction in that year."" And yet when you really think about the stock market and you look at the direction of the line over time, it goes lower left to upper right. For me, that's what feels correct. Now, the market does drop. It's never a straight lower left to upper right. But that we've somehow used the word correction to say that it's correcting, and we invariably use that to describe the market dropping to me has always been incorrect. So that's telltale foolishness term B.
Term C: The word ""dip."" As I've said many a time -- and that's the whole spirit of something old -- ""Dips wait for dips."" I truly believe you and I are best served by consistently investing into the market. I like every two weeks, I use that specifically because many people get paid every two weeks, twice a month with their salary and I think it's wonderful if you can save any of that paycheck, systematically pay yourself first and put some of your earnings right away into savings, and put those savings right away into funds in your 401(k) or your favorite new stock pick from Motley Fool Stock Advisor. I think it's just great to Always Be Investing -- A.B.I. On the other hand, a lot of people store up their money and think at some point, they're worried the market is going to drop, and then they fantasize that they'll be the one to have that money saved and put it in at the right moment, and waiting for the dip, they'll do better as an investor. What I think they often don't realize is the market tends to rise from one day or week or month to the next, and so you're paying quite an opportunity cost by parking money outside of the market over time and waiting for the proverbial dip. And that's why I will simply remind us, in my experience, dips wait for dips. I think we should all be always investing: A.B.I., all the time.
Term D -- this one has been used for decades now, and I guess ever since technology showed up, which I think is back to the Greeks, probably somebody was using the phrase ""tech stock."" But since I think Tom and I made our first appearance on CNBC in the 1990s, whenever anybody has used that phrase, I've tried to call it out. I certainly can do it very easily here on my podcast with my home crowd here. You'll understand this, but I don't really know what a tech stock is. That phrase has never meant very much to me, and I think people who say ""I'm exiting tech stocks"" or ""looking for a good tech stock"" should just drop the tech part of it and just talk about stocks and the companies they want to take part ownership of, because it was true in the 1990s, I think it's only even truer every day since -- technology increasingly is driving the world around us. It is ubiquitous. It is every bit as important to Walmart today as it was to Amazon in the 1990s or Intel in the 1980s. Or let's go back to General Electric a century ago. Technology, which a quick check of the dictionary reveals is ""The application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry"" -- yeah, that's been going on a long time, and it runs through many different companies.
I think we head-fake ourselves if we start saying, ""I'm looking for a tech stock."" Really I think you should be looking for a great company, and you will often find those companies that use new technologies, new approaches. I would even say corporate cultures involve so much innovation, in a sense, those are a technology. Really, I guess I'd like the word ""innovation"" more than technology. One thing you've never heard me say is ""tech stocks."" I also don't say growth stocks and value stocks, but we'll leave that for another time.
Anyway, term D, telltale foolishness, something old -- the tech stock.
That gets me to my final one -- E, related in the same mentality, and, in some ways, this one brings all of the others that I've just shared with you together. When I say that I don't like it when people refer to a company, stock as a ""name,"" ""Names, I'm looking for some good names."" Chris Hill and I have made jokes back and forth over Slack, over the Fool Slack since we can't see each other in Fool HQ, I'm looking forward to that opening sometime in 2022 ... But whenever one of us sees somebody use that, we'll often drop a Slack to the other guy and link to it.
Because to me the reason ""names"" are telltale foolishness is because it's usually used by people for whom that company, that stock, is just a name. They may not know what the company does. They probably couldn't tell you very much about who's leading that company. They might be pretty good at telling you where the stock is or what the ticker symbol is. But for many people again, I think for the traders out there, it is just about a name, and what's the next name? I threw these three names away for these other five names.
But for me at least and maybe for you, dear Fool as well, for me that gives such short shrift to what's really happening out there, which is that entrepreneurs are starting things with capital, creating a product or a solution that solves someone else's problem, or maybe introduces new possibilities into the world. And they get capital and they build a company. If they're doing it in a consciously capitalistic way, they're trying to create a win for everybody. Their customers, certainly -- otherwise, why do we have businesses? -- but their employees who drive the enterprise; partners and suppliers. If the environment is relevant, I hope you're treating the environment well. Great businesses are creating wins for everybody and why business truly does elevate humanity in such a wonderful way when it's done right and done well.
For me, that's not just a ""name."" Name so superficial relative to really what's happening there, which is human enterprises cooperating for the betterment of humanity. I want to be invested in that. That's why I think, over the last century, you can go from the lower left to the upper right as you look at the progress of the stock market, especially here in the United States of America, and I believe the exact same thing is going to happen in the century ahead and will become more of a global phenomenon. We will be talking about the strength of global markets, not just how great the U.S. stock market has been over the decades, not that we're the only great one. There have been some wonderful places to have had your money invested on planet Earth over the last century. But this model works and it's because of the complexity, the messiness to humanity.
But ultimately, here's some good news. I especially want to say that this week. The good guys outnumber the bad guys. They always have on planet Earth. The good guys don't get the headlines a lot of time, and sometimes they're just a name to somebody else, but we good guys far outnumber the bad guys. In conclusion, telltale foolishness, I hope is an opportunity whether you're hearing the phrase long-term investor, correction, dip, tech stocks, or names, I hope it will give you pause. Maybe enable you to give that other person pause as you talk out a little bit: What does that word really mean? What does it refer to and what's really happening out there? For my longtime listeners, I think you've heard these things before. You recognize this as something old. But the reason I like to bring something old right into the here and now is because many people -- especially newer listeners -- have not heard these things. If I'm challenging you, I would encourage you to challenge me back at the end of this month. Just like every month, there is the Rule Breaker Investing mailbag -- rbi@fool.com is our email address. If you think I'm missing something or if there's an F, G, H, or I term, something you'd like to add to my list as telltale foolishness, I would love to share that out later this month in our mailbag because I have no monopoly on good human insight on words and phrases about money and the markets. You can make me smarter just like I try to do that for you every week.
So share it out if you see something small ""f"" foolish.
Next, we go to something new. And my something new, I think a lot of us will recognize as having been around for millennia. But at the same time, especially here in the United States of America, it is ironically perhaps quite new. I'm talking about a way you can use your money that's different from investing. It's more akin to gambling because it literally is gambling. But the reason it's new is because sports betting has become a really big deal in the United States of America for a few factors we'll speak about in a minute. But it's become legal. Not only that it's become pretty big business whether we're talking about DraftKings, FanDuel, or your local bookie who may now be operating legally in the United States of America.
A few thoughts about sports betting. The first is, for me, it was always fine. It should always have been legal. Why can't you put down a wager? A speculation about the future with a friend of yours, whether it's about sports or what you think is going to happen in politics?
I love prediction markets. I love the increasing growth of prediction markets. It's been interesting for me to follow Metaculus -- if you haven't seen that site take a look, M-E-T-A-C-U-L-U-S -- some really interesting prediction markets about the state of the world today. That's just one site. There are many examples of this, but I think it was always fine to speculate. In a lot of ways, investing, of course, is speculating. I took pains to try to draw some distinctions between investing and trading with ""something old"" this week, but at its heart, they both involve you taking some of your money, letting go of it, speculating about the future, and being rewarded if you're right and penalized if you're wrong. Whether it is the performance of Apple's stock over the next year or your favorite sports team or some irrelevant sports teams -- some people don't like to bet on their own teams. That makes it hard sometimes, they like to bet on irrelevant games because it makes it more interesting for them.
But I want to reiterate first up. I think this always should have been legal and I'm fine with it. I've done it myself. Whether it's things like March Madness pools or just sitting there next to your friend at the game and saying, ""Hey, I think the next pitch is going to be a strike."" All of these things, I think, are fun. They're human. As long as we're not doing really silly stuff with our money, I think it's just fine. Sports betting -- checkmark, I get it. I think it should have been the industry that it is today all along, frankly. Second, why is it so here and now? Why is it something new?
Well, a few years ago, I had my friend Phil De Picciotto on this podcast, he's founder and president of Octagon. Basically, he's a sports agent and the sports agency here in greater Washington, D.C. Very successful man. He had some great insights about sports. One of them at the time was that stadiums are getting smaller. More of us are watching sports on TV. TV is becoming a bigger deal but things like ticket sales and concessions, those things are dropping. In the face of that, even with TV revenues and internet revenues going up, it's become pretty clear that whether you're the NBA or the NFL or any of the major sports, you were seeing some of your numbers decline. And meantime, there was this whole industry speculating, gambling on what's going to happen, and you had no participation in that because it was illegal even though a lot of people were still participating in the open air. It was, as we say, these days ""a thing."" Phil pointed out that sports betting will be replacing lost revenues in many cases for the major sports, which is why, point No. 3 -- you are increasingly seeing the infiltration of the coverage that we're getting from the media of our games today listing the lines of the game.
Like this team's supposed to win by 3 1/2 points, and you're actively seeing some of the color analysts and the studio people speaking to whether that's a good bet or not, a 3 1/2 point line. For some of you, you know sports betting a lot more than I do. You can talk to the complicated numbers in a way I can't because I don't do much of this. But for others of you, you may not even know what a line is. But a line is simply a number that Las Vegas buyers and sellers -- just like stock market buyers and sellers -- agree on as the legit reflection of our best understanding of the future. If we say the line for this week's game is the home team by 3 1/2, we're saying that it's a 50-50 bet. You could either bet that the home team will win by four or more points, or will win by three or fewer points or, of course, lose out. It's a 50-50 bet, which gets me to my final, and really, I guess, my most important point here, which is that I think this is a really bad way to try to make money. I'm all for entertainment. Some of my favorite companies and stocks are entertainment focused, whether it's something like Disney or Activision Blizzard or Netflix, the list goes on. I love entertainment, and I've already said I'm just fine with sports betting and betting in general. It's very human. It's happened for thousands of years. It's how the stock market works in a lot of ways, so I'm just fine with that. But here's a huge difference between sports betting and the stock market.
We've already talked about the stock market typically rising 9% to 10% per year. That is generative. That is progressive and constructive and good things come out of that. Good things make that happen from one year to the next. The huge difference with sports betting which is seemingly increasingly popular these days. The huge difference is that it is zero-sum. One of us is going to be right in the bet we talked about just a minute or two ago and the other guy's going to be wrong. It's not very different from flipping coins because the lines are set very efficiently and very intelligently. It's going to be about half of us win, half of us lose. Of course, the reason that DraftKings and Las Vegas and this whole industry exists is because they are ""the house."" They are like eBay. They're matching buyers and sellers, and they're taking their cut. The huge difference between sports betting -- and why I think it's a really bad way to try to make money in any way over the long term -- is because it is zero-sum, and we also take transaction fees out of each of your bets.
So I have friends -- maybe you do too -- who enjoy sports betting. I've done it once or twice, and I'm totally open to it, but I'd be the first ... and I hope every fellow Fool will hear me right now and share it out with friends and family. Of course, some people have serious problems around gambling. I'm not really speaking about that right now. I'm just speaking about how it's a really bad way to try to make money in this world. Every bet you make you could've instead invested in something that rises over time with a tailwind at your back. You can still have fun watching the games, and you can still make what people sometimes have called ""gentlemen's bets,"" which are basically free bets or bet a dollar. But if you think that you have any shot to make serious money persistently over the only term that counts -- the long term -- I would say you are dead wrong. The math is very obvious. Imagine if the stock market historically rose 0% a year, some years up, some years down, but it always centered back at the number 0%. I wouldn't be talking about it and the Motley Fool would not be promoting the idea that we should all be investors. Well, that's actually the world of betting.
Things center on 0% returns -- slightly less than that, though, because ""the house"" will take its piece. In conclusion, I hope you're making the best decisions with your own dollars, and if you're like me, you're slightly perturbed by the amount of increasing mainstream coverage that mainstream sports are getting specifically around, which is the way to bet on this particular game. I hope ""something new"" is connecting with you or those you know, and you'll make really good decisions for those hard-earned dollars that you surely did earn. They deserve better than sports betting.
We move from something old, something new, now to something borrowed. If I was a little too earnest with the first two points, I thought I could lighten it up a little bit here with something borrowed because when I thought, ""What should I borrow this time?"" I was reminded of some of the favorite pages from any of our past books that my brother Tom and I wrote together, and I even checked in with my producer Rick and I said, ""Rick, do you remember 'make your dog a trick dog' from our second book: You Have More Than You Think? It was an interlude in the middle of the book?""
And Rick, who is one of our longest-time, most-knowledgeable Fools said ""No, I don't recognize that at all."" So I think you, dear Fools, listening to me -- the chances that you actually know what ""make your dog a trick dog"" refers to is probably, maybe less than 2% of us listening, so this is definitely worth bringing back [as] ""something borrowed."" So, I'm going to be doing a short dramatic reading from our book You Have More Than You Think. But before I get there, let me briefly explain what the heck I mean by ""make your dog a trick dog.""
So, The Motley Fool's first book, Tom and I wrote, The Motley Fool Investment Guide, it was published in 1996. It was about the stock market, and that's the one we've recently updated a couple of years ago to refresh it. Because if you're trying to write an investment classic, you probably should give it a fresh look every decade or so. It had been a little while for The Motley Fool Investment Guide. But after that first book we thought, what's a good follow-up? And with Simon and Schuster, our publisher, we decided, let's broaden it. The first book was about the stock market. The second book is going to be about money. Even if you're not ready to invest, how can we get everybody in the world, all of whom, I hope, have at least a shekel, a dollar, or a yen. How can we inspire people to save that shekel, and find more shekels, and ultimately invest them so that you can do that magical trick that we love at The Motley Fool in this world, -- you can have your money make more money for you, which is another wonderful way of thinking about the stock market. You Have More Than You Think is what we called our second book. I love that phrase. It's really the spirit of The Motley Fool to help all of us as we democratize this subject and make you realize you don't need somebody with an expensive suit who tells you you don't know what you're doing. You don't need that person to manage your money for you. You can do this yourself.
You're certainly going to need to make some money yourself and save some money yourself, so that was the purpose of our book, You Have More Than You Think, and it was a lot of fun to write. But at about the midpoint of that book, we thought: ""Let's have some fun, just like halftime in some sports like football or soccer -- halftime has some follies and a little bit of whimsy. Let's do that right in the middle of our book, You Have More Than You Think.""
The framework for it was, ""Well, hey we've spent the first half of this book talking about how to make some money and save some money. We thought, let's have fun. Let's remind you and me that making money is actually easier than many people think in this world.""
I think it was Tom who in that chapter pointed out that there are a lot of cash registers worldwide where there's this little cup next to it and it says, ""Take a penny, leave a penny."" Right there, that's literally free money sitting out there, and whether or not we counseled our readers to just take and not give, I won't say. But it's a reminder that there are a lot more opportunities around us. We started with the first of eight moneymaking ideas in You Have More Than You Think. And it was make your dog a trick dog. I'm not going to replicate that one here. I'm going to share a different one this time. But basically, take your dog, teach it some tricks, and then at the farmers market this Saturday, bring your dog down, put a hat out. Now that your dog is a trick dog, we think you're going to make some money. You're going to have some fun, create some entertainment at your local farmers market by making your dog a trick dog.
So there's certainly some tongue in cheek throughout this interlude, throughout what I'm sharing with you this week. But the spirit of, ""Hey, use some imagination,"" you can make some more money and save some more money better by using your imagination -- that part is true. So make your dog a trick dog instead of just a dog. I think I'm reading here from page 114 of the paperback edition of You Have More Than You Think when I say -- we framed it up this way, we now proudly present eight original and brilliant entrepreneurial ideas that we call ""trick dogs.""
""Every one of them can be done right now, requires minimal start-up cash or none at all, few additional materials, and no previous experience. All you have to do is finish reading, set down the book, exit the room, and begin. It's that easy, the future is now.""
And at that point in the book, we launch into ""make your dog a trick dog,"" which I've already referenced. It's funnier to read it out than I just summarized and I could have shared that with you this week, maybe I will in some upcoming podcast, but I wanted to skip, pass ""make your dog a trick dog"" and ""bottle your own water"" and ""borrow your friends' books and sell them"" and ""command your own squeegee army"" and go to No. 5, something borrowed this week on Rule Breaker Investing. Here we go: ""Attend the bathroom at expensive restaurants."" I'm reading from Page 118,
""One touch of elegance missing at even the most extravagantly outfitted restaurants today is a well-dressed, completely equipped bathroom attendant. Do you know how to spell opportunity? Before starting, you're going to need to bring with you the proper accouterments. Most of these can either be found around your own bathroom or be purchased at your local pharmacy superstore. Everything is a superstore these days.""
""Fill a large shoebox with cotton balls, fragrance bottles, dental floss, hand lotion, nail clippers, Q-Tips, deodorant, and the always-essential mustache comb for men or mustache clippers for women. Now, you just need to set up, so put on a good dark suit or dress, and select the most expensive restaurant in town. Do not make the mistake of going anything but first class. Pass furtively and directly back to the bathroom of your gender. Open up your shoebox beside you, lay a clean white towel over one forearm, and then just stand there inside the bathroom entrance very much minding your own business. Believe it or not, most of your money has already been made. Just by standing there, beaming with professionalism, you'll land a steady flow of tips.""
""'Up your salary' by pretending to clean the place, scurrying about as they stand over a urinal or enter the stalls or primp themselves before the reflecting glass. For many, this will be enough, but aggressive entrepreneurs can bring in so much more money with just a bit more effort. Start ahead of time by removing the rolls of toilet paper from every stall. Once your patrons are seated, nature running its course, gently, deliver your question. ""Will you be needing any tissue paper?"" To which they will respond, startled, that yes, of course they will. Tempted as you may be to charge them for it, restrain yourself. Instead, just drop them the roll, consider the service complete, and collect their inevitable and often quite high tip as they exit. But before they're out the door, do spruce them up a bit. A quick roll down their back with the old adhesive lint remover may be appreciated. The key is to be deliberate but not forceful. It may take practice.""
""OK, at some point, somebody will question you or complain to the manager. You'll find out just how good a restaurant this really is during the inevitable confrontation. If you get kicked out, good riddance. You didn't want to work in that place anyway, and there are a bunch of other joints where you can apply your trade. But any restaurant worth its chef should congratulate you and hire you on the spot. After all, they should be asking themselves, 'Why weren't we providing this service to our patrons already, charging the prices we do?' Plus, hey, you were even bringing your own stuff with you. The restaurant had failed to provide its own dental floss and nail clippers, and it took someone with energy and vision to correct this ... all the way to the bank.""
And that is the end of that particular section. After it, ""make your car collector's item,"" ""be a broker to the world,"" and, of course, the closing, ""take a few pennies, don't leave a penny."" Each of these truly is timeless. It's a delight to go back and read something written in 1998 and think about how, yeah, you probably could still bottle your own water and make some money in this world anyway. Attend the bathroom at expensive restaurants -- something borrowed.
Now to close: Something blue. I'm blue this week. Are you? I think a lot of people are pretty blue this week and in more than one way. But speaking just for my own self this week, I'm blue for a personal reason, and that is that this past week, I lost my uncle, Jimmy Lowe. Indeed, his life is being celebrated today just after I finish this recording, and I want to speak about being blue and my Uncle Jimmy, though I'm not going to even try adequately to sum up his life and what he meant to many. Heck, you can Google ""Jimmy Lowe obituary"" and the top hit will give you lots of biographical information about this fine man.
Now, when I thought about what to do for blue for this week's show, my first thought hadn't been about my Uncle Jimmy, it was instead to share one of my five favorite poems this week. It's been a while since we shared a good poem together on the Rule Breaker Investing podcast, so I combed back through one of my lists -- I keep many lists, and one of them is my five favorite poems.
I did a quick text search of them for the word ""blue"" -- what else? -- and indeed, one of my five favorite poems at present does contain the word blue, and ""something blue"" is going to enable me to read you that beautiful, bluetiful sonnet in just a bit. But then, when my Uncle Jimmy died, I felt additionally blue, and it gave me something else to reflect on. My Uncle Jimmy was always of this world, but as he made it into his mid-80s, it's fair to say that he was naturally and increasingly recognizable as an old-world figure in the best way -- an old-world gentlemen. He went to the same schools I did, up to college. Both Episcopalian schools, St. Albans in Washington, D.C., and St. Mark's in Southborough, Massachusetts. I had the pleasure of going to both of those with my cousin, his son, Garrett. All three of us, actually, whether we were bulldogs at St. Albans or Lions of St. Mark's, all three of us on the athletic fields wore blue: Yep, that was the color of those schools. And from there, my uncle Jimmy went on to Yale and Yale Law School, more bulldogs, by the way, more blue. And Uncle Jimmy loved his schools and he served on school boards, he was a generous benefactor, one of those guys who still got misty-eyed and wistful when thinking back to his schoolboy days and worked to make those just as special for his kids and his kids' kids. As I, feeling blue this week, prepare to drive down to historic St. John's Church right here in Washington, D.C., near the White House to celebrate a life near and dear to many, I also then noticed that the poem I'm about to share with you that includes the word blue, is perhaps the most beautiful in the English language to capture flight. Flight in combat, no less written by a combat pilot.
Combat -- very much on our minds this week, making millions, if not billions of people this week feeling, well, blue too. Then I thought just to look into the poet of this poem, High Flight, which was alluded to once famously when Ronald Reagan spoke after the Challenger disaster. And who was this poet? This 19-year-old poet who wrote High Flight and then tragically died just a few months after. John Gillespie Magee Jr. -- not a name today that connects with most of us, and so I wanted to remind myself of who this man was, who used the word ""blue"" in this poem, which really is the only reason I thought to include it this week. But then two more reasons showed up. The first because if you're like me, whenever you see or think blue this week because of this week, where we are in history right now, you see a second color right alongside it and it inspires you. You see blue and gold. You see it on many flags out there, you see it projected on the Eiffel Tower or that skyscraper in your city and you recognize that this gold and blue are bringing many of us together in ways that are deeply felt and deeply important, and so we think blue for that first reason. But then I also noticed -- and in a way, this is purely coincidental and maybe in another way it's not -- but this poem High Flight was enclosed by Magee in a letter to his parents shortly before Magee was killed in his Spitfire VCH plane flying in 1941 for the Royal Canadian Air Force.
Despite being in the United States at the time, since the U.S. had not yet entered World War II, Magee had crossed the border into Canada, so he could join someone, some countries, some air force in order to fight the evil of Hitler. Magee, who was from a well-heeled family like my Uncle Jimmy. Magee didn't have to volunteer or fight at all, but fight he did, and that poem reached his parents in Washington, D.C., perhaps the last thing that they would receive from him, before his untimely death at 19.
Coincidence or not, where was that letter, that poem mailed? Well, to the city from which I broadcast to you today to the very church, where, blue, I am headed in a minute for memorial services, historic St. John's Episcopal Church, which my Uncle Jimmy loved and at which he served and attended for decades and the same church that John Gillespie Magee Jr.'s father was in 1941, when he received that letter as the curate. As I realize this, as you can see, with much swirling together, I felt even more blue.
But now, I mean by that blue, that blue of the gold and blue, not sad blue, the proud blue is what I felt. And blue, I will now share with you this poem which you may have heard before, but which is now even more, one of my favorites, High Flight by John Gillespie Magee Jr.
Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings; Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
Of sun-split clouds — and done a hundred things
You have not dreamed of — wheeled and soared and swung
High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there,
I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung
My eager craft through footless halls of air...
Up, up the long, delirious burning blue,
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
Where never lark or even eagle flew —
And while with silent lifting mind, I've trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.
High Flight, this week, was dedicated to my Uncle Jimmy Lowe, and more broadly and connected in to the things that count, to the gold and the blue.

Many people feel eBay is yesterday’s news in the e-commerce space. But these latest numbers prove otherwise.
Digital Realty Trust (DLR)

Digital Realty Trust provides data center and office space for some of the world’s leading cloud companies. The company is a highly specialized, data-focused real estate investment trust that owns over 285 data centers in 26 countries.
The company’s latest quarterly earnings totaled $1.1 billion, or $3.71 per share, up from last year’s total of $44.18 million, or $0.16 per share. The company’s improving margins are in part due to increased bookings for the quarter. Revenue for the quarter grew 4.7% to $1.11 billion from $1.06 billion last year.

Upstart partners with banks and credit unions to provide consumer loans for people that don’t qualify for traditional loans. Non-traditional variables like your level of education or employment are considered when deciding whether you’ll get a loan.
The company is able to assess credit risk factors that other companies cannot because of machine learning. Due to the greater accuracy, they’ll allow banks to lend money to people with a lower risk.

Lincoln Electric Holdings (LECO)

Lincoln Electric manufactures arc welding equipment and other products, ranging from consumable welding to welding and cutting equipment.
The company is well-positioned thanks to the strong product development pipeline and its industry-leading position in automation. The large investments they’ve been making in additive and other technologies mean that the company is not only financially sound, but will also have room to perform acquisitions.
Based on the promising trends we are seeing in the U.S., it is most likely that we are in the early stages of an industrial expansion cycle. It is a big deal because it means that after years of slow productivity growth, there is now the possibility for more robust economic growth for the foreseeable future. Companies like Lincoln Electric will benefit massively from this.
8 Strong Uptrend Stocks to Buy on the Next Dip
The Lincoln Electric Company reported strong quarterly earnings last month. Their Q4 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.61 per share, up 29.8% year-over-year. The bottom line jumped by approximately 30% over the previous year. Revenue for Q4 came in at $74.4 million.
Best New Stocks: Visteon Corporation (VC)

An automotive industry supplier, Visteon manufactures automotive products, including ride performance and clean air systems. With all the talk about the electric vehicle revolution, it is no surprise that companies focused on this are among the best new stocks to buy.
The company is seeing strong earnings growth catalysts. Visteon reported net sales of $786 million for the 3 months period ending Dec.31, 2021, 15% growth year-over-year. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) came in $92 million because sales were strong, prices rose, and the cost of designing new models declined.
They expect new product ramps, favorable pricing, and strong margin growth. Visteon has one of the most stable balance sheets of any auto supplier and they’re likely to use it to finance new developments.
United States Steel Corp. (X)

Infrastructure is one of the key themes that has emerged during President Joe Biden’s administration. The President feels that construction is one of the industries that will lead the American revival. A host of stocks in the steel sector are doing well in this environment.
U.S. Steel first made an impression on the industry during the Industrial Revolution, established in 1901 by banker J.P. Morgan and named after Andrew Carnegie’s company to merge with others in the same industry. This company has been declining in recent years and has struggled to maintain its market share against foreign competition and emerging technologies.

U.S. Steel has divested their less profitable business to focus on the things they do best and become a force in the steel industry again. The company cited the efficiency of operations as one of the reasons for divestment. With the industrial renaissance in full swing, United States Steel is in a great position.
Best New Stocks: Intuit (INTU)

Intuit offers several different products to help with taxes: Quicken for personal finance management, TurboTax for filing taxes online, QuickBooks for small business accounting needs, and Lacerte Accounting for general accounting needs.
It is again growing in popularity leading up to tax season as software traders take more notice. The maker of TurboTax and other financial software has been declining this year due to broader trends of selling off software-related investments. Intuit has some good points going for it compared to other software brands.
Intuit is not just a company that creates tax-preparation software. It has also purchased Credit Karma of financial technology fame, which gives it a more diverse platform for its products. Intuit’s financial and accounting tools are expanding beyond TurboTax and QuickBooks. This expansion should result in higher profitability and cash flow generation for Intuit.
Roku (ROKU)

During the year thus far, high-growth stocks have been under tremendous selling pressure. Streaming giant Roku is no different. Year-to-date, Roku is down around 55%.
You can blame the broader market. But there is also some responsibility that the company has to shoulder. Investment analysts were left disappointed with the end-of-quarter performance report. The management team guided total revenue to be about $893 million during the quarter but only delivered $865 million. They’re also expecting revenue to grow by an amount lower than what Wall Street expects in the first quarter.
7 Funds to Buy to Sidestep the Stock Market Volatility
However, Roku has seen a huge share increase in recent years, as more and more people ditch linear TV for streaming. Plus, they’re now available in Smart TVs, so they’ve got a whole new market opening up — meaning great growth opportunities. It is very cheap per share right now, so it is not a bad time to pick some ROKU stock while you can.
Best New Stocks: Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)
Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com
Domino’s Pizza is a fast-food restaurant chain. They have been expanding to other countries in recent years. They are also the third-largest pizza chain globally, after Pizza Hut and Papa John’s Pizza (NASDAQ:PZZA).
Domino’s Pizza is a company that has been around for decades. The company has seen growth in recent years, attributed to its expansion and its focus on fresh ingredients and new recipes.
Analysts are predicting that Domino’s share price will take a dip due to slower sales and substantial cost inflation. Domino’s has benefited massively from the stay-at-home trend, but now that people are returning to work, they’re likely not ordering as many pizzas as they used to. However, the company has the money to outlast any short-term headwinds. And some of the rising demand from people ordering delivery may last longer as they get used to ordering from the Domino’s app due to many factors.
The company has grown over the past decade, but the most recent growth has been astute. The team has a great strategy to create shareholder value while buying their shares.
Sherwin-Williams (SHW)

Newer companies in the paint industry have tried to take over, but Sherwin-Williams has been able to maintain its dominant position for years. The company has an impressive product line spread across both the residential and commercial sectors. They also have a huge customer base — millions all over the country. That said, they’ve managed to maintain high brand awareness, too.
Since Sherwin-Williams is a major player in the paint industry, it is not surprising that it has seen steady growth over the last few years. The heating up of the housing market has helped spur activity in the market. Thanks to this, Sherwin-Williams is one company that has seen a big bump. They’ve managed to prosper as they’re closely connected to professions like painting and home improvement.
7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever
This is good news for investors who want to buy into this company because it means that Sherwin-Williams’s future also looks bright.

2022-03-12 00:00:00+00:00,Ebay Is Joining the NFT and Crypto Party. But Should It?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-is-joining-the-nft-and-crypto-party.-but-should-it,,,"In addition to being able to buy and sell NFTs on eBay, users may soon be able to use crypto for transactions on the platform. In this Motley Fool Live segment from ""The Virtual Opportunities Show,"" recorded on March 1, Fool contributors Rachel Warren, Travis Hoium, Demitri Kalogeropoulos, and Jose Najarro discuss why this could be a strong move for the company to attract its target demographic.
{% sfr %}
Rachel Warren: This was really interesting and unexpected, I think. I guess I shouldn't be surprised because we are seeing a lot of movement in the direction of a lot of companies you might not associate with being really friendly toward crypto and NFTs. But eBay, so there was an interesting article on thestreet.com and it was saying eBay might take crypto payments and that it already accepts NFTs, which I'll get to in a second. In a phone interview with thestreet.com, the head of eBay was saying, basically they really want to be targeting as a marketplace for Gen Z and millennial consumers, specifically, which I thought was really interesting. The CEO said, ""We're just completing our transition to managed payments, where we are now managing $85 billion of volume on our platform directly."" This is the CEO, Jamie Iannone, he told the Street this, he said, ""This gives us the ability to open up new forms of payment."" According to this report, they are studying the possibility of adding cryptocurrencies as a possible means of payment. The firm could make an announcement on March 10th during its day dedicated to investors, he told The Street.
I don't know, it's interesting because they obviously don't currently accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment on the platform. But again, if they're specifically targeting this consumer base of Gen Z users and millennials, it makes sense that they are trying to expand into these areas where maybe wouldn't automatically think eBay would expand to. One thing I did not realize was that eBay had already stepped into the NFT space. One of the things he noted in this interview with The Street, he said, ""We did change our policies last year so that you could trade NFT on the platform. Essentially know eBay is a place for people who have something to sell and people who have something by showing up. Even without announcing anything or doing anything, people started trading NFTs on the platform,"" he told The Street.
Again, I had no clue that people were buying and selling NFTs on eBay. Again, completely blew my mind, so I almost feel like that's maybe almost bigger news and that they might been expecting crypto as a form of payment. But something to watch and given that their Investor Day is just what is that about nine days away from now, we could be getting a much larger and more detailed announcement. But the story on The Street has got quite a bit of attention in the fact that you might be able to buy and sell things using crypto in addition to already being able to buy and sell NFTs. That seems like a really strong move to attract that demographic they're trying to, so really interesting.
Travis Hoium: It'll be really interesting to see if they're like a legacy company like this, is able to move into some of these new markets. As I follow-up crypto and NFTs more specifically, it's been interesting to see who is trying to move into this market, and there's some that makes sense and there's some, it's like, what are we doing? [laughs] This one seems a little bit like a stretch. If now I still think of eBay as, I'm in my late 30s, I'm at the lower age range of people who like eBay was the coolest thing ever. As we have OpenSea and Magic Eden and these NFT native platforms. That's where they are ultimately competing with, and I have a hard time seeing how they're going to move projects that are growing in those platforms to a legacy platform like eBay.
Cryptocurrency is a little bit different because I see that more as like just a transaction medium and it doesn't have to be. I could say, hey, I need US dollars, but you want to pay me in a cryptocurrency. Then behind the scenes that I will just like the back legwork of the transaction happens. I can see that taking place. But so that's an interesting move, at least for the usage of cryptocurrency. I don't know what your thoughts are, Jose.
Demitri Kalogeropoulos: I know eBay's payments and their advertising are two of the only areas that are growing at the moment because they've got so much merchandise volume through the pandemic and now they're having a growth hangover from that. I know the stock dropped, I think it was last week, I think they reported their earnings. Interestingly enough, it was a little bit different than, I think Rachel follows Etsy a bit which that stock was that they had some better numbers in terms of growth, more buyers are moving to the Etsy platform. This could be one way that eBay is trying to get more people back on there if they can make it a more attractive program for sellers, it seems like they're trying to entice buyers back on in that way, but it's a little bit of a tough battle there.
Rachel Warren: I'm of the mind that any of these companies that have that digital first aspect. I think that they can enter this space with NFTs and crypto a little bit more easily than perhaps some others. But it will be interesting to see. I guess this whole NFT thing with people trading on eBay, wasn't super well-known because The Street article noted that there wasn't really any big announcement that they made. It almost sounded as if people recognized the ability to do that on the platform and just started doing it. I would doubt it's anywhere close to the volume you're seeing on some of these specific platforms like OpenSea, for example, that are designed to be a place that's a marketplace for NFTs.
But I do think one thing you might be seeing more, and I'm always like a little bit crypto-skeptic, like I like it but I'm just not totally sure what I think. I think companies that maybe in the future don't accept crypto as a form of payment, maybe they'll be getting left a little bit behind, so maybe they are trying to be ahead of the curve, but it will be interesting to see.
Jose Najarro: Yeah, definitely I agree there with all these points, especially Travis. There are certain companies that are getting into the space that, hey, it makes sense, and there's other companies that don't make sense. For eBay, I think being a e-commerce store in theory it makes sense. You're a e-commerce platform, you want to bring new people. But the last time I purchased something on eBay, I think it was a year ago and it's usually something that's used or some form of collectible, my uncle, he is like a huge airplane fighter collector, the models, and I don't think he would ever use a crypto way to purchase that product.
Crypto has definitely seen better adoption in the younger generation; Gen Next, Gen Z, or whatever they were called. But I think maybe like Etsy, one that Rachel follows, Etsy for sure that would make more sense because I feel that generation of consumers already there and they are heavily adopted with this market. Definitely pretty interesting. I definitely want to read more about how they are doing the NFT trading and how they are able to keep track of that. But that's probably something I'll dig a little bit deeper later on.
Travis Hoium: Yeah. I was trying to look at that as you were talking because in a traditional NFT market, it's a smart contract. You say, I will give you some cryptocurrency and you give me the NFT but the transaction happens immediately. Any royalty or anything like that, that happens automatically on the platform. If you're not paying with cryptocurrency, I don't know how you would do that with an NFT.
Rachel Warren: Well, there are some companies I know that will let you do actual cash, for example, I'm trying to remember if it's Nifty Gateway is one NFT platform. It's either Nifty Gateway, or Foundation clearly even researching about this slightly because I'm into it, but you can pay for NFT using a debit or credit cards or maybe that's was an option.
Travis Hoium: Yeah. In a lot of those, what they end up doing is they take your cash from your credit card or debit card and they turn it into cryptocurrency and then they make the transaction. I'm just looking on eBay right now and that doesn't appear to be what's happening, but I'm not sure.
Rachel Warren: Weird. [laughs]
Travis Hoium: Yeah [laughs]. Just thinking back on what you guys are saying though. I agree, this makes more sense than like Walmart in the metaverse. [laughs]
Rachel Warren: I'm still wanting to see what are they going to be doing. Actually, I'm fascinated. But we'll see.

David Gardner: Thirty separate times, about every 10 weeks on this podcast, over six years, I picked five stocks. I chose a theme that made sense to me at the time, sometimes sublime, sometimes silly, and then I thought to myself, what are the five best recommendations that I can come up with for stocks that fit that theme? Aiming, of course, always to beat the market, the S&P 500, because otherwise, why are we bothering? Then one year later, we reviewed the picks and then another year passes, the two-year review. Two-years later, we never forget, we hope you wouldn't also. We score everything transparently and accountably because we're Fools, you should expect that of us, and I would say yourself too. Then the three-year review, which is going to be the most telling, and why is that? Well, first, because three years have passed since I picked the five stocks, we really can be smarter about what has happened and why, and what we can learn with the greater passage of time.
That's the smarter part. But if I've done my job well then, we'll also be happier, we hope richer too. Now, that three-year review is also important because most of the time, we end the game right there. We're going to keep holding these stocks in real life, mind you, you should too, if you own them, but if I kept reviewing all 30 of my samplers in years 4, 5 and 6, etc, well, we wouldn't have time to do much else on this podcast. Thirty separate times I picked five stocks, what I've also called my Five Stock Samplers, and we're going to review three of those samplers this week. Five Stocks Rolled Up at Random, Five Stocks that Spark Joy, and Five Stocks Shrouded in Mystery. Review them, we will with my three analysts. Guest star Sanmeet Deo, Asit Sharma, and Rick Munarriz, only on this week's Rule Breaker Investing.
Welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing. It's rare that I start a show already talking about next week's show, but I'm going to do that briefly this week. A couple of years ago, Chris Hill joined me for Rule Breaker Investing, and we did, I think one of my more memorable podcasts. Together, Chris and I did the day the market crashed. It was a simulation like Orson Welles, War of the Worlds, radio broadcast for those who know that history. But we were just having fun, it was of course made up. The market wasn't crashing that week. But we did a live seeming podcast, just to process what that would feel like, and sound like for you, our dear listeners. We've heard back many times over the years, this is one that people have gone back to and that the market happened to go down 30 percentage points or so within a few months. Well, we didn't intend that, we weren't expecting that, but it was helpful in that regard. Well, Chris is going to come back and join me next week and we're going to do something special. Again, I hope we're not exactly repeating what we did, well, I'll just let you experience that next week, but really excited to have Chris and some guests joining us for a special edition of Rule Breaker Investing next week. That's then, this is now, we're going to be looking over three, Five-Stock Samplers this week.
I always enjoy these episodes, I hope you do too. It's our opportunity to see what happened to stocks that were picked 1, 2, and 3 years ago this week or so. We've got three different samplers, one dated one year, another, two, and one we'll be sending off to Foolhalla after its three-year run. They are in order, Five Stocks Rolled Up at Random, Five Stocks that Spark Joy, and Five Stocks Shrouded in Mystery. I'm about to get started with the first of those, the one that's one year old, Five Stocks Rolled Up at Random. I don't really want to review that one, but we will be in a minute. But first, let me just speak about Five Stock Samplers and Reviewapalooza episodes for new listeners. From the earliest days of the Fool, we've always said it's so important not just to talk the talk, but to walk the walk. I mean, that for me and for my brother Tom, when we first started The Motley Fool as a newsletter we thought we could write about stocks and write about our thoughts.
But wouldn't it make more sense for us to pick stocks too, to walk the walk as it were, instead of merely talking the talk. From our earliest days of the Fool, the fun of being in the game, skin in the game, accountability, the benefits to our learning, which I'll speak about in a sec, have always been so powerful. Talking the talk and walking the walk underlies so much of The Motley Fool's work, but of course, it's right in the heart of these Five Stock Samplers. The second thing I want to say about walking the walk is if you're walking the walk, that's great, but you know what, you should also be scoring the walk. This is one of my cardinal teams on Rule Breaker Investing. It's one thing to pick a stock, it's an entirely different thing to score how that stock's doing, to score against the market's average, and of course, more broadly, to score your portfolio, not just that stock against the market average year-in and year-out. I think you'll get so much better not just talking the talk and not just walking the walk, but scoring the walk, because point number three, when you score, you learn. There's no substitute for the learnings that come from lived experience.
That goes for your winners and your loser, and we'll be talking about both of those this particular week on Rule Breaker Investing. But there's really no way to know that you're not doing it right, unless you start seeing some negative feedback in the form of red numbers or poor performance. Nobody likes it, I sure don't, but as the person who I still think has picked more bad stocks than anyone else in Motley Fool history, I can tell you that it's been really important to me to learn from the mistakes that I've made and of course also, I would say even more importantly, to learn from what's working. That's a forgotten art. Sometimes, a lot of people talk about the importance of learning lessons from what failed, I get it, but I love to learn lessons from what is working because that's surely what we want to do more of and figure out over the course of time.
Walking the walk, but scoring and scoring because you learn. I guess the last thing I want to say before we get started with this Reviewapalooza, this is a tip to any financial professional, that's what our analysts and advisors are at The Motley Fool. I've never really thought of myself this way, but I guess I'm a financial professional and that's what we are. You're going to build trust with your clientele when you're talking the talk, walking the walk, scoring the walk, and learning from the score. I think any financial professional listening to me right now is highly encouraged. If you're not already doing all of those, and I bet a lot of you are, if you're a Fool, you probably are, but in my experience, a lot of people in the financial world are not necessarily going through all of those steps. But if you do, you're going to separate yourself from all the others because you're going to be building trust, and don't we need a little bit more of that in this world? Well, as we all want to do on this podcast, it's time to go back in time.
It wasn't so long ago, January 21st, 2021 the market was in a very different place than it is right now. In fact, the market has had some real undulations up and down since January 21st, 2021. On that week's podcast, I pick Five Stocks Rolled Up at Random. I'm about to invite my friend Sanmeet Deo on to review this sampler but let me say about the market that even though it's really been suffering in recent weeks and months, the S&P 500 is up 16.9 percent. We'll just call that an even 17, since January 21st of 2021. So that's the mechanical hair that all of our greyhound stocks are chasing here 17 percent take it all-in-all. That's a really wonderful overall year for the stock market now. It hasn't felt that for a lot of our stocks and let's see how Five Stocks Rolled Up at Random are doing. Sanmeet Deo, how are you doing, sir?
Sanmeet Deo: I'm doing great. Thanks for having me again.
David Gardner: Excellent. Thank you. You and I were just talking off the air about the Texas basketball team and a big win over Kansas this week and the burnt Orange. I know that football accounts for more in your home State of Texas, but it's nice to know that there's some basketball excitement these days around Austin.
Sanmeet Deo: Yeah, for sure and the coach is really trying to get that fan engagement with basketball. He knows that it's a tough road when you have such an entrenched football fan base. But he's doing his best to get them excited for basketball as well, especially with the new arena coming next year.
David Gardner: Well, that is exciting and sports are exciting and something you and I enjoy but maybe we should just return back to the stock market which is what centers us. Let's talk about Five Stocks Rolled Up at Random. Now, no requirement on your part, Sanmeet, to go back and relisten to that podcast from a year ago. But can you maybe briefly summarize why they were Five Stocks Rolled Up at Random?
Sanmeet Deo: Yeah, this was fun. I did relisten to it, and it was a cool way to do a Five-Stock Sampler. Usually, you have your samplers with themes and this theme was really just random. You randomly pick 10 stocks and then you pick five from those, so it's an interesting way to play the Five-Stock Sampler game and we'll see how the results turned out for the year [laughs] and going forward as well. But one thing I love about these samplers is that they are samples, so many of the samples have done well just from picking themes and picking stocks from that big universe, so they're all almost random to some extent.
David Gardner: Well, choosing the theme definitely is not and that's always been a fun thing for me to do overtime. Then thinking of what stocks best exhibit that theme always gets you as you're saying, Sanmeet, into a smaller group. I've only ever done five stocks at a time and certainly, a portfolio is not about five stocks. But with that said, the five stocks that I rolled up at random in alphabetical order are Apple, Atlassian, SolarEdge Technologies, Starbucks, and Teladoc. Again, they are competing against in S&P 500 up 17 percent. Let's start as we do traditionally with the worst performer, and wow, it's been a hard year for Teladoc,, it was at $246.74 about a year ago. Today, it's below 70. This stock, Sanmeet is down 72 percentage points in its first year as part of this sampler. Previously, big winner for Motley Fool Rule Breakers combining two companies, well, let's talk about that a little bit. What is the number one reason in your mind that Teladoc has lost three quarters or so of its value in the past year?
Sanmeet Deo: If I could choose just a short phrase, I would say pandemic pull forward. The pandemic was rough for all of us in general, for many reasons, but for many businesses that actually pull forward a lot of revenues and their business trends. While that was good in 2020 for their businesses, meeting those expectations and continuing that growth and continuing those trends in the later years in 2021 has proved very challenging for some RNAs, one specifically Teladoc, which if the listeners aren't aware of yet, it's a virtual healthcare services company on a B2B basis, covering various clinical conditions and offering telehealth for chronic condition management, extra medical services, behavioral health. It serves health employers, health plans, hospitals, and insurance companies through brands such as Teladoc, Livongo, BetterHelp and etc. They're a global leader in this virtual care space, they have over 12,000 clients, 51.5 million US paid members, and 10.5 million medical visits in 2020. Now, with those numbers, you would think, why is this stock down like it is.
David Gardner: This is the age of telemedicine. I mean, that was my thinking anyway and it felt like that's what was happening during this pandemic.
Sanmeet Deo: Yeah, one of the themes I've noticed with some of these pandemic winners is it brought forward trends that were already in process. But because of the shutdowns in the extreme nature of the way we lived during the pandemic, those trends were accelerated. We couldn't go see the doctor, we couldn't take care of our health the way we would have. We looked at companies like Teladoc to provide those services that we couldn't do in person, so seeing our doctor when we need to virtually, getting mental healthcare when we needed it virtually. Those are things that really drove the business and while that drove the business, now, they've come off that high, so to speak, and revenues are slowing down, although they were at a rapid clip over the past four quarters of over 100 percent.
Slowing down, disappointment with membership revenue growth. One analyst had estimated only 1-5 percent year-over-year membership growth from 2021-2024 going forward. The market really thinks that this pull forward is not sustainable post COVID. Because of these, the stock had gotten overvalued and expectations had run high, so now, they're playing catch-up with expectations in terms of revenue, membership, growth, and all those things. Also, another theme that's been particularly for them is competition. The big elephant in the room of Amazon with their Amazon Care, which they announced today is being rolled out broadly. Walmart, GoodRx, lots of companies are getting into the space so that competition has also been an overhang on the stock.
David Gardner: Well said, and yeah, as we speak and we are recording the afternoon of Tuesday, February 8th, Teladoc is down another seven percent today, and I'm assuming that is in sympathy. Well, actually, empathy maybe for shareholders of that Amazon announcement. Well, that's Teladoc. Again, this is a company that had a $40 billion market gap within the last year, down to an $11 or $12 billion market gap. This is not the only so-called pandemic stock that is taken it seriously on the chin, Peloton, but that's for another Five-Stock Sampler or another day. There are other examples, but I know you feel the same way I do, but I feel it incumbent upon us to say, Sanmeet, to all of our listeners that we're in it for the long term with these companies. So it's very frustrating to watch some of our Rule Breakers stocks get cut in half or more since it happened many times before. I like to stay in there when the tailwinds behind companies and their solutions are in place and I do believe telemedicine is a wind that's going to keep blowing in our back and keeping our boats moving forward even though, wow, we faced a huge headwind here in 2021. Well, let's move from the worst performer now, Sanmeet, to the best performer, and while it's nice to see the best performers up, I'm sorry to say it's not nearly as up as Teladoc is down. The number 1 performer for this Five Stock Samplers so far Atlassian up 36 percent. That's about 19 percentage points over the market. What's been happening for this Australian software company?
Sanmeet Deo: Yes, I am asking for those who aren't familiar. It's a $79 billion market cap company currently that makes workflow management, collaboration, agile, and organizational software products such as Jira and Trello. Trello is something we use here at The Motley Fool for project collaboration. It's used by 82 percent of Fortune 500 companies, has 10 million monthly active users and over 180,000 customers in over 190 countries. Solid software company. This is just a case of a strong revenue growing company. They've averaged over 35 percent durable and consistent revenue growth over the past year and as well as even looking back past that, they've had rapid subscription revenue growth of over 50 percent in the past few quarters. They have a differentiated, go-to-market with a low-price, high-value products strategy.
They are growing across users, new use cases and products. One of the things with software companies and these SaaS companies that you may not think is very highly free-cash-flow positive. Their free cash flow margins have improved to about 35 percent in fiscal 2019. That's about 400 million free cash flow and it is said that they could reach a billion in free cash flow in fiscal '23. They are also benefiting from one of the best cloud transitions in the software industry. Many of these software companies have transitioned from on-premise desktop or software that you have to pick up and use to cloud software, that's high-margin, high subscription-based software. Another great thing that I like to look at sometimes is they have a very strong workplace culture as indicated on Glassdoor and Comparably, which is another side I like to use. It's overall just executing very well, and I think that's really the reason it's been doing so well as a stock.
David Gardner: It has been a long-term winner for many Fools and a great Rule Breaker pick. I'm glad to know it's up 37-ish percent over this last year but it's not going to be enough to have this sampler after one year rolled up at random, beating the market. Let's just talk about a few of these other companies, Sanmeet. Now, let's go to two S companies, very different businesses, SolarEdge Technologies, a solar power company powering the solar revolution, and then Starbucks. I'm curious, Sanmeet. I know a lot of our Motley Fool employees don't come from Wall Street but you do have a past having come from Wall Street. Of the two companies, SolarEdge and Starbucks, which was more of the company that you've studied over the course of your career?
Sanmeet Deo: Actually, the one I say more is Starbucks. I worked at a large-cap growth firm, and as part of working there, Starbucks was one of the staple growth names in our portfolio and one that is also easy to understand. You can just go to a Starbucks, pick up the coffee, see the trends, see the businesses, and get a good grasp of the company. Starbucks, I got to say is what a rough road over the past couple of years for a company that's especially restaurant companies like Starbucks, where having to deal with shutdowns, reopenings, very uneven growth, and reopening across geographies with the US operating differently than markets like China where Starbucks is in or other places internationally where reopening might be slower or the virus has been popping in and out all over the world at different places and spiking in different places. For Starbucks, that's been a huge challenge. They are getting hit on the demand side when you have to close stores but then they're also getting hit on the cost side when you have labor shortages and wage inflation and coffee prices have actually gone up as well. It's been a rough road to navigate for Starbucks.
David Gardner: I will point out that Starbucks is down 10 percent over this last year. Both SolarEdge and Starbucks are underwater. Unfortunately, SolarEdge is down 17 percent, Starbucks is down 10 percent. I introduced these two S companies together because they are both, I'm not going to say sucking, but [laughs] they are both losing to the market. You're right. I mean, what a hard business it's been to run for Starbucks the last couple of years. What about SolarEdge?
Sanmeet Deo: SolarEdge makes the DC optimized inverter systems for solar photovoltaic installations worldwide. I can see why this is a great Rule Breaker because it is playing off the long-term tailwind of solar energy, electric energy, and they've been hit with supply chain, chip shortage issues, an overhang for the stock. Some people think it's transient and it has upside once that's been alleviated. Those revenues have been choppy, it started to come back in the past couple of quarters, back to about 40 percent plus. They're positioned well though because the residential solar market is forecasted to grow quite well in the next few years. That's a place where they play very well. SolarEdge is also a duopoly of sorts with another company called Enphase. They have a strong foothold in this market and they have been even throughout this. They've had strong solar revenue across segments and geographies. The commercial segment has started to turn and indicates the businesses are spending after the downturn to COVID. They're in that recovery phase and I think recently too, The White House confirmed an extension of solar tariffs put in place by Trump during Trump's administration. Some of these governmental and energy credit situations also play a part in SolarEdge's business.
David Gardner: Well, thank you for that. Yeah, this stock touched a high of around 370 in November, right around Thanksgiving. Now, here we are in early 2022, we find ourselves well down from 370 down to about 245. Again, a company that we've held for a long time. This is a company with a $12 billion market cap today. As you mentioned, they are an Israeli company, Enphase is a US company, and yes, they are a duopoly as you mentioned. An interesting company we're going to keep holding and hope it performs better over the next two years. Let's close real quick, Sanmeet, with, well, maybe the best known of all five of these companies, even including Starbucks and that would be Apple. I'm happy to say that Apple is a winner. Over the last year, the stock is up 33 percent, again, the market up about 17. Apple is dragging Five Stocks Rolled Up at Random upward. It's not going to get high enough but give us a word about Apple.
Sanmeet Deo: I think Apple has just robust demand for their products, iPhones, Macs, wearables, strengthen their services businesses with their TV service. That just continues to drive revenue and earnings even despite supply chain issues, which they too are not immune to but they've done a very good job of navigating those. They have reported that they are seeing some relief coming in the first half of 2022. There's always that excitement of talk of an Apple Car, or if not even an Apple Car, they're more engaged within the electric vehicle segment. However, they decided to take part in that. There's also always the Apple will buy you theme [laughs] in coming up with other companies. Because of the cash that they generate and have on their balance sheet, just executing phenomenally like they really do, they have very few quarters that disappoint.
David Gardner: Does any company have more cash on its balance sheet than Apple?
Sanmeet Deo: I don't know. The only one I could guess is maybe Google, but I don't think even Google has as much as Apple or Berkshire Hathaway.
David Gardner: Why even pick knits here? These are companies that have on their balance sheets cash that exceeds the GDP of some sovereign nations around the world today. This is a really important, relevant company, Apple Plus. A lot of people watching Ted Lasso last couple of years waiting for Season 3. It's a reminder. I just got another pair of AirPods Pro in the mail today, having slightly lost one of my AirPods Pro the other day. It's a reminder of how relevant this company is, the devices that we're using, the entertainment we're consuming, Apple is such a big part of music as well. It's an amazing company. I'm glad it's part of Five Stocks Rolled Up at Random, but now, it's time to account for where we are. The stock market up 17 percent over the first year for this podcast. I regret to say that this group is presently down six percent. I am looking at you, Teladoc, because you're bringing everybody else down. But if I never picked Teladoc, we'd be up. But so far, anyway, this is one of my losing Five Stock Samplers. I guess the good news, Sanmeet, is one year does not a season make, is that fair?
Sanmeet Deo: Absolutely. These are three-year samplers. We still have two years to go. A lot can happen in those two years for these companies.
David Gardner: Well, thank you very much, and each one of these is such a relevant, interesting company to follow on its own. I mean, Teladoc, despite its underperformance, is a fascinating company and doing really important things in this world. It would be fun to see how Five Stocks Rolled Up at Random play out. I love dice and I love randomizing and I don't want them to have a bad reputation, [laughs] so I need this sampler to do better than it's done in years 2 and 3. In the meantime, Sanmeet Deo, thank you so much for joining us again on Rule Breaker Investing. Fool on, my friend.
Sanmeet Deo: All right. Thank you, David. Thanks for having me.
David Gardner: All right. Well, from January 2021, we go back one year. This is pre-pandemic, my friends. Well, for most of us in the world. Way back music machine, Rick Engdahl.
The date was January 22nd, 2020 and it was Five Stocks that Spark Joy. What I remember now, two years later, is that it was a [inaudible 00:26:26] to Marie Kondo, Mark Hahn. She had a lot of fans back then. She still has a lot of fans today. The woman who teaches us how to organize our homes, how to simplify our lives. I started reading her book, in fact, and though I've not finished it, her first insight is so profound. She's like, ""We all expect our kids to pick up after themselves. We say stuff to them like, 'Clean up your room, honey,' but we never are taught exactly how to clean things up. In most cases,"" Marie Kondo has said, ""that's because parents themselves don't exactly know how to do it right. They were never taught themselves and this has been passed down through the generation."" So Mark Hahn is here to help us simplify our closets. Those are both the tangible and intangible closets in our homes and in our minds. Asit Sharma, as I get to welcome you in now, the big phrase that I remember from her is, ""You picked that old sweater up in your closet and you look at it and you ask yourself, 'Does this spark joy for me?'"" If it doesn't, what are you supposed to do?
Asit Sharma: You're supposed to discard it, David, if it doesn't spark joy. [laughs]
David Gardner: Exactly, and that's going to simplify our lives a lot if we take that mentality. Five Stocks that Spark Joy, Asit, and I'm going to give the stock names now, Amazon, Apple, Etsy, Tesla, and Walt Disney. All five of those I was picking at the time because I think Marie Kondo's insights into how to live better can actually help us invest better and we're going to find out whether these stocks and their performance are going to back me up on that point. But first, Asit, great to have you back to Rule Breaker Investing.
Asit Sharma: David, thanks for having me back. Really excited to talk about these stocks in context of Marie Kondo. It seems like every time I've encountered any kind of Japanese thinking, there's always a big revelation whether it's continuous improvement or the compound method of production which is essentially using flags to show one process is done and another can start. The Japanese have a way of approaching the world that lifts you out of your own sphere and punks you down in another one, and this certainly is that for me.
David Gardner: Wow, that is really well put and thank you. You're reminding me I need to delve further into Japanese culture, so thank you for that reminder, Asit. Let's start with the worst performer. Good news, there is only one stock that's down in this group of five and it's losing to the market by 37 percentage points. A couple of numbers here. The stock market over the last two years is up 36 percent. Therefore, Walt Disney, ticker symbol DIS, it's down 37 percentage points to the market. That means it's down one percent overall versus the market's plus 36. With Sanmeet earlier, I think I said Apple might be the best-known company in the world. It definitely has more cash, but maybe Disney is even better known worldwide than Apple, but then again, why draw these kinds of distinctions? This is a big brand and a big business operating across many different industries. It's underperforming. Asit, in your mind, for what reason over the last two years is Disney 37 percentage points behind the S&P 500?
Asit Sharma: David, I think the factor that drove their underperformance isn't something that's difficult to figure out for many of us. Those theme parks got hit during COVID. You picked this basket in January of 2020. I remember on March 15th of that year, trying to go to a play out in the real world and learning that the play was canceled, we had a turned back and that was the beginning of this COVID experience for me. But extrapolate this to Disney, which has such a big component with its theme parks. Investors have necessarily been cautious about this company. I took a look at both the companies I'm going to speak about through this Marie Kondo lens. I wanted to know what is speaking to management, what is sparking joy in management's eyes, and what might they be trying to discard? Let me take a stab at this. I actually want to quote from the last conference call that Disney had. This is from CEO Bob Chapek. Now, of course, we're recording just before the next quarter of earnings is going to be released, David, so for anyone who's tuning in, this is probably not the most recent quarter by the time you're listening.
He said, ""Telling the world's most original and enduring stories, maximizing the synergy of our unique ecosystem to deepen customers' connection to our characters and our stories, and using the power of our far-reaching platforms and new technologies to give consumers the best entertainment experience possible."" This is the way Disney describes what sparks joy from them. I believe that, there's a lot of corporate-speak in that, but I think when you look at how quickly they've been able to get into the streaming market with Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu and create this gargantuan tribe of listeners. I think at the last count, Disney+ had 180 million subscribers. You can see that they are funneling that joy, the stories that they've been telling for decades into this new medium that the next generation of consumers is going to watch and keep watching. That obviously shows you the potential of the company where its heart lies. I'm going to go out on a limp here [laughs] and try to isolate what isn't sparking joy as much. I think that actually is the theme parks, not because those aren't wonderful expressions of Walt Disney's original love for narrative and his love for having experiences. I think that it's more difficult part of the business as time goes on.
Of course, it's got a much smaller margins. They are struggling to recover from COVID. As the last few weeks have evolved, I note that Bob Chapek is under fire because Disney fans are furious that lines have become very long, ticket prices are soaring. This is a hard problem and it would be a hard problem for any management team. Right now, they're not feeling the joy on those theme parks, but I will say, even though if you look at these numbers, the Disney part of the business, the Disney theme parks part of the business while being only 25 percent of revenue and even less than operating profit, about six percent, long-term, it is something that's going to spark joy again. I think fast-forward a few years past COVID and we've got a few years left in this basket, I think that component comes back and the whole picture and beauty of this business model becomes apparent to investors.
David Gardner: Well, and we do have one year left in this basket, so we're two in out of three. We do have another year for the world to, I don't know, find its new normal and have more action around Disney theme parks, but you're speaking as well to streaming. Asit, and looking over this basket, this Five-Stock Sampler, Five Stocks that Spark Joy, three of these companies are among the most prominent entertainment companies when we think about streaming. Amazon, of course, with Prime Video, Apple with Apple Plus, and Disney, of course, with Disney+. Part of what sparks joy for a lot of us are those stories, and ultimately, when you look at these five companies, we're about to talk about the big winner next, but all five of these really have great brands. Certainly, Etsy is not nearly as well-known as the other four, but let's now shift from Disney, the biggest underperformer to the biggest outperformer and that will be Tesla.
While a lot of people, for a long time, have viewed Tesla as unsustainably premium-priced and maybe it even still is today, often that's been true, Asit, of the Rule Breakers over the course of time. They're perceived overvalued people don't buy the stocks, but I think part of the reason that happens is because they have great brands and brands aren't really counted anywhere on the financial statements for the most part unless we're talking about goodwill, but that's an obscure thing we're not going to talk about right now. Brands are often overlooked, I think, both by Wall Street analysts, but also the computer algorithms that drive a lot of the trading. I think that's part of the magic for a company like Tesla. Tesla was at $114 a share two years ago. It's now over 900. This stock is an eight-bagger for this Five-Stock Sampler. I myself have bought at least one new Tesla since picking this Five-Stock Sampler two years ago. So it sparks some joy for me. Asit, this stock is up 674 percentage points over the market averages. Would you have believed that two years ago?
Asit Sharma: David, it's been a long evolution for me to understand the power of great brands. I am a believer now, I've been talking about this principle probably for the last year on Industry Focus with Emily Flippen, you can't underestimate what a brand can mean in the consumer's mind. We can be skeptical about Tesla's ability to produce its cars, its entry into new markets, its competition. If we don't understand what the consumer wants, we could be way off base, and that's been the case here. I want to point out one more thing about Tesla, which I think is more recently supporting its success in addition to its great brand. That is the ability of Elon Musk and his management team to go full Marie Kondo and figure out what is speaking to their heart and discarding the other things. Counter intuitive, if you look at Tesla's strategy over the last two years, while they are working on a bunch of new models, they haven't been hyper-focused on that. In fact, that's secondary. What is sparking joy for Tesla, for Elon Musk is scaling outputs.
He mentioned this in the company's lastearnings callback in January. I thought it was fascinating. He said a lot of people don't understand this point. If we had spent our focus during COVID with supply chain shortages inability to get the chips in that we wanted on trying to introduce new models, that would've been really complex business proposition. Instead, we just focused on scaling our output. Because you and I have, David, both know that demand is there. People want that brand. By doing that, they were able to increase their volumes by 90 percent year-over-year. They were able to produce a tremendous amount of operating cash flow, a tremendous amount of profit. I believe in the last quarter, if I'm not mistaken, they had about $2.8 billion of operating cash flow that they generated, and as Musk pointed out, most automakers went backwards last year and during COVID they weren't able to meet demand. The ability of management team to channel that inner Marie Kondo and focus on what's sparking joy, focus on what's important is a sign of a winning company, so these two elements together, they explained this fantastic stock price moving to me now of course, we can't predict the future. There's still some time left in this basket, but I wouldn't bet against this company over the long term.
David Gardner: Well, and speaking of the long term, that's how long we have held this stock. First picked in Motley Fool Rule Breakers, November 2011, so we're now in our eleventh year of just buying and holding Tesla. We have been, well, I'm just going to say it, rewarded beyond my wildest dreams, the performance of this company, and often it's forgotten that from 2014-2019, ticker symbol TSLA, check it, went sideways. As the market continues to rise inexorably a strong bull market. In the teens 2014, '15, '16, '17, '18, Tesla went sideways and it just was within the last three years that the stock truly has exploded. While it's been volatile, I mean, the stock is already down from recent highs, like a lot of others, it's had about 20 percent as valued shopped in just the last month or so. Nevertheless, we're so far above where we started, and I think it's a company that does spark joy.
I think from day 1, people have said if Apple made a car, it would be Tesla. Tesla early days had that understanding of design, but also the fun. Elon Musk is a crazy man, mostly in a good way I think, and I think a lot of us have benefited mightily because of all of his exemptions and his company's efforts. It is still one of my favorite consumer products of all time, it is by far the best car I've ever driven, and it's amazing to think that Tesla remains asset at the forefront of the electric revolution. Seems like everybody else is announcing, they've got their electric car coming to, but nobody is anywhere close to Tesla in terms of building out that network of chargers or all of the miles logged which helps contribute to the AI for, I don't know, at some point, autonomous driving might actually work and Tesla might actually bringing it, but they really have a huge advantage.
Asit Sharma: It's amazing what you can achieve when you set audacious goals and work backwards.
David Gardner: Beautifully said and succinctly said, let's stay succinct about these other three. But if there's any one of the remaining three stocks that you'd like to speak to, Asit, I learn so much from you. I will point out to the others. Apple and Etsy have both more than doubled, and Amazon itself is up 70 percent. Again, with the stock market up 36 percent points, this has been an absolute homerun of a Five-Stock Sampler. I will just give the numbers right now. Overall, the market's up 36 percent points. These stocks average gain of plus 216 percent points, so we're a 180 per stock above the market. Of course, Tesla pulling them all up together, but three of these stocks have more than doubled. Between Amazon, Apple, and Etsy, which one do you want to pick up, look at it and ask, doesn't spark joy for you, Asit Sharma?
Asit Sharma: You're asking me to pick my favorite child, David, [laughs] and I happen to have three children. But let's do this. Let's go with Etsy to keep within this theme. I remember rubbing my hands together when you first picked this basket. Thinking, oh men, this basket is going to outperform, and outperform it has. But to choose one, I loved that Etsy's management team talks about a fun and inspiring and engaging experience on their platform. Almost every conference call, that's so important, you know the intangibles are what make accompany performance, it's the people you hire, it's the goals you set, it's the attention to the small thing. I really love how Etsy is so focused on making its platform fun for the people who want. It's crafty artisans type goods, which I am an avid buyer. I seem to remember you saying that you hadn't or maybe when I was reviewing your transcript from the podcast that you hadn't bought from Etsy at that point in time and I'm curious. Have you become an Etsy members since then?
David Gardner: I'm sorry to say I still have not, and there are a lot of reasons I might, in particular, as a geeky board gamer, one of the things that I like this is a real sidelight of Etsy, but there are a lot of people who take the components of the game. Let's just pick Monopoly as the generic name everybody knows, and bling them out, like have much more interesting looking dice that you roll or replace that little metallic poodle with something else. There are a lot of opportunities that craftsman have to take well-known games and develop much more interesting or beautiful components, and you just put those in your box instead, kick-out the old, so put in wood for plastic, for example. That's happening, thanks to Etsy. I probably should have, Asit, but thank you for remembering that about me. I still haven't bought from Etsy as a consumer.
Asit Sharma: Well, I'm guessing within the next year or two, you will because they have disability to help you find the things that are going to spark joy, whatever your interest are. They do it very well. They pour a lot of money into the technology to make it easy to find those things. I think, these are the intangibles behind numbers like we've seen recently where they're growing their total platform volume by double-digits. It's now over, I think, three billion bucks of total platform volume in the last quarter, they're becoming quite a big company from this little upstart that challenged Amazon and its own world of handmade goods. I think that Etsy is the one for me that is most Marie Kondo-like in this regard.
David Gardner: I love it, and you know what I also love? I love that we're talking about this in early February with the stock around a 140. Again, this has been a wonderful performer. It is up 181 percent from two years ago. But have you looked at the stock recently, Asit and everybody listening to us right now? This stock was over 300 thanksgiving week, it's at 140 right now two months later, this feels like a sale. A sale is happening not just on the Etsy platform, but maybe on the stock market. A lot of long time listeners are smiling because they know Etsy was the example we used for the Market Cap Game Show for years. Matt Argersinger always kept over estimating it, and I was always saying no, it's a smaller market cap than that, which means, Matt, you should be a buyer. Indeed, a lot of us have been very well rewarded, but it is amazing to me, Asit. We've seen this, of course, with many Rule Breakers stocks in just the last couple of months, the stock has been cut in half in just two months.
Asit Sharma: It makes you wonder how long one should wait on the sidelines. I'm an Etsy shareholder, and I hope to pick up some more shares in the near future. I'm not saying that because you brought up that the fact that the stock was cut in half. But when I look through my list of holdings, it popped out. Now, I invested in many growth names, so yes, I've taken a beating among many areas my portfolio, but this is one stock, again, that will feel good to add to my holdings. I think when I fast forward a year or two from now, I'll feel even better.
David Gardner: Thank you for that, and that fast-forwarding is important. The only reason that make sense to fast-forward is if you're still holding the stock, otherwise, you fast-forward into nothingness, so it's a reminder, Asit, and everybody listening that it's about holding, that's really most of the work of investing. That by discipline, I've tried to exert upfront and that sell discipline that I ignore relative to most of the rest of world in between those two points are hold, hold, hold, and Etsy has well-rewarded us for these two years, and yet you've been whacked as an Etsy shareholder just over the last couple of months. You have to be able to enjoy all of that and see the whole journey, I think to be a successful investor, well, we don't exactly know what the next year will hold. But one thing, I think almost for sure this Five-Stock Sampler is going to retire to Foolhalla next year as the market beater, again, 180 percentage point lead over the market after just two years of volatile trading. We'll keep our fingers crossed, and with Marie Kondo, we'll hope to pick these five stocks up a year from now, Asit, and hope they still spark joy. Thank you, my friend.
Asit Sharma: So much fun, David. Thanks a brunch.
David Gardner: All right. Well, from 2020, let's go back in time once more. It's January of 2019, the date was January 23rd. The podcast that week was entitled Five Stocks Shrouded in Mystery and for this group, I'd like to welcome back long time Rule Breaker friend of mine Rick Munarriz. Rick, welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing.
Rick Munarriz: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here, David.
David Gardner: How's investing been treating you over the last year or so, Rick? It hasn't been great for a lot of my kind of Rule Breaker Stocks, you?
Rick Munarriz: Yes. I've been hit hard. I got lucky that I moved into some REITs just like thinking, hey, maybe a little income. Now that I'm in my 50s and my wife is pondering early retirement in a year. I took a conservative approach with a part of my money. I'm still very into the aggressive growth stocks that we know and love, David. But that helped out. I took a tiny little bit on crypto which was greater initially and then not so great lately, but again, a very small part. Last year wasn't too bad, my portfolio was actually up in the low teens and the mid-teens rather, which I know is a lot better than a lot of people with growth investors but I definitely lost to the market like just about everybody I know.
David Gardner: Coming right off for five stocks that sparked joy and what we just talked about Etsy, it's truly remarkable to me to think that Etsy is less than half what it was just two months ago and yet still up 100 percentage points plus over the last two years. That's how investing in Rule Breaker is felt in recent months. Well, let's take a look at this group now. We're going to be sending this Five Stock Sampler off to Foolhalla at the end of this week show, because Five Stock Shrouded in Mystery started on January 23rd, 2019 and three years later that was a few weeks ago. Our numbers are locked. Friday, January 21st was the full three-year period and those are the prices we'll be using and this Five Stock Sampler, while the S&P, Rick Munarriz, was up, on average, 55 percent over the last five years. That's with an asterisk. We're going to explain a little bit more about that in the second.
Technically, the S&P 500 is up 66 percentage points over these past three years. But one of these companies got bought out very early and so we're only averaging it for the time that it was still alive stock and that's what brings down the overall average of the market to 55 percentage points over the last three years. But now I feel like I'm really getting into the weeds. Let's zoom back one level, Rick, and let's look at the worst performer among these Five Stocks Shrouded in Mystery. We'll explain the mystery a little later. But Rick, Carter's, the ticker symbol is CRI. Baby clothes, multi-generations up 13 percent the last three years. Bad news though, the S&P, it's not really bad news, was up 66 percent, and so Carter's is 53 percentage points behind the market. Rick, looking over the last three years, what, in your mind is the number one reason why Carter's has underperformed?
Rick Munarriz: I just want to start by saying that up 13 percent and this is the worst pick is obviously going to be a very good next 10-15 minutes for us here talking about these stocks. But for Carter's, again, this is the company behind OshKosh B'gosh and of course, Carter's. I think what really hurt them is that even before the pandemic, they weren't doing that well. The revenue net sales basically in 2018, less than two percent, 2019 less than two percent, and then the pandemic came, so revenue declined 14 percent in 2020. This is a company that already had issues where it wasn't necessarily catching up to, let's say a Target or Walmart that's selling a lot of kid clothes. A lot of generic stuff to put on your kid as they grow up and especially if you're a parent and you're cost conscious, you don't want to invest a lot of money into an outfit that only is going to fit them when they're really young for maybe a couple of months, a year or two at most.
I think that's hurt Carter's. Just the general scope of the pandemic, I think it's fairly obvious that if your kids and your family and you're all hunkering down and sheltering in place, you don't necessarily want to get out and say, ""Oh, I need to get these outfits because my kid has a play date."" Or ""He is going to go to school every day, I got make sure she looks different. I got to make sure that she has something special to wear once she's invited to a sleep over."" All these things didn't really happen during the pandemic. So I think a lot of parents just said, if there's one thing I can hold back on is just clothing and we saw this with a lot of companies, but I think especially with children, since they outgrow them so quickly, you're not making an investment in something that they can wear 5, 10 years from now for a lot of the young kids. I think Carter's was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, but it was already at the wrong place at the wrong time before the pandemic.
David Gardner: Well said, and I'm sorry to say this stock, which is up 13 percent. It's actually made money over the last few years. It's just really underperformed. It's joined by one other in this Five Stock Sampler that also similarly has dramatically underperformed. IPG Photonics completely different business, cold lasers, fiber lasers. But IPG Photonics is up 17 percent over the last three years, but that again, still about 50 percentage points or so rounding behind the market averages. Horse of a different color here, Rick, but what's been up with IPG Photonics over the past three years?
Rick Munarriz: Yeah. With IPG Photonics, and again, it's not a household name, obviously. This company makes fiber lasers, amplifiers, laser systems, a lot of industrial stuff that's used for medical applications, telecommunications, materials processing. It's a lot of stuff, a lot of this heavy industrial equipment that's used to make things and make other things go. What really hurt IPG Photonics was actually a lot of the weakness, not just a supply chain breakdown all over. But in China when there was a slowdown in their manufacturing because they are very big with these material cutting applications. They have basically half of the welding market as far as equipment to help with welding. All these things, once production slowed down during the COVID-19 crisis and especially with tensions between the US and China. Even though IPG Photonics, they have factories everywhere, they have presences all over the world. when China slowed down, a big part of their business actually took a hit. That is why the stock was able to rise over the next three years, but definitely lose the market just a rough climate globally, particularly in the world's most populous nations.
David Gardner: Thank you for that. What a fascinating time it has been and to see what has won and what has lost. A lot of this was simply unpredictable but I think part of what we do as Rule Breaker investors is we're looking at great founders. We're looking at companies that have innovative solutions that the world needs and we're never quite sure which one is going to win when and which ones are going to lose, otherwise, we'd never bought those in the first place. But this is a company that unfortunately lost its founder in just the last few months. Valentin Gapontsev, the Russian American immigrant, just a great story. One of my favorite Russians Gapontsev with a net worth of 2.3 billion largely tied up in his IPG Photonics stock company. He founded decades ago, unfortunately died in October of last year.
But this is a stock like a lot of these we've talked about this week. We've owned it for a long time, recommended it actively all the way through and we're going to keep doing that with IPG Photonics. These two stocks, Rick, put this Five Stock Sampler and a whole both about 50 percentage points behind the market. Let's now go to the winner in this Five Stock Sampler, the number one performer, MercadoLibre, ticker symbol MELI, also shrouded in mystery with these other four. Good news MercadoLibre is up from $328 a share three years ago. It closed a few weeks ago, January 21st at 1,053-ish up. As I mentioned, 220 percent waxing the market averages up 150 plus over the market. Rick, you speak Spanish, you pronounced MercadoLibre much better than I do. You know this company better than I do, but it's been one of our favorite longtime Rule Breakers. In your mind, what's the number one reason over the last three years that MercadoLibre tripled?
Rick Munarriz: I think especially with MercadoLibre the way would it have been able to do is, it has been able to do it every single e-commerce company has wanted to do and Amazon has exceeded. But for the most part, this is a company that said, right, we are the leading Latin America marketplace for goods, for e-commerce. Where can we go next? They have Mercado Pago, which is basically like a PayPal equivalent or Square or Venmo, but more PayPal is because it's very good for commerce. Mercado Pago has actually overtaken the MercadoLibre platform. There are 78.7 million unique active users across MercadoLibre's entire ecosystem. But this is a company in its latest quarter, 7.3 billion in gross merchandise volume for the MercadoLibre. The actual like e-commerce is a store front, but 21 billion, almost three times the volume in Mercado Pago. It's almost like that one point that you and I followed eBay for a long time when PayPal overtook eBay became the bigger verb in that company and eventually had to be spun off on its own. You have Mercado Pago has become so powerful and there are other things. Every time MercadoLibre slaps the name Mercado which is Spanish for market. I will give you that [laughs] introductory Spanish lesson there. MercadoLibre is obviously free market. They go Mercado Envios, which is their fulfillment and shipping stuff. Mercado Credito, they have a credit department. Now Mercado Fondo which is now an asset management company. They are doing so many things now that they are basically the name, the brand, and FinTech when it comes to Latin America and just the ability to be able to grow beyond. They would've been fighting with just the marketplace with the fact that they were able to expand into all these logical areas to basically spread their wings really set them apart from most of the companies that have failed.
David Gardner: As good as the stock has been and we're just looking at the three-year run, this is another one that's well down from recent highs. Rick, MercadoLibre actually touched stock over 2,000 as its 52 week high presently trading at 1,053. So at a market cap of $50 billion, just about even, I continue to love the future of that whole area of the world. MercadoLibre's leadership in so many contexts, helping lift up and serve Latin America. So are you as excited about this stock here in 2022 as we were in 2012?
Rick Munarriz: I definitely am, and again, this is something that a company that it's not just as a stock is cheaper now than it was several months ago, because that's not the right reason to buy the stock. This is a company that will continue to dominate. You're talking about the CEO, micro-scale bidding, who basically was like 1999 Stanford student. So basically, watching this whole.com revolution before the bubble pop and basically said, all right, I can do this in my country, I can do this in South America, I can do Latin America, and boom, MercadoLibre is born and they would quickly scaled up. Within a few years, eBay was buying 20 percent of the company. They had a lot of big investors onboard, so clearly, a well-educated person that saw something early, like so many people we know back in the late 1990s, hopping on this trend enable to make it work. So just a definitely dynamic company, but I think the future is still very bright for MercadoLibre. All the fears that we've always said, there's like geopolitical risks, there's inflationary risks because of the inflation through Latin America that's been ramping for basically decades. All that MercadoLibre has been able to climb that wall of worry, and it's just an amazing company.
David Gardner: True to add, and looking on its own, this company has made this Five-Stock Sampler a winner, I'll be giving the final accounting in just a few minutes. But since Rick, this is the last time we're talking about Five Stocks Shrouded in Mystery. We should speak to the other two, the also-rans. One of them beat the market, the other lost, let's go with the lost one first, Planet Fitness up 45 percent the last three years, but that's 21 percentage points behind the market. What's your take these days on Planet Fitness?
Rick Munarriz: So I was a big fan of Planet Fitness and this is the kind of stock again, if you look at the stock chart, it's almost like doing like a fitness rep because the stock hit $23.77 in March 2020 when so many of our stocks bottomed out. Now, it's almost quadrupled at this point since then. But this is obviously a company that, again, we're talking about CEOs, about these top of the line CEOs at these companies that IPG, MercadoLibre, but then with Planet Fitness specifically, it had one of my best origin CEO stories, CEO origin stories, and I know I shared it on the podcast three years ago, but I'll do this pretty quickly. Chris Rondeau, he was a college student in Dover, New Hampshire, population 30,000 and he was a real fitness buff. Have you seen him? He's very buff, he works out, obviously, and there was like basically one really good gym in towns. So he signed up and said I'll work at the front-desk, if you can let me work the equipment and stuff like that.
Gym is not going anywhere, it's about to go under. These two brothers come in, they buy it and they have this complete idea about changing everything around. They want to replace, get rid of the day care center. Get rid of the heavyweights. Because there's just a lot of grunting, a lot of heavy equipment hitting the ground. They got rid of fitness classes, which was very controversial at the time. They did all these things and place thrive. They dropped the price downs like $10.999, and all it was was basically just a bunch of workout gear, a bunch of a robot gear, treadmills, bikes, and light weights. It took off obviously, and Chris Rondeau, who is working the front-desk, eventually becomes a club manager eventually becomes a regional manager and then VP, and then 20 years after he is checking IDs at the door of the very first Planet Fitness becomes a CEO so you can relax and the most humble of origins and be CEO, and obviously the stock has done really well over time. The company continues to grow. I know if rambled too much on Planet Fitness, but it's definitely very interesting stock especially now that we can go to gyms again, which was something that we couldn't do two years ago, which is why the stock was as low as it was back in March of 2020.
David Gardner: Got to love the Haracio Alger stories which continue to run. I would say there are more rags to riches, amazing stories of people from modest means coming to become very successful business people. I think that happens more today than it did in the 19th century. Which checking Wikipedia right now was when novelist Horatio Alger wrote a lot of his so-called Horatio Alger stories. Rags to riches stories, impoverished boys becoming Superman. There were some wish fulfillment for his readers back in the 19th century. But I see this every day, these days, and I love that about America. I'm delighted to note after your storytelling, Rick, but that's been true for Planet Fitness as well. But it wasn't enough to propel the stock to a market, bid.
It's running 45 percentage points, so about 20 behind the market. Let's talk about the last one because in some ways, this is the most interesting of the five in the sampler, but for really unusual reason. So Rick, these stocks are picked on January 23rd of 2019, and within just days, in fact, less than two weeks after the podcast aired, Ellie Mae, ticker symbol ELLI is all of a sudden popping 9.5 percent that day, and why? Because the story is, it's going to be bought out. Indeed, Ellie Mae was, you can tell the story better than I will, but I will just point out, stock basically went from 70- 99 when we closed it out. So it was up 41 percent. The market at the time was up 10 percent, and Ellie Mae was off the market, so we froze its numbers here In this Five-Stock Sampler. We've talked about this each year since. But just amazing to think that within two weeks of picking a stock, this sometimes happens in real life, doesn't rick, in portfolios. Sometimes your companies get bought out and that's what happened to Ellie Mae.
Rick Munarriz: I think especially with the way you would like to approach these disruptive growth companies. They're going to be acquisition targets. They may not always be available for sale, but it does not surprise you when one your stocks gets acquired because they are something that someone thinks is important to them and it's disrupting their business or can make their business better. With Ellie Mae, they were really basically reinventing the game with how mortgage lending was done with enterprise software solutions to make things process more efficiently. So it did that surprise me when they were bought out. It was private equity firm Thomas Bravo paid about $3.7 billion of deal with worth $99 a share. Deals announced that February, it closed in April.
So within three months, you have locked in this 41 percent gain on the slant sampler scorecard in just three months, that's great money if you can take it. The only downside to this, and there is a bitter, sweet and I should get more bitter than sweet ending to this, is that a year-and-a-half later, Thomas Bravo went onto sell Ellie Mae to Intercontinental Exchange, ticker symbol ICE company we know for $11 billion, so almost tripled their money by basically flipping this amazing company that would better on our scorecard, on the sampler scorecard it would have actually said, just let it be and then let Intercontinental Exchange pipe directly from the tap, they would have paid more. So great job on the private equity firm, Thomas Bravo for doing that. But [inaudible 01:03:30] any for us and what could have been a much larger gain?
David Gardner: Yeah, bravo to them, it is exciting when you find out that your stock is getting bought out and it shoots up, it's generally stocks are bought up premiums by their acquiring companies. So the little fish that get grabbed like Ellie Mae, they are exciting to quote that day and see, I had completely missed the latter part of that story though, Rick, to think that the stock tripled just in a couple of years from there. Yeah. We really did miss out on some great gains. A friend to the mortgage lending industry, Ellie Mae, helping out mortgage brokers run their business through their platform. So one of those companies that had its own platform, Etsy has its own platform, Ellie Mae had stood one up itself. Obviously it's a very relevant companies today, even though it's much more opaque to most of us. But anyway, for this Five-Stock Sampler, it was the last of the five stocks shrouded in history, and Rick, do you want to say why these are Five Stocks Shrouded in Mystery?
Rick Munarriz: If I remember correctly, it was something about possibly like these were like bear market stocks like the feet of bear earlier we just repeated them again because we just felt inspired to do so.
David Gardner: That was the mystery and I'm glad that you remember. This is a long time ago, so you certainly weren't required to remember this. I had to double-check it myself. But the third Five-Stock Sampler I ever picked was Five Stocks to Feed the bear in February of 2016, and they had a great run over those three years. I decided, since I had to pick a new Five-Stock Sampler, right, as that old one ended, I decided, why not just repeat them again and make an important point about investing, which is, we loved in three-years ago. They did great, we love them today, let's buy them again, recommend them again, and they have done great. So very happy to say that the mystery part of five stocks shrouded the mystery. Because otherwise, what would unite Carter's with IPG, Photonics, Ellie Mae, Planet Fitness, and MercadoLibre. There are no themes that really makes sense for those, it's because we took a previous group that were picked in a bear market circumstances, stocks that we liked through a hard market in 2016. We just persisted them and kept holding them all of these, companies, like the ones we've talked about this week, all of these generally remained active recommendations. We like them here in 2022, just like Rick, we liked them in 2019 and in 2016. So the final accounting then for Five Stocks Shrouded in Mystery, the average is 67.1 percent gain as a group versus the market's 55 percent, 55.0 matched against the S&P 500. So this basket beats the market by 12 percentage points over three years. Again, they've already done really well. The three-years before they were up more than a 100 percent is a basket. They just added another 67 percent on top of that as Five Stocks Shrouded in Mystery disappeared in January of 2020. To send off with the music, Rick Engdahl, our Foolhalla tribute to Five Stocks Shrouded in Mystery. Another market bidder.

2022-03-11 00:00:00+00:00,3 Growth Stocks for the Next 10 Years and Beyond,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-growth-stocks-for-the-next-10-years-and-beyond-1,,,"If you've grown weary of forever chasing the next hot growth stock and keeping constant tabs on your holdings, you're not alone. ""Active"" investing can get real tiresome real fast.
Fortunately, you don't have to settle for subpar results in exchange for a passive, less-involved approach. There are plenty of great growth stocks you can step into and sit on for a decade or more, only checking on them every now and then. In fact, most of these tickers require a long-term mindset if you want to get the most out of them. Here are three such growth stocks to consider.
Shopify
Amazon may be the undisputed king of e-commerce. However, there's a downside to being willing to sell anyone virtually anything from your own inventory as well as via a few million third-party sellers: Things can get messy, requiring restrictive guidelines that limit legitimate sellers' businesses. Many of these sellers are now looking for less cumbersome ways to promote their goods online, and they're finding Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) does the job perfectly.
Image source: Getty Images.
Simply put, Shopify empowers small businesses by allowing them to establish their own online shops their way, entirely outside of Amazon's purview. Shopify no longer discloses exactly how many sellers use its platform, other than proclaiming it's ""millions of merchants."" It does say, though, that its tech has facilitated more than $450 billion in sales to date -- $54.1 billion of which were made during the fourth quarter of 2021 alone. That's 31% more business than Shopify's online shopping services handled in the same quarter a year earlier.
The thing is, Shopify has only scratched the surface of being the un-Amazon. The analyst community is calling for top-line growth of nearly 31% this year, which should accelerate to nearly 32% next year.
MercadoLibre
Speaking of Amazon, you may have heard MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) called the Amazon of Latin America. But the description doesn't do the company justice. While it is in many regards comparable to Amazon, it also mirrors eBay and PayPal. Online auctions and digital payments are also in its wheelhouse in addition to outright e-commerce. It just offers these services in a mostly underserved South and Central America.
And it's a powerhouse to be sure. In countries where it offers its services, MercadoLibre controls an average of about one-third of those markets, leveraging this reach to generate a record-breaking $2.1 billion in revenue during the final quarter of last year. That's a 74% year-over-year improvement.
A long-term stake in MercadoLibre isn't as much an investment in this particular company, however, as it is a play on a continent's digital coming-of-age.
In simplest terms, Latin America is now where North America was 15 years ago. While cellphones are common, the use of smartphones in South and Central America is still picking up steam. The Groupe Speciale Mobile Association, or GSMA, which helps the region's mobile carriers manage their collective operations, estimates 57% of South America's population was using the mobile internet as of 2020 en route to 64% by 2025.
Smartphone adoption itself is projected to swell from 72% to 81% during that same time. Not only is MercadoLibre's addressable market getting bigger, existing South American users of smartphones (and the mobile internet access they offer) will continue to get comfortable with all sorts of new e-commerce offerings.
Apple
Finally, add Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) to your list of growth stocks you can feel good about buying and holding for the next 10 years or longer. It's a predictable, on-the-nose pick to be sure. That's the upshot, however, of being the biggest and most profitable company on the planet.
Don't misunderstand. There will come a time when Apple's flagship iPhone business will be incapable of generating half of the company's revenue the way it does right now. While only a little over one billion of the more than seven billion people on the planet are iPhone users, not everybody in the world needs -- or even wants -- an iPhone, or even a smartphone.
Meanwhile, other smartphone makers are starting to make mobile devices that can legitimately compete with the iPhone's superior performance, and these competitors' phones are often offered at a fraction of the typical iPhone's price, too.
The point in time when this headwind will become a serious problem for Apple, though, is many, many years down the road, if it ever becomes a true problem at all. In the meantime, the company continues to make inroads with apps and other digital content. These services may only account for about 20% of the company's top line, but in that this is very high-margin revenue, digital goods and services actually make up about a third of Apple's operating profits. The growth of this profit contribution will increase at a faster clip as the company's services arm continues to swell over the course of the coming 10 years.

2022-03-11 00:00:00+00:00,"Top Stock Market News For Today March 11, 2022",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-stock-market-news-for-today-march-11-2022,,,"Stock Market Futures Inch Higher Following Hot CPI Readings
U.S. stock futures are in the green heading into Friday’s trading session this week. As oil and commodity prices stabilize from a war-fueled price surge, inflation continues to rear its ugly head. Evidently, crude oil prices fell for a second consecutive session alongside all three major stock indexes. On the economic front, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index (CPI) readings are in. In February, the CPI gained by 7.9% year-over-year. While this is in line with consensus economists’ forecasts, it still represents a 40-year high for this inflationary measure.
In general, most would argue that inflation has been and remains a major concern for economies worldwide. With the Ukraine-Russia war further weighing in on already strained global supply chains, things could continue to worsen. Because of all this, some investors could be anticipating an acceleration by the central bank to tighten monetary policy. By extension, this could include more aggressive interest rate rises. Regardless, it seems like uncertainty will continue to be a prominent theme in the overall stock market today as well. As of 5:51 a.m. ET, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures are trading higher by 0.33%, 0.41%, and 0.45% respectively.
Rivian Slumps Following Lackluster Quarterly Earnings Figures And Production Outlook
Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) is among the headliners in thestock market today Naturally, this would be a result of its latest quarterly earnings update. After yesterday’s closing bell, the company missed Wall Street’s estimates at the top and bottom line. Diving in, Rivian posted a loss of $2.43 per share on revenue of $54 million for the quarter. To put things into perspective, consensus forecasts were pointing towards a loss of $1.97 per share and revenue of $60 million. Overall, it seems the upcoming electric vehicle (EV) maker continues to face challenges in getting its operations off the ground.
In fact, Rivian cites growing issues on the supply chain front as a key reason for its lack of momentum. To quote the company, “In the immediate term, we are not immune to the supply chain issues that have challenged the entire industry. Those issues, which we believe will continue through at least 2022, have added a layer of complexity to our production ramp-up.” Because of this, the company is currently expecting to produce 25,000 units of its electric trucks and SUVs in 2022. To point out, this is about half of its initial vehicle production forecast to investors during its IPO roadshow. Nevertheless, the orders continue to pile on for Rivian as its current total reservations are at a whopping 83,000.
Looking forward, the company refrained from providing revenue guidance for the current fiscal year. However, it is actively optimizing its operations. Namely, the company is planning to replace its battery cells with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells. By using LFP cells, Rivian benefits from generally cheaper build costs alongside batteries that charge quickly and deliver longer ranges for its EVs. This would be the company following in the footsteps of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) earlier this year.

DocuSign On The Decline After Providing Less-Than-Expected Annual Guidance
Another name making the rounds because of its earnings today would be DocuSign (NASDAQ: DOCU). All in all, the company raked in a quarterly revenue of $580.80 million, above estimates of about $561.60 million. Year-over-year, this adds up to a solid 34.8% jump. At the same time, DocuSign is also looking at a respectable earnings per share of $0.48, in-line with consensus expectations. For the quarter, the company also saw sizable growth across several key metrics. Notably, its billings and subscription revenue are up by 25% and 37% year-over-year respectively. On top of all that, DocuSign also generated record margins throughout the quarter.
Commenting on all this is CEO Dan Springer. He highlights, “While the year unfolded differently than expected, we are proud of the ongoing performance and resilience of our team as we scaled to become a multi-billion dollar company. Together, we helped another 280,000 new customers begin digitizing how they agree as we surpassed 1.17 million total customers overall.” This alongside the e-signature company’s ongoing partnership with Zoom (NASDAQ: ZM) since last month is worth noting now.
Despite all of this, DOCU stock appears to be on the decline following the company’s guidance for the current fiscal year. DocuSign is expecting a total annual revenue of between $2.47 billion to $2.48 billion. This is noticeably below consensus estimates of $2.61 billion. The real question now is whether DocuSign can make the most of its operational momentum to drive meaningful growth long-term.

eBay CEO Jamie Iannone Reveals Company’s Interest In Potential Digital Wallet Offering
In other news, popular e-commerce platform eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is reportedly looking towards crypto tech. For the most part, this information comes from the company’s investors day event yesterday. In it, eBay officially launches its first digital wallet offering. Through its digital wallet, customers can “use proceeds from their sales to conveniently purchase their next item or pay their selling expenses.” Moreover, CEO Jamie Iannone also floated the idea of adding cryptocurrency-related functions to this wallet.
Iannone said, “we continue to evaluate other forms of payments that we should take on the platform. We don’t currently accept cryptocurrency on the platform.” Even so, eBay is not one to shy away from significant updates to its payment systems. Currently, the platform already supports Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Pay and Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) Apple Pay. Additionally, it also facilitates buy-now-pay-later solutions via Afterpay. Not forgetting, eBay already supports the trading of non-fungible tokens, an upcoming area of crypto tech now. As such, it would not be all that surprising for the company to consider accepting digital currencies on its platform.

Ford Teams Up With Utility Firm PG&E To Test F-150 Lighting EV As Backup Power Generator For Homes
Elsewhere, Ford (NYSE: F) is making plays in the home energy grid space now. Through a collaboration with California-based utility company PG&E (NYSE: PCG), it is looking to turn EVs into backup home generators. In detail, the duo are looking to test Ford’s upcoming F-150 in this current venture. They aim to do so by connecting the EV to the power grid. As it stands, initial testing is set to begin this spring. Should things go as planned, this would add another key feature to Ford’s already popular F-150 electric pickup truck.
Highlighting how this could benefit Ford in the EV market now is CEO Jim Farley. The CEO believes that this step into “bidirectional charging,” would set Ford apart from key competitors such as Tesla. Also, PG&E CEO Patti Poppe added that one in five EVs sold in the U.S. is in the company’s service area. In her own words, “That’s about 6,600 MW of capacity that’s driving around today.” With this in mind, investors may be tuning in to F stock at today’s opening bell.

March 10 (Reuters) - E-commerce company eBay Inc EBAY.O said on Thursday it expects revenue to grow between 5% and 6% in fiscal 2023, and launched its first digital wallet.
Analysts polled by Refinitiv estimated 2023 revenue of $10.95 billion, which indicates a growth of 5.5%.
EBay saw strong demand from the online shopping boom last year during the COVID-19 pandemic, but is now scrambling to sustain the momentum as people return to regular living.
Moreover, analysts have said that eBay, which is still in the early stages of product innovation, faces tough competition from rivals such as Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.
EBay said the digital wallet would let customers use proceeds from their sales to conveniently purchase their next item or pay their selling expenses.
""We see incredibly compelling growth potential in this market,"" Chief Executive Officer Jamie Iannone said.
The company also launched eBay Vault, a digital marketplace and storage facility for trading cards and collectibles, which is expected to launch in the United States in the next quarter.
Shares of the company fell 1.1% to $52.5 in extended trading.
The company expects adjusted profit to rise about 10% in 2023, it said at its investor day. For fiscal 2024, eBay forecast revenue to grow in the range of 7% to 8%, and adjusted profit to rise about 15%.
Last month, eBay had forecast bleak first-quarter results as it tackles waning online demand, stiff competition and global supply chain disruptions.

10 stocks we like better than MercadoLibre

See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of March 3, 2022
Danny Vena: MercadoLibre has been called a lot of things. When it first arrived on the scene it was called the eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) of Latin America because back then, eBay was the dominant e-commerce platform. Since then, it has been called the Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) of Latin America because now it hosts e-commerce platforms for a wide variety of merchants across Latin America. It's been called the PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) of Latin America because of its fintech arm, Mercado Pago.
It offers a wide variety of things and it's earned all those names but really none of those paint a full picture of what it is MercadoLibre does. If you've been looking at the slide here, as I'm sure you have, it covers a lot of area. I'm going to stop that screen share for just a minute and I'm going to jump forward to the numbers.
Now, one of the things that we have seen lately with a lot of e-commerce stocks is the fact that they put up pretty good numbers year-over-year, but they haven't been near the level that they were growing triple digits during the pandemic. A lot of that has caused the e-commerce stocks to fall because some investors think, well, e-commerce is over. It got a bump from the pandemic and now we're not going to see growth for years.
Mercado Libre really turned that on its head. Not only did the company grow pretty impressively, year-over-year up 74% in the fourth quarter, but also it edged higher sequentially across a variety of metrics. Gross merchandise volume was up year-over-year and sequentially. That is the value of the products sold on its platform.
Its fintech arm did a lot better than that. Total payment volume grew 73%, and that was up from 59% in the third quarter. Off platform total payment volume. I want to take a second on that. MercadoLibre used to be like PayPal, just something that MercadoLibre used on its platform in order to help users make payments.
Because we're talking about an area of the world that is still largely cash-based, half the people in the region don't have a checking account, don't have a credit card, and Mercado Pago allowed them to go to the local convenience store, give some money to the cashier, have it added to their account, and boom, use Mercado Pago like a credit card. It became so popular, however, that it moved off of MercadoLibre's platform and a lot of merchants that had websites said, ""Hey, I want to use that payment method here too because it's so popular.""
Eventually, it moved off the platform and is now accepted at a growing number of brick-and-mortar stores. You can see the off-platform total payment volume nearly doubled again year-over-year and that's up from 79% growth in the third quarter. By and large, MercadoLibre delivered on all of the metrics that matter. We saw consistent growth in its user base, we saw consistent growth in the non-financial metrics that tend to vary over time.
But this really was exactly what the company needed to do in order for investors to say to themselves, ""Hey, well, that's not too bad. I expected it to be like all of the other e-commerce stocks that I have in my portfolio that have fallen lately and it really didn't do that.""
Matt Frankel: I was very impressed with the numbers all around. Still, a pretty small company when you compare it to Amazon or any of those. One thing I would say about MercadoLibre and other stocks like this, don't try to time the bottom on these. If you love a company, you love their results, you love what they're doing, go for it. It may fall another 10%, it may go up another 10%, whatever. Don't try to time the bottom.
It's a real estate quote that I like to say, is that you make your money when you buy, not when you sell. It's really true when it comes to investing in these stocks. You make your money by buying good companies at reasonable valuations not by trying to time the bottom. No one tries to time the real estate market to the day to try to get the best deal. The same logic should apply here. If MercadoLibre is $2,000 again in the year, am I going to care whether I paid $800 or $900 for it right now? No.
That's just something to keep in mind as you start looking for opportunities in this market. But I really love MercadoLibre's business all around. I feel like it could be, not necessarily as big as Amazon just because the U.S. is a more lucrative market than Latin America, but it could definitely be in the same ballpark. It's really not yet. It's still pretty small, relatively.

2022-03-09 00:00:00+00:00,Is PayPal Stock a Buy?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-paypal-stock-a-buy,,,"Despite one analyst downgrade today, shares of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) were bouncing higher along with the broader market. The stock has lost nearly half of its value year to date after a disappointing outlook for the year ahead.
While Bank of America (BofA) doesn't see any upside for the stock in 2022, it's hard not to resist the tempting value in PayPal right now. Should investors pull the trigger at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21?
Management expects adjusted earnings per share in 2022 to be flat to up to 3% over 2021. So, even though PayPal trades at its lowest P/E multiple as a publicly traded company, it's possible the stock could continue to underperform this year.
Some analysts have questioned whether competitors like Apple Pay are encroaching on PayPal's turf. Apple Pay is integrated across Apple's devices -- a massive installed base that stood at 1.8 billion at the start of the year. But there are a few numbers from PayPal's recent quarter that suggest it is still a trusted brand for more than 400 million users.
PayPal reported that the number of transactions per account grew 11% over the year-ago quarter. That's a meaningful acceleration over 1% growth in the fourth quarter of 2020.
PayPal also added 49 million active accounts to finish 2021 with 426 million, which reflects an entrenched and trusted brand.
Image source: PayPal Holdings.
Customer account growth will slow in 2022 as management shifts its strategy to driving higher revenue per user rather than adding new users. This seems to be the biggest factor weighing on the stock's performance.
However, PayPal's early outlook calls for revenue and adjusted earnings to grow above 20% entering 2023. The recent sell-off appears to be an overreaction to what could be a temporary slowdown in growth partly caused by management's shift in growth strategy and the transition of eBay to its own payments system.
At these lows, investors could give this fintech leader the benefit of the doubt. But I might wait to see if PayPal actually reaccelerates its growth toward the end of 2022 before making an investment.

2022-03-09 00:00:00+00:00,Why PayPal Holdings Stock Was Up Despite Analyst Downgrade,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-paypal-holdings-stock-was-up-despite-analyst-downgrade,,,"What happened
Shares of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) were trading up 4.9% as of 12:49 p.m. ET on Wednesday. The move comes after Bank of America (BofA) downgraded the stock from a buy to hold.
However, a lift in broader market sentiment is winning out today. At the time of writing, the S&P 500 index was also up 2.8% as investors digest the latest developments in Ukraine and possibly seek out bargains on the dip.
So what
Analyst Jason Kupferberg with BofA cited reasons that don't hinge on PayPal's long-term competitive position but instead are based on short-term headwinds. The analyst sees PayPal entering a ""transition year"" that could weigh on the stock price.
Specifically, the analyst sees management's pivot to driving higher revenue-per-user (instead of new customer growth) becoming more complicated given the problems in Ukraine. Nearly a third of PayPal's revenue was earned in Europe in 2021, according to the analyst. This clouds the near-term outlook for growth and therefore doesn't give investors any clear catalysts for when revenue might accelerate again.
Image source: Getty Images.
Now what
PayPal's guidance calls for revenue to increase between 15% to 17% in 2022, which includes a four-point reduction from the loss of eBay. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be flat to up to 3% over 2021. Earnings will include a 12-point headwind stemming from reserve releases and taxes.
The loss of eBay's payment volume has been a concern for investors over the last few years. eBay recently transitioned to its own payments system faster than PayPal expected. The payments leader disclosed that the loss of eBay's business in 2021 reduced its top-line growth by a whopping 11 percentage points. Excluding eBay, PayPal's revenue would have grown 29%.
But remember, the stock has already fallen 56% over the last year, so a lot of these concerns may be priced in for the most part. At a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21, long-term-focused investors could have a great value on their hands to ride the long-term growth of digital payments.

2022-03-08 00:00:00+00:00,"4 Reasons to Buy Coupang, and 1 Reason to Sell",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-reasons-to-buy-coupang-and-1-reason-to-sell,,,"Coupang (NYSE: CPNG), the largest e-commerce company in South Korea, recently posted its fourth-quarter earnings report.
Its revenue rose 34% year-over-year to $5.08 billion, but its net loss widened nearly fivefold from $83 million to $405 million. On an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) basis, its net loss still widened from $82 million to $285 million.
That flood of red ink drew the market's attention away from Coupang's robust top-line growth, and the stock remains about 40% below its IPO price of $35. Let's discuss four clear reasons to buy Coupang -- as well as one reason to sell it -- to see if investors are ignoring a multibagger in the making.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Impressive customer growth
Coupang's active customer count rose 21% year-over-year to 17.94 million in the fourth quarter, marking its 16th consecutive quarter of more than 20% customer growth. Its net revenue per active customer also continued to rise.

Data source: Coupang. YOY = Year-over-year.
The stable growth indicates that Coupang's investments in its logistics network over the past several years, which placed fulfillment centers within seven miles of about 70% of the South Korean population, are paying off.
In 2021, Coupang expanded its total infrastructure by 15 million square feet, representing more expansion than its previous two years combined. That's why its net losses are widening so rapidly. But over the long term, it could rein in its spending as economies of scale kick in.
2. Rocket WOW's rapid expansion
In late 2018, Coupang launched Rocket WOW, a subscription-based service that provides free next-day deliveries, early morning deliveries, free returns within 30 days, free streaming videos through Coupang Play, and other perks. It currently costs 4,990 won ($4.10) per month.
Coupang ended 2021 with nine million paid WOW subscribers, or nearly half of its active customers, compared to six million subscribers a year ago. Coupang likely operates WOW at a loss, but CEO Bom Kim pointed out that those subscribers ""purchase with significantly higher frequency and across more categories than non-WOW members"" during a conference call last May.
That model makes Rocket WOW comparable to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime, which locked in more than 200 million subscribers last year. Coupang raised WOW's monthly price for the first time last December, and it could continue raising its fees as it gains more customers.
3. Stable revenue growth
Coupang's revenue rose 54% to $18.4 billion in fiscal 2021. However, that marked a slowdown from its 93% increase in 2020, and its growth decelerated over the past four quarters:

Data source: Coupang.
Yet that slowdown wasn't surprising. Like many other e-commerce companies, Coupang's growth accelerated during the pandemic as more people shopped online, then faced tougher comps as the lockdown measures were relaxed.
4. A bargain bin valuation
Looking ahead, analysts expect Coupang's revenue to rise 26% in fiscal 2022 and increase 24% in 2023. Those growth rates are stellar for a stock that trades at just 1.6 times this year's sales.
By comparison, analysts expect Amazon's revenue to rise just 15% this year, but the stock trades at nearly three times that estimate. eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), which is growing at a much slower rate than Coupang and Amazon, also trades at about three times this year's sales.
5. The one reason to sell Coupang: its margins
But unlike Amazon and eBay, Coupang isn't profitable. Its net loss widened from $463 million in 2020 to $1.54 billion in 2021.

Data source: Coupang. *Impacted by a fulfillment center fire.
On the bright side, Coupang was still sitting on $3.5 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of 2021. It also expects its adjusted EBITDA loss to narrow from $748 million in 2021 to $400 million or less in 2022, and to turn profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis by the fourth quarter of 2022.
But investors should take those rosy estimates with a grain of salt since Coupang is still heavily focused on fortifying its domestic business while expanding into overseas markets like Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and Japan.
Is it the right time to buy Coupang?
Coupang still has plenty of growth potential, but it faces intense competition and lacks a clear path toward profitability. It could easily double from its current levels once it generates stable growth with narrowing losses, but I wouldn't accumulate more shares until its financial discipline improves.

2022-03-07 00:00:00+00:00,New to Investing in 2022? 3 Surefire Stocks to Buy,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/new-to-investing-in-2022-3-surefire-stocks-to-buy,,,"Buying quality stocks and holding them for decades has proven to be the best way to grow your savings. While the market's recent dip might be concerning to some, remember that the S&P 500 index has fallen 10% or more a total of nine times since 2007, but since then, the index has nearly tripled in value.
What are the best stocks to buy today? Three Motley Fool contributors offered their suggestions for the best stocks for new investors to consider buying. Here's why they picked BJ's Wholesale (NYSE: BJ), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST), and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY).
Image source: Getty Images.
A small warehouse operator with room to expand
John Ballard (BJ's Wholesale): A good way to start investing in 2022 is to choose companies that deliver value to consumers in the near term while still offering above-average growth potential over the long term. BJ's Wholesale just reported strong results to close out fiscal 2021 and is a relatively inexpensive growth stock to consider right now.
BJ's operates in the same market as Costco Wholesale. It's a membership-based warehouse store that primarily operates on the East Coast with 226 clubs and 157 gas stations in 17 states. BJ's started in 1984 and has had no problem growing while going up against entrenched retailers like Costco and Walmart's Sam's Club.
Like Costco, most of BJ's profit comes from its membership fees, which grew 8.4% last year to $360 million. Total memberships increased 3% in fiscal 2021 and grew 15% compared to two years ago. BJ's also reported the highest renewal rate in company history -- all good signs that BJ's is offering the consumer incredible value at a time when prices for everyday goods are climbing at the highest rate in 40 years.
""The health of our membership base is poised to deliver long-term future growth,"" CFO Laura Felice said on the recent earnings call. ""BJ's is a company that is stronger today than it has ever been, and we will look to extend and grow this position.""
At this juncture, BJ's is offering great value to investors. The stock trades at a relatively inexpensive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18. That compares favorably to the average P/E of 24 for the S&P 500 index. The stock has already more than doubled from its initial public offering (IPO) in 2018. It just might be like investing in Costco 30 years ago.
An excellent choice for any portfolio
Jennifer Saibil (Costco): If you're considering getting into investing, Costco is a great starter choice. It has an easy-to-understand business model that most people are familiar with; it's been an outstanding stock to own over time; and it still has plenty of room to grow.
Sales have been elevated since the pandemic started. At the beginning, it was due to customers stocking up on essentials. Now, it's due to the company's low prices, which are shoppers' best bet against inflation.
Costco operates a membership model, and it took in almost $1 billion in membership fees alone in the fiscal second quarter (ended Feb. 13). Sales increased 16% year over year in Q2 to more than $100 billion, and earnings per share increased from $2.14 last year to $2.92 this year. That's in spite of increased costs and supply-chain backups. Volume was strong enough to cover higher costs, and it also gives the company leverage when dealing with suppliers. It's laser-focused on keeping prices down, which brings customers in when times are tough but even when times are good. That's why it's such a winning model.
The retailer owns 828 global warehouses with 572 in the U.S., and it plans to open 28 net new units in 2022. Its careful and gradual expansion gives it many long-term growth opportunities, especially as it successfully develops its presence internationally.
Costco stock gained more than 50% in 2021, but it's down 7% so far in 2022. Shares trade at a slightly expensive 42 times trailing-12-month earnings. Costco shares typically trade at a premium because it is a reliable sales and profit-producing machine. It also pays a dividend that it raises annually and which yields .6% at the current price. That's below average, but it also pays a special dividend evey few years when cash levels are high, and management said that might be happening soon.
Costco is a no-brainer stock to keep in any diversified portfolio. It provides growth opportunities as well as income.
An e-commerce retailer that has proven it can grow profits
Parkev Tatevosian (eBay): Online auction and e-commerce site eBay thrived at the pandemic onset. Note that eBay does not own any of the inventory for sale on the platform. Instead, eBay brings together buyer and seller, and takes a percentage of every transaction. In that way, eBay is immune from inventory risk. The unique retailer benefited as hundreds of millions of folks looked to avoid shopping in person. The momentum from 2020 carried into 2021, and the company put together its best two-year revenue growth in the last decade.
Sales growth is icing on the cake for eBay investors as it is a company's primary strength. eBay is better known for impressive earnings growth. Indeed, eBay has increased earnings per share over the last decade at a compound annual growth rate of 23.6%. For those new to investing, earnings growth is arguably the most vital metric to follow. It can be easy to grow sales if you offer your product at a low enough price. Generating earnings growth is more challenging and requires managing a business to be competitive on pricing while keeping expenses below revenue.
eBay's proven capability to do both makes it an excellent, surefire stock for those new to investing. What's more, eBay can be had at inexpensive prices. And since earnings are one of the most vital metrics for a company, it follows that the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is one of the most critical valuation metrics to consider. In that regard, eBay is selling at a forward P/E of 12.97. That's near the lowest price eBay has sold for, according to the aforementioned metric, in the last year.

2022-03-03 00:00:00+00:00,6 Stocks That Moved the Market in February,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/6-stocks-that-moved-the-market-in-february,,,"February was a huge month in the stock market, and investors can look back to identify key trends. Earnings season created some winners and losers, while geopolitical tensions and a growth stock sell-off drastically increased volatility. Here are some of the stocks that played the biggest roles in February's market.
1. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: FB) dropped 32.8% in February, wiping out $300 billion in market capitalization. Most of the damage was inflicted in the days following the tech giant's fourth-quarter earnings report. Meta's earnings fell short of Wall Street's forecasts, but investors were even more troubled by the details.
Image source: Getty Images.
The company reported a decline in daily active users across its social media platforms for the first time in its history. Meta issued sales guidance that was below analyst expectations, while its increased investments into virtual reality will reduce cash flow for the next few years.
In a difficult stock market, this combination of bad news and lukewarm outlook was enough to crush the social media leader.
2. PayPal
Fintech leader PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) was another victim of a poorly received earnings report, falling more than 35%. PayPal's updated quarterly forecast calls for lower-than-expected sales growth and a decline in earnings relative to last year.
The company struggled to meet its forecasts for new account growth last year. PayPal is also dealing with a modest drag on sales as it loses transactions from eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) that have contributed to revenue for years. With those challenges in mind, the company is abandoning its aggressive goal of achieving 750 million active accounts by 2025.
PayPal was a high-valuation growth stock, but its growth trajectory is in jeopardy. The valuation responded accordingly, moving closer to the ratios that are common among moderate-growth tech stocks.
3. Home Depot
Home Depot (NYSE: HD) was struggling along with the market in general before investors soured on its Feb. 22 earnings report. The retail stock reported respectable sales and earnings growth, and it announced a 15% increase in its quarterly dividend.
However, investors were concerned about a decline in traffic. Inflation and supply chain issues also present ongoing challenges that could threaten sales and cash flow this year. The company's guidance for essentially no growth next year wasn't good enough to sustain the stock's 21.5 forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and 1.9% dividend yield.
FB, PYPL, HD total return level. Data by YCharts.
4. Snap
Snap (NASDAQ: SNAP) staged a big turnaround and climbed 22.7% in February. The social media powerhouse beat analyst estimates for user growth and sales, and it achieved net profits for the first time ever.
The stock had fallen 70% from its all-time high, sending its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio as low as 24 prior to earnings. That steep sell-off left plenty of room for the rebound. Even after this rally, Snap is still more than 50% below the $83 per share that it hit last September.
As with other social media stocks, Snap faces short-term uncertainty due to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iOS privacy updates. It also has a ton of long-term opportunity with virtual and augmented reality. That's a recipe for volatility.
CVX, SNAP, BILL total return level. Data by YCharts.
5. Chevron
Chevron (NYSE: CVX) climbed 10.8% in February as oil soared above $95 per barrel, sending the energy sector higher. Chevron had stumbled late in January after its quarterly report revealed disappointing profits.
Still, the company achieved record free cash flow and reduced its debt, so a sharp spike in oil prices was enough to propel Chevron higher. Inflation across the global economy and conflict in Eastern Europe are boosting energy prices, which should translate to larger short-term profits for the oil giant.
6. Bill.com
Bill.com Holdings (NYSE: BILL) enjoyed a turnaround in February. The fintech stock lost half of its market value from November 2021 through January 2022, but it climbed 26.4% in February after a strong earnings report. In the first week of the month, Bill.com reported adjusted profits that were nearly breakeven, while analysts had expected a net loss of more than $15 million. The company also tripled revenue over the prior year, topping Wall Street's forecast by 20%.
It is still at a stage where it's naturally volatile. The company is consistently achieving enormous growth, but investors have to pay a premium to own it: The stock's P/S ratio is over 50. As Bill.com burns through more than $15 million in cash each quarter to fund its growth, investors are quick to sell if there's any hint of bad news about the company itself or the market in general.

2022-03-03 00:00:00+00:00,Investing in NFTs? Here's Why You Should Buy Shopify Stock,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investing-in-nfts-heres-why-you-should-buy-shopify-stock,,,"NFT sales skyrocketed to the moon in 2021. Working from a base of hundreds of millions of dollars in 2020, NFT sales rocketed to $25 billion globally in 2021 as digital artists, musicians, video game enthusiasts, and collectors in general flocked to the blockchain and crypto technology. Some analysts (notably, market prognosticators at Jefferies (NYSE: JEF)) see sales booming to $35 billion in 2022.
A handful of creators and collectors have made some serious dough in the NFT world, and the sudden size of this market is attracting plenty of attention from investors now as well. If you're looking for a way to invest in NFTs but don't know which crypto token, artist, or creator project to start with, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) stock might be a fantastic place to begin.

An up-and-running NFT marketplace you can actually invest in
As is frequently the case with new technology, the NFT field is crowded with options and potential opportunities. A lucky few of them have quickly paid off big time. However, many blockchain projects (on which NFTs are ""minted"" or created, usually on the Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) blockchain) and actual NFT art and collections will have a low probability of holding their value over time. That doesn't mean you shouldn't buy an NFT. On the contrary, there are reasons why you might want to buy one -- or if you're an artist or creator, mint and sell some of your work as an NFT.
For the uninitiated, though, I always advise them to get started looking for publicly traded companies that have a hand in a burgeoning new industry. At this juncture, NFT stocks are limited. Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN) is working on an NFT marketplace and has a waiting list to get early access. eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) also started allowing NFT sales on its site last year. Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) cloud segment AWS has some extensions available to help developers build their own marketplace. Top destinations to mint and buy NFTs like OpenSea are private companies right now.
Enter Shopify, the e-commerce software giant used by a couple of million merchants worldwide. Shopify already has its NFT software up and running. On the fourth-quarter 2021earnings call Shopify president Harley Finkelstein said developing new ways for small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs to reach customers is always a top priority and called attention to Shopify's NFT tech.
""In 2022, we will continue to innovate on behalf of our merchants, bringing more exciting opportunities and capabilities to these brands, enhancing their ability to sell in new and creative ways, such as selling NFTs. Selling NFTs on Shopify, which is currently in beta, creates a new way for brands, artists, and creators to engage with their communities by selling their own NFTs across multiple blockchains.""
Currently, Shopify's NFT Beta program is available to all U.S.-based Shopify Plus customers (those that subscribe to the $2,000-per-month service spanning all parts of online business management). Shopify's site-building and management software has particular appeal for those who want control of their branding and their customers' NFT journey.
Picks and shovels, or sift through the dirt?
Of course, NFT sales are an insignificant part of Shopify's business right now (since the project is still in beta test mode), and that's likely not going to change anytime soon. Nevertheless, I think this is a great pick-and-shovel investment in NFTs, one with a lot of upside potential over the next decade, without needing to sift through the countless NFT projects out there in search of a very rare gem.
Shopify has a well-established track record of fostering new e-commerce ventures on behalf of its users, and the company is gearing up for another round of heavy investment. Finkelstein dropping the NFT service on theearnings callcan be taken as an indication that things are off to a good start for those merchants using it so far.
Perhaps most importantly, should the NFT sales firehose suddenly lose some pressure (seriously, it's possible -- remember, this is still pretty new technology), Shopify stock certainly isn't going to blow up as a result. Think of NFTs as a low-risk but high-reward bet for Shopify at this point. Given how well-entrenched Shopify is into the e-commerce industry's fabric, I think it could work out. If it does succeed, that's fantastic! If Shopify NFTs are a flop, no harm and no foul. You still own shares of one of the best digital commerce businesses around.

2022-03-03 00:00:00+00:00,3 E-Commerce Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-e-commerce-stocks-you-can-buy-and-hold-for-the-next-decade,,,"Online shopping may have tapered off in 2021 from the historic surge it witnessed during the lockdown phase of the pandemic. But the Commerce Department says e-commerce still rose over 14% last year, with shoppers spending $870.8 billion online.
That was in line with total retail sales, which also rose 14% to $4.5 trillion, and e-commerce accounted for nearly one in five dollars spent by consumers. It also means that shoppers didn't completely abandon the habits they developed during the early phases of the pandemic.
Even though e-commerce soared by more than 31% in 2020, consumers are still turning to online markets for their shopping needs today and will continue to spend increasing amounts of money online in the future. That makes investing in e-commerce stocks a sure-fire winner, and the following three companies are among the best options out there.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Amazon.com
Of course, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) has to be in the mix because of its dominance in U.S. and European markets and its leading position in Asia, exclusive of China, where Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) dominates the market.
While Amazon's revenue growth slowed in 2021 to just 21% in currency-adjusted dollars compared to 38% the year before, it continues to account for a massive portion of all e-commerce sales. DigitalCommerce360 estimates that between Amazon's own sales and those of third-party merchants, gross merchandise value (GMV) rose 18.8% to $379 billion to give Amazon a 43.5% share of the U.S. market.
Moreover, of the entire increase in total e-commerce sales last year, Amazon was responsible for 55.4% of it. It's clear that for many consumers, Amazon.com is the first place they turn to when they need something and very often the only place they look.
Coupled with the powerhouse that is Amazon Web Services, the highly profitable cloud infrastructure service that powers the internet presence and online capabilities of so many other companies and institutions, Amazon is the one-stop-shop for everything e-commerce. Its stock has fallen almost 20% from recent highs, which seems an overreaction to the natural slowdown, partially caused by supply chain issues beyond its control.
That's putting Amazon's stock back in the area where it was before the pandemic. For a company that owns nearly half the online market and is responsible for well more than half of e-commerce's growth, that makes it a bargain stock, one you can own for decades.

2. JD.com
Chinese e-commerce platform JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) is the eBay of China, an online platform for third-party sellers, and consumers are flocking to its virtual aisles.
Third-quarter sales soared 25.5% to $33.9 billion, almost as good as the 29% gain it saw in the same period the year before. Annual active customer accounts -- people who have made at least one purchase over the past year -- jumped by a similar percentage to reach 552.2 million.
During China's annual Singles Day sales extravaganza, the equivalent of Amazon's Prime Day event but stretched out over 11 days, JD.com generated $54.6 billion in GMV. In comparison, Prime Day generated sales of $11.2 billion for Amazon.
As China has cracked down on tech stocks, especially companies affiliated with Alibaba's Jack Ma, the markets have worried about the fallout for JD.com, sending its stock lower. And just this month, Beijing ordered Chinese companies to report their exposure to Alibaba's Ant Group, the financial firm Ma had planned on taking public until intense regulatory scrutiny scrubbed it.
Previously JD has said it had little to worry about in such a crackdown, but investing in Chinese stocks has become riskier as a result. Still, the e-commerce giant has navigated the waters successfully thus far and should be able to grow for years to come.

3. Shopify
Not an e-commerce site itself, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) is the seller of picks and shovels to those wanting to establish an e-commerce presence. That business exploded during the pandemic as people out of work sought to start up their own businesses, but that has since eased as the economy reopened.
In Shopify's fourth-quarter earnings report last month, CFO Amy Shapero told analysts, ""We believe that the Covid-triggered acceleration of e-commerce that spilled into the first half of 2021 in the form of lockdowns and government stimulus will be absent from 2022.""
The slowdown caused Shopify's stock to crater, dropping shares to lows not seen since the pandemic first began. That seems highly short-sighted because of the potential its business still represents.
Shopify is becoming a vertically integrated one-stop-shop for businesses small and large. While its original focus was on helping mom-and-pop shops start, medium-size and enterprise-class businesses are now turning to Shopify's offerings, which it continues to expand.
Beyond just the typical back-end operations it specializes in, Shopify is now offering businesses a slew of new options, including merchant money management accounts (Shopify Balance), small business loans (Shopify Capital), fully hosted enterprise e-commerce platforms (Shopify Plus). It will begin selling NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, to help businesses and brands connect with their customers and fans.
With e-commerce solidly cemented with consumers, Shopify is a sure bet for decades-long growth.

2022-03-01 00:00:00+00:00,eBay Projects Reopening Headwinds to Persist in 2022,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-projects-reopening-headwinds-to-persist-in-2022,,,"Online marketplace eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) reported its fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 earnings after the markets closed on Wednesday, Feb. 23. The results highlighted a company experiencing headwinds as shoppers revert to pre-pandemic shopping behavior.
That was to be expected. Shoppers diverted a large part of their spending online at the pandemic's onset as they looked to avoid crowded places where they could potentially be exposed to COVID-19. Now that billions of doses of an effective vaccine have been administered, people feel more comfortable leaving their homes. As a result, spending on eBay's platform is decreasing.

eBay is raising fees to sustain revenue
In its fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2021, eBay reported gross merchandise volume of $20.7 billion. That was down 10% from the same quarter in the prior year. The metric measures the total dollar sum of spending on its platform. It's vital because eBay earns revenue by taking a percentage of these transactions.
That was the third, consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines in the metric. Unsurprisingly, it follows momentum in economic reopening, which started gaining steam in the second quarter of 2021. The fall is more dramatic in its international segment, which decreased by 17% in Q4 vs. the U.S., which fell 2%.
Interestingly, eBay has sustained revenue growth despite declining consumer spending on its platform. To achieve this feat, the company has increased the transaction take rate, which is the percentage it keeps from each sale. In Q4 2021, that figure was 11.8%, up 180 basis points from 10% in Q4 2020.
Of course, sellers on the platform are not too happy about the change. eBay is taking a more significant share of sales. That leaves them a choice: increase prices to maintain profits or keep prices the same and earn less. The choice is not easy -- if one seller raises prices and competitors don't, the competitors will make more sales. The other option is to leave eBay's ecosystem entirely, which 2 million sellers chose to do.
As of Dec. 31, eBay had annual active sellers of 17 million. That was down by 2 million from the 19 million it boasted as of Sept. 30. Sellers and buyers are equally vital to eBay's success. If fewer items are for sale, buyers will be less interested in frequenting eBay. Similarly, if fewer buyers are visiting, businesses will be less interested in listing items on eBay.
Unfortunately for shareholders, eBay is simultaneously shedding buyers and sellers. In Q4, active buyers decreased by 9% to 147 million.
eBay has a profit focus
eBay expects headwinds to persist and is projecting gross merchandise volume will decline by around 9% in 2022. Surprisingly, the stock was up by 1.5% on the day following the report. Perhaps the market appreciated that management expects adjusted earnings per share to increase by 6.5% despite the headwinds in 2022.
Increasing the take rate puts the company on firmer footing in the long run, serving fewer customers more profitably. Management's philosophy can be a breath of fresh air for investors fatigued by businesses with the ""growth at all costs"" strategy. If you find yourself in that camp, eBay can be an outstanding stock to put on your list.

2022-03-01 00:00:00+00:00,eBay's Growth Hangover Has Arrived,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebays-growth-hangover-has-arrived,,,"It was bound to happen eventually, but investors were still jolted to see eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) growth turn negative in late 2021. The e-commerce platform, which became an essential marketplace for many sellers during earlier phases of the pandemic, is shrinking compared to those high-growth days.
eBay warned this week that sales volumes will remain negative into early 2022 as the company goes up against big spikes from a year earlier.
That pressure will lesson as the year progresses, though, and eBay sees room to expand sales slightly in 2022. Management is also planning to shower shareholders with cash over the next few quarters through dividends and stock buybacks.
Let's dive right in.
Sales were strong
While sales volumes fell 11% this quarter, eBay's fourth-quarter demand was better than expected. Sure, the company handled far fewer transactions than it did a year ago. But that's no surprise given that late 2020 marked historically strong growth. Overall, transactions were down 22% over the holiday period.

eBay got help from its new advertising and payments businesses and from higher selling prices, so overall organic revenue was up 5%. That result hit the high end of management's guidance. ""Rounding out a very strong year,"" CEO Jamie Iannone said in a press release, ""I'm proud of our team for delivering yet another solid quarter.""
Looking deeper
There were two warning signs in the report that imply a tough period ahead for eBay. The pool of active buyers shrank at a 9% rate, nearly doubling the pace from the prior quarter. Sellers tend to follow buyers, meaning eBay will have a harder time boosting volumes and collecting transaction fees.
And speaking of fees, eBay's take rate stalled at 11.8% of sales after having jumped in each of the last four quarters. Investors have been hoping to see that figure rise over time thanks to new buyer services like payments processing. The Q4 results suggest that this expansion can't happen during significant volume declines.
The outlook
eBay's 2022 outlook was a good news/bad news scenario. On the bright side, the company forecast that growth will stabilize later in the year so that organic sales stay slightly positive for the full period. In other words, eBay is expecting a soft landing after two years of unusually strong growth.
In addition, the company is planning to deliver lots of cash to shareholders. Management just gave eBay's dividend a 22% hike and also approved a $4 billion stock repurchase plan.
The bad news is that fiscal Q1 is expected to show a sales decline of 5% to 7% as volumes shrink. This slump will likely pressure earnings just as it did in late 2021.
One or two quarters of modest revenue declines shouldn't matter to investors, especially given eBay's big gains in 2020 and 2021. Management is saying that growth will return by the second half of the year, too.
But today's investing climate has investors focused more on the short-term outlook, which is mostly negative for eBay. That sour mood might set investors up for big gains ahead as the company works through its growth hangover. Yet, the shares aren't likely to spike again until eBay's recovery is already underway.
