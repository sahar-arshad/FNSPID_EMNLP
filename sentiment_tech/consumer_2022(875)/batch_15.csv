2022-05-27 00:00:00+00:00,"Stock Market News for May 27, 2022",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-news-for-may-27-2022,,,"Wall Street closed sharply higher on Thursday witnessing a correction rally in a highly oversold market. Market participants sentiments have been boosted following the Fed’s FOMC minutes and strong earnings results by some major retailers. All three major stock indexes ended in the green.
How Did The Benchmarks Perform?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) appreciated 1.6% or 516.91 points to close at 32,637.19. Notably, 27 components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory while 3 in negative zone. The blue-chip index posted a 5-day winning streak, the longest since Mar 23.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 11.740.65, climbing 2.7% or 305.91 points due to the strong performance of large-cap technology stocks.
Meanwhile, the S&P 500 advanced 2% to end at 4,057.84. Ten out of 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in positive zone while one ended in red. The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC), the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), the Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF), the Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI)  and the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) rallied 2.4%, 4.9%, 2.3% and 2% and 2.4%, respectively.
The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was down 3.1% to 27.50. A total of 11.43 billion shares were traded Thursday, lower than the last 20-session average of 13.22 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 5.16-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.95-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.
A Relief Rally
Wall Street has seen extreme volatility in the last couple of months on concerns of soaring inflation, an ultra-hawkish Fed and a near-term recession. This week U.S. stock markets have seen a relief rally. Weak to date- the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – are up 4.4%, 4% and 3.4%, respectively.
Investors’ confidence was further  bolstered following the release of the Fed’s May FOMC minutes. The minutes also said, “a restrictive stance of policy may well become appropriate depending on the evolving economic outlook and the risks to the outlook.”
Following the release of minutes, market participants expect that the central bank may not turn too tough in its monetary stances so that the economy will be pushed into a recession.
Strong Retail Earnings
Market participants were concerned about the slowing growth of the U.S. economy after several retail behemoths have revealed in their earnings report that mounting inflation and shortage of labor are eating their profits. Moreover, they warned that consumers are gradually shifting from purchasing discretionary items to necessary goods, especially groceries.
However, on May 26, three major retailers, namely, Macy's Inc. M, Dollar Tree Inc. DLTR and Dollar General Corp. DG reported strong first-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings results. All three retailers exceeded the consensus estimates for both the top and bottom line and provided solid guidance.
Consequently, shares of Macy's, Dollar Tree and Dollar General have rallied 19.3%, 21.9% and 13.7%, respectively. Macy's currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Economic Data
The Department of Commerce reported that the U.S. GDP was contracted by 1.5% in first-quarter 2022 compared with 1.4% reported earlier. The consensus estimate was for a fall of 1.3%. Higher consumer spending was more than offset by weak business and private investment. Growing trade deficit was another negative for GDP’s growth.
The Department of Labor reported that weekly jobless claims fell by 8,000 to 210,000 for the week ended May 21. The consensus estimate was 218,000. The 4-week moving average was 206,750, an increase of 7,250 from the previous week's data of 199,500. Continuing claims (those who already received government benefits) increased to 1.346 million for the week ended May 14. Previous week’s data was revised downward to 1.315 million from 1.317 million reported earlier.
The National Association of Realtors reported that its Pending Home Sales Index dropped 3.9% to 99.3 in April. The consensus estimate was for a decline of 2%. March’s data was revised downward to a decline of 1.6% from a decline of 1.2% reported earlier. Year over year, the index fell 9.1%.

LONDON/BEIJING, May 27 (Reuters) - World stocks were heading for their first weekly gain in eight weeks on Friday on a more upbeat earnings view while the dollar hit one-month lows after the Federal Reserve's minutes suggested it could put the brakes on rapid rate hikes later this year.
Optimistic U.S. earnings outlooks overnight from department store operator Macy's Inc M.N and discount chains Dollar General Corp DG.N and Dollar Tree DLTR.O boosted stocks.
The Fed's minutes of its May meeting released on Wednesday confirmed two more 50-basis-point hikes each in June and July, but policymakers also suggested the potential for a pause later in the year.
""It's all flowed through from the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) minutes,"" said Giles Coghlan, chief currency analyst at HYCM.
""Investors were relieved there wasn't a 75 basis points hint.""
Markets would focus on the April core PCE price index for the United States due later on Friday for further signs on whether inflation was running hot, Coghlan added.

European shares .STOXX hit a 10-day high and were up 0.18%. Britain's FTSE .FTSE eased 0.23%, off the previous day's three-week highs.
Hong Kong shares .HSI rose 2.7% after better-than-expected first-quarter revenue growth from Alibaba 9988.HK and Baidu 9888.HK. Asian shares .MIAPJ0000PUS also benefited from hopes of stabilising Sino-U.S. ties and more Chinese government stimulus.
The United States would not block China from growing its economy, but wanted it to adhere to international rules, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday in remarks that some investors interpreted as positive for bilateral ties.
Japan's Nikkei .N225 advanced 0.7%, China's mainland blue-chips .CSI300 rose 0.2%，and Australia's resources-heavy index .AXJO climbed 1.1%.

BEIJING/TOKYO, May 27 (Reuters) - Asian shares on Friday extended overnight global gains thanks to strong results from regional tech firms and U.S. retailers, while investors also took comfort from Federal Reserve minutes suggesting it could pause its rapid rate hikes later this year.
The swing in sentiment left the dollar wallowing at one-month lows, with the euro rising to its highest since April 25.
However, the optimism is likely to fade when the European markets open. The pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures STXEc1 were flat, German DAX futures FDXc1 were down 0.02% while FTSE futures FFIc1 were 0.34% lower.
Both Nasdaq futures .NQcv1 and S&P500 futures ESc1 eased 0.1%.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rallied 1.8%, the biggest gain in a week, buoyed by a 2.8% jump in Hong Kong stocks .HSI as Chinese tech firms got a boost from better-than-expected first-quarter revenue growth from Alibaba 9988.HK and Baidu 9888.HK, as well as hopes of stabilising Sino-U.S. ties and more government stimulus.
Japan's Nikkei .N225 advanced 0.6%, China's mainland blue-chips .CSI300 rose 0.6%，and Australia's resources-heavy index .AXJO climbed 1.1%.
The United States will not block China from growing its economy, but wants it to adhere to international rules, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday in remarks that some investors interpreted as positive for bilateral ties.
Wall Street closed sharply higher overnight after optimistic retail earnings outlooks and waning concerns about overly aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed encouraged buyers.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 1.61%, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.99%, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC 2.68%.
Upbeat guidance from retailers such as Department store operator Macy's Inc M.N, discount chains Dollar General Corp DG.N and Dollar Tree DLTR.O appeared to offset dour warnings from their peers in recent weeks.
""Despite the fact that the five day gains on Wall St now at and above 4% suggests that the meltdown has been snapped, there should be no mistaking that this is but earnings relief; - and should not prematurely inspire proclamations of a bull market reboot,"" said analysts at Mizuho Bank.
Tapas Strickland, a director of economics and markets at NAB, said ""equities are sitting in the glow of the FOMC Minutes on Wednesday where it appears markets have interpreted them as opening up the possibility of a Fed pause in Q4 2022, while some note the front loading of hikes may have tightened financial conditions sufficiently.""
The Fed's minutes of its May meeting released on Wednesday confirmed two more 50-basis point hikes each in June and July, but policymakers also suggested the potential for a pause later in the year.
Still, the lift in equities has not spilt over to other asset markets, with bond yields broadly steady, Strickland noted.
On Friday, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR rose slightly to 2.7504% compared with its close of 2.7416% on Thursday. It had hit a three-year high of 3.2030% earlier this month on fears rapid hikes from the Fed may undermine long-term growth.
The two-year yield US2YT=RR, which rises with traders' expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.4618% compared with a close of 2.4778%.
""The fall in U.S. Treasury yields in the meantime has correlated with falls in inflation expectations, which had been above 3% in the 10yr, and are now in the 2.6% area. All in all, a pronounced decompression of stress,"" said analysts at ING in a note.
In the currency markets, the U.S. dollar =USDfell 0.2% against a basket of major currencies, further pulling away from its 20-year peaks hit two weeks ago. The euro EUR= gained 0.28% against the greenback. FRX/

Retail stocks have been under pressure, with inflation taking a toll on the amount of discretionary income consumers have at their disposal. However, strong results from Macy's (NYSE: M) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) suggest some retailers are finding ways to tap into changing trends and still be successful.

Macy's soars on spring strength
Shares of Macy's were up 18% on Thursday afternoon. The department store retailer gave investors good news in its first-quarter financial report.
Macy's saw revenue rise nearly 14% to $5.35 billion. The move higher came on a 12.4% rise in overall comparable store sales, combining both company-owned stores and licensed locations. Adjusted earnings moved sharply higher from the pandemic-affected first quarter of last year, nearly tripling to $1.08 per share. The company cited extremely strong sales gains for its Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury store concepts. Digital sales growth slowed to 2%, but was still up 34% from where it was three years ago prior to the pandemic.
Other business metrics showed Macy's overall success in handling some challenges. Gross margin climbed a full percentage point to 39.6%, showing promotional discipline. Expenses were down as a percentage of sales. Inventory levels rose 17% year over year as unpredictable supply chain conditions made it tough for Macy's to optimize its inventory handling, but the company was still pleased with its overall performance.
Macy's boosted its full-year 2022 guidance, now expecting adjusted earnings of $4.53 to $4.95 per share. That's $0.40 to $0.43 per share higher than its previous forecast, and it reflects new confidence that the department store has turned the corner.
Money grows on Dollar Tree
Dollar Tree shares saw an even bigger boost, soaring 21%. The discount retailer reported a big jump in its dollar-store business during the first quarter, showing the impact of shoppers looking for more bargains.
Dollar Tree's numbers were solid. Revenue rose 6.5% year over year to $6.9 billion on a 4.4% rise in same-store sales. There continued to be disparities between the company's two primary nameplate businesses, as Family Dollar comparables dropped 2.8% while namesake Dollar Tree store comps were higher by more than 11%. Gross margin jumped 3.6 percentage points to 33.9% on a more favorable product mix, and earnings of $2.37 per share came in at record levels and were up 48% year over year.
Dollar Tree completed its boost of its base price on goods from $1 to $1.25, which played a key role in supporting margins in an inflationary environment. The company is also proceeding with its $3 and $5 Plus assortments, hoping they will further enhance Dollar Tree's value proposition.
Investors got another upgrade in guidance, as Dollar Tree increased its earnings expectations by $0.20 per share to a new range of $7.80 to $8.20 per share. As consumers look for ways to make ends meet, Dollar Tree is in a strong position to benefit.

2022-05-26 00:00:00+00:00,"US STOCKS-Wall Street jumps on upbeat retail guidance, easing Fed fears",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-street-jumps-on-upbeat-retail-guidance-easing-fed-fears,,,"By Stephen Culp
May 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street surged on Thursday in a broad rally as a raft of solid retail earnings and soft economic data eased lingering concerns that the Federal Reserve's aggressive policy tightening would extend beyond expectations.
All three major U.S. stock indexes were sharply higher, with economically sensitive consumer discretionary .SPLRCD and microchip .SOXstocks beating the broader market.
On a weekly basis, the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow are on track to snap their longest losing streaks in decades, and at current levels are poised to notch their biggest weekly gains since mid-March.
""We're having a good rally,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. ""What happens today probably sets the stage for the indexes snapping a streak of weekly negativity.""
Upbeat guidance from retailers appeared to offset dour warnings from their peers in recent weeks.
Department store operator Macy's Inc M.N jumped 19.1% after raising its annual profit forecast.
Discount chains Dollar General Corp DG.N and Dollar Tree DLTR.O advanced by 14.4% and 20.4%, respectively, following their annual sales forecast hikes, suggesting consumers are shopping for less costly goods amid decades-high inflation.
The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) most recent monetary policy meeting calmed fears that the U.S. central bank could turn more hawkish, a concern which has fed into market volatility in recent weeks.
""The market agrees that we’re seeing an aggressive Fed, but not an ultra-aggressive Fed at this time,"" Cardillo said.
""Structural inflation has peaked, but transitory? Probably not,"" Cardillo added. ""That would be a key for the Fed, and that could happen.""
""The Fed turning dovish in the fall is a good possibility.""
Economic data released on Thursday, including jobless claims, pending home sales and GDP, brought good news wrapped in bad, suggesting the economy is showing just enough softness to prompt a dovish pivot from the Fed by autumn.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 572.54 points, or 1.78%, to 32,692.82; the S&P 500 .SPX gained 85.54 points, or 2.15%, to 4,064.27; and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 328.13 points, or 2.87%, to 11,762.87.
All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 were up, with consumer discretionary stocks leading in percentage gains, surging by 5.1%.

2022-05-26 00:00:00+00:00,Retail Roundup: Which Retailer is Ready for a Recession?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/retail-roundup%3A-which-retailer-is-ready-for-a-recession,,,"Today was an unusual day for earnings reports, as five different U.S retailers declared earnings. These retailers were all across the spectrum. Discount retailers like both Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) declared earnings, as did more mid-range retailers, The Buckle (BKE) and Burlington Stores (BURL). Lastly, higher-end retailer Macy's (M) also declared earnings.
While each retailer offered different results, the market reacted in much the same way: overwhelmingly positive. The last quarter proved a solid one for retailers of all stripes, but will this wave of positive feelings continue? That's looking a bit less likely.
Right now, I'm bearish to bullish, depending on each company's primary market base. I'm bullish on Dollar Tree and Dollar General, moderately so on The Buckle, and bearish on Burlington and Macy's. The higher up you go, the less likely you are to find success, especially with the macroeconomic picture being what it is.
The Retail Roundup: Retail by the Numbers
While almost every company turned in some positive numbers in the latest quarter, the extent to which they did varied wildly.
Dollar General turned in earnings of $2.41 per share, which beat the Zacks estimates calling for $2.32 per share. However, even Dollar General fell against the previous quarter, which came in at $2.82 per share.
Dollar General's revenue, meanwhile, came in at $8.75 billion. Zacks estimates looked for almost exactly that amount, as Dollar General came in just 0.5% higher than the estimates.
Dollar Tree posted even better results, as the company brought out $2.37 per share against Zacks estimates calling for $1.98. Dollar Tree managed to surpass its figures from this time last year, which came in at $1.60 per share.
Revenue was just as positive, as Dollar Tree posted $6.9 billion in revenue, 2.47% higher than the Zacks estimates. Comparable store sales actually doubled Street estimates on some reports.
The Buckle offered positive results as well, though perhaps not as positive as the dollar stores did. The Buckle came out with $1.12 per share in earnings. Revenue, meanwhile, was $309.1 million. That again beat the previous year's figure of $299.1 million. The Buckle also reported a small climb in comparable-store sales, up 3.7% from the same time last year.
Macy's posted much better results than expected. The company turned in $1.08 per share in adjusted earnings, while Refinitiv analysts looked for $0.82 per share. Revenue came in at $5.35 billion for the quarter, and Refinitiv projected $5.33 billion.
The lone exception to the mix was Burlington, which posted adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share. Zacks projections called for $0.64 per share. Revenue also proved a miss, as Burlington turned in $1.93 billion against Zacks projections calling for $2.01 billion.
By the Numbers, with a Few Small Variations
Taking a look at how the numbers shake out here suggests a clear path forward. The ""dollar"" retailers did perhaps the best overall, while The Buckle, the first major mid-range retailer, did well, if not spectacularly.
Macy's managed to do well, thanks in large part to its higher-end retailer target. The only real outlier that bucked the trend is Burlington, which Forbes describes as an ""off-price apparel and home product retailer.""
With inflationary conditions currently ruling the day, and a recession looking increasingly likely, the future for retail should likewise play out by the numbers.
The dollar retailers should continue to hold out well, as surging inflation drives shoppers to the lower-priced alternatives wherever possible. We already saw as much happen with Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT) when they declared earnings just a few weeks ago.
Macy's is proving to be a bit of an outlier here, but even this comes with a potential explanation. By targeting the higher-end consumer, Macy's can expect to continue to sell. Inflationary pressures are, initially, less felt by higher-end consumers; they simply have farther to fall than the lower-end consumer does.
A man with $500 in his pocket simply doesn't feel the impact of an extra $20 at the gas pump the way a man with $100 does. If it goes on long enough or gets deep enough, the wealthier man will feel the sting as well. By then, the less wealthy man will have adjusted his behaviors accordingly.
So Macy's is likely safe for now, and if the increasingly-likely recession isn't particularly deep or long-lived, then Macy's may never feel the hit. Even if it does, its aggregate higher-end shopper market may only result in slight losses overall.
Dollar Tree and Dollar General are likely to benefit from inflationary environments and recessions as customers seek better value. The Buckle is also likely to derive some value from that as well, though to a lesser extent.
Only Burlington, with its mix of products and its slightly-higher-than-middle target market, is likely to get the worst of inflation and a recession all at once. Its customers aren't so insulated from harder times, and lower-cost alternatives to its goods are likely more readily available.
Wall Street's Take
Turning to Wall Street, Dollar Tree has a Strong Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 12 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The average Dollar Tree price target of $171.78 implies 6.5% upside potential.
Analyst price targets range from a low of $147 per share to a high of $200.90 per share.
Dollar General, meanwhile, also has a Strong Buy consensus rating. That's based on 12 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The average Dollar General price target of $245.57 implies 10.4% upside potential.
Analyst price targets here range from a low of $178 per share to a high of $285 per share.
The Buckle has no analysts giving it coverage in the last three months. Therefore, no recent price target exists for this company.
Next, Burlington Stores has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 15 Buys, two Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The average Burlington Stores price target of $247.89 implies 46.1% upside potential.
Analyst price targets for Burlington range from a low of $175 per share to a high of $350 per share.
Finally, Macy's has a Hold consensus rating. That's based on one Buy, two Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The average Macy's price target of $29.33 implies 29.2% upside potential.
Analyst price targets for Macy's range from a low of $22 per share to a high of $36 per share.
Concluding Views
The retail market is a complex animal. Each store has its own target market. Some of these markets overlap. Elements within each market will seek out alternatives based on their individual circumstances. The end result is, roughly, like trying to pile sand. There are only so many rigid core concepts here to provide structure.
Yet knowing what we know so far, and performing a bit of generalization accordingly, produces noteworthy results. Dollar Tree and Dollar General are likely to do well in the environment we're facing now, so I stand bullish on them.
The Buckle, being mainly a clothing store, has certain minimums it can't break. However, it can do well within this market. Clothing being a necessity, it's likely to do reasonably well.
Macy's has a high-end consumer market, and its shoppers have further to fall to the point where they don't shop or seek out alternatives. That still leaves me bearish, but only cautiously so. It's not likely to bring in a lot of new shoppers from other spectra of earnings.
Burlington Stores is the most likely to fail in this environment. With shoppers that aren't quite in the high end but are also able to better find substitute goods, it has the worst aspects of Macy's. It also has higher minimum levels than The Buckle, which leaves it less able to adapt.
Just how the broader retail market will turn out is anyone's guess right now. It depends heavily on how the macroeconomic picture comes into play over the next several months. For right now, though, it's starting to look like the cheap stores will rule the day, followed closely by the stores that cater to those for whom cheap is a relative term.

NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - Earnings from retailers this week illustrated a split in shopping patterns of more- and less-affluent Americans dealing with the highest inflation in four decades.
As high inflation has lifted prices of everything from TVs to toothpaste, lower-income consumers have curbed their spending habits, according to stores that cater to them. Higher-income shoppers have shown resiliency, snapping up tailored suits, designer gowns and footwear, according to the department stores that cater to them.
On Thursday, Dollar General said shoppers were purchasing more food and beverage products instead of apparel, home and seasonal products. Rival Dollar Tree said shoppers were responding ""favorably"" to its new ""greater value"" products and its broader range of items priced at $3 to $5.
Stores under the Dollar Tree banner delivered their strongest quarter in company history. Same-store sales surged 11.2%.
At department store operator Macy's, which tends to draw middle- to higher-income consumers, shoppers spent money on non-essentials such as tailored suits, gowns and beauty products.
Sales at its upscale Bloomingdale’s department stores rose 28% in the first quarter, while they rose 25% at its luxury beauty outlet Blue Mercury. Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette said that at households earning more than $75,000 yearly, the customer was ""very healthy, and spend levels were quite strong.""
Although households earning less than $75,000 yearly were ""most affected"" by inflation, Gennette said, they spent more time shopping at Macy's discount outlets.
Macy's re-affirmed its full-year sales guidance and boosted its earnings forecast after several other retailers, including Walmart WMT.N, Target TGT.N and rival Kohl's KSS.N, had cut forecasts, citing inflation, inventory and supply chain issues.
Macy's rival Nordstrom JWN.N also bucked the trend of gloomy outlooks, issuing a robust increase to its forecast.
Michael Witynski, Dollar Tree's CEO, said he was ramping up investments in labor, distribution and its supply chain.
""We are taking the necessary actions now to position ourselves for accelerated growth in what I view as the most attractive sector in retail, especially in the current macro environment,"" he said on Thursday.
Bigger rival Walmart disclosed in its earnings last week that many shoppers were saving money by choosing more store-brand, ""private-label"" lunch meat, deli, bacon and dairy items. Many lower-income shoppers also shifted to buying milk in half-gallon rather than full-gallon containers, Walmart said.
But even at Walmart, some more-affluent shoppers bought higher priced items such as gaming consoles and patio furniture.

May 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed sharply higher on Thursday after optimistic retail earnings outlooks and waning concerns about overly aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve put investors in a buying mood.
All three major U.S. stock indexes posted solid gains, with economically sensitive consumer discretionary .SPLRCD and microchip .SOX stocks beating the broader market.
The tech-laden Nasdaq surged the most - its 2.7% advance was powered by gains in Apple Inc AAPL.O, Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.
On a weekly basis, the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow are on track to snap their longest losing streaks in decades, during which the benchmark S&P plummeted 14.1% and brought it within striking distance of being confirmed as a bear market.
At current levels, all three indexes are poised to notch their biggest weekly gains since mid-March.
""With first quarter earnings essentially over and coming in better than expected, combined with the Fed indicating that they are going to be front-end loading its rate-tightening policy and implying it may pause later in the fall, all of that has given investors reason to feel optimistic,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
Upbeat guidance from retailers appeared to offset dour warnings from their peers in recent weeks.
Department store operator Macy's Inc M.N jumped 19.3% after raising its annual profit forecast.
Discount chains Dollar General Corp DG.N and Dollar Tree DLTR.O advanced by 13.7% and 21.9%, respectively, following their annual sales forecast hikes, suggesting consumers are shopping for less costly goods amid decades-high inflation.
The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) most recent monetary policy meeting calmed fears that the U.S. central bank could turn more hawkish, a concern which has fed into market volatility in recent weeks.
""We have had 65% more daily price moves of 1% or more than the average since WW2,"" Stovall said.
""If the Fed is too aggressive, they'll choke off inflation but also choke off economic growth,"" he added. ""It's like in the winter you want to tap your brakes, not slam on them, to maintain control and avoid spinning out.""
Economic data released on Thursday, including jobless claims, pending home sales and GDP, brought good news wrapped in bad, suggesting the economy is showing just enough softness to prompt a dovish pivot from the Fed by autumn.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 516.91 points, or 1.61%, to 32,637.19; the S&P 500 .SPX gained 79.11 points, or 1.99%, to 4,057.84; and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 305.91 points, or 2.68%, to 11,740.65.
Of the 11 major indexes in the S&P 500, all but real estate .SPLRCR ended the session up. Consumer discretionary led the gainers, rising 4.8%, with tech .SPLRCT and financials .SPSY placing and showing at 2.5% and 2.3%, respectively.
Shares of Twitter Inc TWTR.K jumped 6.4% on news that the social media company is suing billionaire Elon Musk for delayed disclosure of his stake in the company.
U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba Group BABA.N rose 14.8% after the Chinese e-commerce company beat estimates, even as it declined to provide forward guidance in view of COVID-19 restrictions in China.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 5.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.95-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and 29 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 28 new highs and 116 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.43 billion shares, compared with the 13.22 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

The bulls generated back-to-back sessions of 80%-plus upside volume, showing that some form of demand has returned to the market. With that in mind, let’s look at a few top stock trades as we go into the last trading session ahead of a three-day weekend.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Snowflake (SNOW)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) had a nice pop on the day, rallying off its initial post-earnings selloff. However, the stock still finished lower by 4.5%.
Investors now have to keep a close eye on the $126 area. That was this month’s prior low until Thursday morning’s gap down. If $126 doesn’t hold, I believe the low near $113 remains vulnerable.
On the upside, however, the declining 10-day moving average has been resistance. If that changes, $150 and the 21-day moving average are in play. Above that puts $164 on the table.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Dollar Tree (DLTR)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
What a robust trade Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) was on Thursday, and it’s one we were looking at on the long side not long ago. What we didn’t expect was a power move back up to the gap-fill level at $155.
Up through that level now, as well as the 61.8% retracement, bulls are looking for a possible continuation to the upside. Remember, it wasn’t that long ago that Dollar Tree was a market leader before the recent retail-stock selloff.
From here, I would love to see this stock hold the $155 to $157 area as support. That keeps it above the 10-day, 21-day and 50-day moving averages, as well as the 61.8% retracement and the gap-fill mark.
On the upside, though, let’s see if it can hit the 78.6% retracement at $166. Above $170 and the $175 to $177 area is on the table.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Alibaba (BABA)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) had a bullish reaction to earnings, yet remains below many key levels.
Specifically, it’s still below the $100 mark, as well as the 50-day moving average. The latter has been active resistance, while the former has swayed between support and resistance over the last few months.
If it can push through this, Alibaba stock could be looking at 20% to 30% in upside — provided the stock can build on the momentum and continue to push higher. My point is, it’s been beaten down and can really squeeze higher if the buyers continue to pile in.
On the downside, however, I’d love to see the stock hold Thursday’s low at $86.73. If it can do that, it keeps Alibaba above the 10-day and 21-day moving averages.
Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Macy’s (M)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Macy’s (NYSE:M) also popped higher on earnings, with shares reclaiming the 10-day and 21-day moving averages, as well as the $22.50 level. This level had been support while $28 had been resistance for about five months.
If it can hold the bottom end of this range, Macy’s could be looking at a push up to $25. Above that puts $27.50 to $28 back in play.
On the downside, though, a break of $22.50 will have investors watching Thursday’s low at $21.12. A break of that mark could put the gap-fill in play down at $19.41.

Please limit your questions to one and one related follow up. And before I turn the call over to Rick, I want to make one quick clarification to our earnings release as I've received a few questions this morning. Our original fiscal 2022 EPS outlook of $7.60 to $8 per share did not include the $0.43 per share of cost outlined in today's earnings release. $0.13 of the $0.43 per share was incurred in Q1 and reduced our Q1 earnings.
Our updated outlook for EPS of $7.80 to $8.20 per share does include the $0.43 per share of cost. And I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Dreiling -- Executive Chairman
Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. It's been an extremely busy 10 weeks since joining the Dollar Tree team. I've been actively meeting with the leaders throughout the organization to get to know them and their businesses and to discuss priorities and opportunities. We see a massive opportunity ahead of us to drive long-term sustainable value creation through the combined Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands.
It's abundantly clear to us that to deliver this long-term opportunity, we're going to be going from a great company and that change is needed. We are fully committed to transform Dollar Tree from a good company today to a great company tomorrow. We have this unique opportunity to become a growth engine that delivers profitable growth with attractive returns on capital for many years to come. However, to get from here to there, we must build the foundation to fuel this engine.
We need to invest in the areas that most positively impact the associate and shopper experience. These investments are intended to greatly improve the performance of the Family Dollar segment and our supply chain as well as support the continued momentum at Dollar Tree. We'll be focusing on our people, most importantly, our teams from store and distribution center associates to field leadership through competitive wages, improved store and DC conditions and enhanced safety. The distribution center network and supply chain presents us with a golden opportunity to amplify efficiencies and deliver greater support to our stores and elevated service to our shoppers through improved in-stock positions.
Pricing at Family Dollar and the value proposition at both banners, we need to be right on price at Family Dollar, on par with our primary competitors, and we will work directly with our suppliers to drive greater store productivity. Dollar Tree has a long history of exceeding customer expectations by offering extreme value. We will continue to place a great emphasis on the value proposition at Dollar Tree. And finally, technology.
We are simply not where we need to be from a systems perspective to reach our potential. We have recently begun a comprehensive review of all of our systems and infrastructure to make the right decisions and investments to take Dollar Tree and Family Dollar to the next level. I felt great about the long-term opportunity for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar before I got here. Now that I've been inside the organization for two months, I feel better than ever.
I have full confidence in the team and our board of directors as we embark on this much needed transformational growth journey. The Dollar Tree banner is generating renewed momentum, and we will be taking the necessary steps to enable Family Dollar to seize the opportunity to deliver long-term operating performance improvements. We are in the midst of a very challenging time for consumers as many are living paycheck to paycheck. They are facing the highest inflation since the early 1980s, record high gas prices, the effects from the pandemic, geopolitical uncertainty and much more.
In tough times, value retail can be part of the solution to help families stretch their dollars to meet their evolving needs. Dollar Tree and Family Dollar provide convenience as our 16,000-plus stores are located close to millions of households to live and work. Mike and I view our organization as a growth company. Now is the ideal time to shift gears for us to make change happen to unlock shareholder value and enable the next wave of profitable growth for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Rick. And it's good to have you here with us, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The team delivered a solid start to the year with a six and a half percent top-line sales expansion, a 19.2% lift to gross profit and a 48.1% increase to earnings per share.
During the quarter, the Dollar Tree team successfully completed its conversion to the $1.25 price point, contributing to both sales and margin improvements. Shoppers are responding favorably as the new greater value products hit our shelves. Importantly, other key strategic initiatives, including the expansion of the $3 and $5 Plus assortment in our Dollar Tree stores, as well as our Combo Stores and H2 renovations at Family Dollar are all working. Rick outlined the types of additional strategic investments we will be making over the next several years that are designed to position the company for improved operating performance and long-term sustainable growth.
Before I discuss Q1 performance by segment, I want to share a few details regarding a very eventful quarter for the company. In mid-March, our board was reconstituted. We now have a new executive chair, a new vice chair and lead director, lead independent director and a total of seven new directors. We also have two new board committees, a finance committee and a sustainability and corporate social responsibility committee.
This week, we published our new 2022 CSR report. I am proud of the progress we are making as a company and the team's effort on sustainability. Please check out the new CSR report in the corporate governance portion of our website at DollarTreeinfo.com. Rick and I have been working very closely together.
We share a common vision for a long-term growth opportunity for the Dollar Tree organization. That value will be created by a combination of Dollar Tree's unique and resilient business model that is demonstrating its earnings power and momentum with its recent initiatives, along with a material improvement over time, and the operating performance of our Family Dollar banner. We are well underway with plans and priorities to address the performance at Family Dollar. I will share more detail later on this call.
Also, two weeks ago, we announced the addition of two key executives to our leadership team. John Flanigan joined the company as Chief Supply Chain Officer. John brings decades of leadership experience in retail logistics, including grocery, drugstore and the value sectors. John will be extremely focused on elevating our supply chain capabilities through improved distribution operations, hiring and retaining of teams, the efficiency improvements throughout supply chain designed to drive greater store productivity through improved in-stock position.
He plans to lead productivity improvements across the logistics function by the use of data analytics, process improvement and automation. Additionally, Larry Gatta has joined the team as chief merchandising officer for the Family Dollar segment. Larry brings more than 35 years of retail merchandising and marketing experience. He is well known and respected throughout the vendor community and will be leading plans to drive our business, and in turn, the business of our supply partners.
Larry will be focused on improving Family Dollar's operating performance and productivity through sales-driving initiatives that provide great value for our shoppers. In addition to the investments we are outlining today, components of our transformation were driven by a number of factors, including continuing to enhance our culture, elevated store standards, better use of private brands, improved category adjacencies, enhancing our product mix, optimizing our vendor partnerships and many, many more. To some degree today, and especially in the quarters ahead, you can expect to receive more details, improved transparency and greater management engagement in shareholder communications as we progress on our plans to improve the operating performance and reassess the long-term opportunities for the company. We are currently in the process of planning an investor day targeted for October time frame.
Now to Q1 performance. The Dollar Tree banner delivered its strongest quarter in company history. Among the highlights, an 11.2% comp, the best quarterly comp performance in more than 20 years, which is including our largest sales day ever, which was the Saturday before Easter. A 40.6% gross profit margin, nearly 700 basis points above the prior-year's quarter and a company record 20.2% operating margin, more than 800 basis points over Q1 of last year.
Margins in Q1 did receive an outsized temporary benefit from the initial transition to the new price point as well as selling through the current inventories. We are modeling a moderation of the margin level as we focus on providing our shoppers with new assortments at greater value for the $1.25 price point. The 11.2% comp sales increase was driven by a 15.4% increase in average ticket partially offset by a traffic decline of 3.6%. For the quarter, the discretionary side of the business delivered a strong 14.1% comp increase, while consumables increased 8%.
April, which benefited from the later Easter holiday this year, was the strongest month in terms of both sales and traffic. Importantly, we successfully completed the conversion to a primary price point of $1.25 across the chain. Credit to our teams. This project was announced in September of 2021 and was completed by the end of February with minimal disruption.
By the end of Q1, our customers have already seen more than 960 of our projected 2,000 new greater value product SKUs on the shelves. Our shoppers are responding to the new items. We are seeing much improved results in the categories since rolling out the enhanced offering. Examples of the consumables category comp improvements where we've put in these new items.
Carbonated beverage, from a 3% decline to a 12% increase now. In snacks and cookies, before the new SKUs, we had a decline of 8%, now a 12% increase in comp. And in our food category, from a 10% decline before to now experiencing a 2% increase. The majority of the changes at this early stage are now traffic-driving consumable side of the business.
The discretionary changes will occur throughout the back half of the year. The $1.25 assortment changes are notable and easy to see when you visit Dollar Tree stores. In today's environment, where consumers are seeing higher prices everywhere, shoppers know they can rely on Dollar Tree as their destination for extreme value and evolving meaningful assortment and a thrill of the hunt. The Family Dollar banner had a big hurdle to climb in Q1.
In 2020, Family Dollar had a 15.5% quarterly comp increase at the onset of COVID. And in last year's quarter, there was a record release of stimulus dollars that positively impacted both top-line sales and margin with the lift in discretionary sales. For Q1, Family Dollar's comps declined 2.8%, which represents a nearly 10% comp since 2019. The 2.8% comp sales decrease was comprised of 3.7% decline in traffic partially offset by a 1% increase in average ticket.
For the quarter, the consumable side of the business delivered a 1.2% comp increase, while discretionary comps were down 14.7% as we cycled the massive release of stimulus dollars last year. February represented the best comp month for the quarter, and April was slightly better than the quarter's comp. Importantly, Family Dollar's comp sales for the quarter were negatively impacted by an estimated 200 basis points by the temporary closures of approximately 400 Family Dollar stores served by our Arkansas distribution center. All of these stores have now reopened.
Last week, we announced that we will be closing the 30-year-old West Memphis, Arkansas distribution center that we have deemed is no longer part of our go-forward strategy. We are working closely with the impacted associates to support them with their transitions by providing severance plans to those eligible, helping associates with opportunities in our other distribution centers and in our stores as well as providing outplacement services and employee assistant programs. We are reallocating stores to other DCs to fulfill the store deliveries and have sufficient capacity to serve all stores in our remaining fleet of distribution centers. We appreciate the hard work and support of West Memphis associates committed during the transition process.
I will now hand the call over to Kevin to provide more color on Q1 and our updated outlook.
Kevin Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mike, and good morning. For the quarter, consolidated net sales increased 6.5% to $6.9 billion comprised of $3.78 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.12 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 4.4% despite cycling the large outflow of stimulus from the prior-year's quarter. This represented a 190-basis-point sequential improvement from Q4.
Costs for the Dollar Tree segment increased 11.2%. Family Dollar same-store sales decreased 2.8%. And on a 3-year stack basis, Dollar Tree is at a 15% comp, and Family Dollar is at a 9.9% comp. Gross profit improved 19.2% to $2.34 billion for the quarter.
Gross margin was 33.9% compared to 30.3% in the prior-year's quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment increased 690 basis points to 40.6% compared to 33.7% for the same period last year as a result of the net of the following. Merchandise costs, including freight, decreased 590 basis points, primarily due to increased initial mark-on and increased sales of higher-margin discretionary merchandise, partially offset by higher freight costs. Occupancy costs decreased 80 basis points from leverage on the comp sales increase.
Distribution costs decreased 50 basis points from leverage and higher capitalized balances resulting from inventory increases in the current quarter partially offset by higher hourly wages. And markdown costs increased 30 basis points primarily from markdowns for clearance items as we move to a higher value assortment at the $1.25 price point. Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment decreased 100 basis points to 25.8% compared to 26.8% for the same period last year. Markdown costs increased 75 basis points due to higher clearance activity related to the shipping delays for seasonal items and slow-moving merchandise.
Occupancy costs increased 45 basis points from deleverage from the comparable store sales decrease and higher real estate taxes. Shrink increased 25 basis points for more favorable inventory results in relation to accruals in the prior-year's quarter. These increases were partially offset by distribution costs that decreased 15 basis points, primarily from higher capitalized balances from inventory increases, partially offset by our higher hourly wages. And merchandise costs, including freight, decreased 35 basis points primarily due to higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher freight costs and higher sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise.
Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased 100 basis points to 23.3% compared to 22.3% in Q1 last year. For the first quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment improved 120 basis points to 20.4% when compared to the prior-year's quarter. Payroll costs improved 100 basis points from leverage on the 11.2% comp partially offset by hourly wages and investments in store payroll. Facility costs improved 25 basis points from leverage.
Depreciation costs decreased approximately 10 basis points, partially offset by other SG&A, which increased approximately 15 basis points resulting from higher store supply costs. For the Family Dollar segment, the first quarter SG&A rate as a percentage of total revenue increased 280 basis points to 23% compared to 20.2% in the prior-year's quarter. Payroll expenses increased 90 basis points primarily due to hourly wage and investment in store payroll as well as deleverage on the comp sales decline. Other SG&A expenses increased 85 basis points due to asset impairment for the West Memphis DC, along with higher store supply expenses for store projects and higher legal fees.
Store facility costs increased 65 basis points primarily from costs associated with removal of product from stores in connection with the voluntary product recall as well as deleverage on the comp decline. And depreciation and amortization increased 40 basis points due to increased depreciation related to capital expenditures for store renovations and improvements. Corporate, support and Other expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 1.8% compared to the prior-year quarter of 1.4%. The higher costs related to increased legal fees, including the reconstitution of our board, and incentive compensation.
Operating income improved 40.7% to $731.5 million or 10.6% of total revenue in the first quarter. Nonoperating expenses totaled $34 million comprised of net interest expense, and the effective tax rate was 23.1% for both the current and prior-year's quarter. Net income for the quarter improved 43.2% to $536.4 million or $2.30 per diluted share, which includes $0.13 per share for costs related to the West Memphis DC. This compared to net earnings of $374.5 million or $1.60 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter.
Looking at the balance sheet. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.22 billion compared to $985 million at the end of fiscal 2021. Outstanding debt as of April 30 were $3.45 billion. The company repurchased approximately 90,000 shares in Q1 for approximately $14.2 million under the share repurchase authorization.
Compared to last year, inventory levels at Dollar Tree are up 39% due to increased capitalized freight costs plus Dollar Tree Plus inventory and a catch-up in past due inventories. Inventory levels at Family Dollar increased 27% compared to last year due to increased capitalized freight and an increase in the average unit cost. Both banners have less average inventory units in store than at the same period in 2019 pre-pandemic. Capital expenditures were $253.4 million in the first quarter versus $224.9 million in Q1 of last year.
And for fiscal 2022, we currently expect that consolidated capital expenditures will be approximately $1.4 billion, slightly higher than our initial outlook for the year based on additional supply chain projects and construction cost pressures. Depreciation and amortization totaled $188.9 million for Q1 compared to $172.7 million in the first quarter of the last year. And for fiscal 2022, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $770 million. In March, our initial outlook for fiscal 2022, diluted EPS was a range of $7.60 to $8.
We expect to incur costs totaling an estimated $0.43 per share, which were not included in our original outlook. These costs represent: in Q1, $0.13 per share for asset impairment and the product recall costs related to our West Memphis DC; for Q2, an estimated $0.22 per share for lost sales, freight, merchandise disposal, payroll and legal costs associated with the West Memphis matter; and for full year fiscal 2022, a total of $0.08 per share for stock compensation expense related to an option grant issued to our new executive chairman. Diluted earnings per share for the full year is now expected to range from $7.80 to $8.20, which includes the $0.43 of costs I've just outlined. Consolidated net sales for the year are now expected to range from $27.76 billion to $28.14 billion compared to our previous range of $27.22 billion to $27.85 billion.
We expect to deliver a mid-single-digit comparable store sales increase for the year comprised of a high single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and a more or less flat comparable store sales in the Family Dollar segment. Selling square footage is expected to grow by approximately 3.9%. For Q2, we estimate consolidated net sales to range from $6.65 billion to $6.78 billion based on a low to mid-single-digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter is expected to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share, and this estimate includes approximately $0.24 per share for costs for the West Memphis matter and stock compensation expense.
Considerations for our updated 2022 outlook include the following. We anticipate that we will continue to experience uncertainty related to inflation, the global supply chain and geopolitical factors. For example, we have seen diesel costs continue to rise, and natural gas price increases are affecting utility costs throughout the business. We are once again experiencing shortages in the availability of helium and have not been able to procure the volume of our needs, which will negatively affect balloon sales.
Our outlook includes our best current estimates of pressures from these factors. We cycled the third round of stimulus checks that totaled an estimated $386 billion in March of 2021. In Q2, we will begin cycling the monthly advance Child Tax Credit payments that began in mid-July of 2021. We noted that our original outlook in March that we expected to invest $195 million in store and DC associate wages in 2022.
As an update, given the competitive retail environment, we expect that we will likely exceed this amount as we invest in our associates. Import domestic freight will present cost pressures due to annualization of fiscal '21 rates in the first half of 2022. As noted in March, we plan for diesel fuel prices to be higher this year. We have increased the forecasted amount for the remainder of the year based on the current market.
Additional color for the year regarding our expectations include, for the enterprise, we are forecasting improved operating margin for the business driven by gross margin improvements, partially offset by higher SG&A costs as a percentage of total revenue. The Dollar Tree segment gross margin in Q1 included an outsized benefit from the transition to the new $1.25 price point. We expect to see a gross margin moderation from the Q1 level as new greater value assortments are incorporated into the business. The Dollar Tree segment is expected to deliver improved operating margin for the year with gross margin benefiting from its strategic initiatives as well as leverage on SG&A.
The Family Dollar segment gross and operating margins are expected to be lower year over year, impacted by the following: higher costs, including freight and needed investments in the business such as labor and improved store conditions; the impact to product mix as a result of stimulus dollars driving discretionary sales in the prior year; and the impact on sales and expenses related to the West Memphis DC matter. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $3 billion in Q2 and $123 million for the year. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 24.2% for the second quarter and 24% for fiscal 2022. Weighted average diluted share count are assumed to be 226.4 million shares for Q2 and 226.5 million shares for the full year.
Our outlook does not include any share repurchase. And as of April 30, we had $2.5 billion remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Kevin. As Rick mentioned in the opening, we are committed to transform Dollar Tree from a good company to a great company. Our initiatives are working and providing increased profits and cash flow. Rick and I both believe now is the ideal time to accelerate investments focused on driving growth through improved associate and shopper experience while propelling greater efficiencies.
These strategic initiatives will be designed to position Dollar Tree for long-term sustainable growth. And we are going to invest and incur costs associated with making this journey. It's the right thing to do, and this is the ideal time to invest in our future. Again, to reiterate, we will be investing in our associates and our stores, the DC network and supply chain, Family Dollar pricing and the value proposition and our technology.
Both Rick and I are committed, aligned and extremely focused. The ability to execute our key strategic initiatives is paying off and setting a solid foundation for improved operating performance and accelerated growth. We believe an -- we delivered an EPS of $5.80 in fiscal 2021. And the midpoint of our guidance range this year is $8, representing a 38% increase.
I believe we are at an inflection point to exhibit our earnings power into the years ahead. We are committed to meeting our customers' needs while investing in initiatives that are delivering the best returns. These initiatives, combined with our robust balance sheet, will position us to deliver long-term growth for our stakeholders, associates, customers, suppliers and our shareholders. We all know it is incredibly challenging and uncertain time for the businesses today.
We believe our company offers the following as we manage through these times: stable and resilient business model that has worked at good times and in bad; a 16,000 store footprint that is convenient for shoppers buying their needs; a tremendous value assortment that helps shoppers stretch their budgets; a strong balance sheet that enables us to invest in our business while enhancing our ability to manage and maneuver through the current environment effectively; a road map to deliver shareholder value through improved performance at Family Dollar and improved supply chain and a continued momentum at Dollar Tree. We have a fantastic growth story of opening 590 new stores this year alone, driving top-line sales growth through key initiatives and, again, an expected 38% year-over-year earnings growth at the midpoint of our range. Operator, Kevin and I are now ready to take questions.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Yes, sir. Thank you. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan.
Matt Boss -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Great. Thanks, and congrats on a nice quarter, and welcome back, Rick.
Rick Dreiling -- Executive Chairman
Thanks, Matt.
Matt Boss -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
So maybe just a high-level one for you, Rick. I know you've only been back for a few months. But you described the Dollar Tree organization as a growth organization. So maybe just -- is there a way to speak to any potential timing of initiatives across the banners, how you're thinking about the team that you're assembling around you or just even at a high level, the degree of low-hanging fruit that you see across the concepts to drive what it sounds like your goal is sustainable, profitable growth?
Rick Dreiling -- Executive Chairman
Yeah, Matt. I'll throw a little color out here and then turn it over to Mike. We are really taking a good hard look at the entire organization. We're looking at both banners.
And the goal here is sustainable long-term growth. And we've got a very good team here, a lot of really solid people, and we're going to supplement them with incremental people that, quite frankly, I've been involved with in my career. But the -- as I reflect on this, you have two great banners. Dollar Tree is incredibly exciting and fascinating to me.
It's the true treasure hunt. The work that's been done on expanding multiple price points, I think, has been great. And now what we have to do is focus on the fundamentals of consumable retailing in Family Dollar. And Mike, what would you like to add to that?
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Matt. I just -- on the timing of our initiatives, you can -- the way we're thinking about it, the short to midterm will be definitely investing in our associates in our stores. And we'll be working on that throughout the quarters. And that's embedded in the guidance that we gave as well as in our pricing.
One of our key initiatives is to get sharper on our pricing and close that gap to our key competitors at Family Dollar. And Larry is working on that right now, and we'll be laying that plan in over the next several quarters. The longer-term things that Rick -- for our long-term growth is really leveraging and driving efficiencies in our supply chain. And John Flanigan actually is out in one of our DCs today, assessing those things.
And then our IT, and we're looking at all of our systems, especially our supply chain, merchandising and storefront systems. So those are bigger capital items, but they're going to take time as we assess them. And I think over the next two to three years, you'll see those improvements come into the business.
Matt Boss -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
That's great color. And then, Mike, just at the Dollar Tree banner, could you help break down upside in the quarter on the comp side maybe relative to plan that drove that first quarter performance at Dollar Tree? And just speak to customer reception that you're seeing to the new product assortment or the product changes as now you're bringing in the product that was bought for the higher price point, just as it's been introduced, what you're seeing from the customer front.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. That's the exciting part of it. Dollar Tree has got such a great reputation for delivering extreme value, and customers have responded well. Our -- throughout the quarter, units were better.
Unit decline was better than what we had planned and expected. Unit decline is around the 10-ish mark. Our -- and we shared our transactions are down a little bit more than 4%. Our average ticket is up 15%.
So those all feel good for us. And going through the quarter, we're delivering almost half of the new items, and customers are responding very, very favorably. And we did -- so the metrics, they're telling us the customers responded. In those categories that we shared, we're seeing -- the last 18 months prior to this change, we were seeing declines in the consumables side and declines in our traffic because of that.
But now we reversed in our salty snacks, in our cookies and in our food. And also externally, we've done some more extensive research of a second round in the quarter. And customers are highly likely to continue shopping at Dollar Tree after the price change. 85% expressed strong likelihood to shop, 77% are recommending our stores.
So our customers still appreciate that great find, the extreme value and the meaningful assortment for them. So we feel good about where we're at right now and as we're moving forward. We've only got one quarter under our belt and looking downstream, we're excited about the new assortment coming in. And this is going to take a while for us to really reset our assortment and our level of margin as we cycle through the new items coming in then, of course, add it to our import items.
That will really take throughout the next year as we're incorporating those into our import buys.
Matt Boss -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Congrats, again. Best of luck.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.
Operator
[Operator instructions] We'll next go to Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities.
Scot Ciccarelli -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Good morning, guys. Welcome back, Rick. So retail transformations almost always take longer and cost more than us on the outside tend to anticipate. Can you guys provide any color regarding the magnitude of incremental investments that may be required to get Dollar Tree and Family Dollar kind of where you want them from an operational and technological standpoint?
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, on the Dollar Tree side, as I've said, we've got a lot of momentum because we've been working on this for quite a while. In fact, in the last two years, what I'm excited about is during the two and a half years of COVID and supply chain disruption, we've come out of this and with two formats that we didn't have in 2019. We've got a great Combo Store and we broke the $1 to $1.25, and we were enhancing that with $3 and $5 assortments. So we've got some momentum, and our strategies are working.
And our cash flow is strong. We've got a great balance sheet. We've got a new reconstituted board and with Rick on board and including the new talent that we talked about. So we're in a place where we're coming out of, I believe, the era of COVID with great momentum in our strategies, a great balance sheet, a new board.
And we're going to accelerate our growth. So we're not starting today. We're really going to accelerate this going forward. So I think on -- as the investments, we will get more detail as we continue to work through this.
And that's where we said we're going to have our first analyst day in October that we'll be really getting into the more of the nuts and bolts of when to expect as we look at this over the next quarters and years on how we lay that in and the benefit according to -- that goes along with those investments.
Scot Ciccarelli -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
All right. So there's no way to necessarily bracket or give a general view in terms of how much incremental investment or operating costs might be required?
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
No, not right now. We've got everything embedded in our outlook for this year. And then we're working really hard. Both Larry and John are looking at those items as we think about how do the beyond years look, and we'll be sharing that in the future.
Scot Ciccarelli -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Got it. Thanks a lot guys.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.
Operator
Next, we'll go to Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.
Rupesh Parikh -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So first, just on Dollar Tree gross margins. I know you indicated that sequentially, you expect them to moderate versus what you saw in Q1.
Is there a ballpark level you can help us frame that for maybe Q2 and the balance of the year? And then just any thinking longer term in terms of where their gross margins are for the banner? At 35% to 36% or do you think you could do better than that?
Kevin Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Rupesh, this is Kevin. As we think through this, and obviously, to Mike's point, we're one quarter in, we're still learning a lot as we work through this. There'll be -- so moving pieces as always. The marketplace continues to move as to what investment into the product is going to be necessary to be a value in the marketplace.
I would tell you this year, I think at a minimum, we would hope to be to the higher end of that historical range. And if we can be above it, we'll be above it. I don't know that we -- where that will exactly land. Again, the environment is such that there's enough uncertainty that it's pretty hard to peg given the fact that the newness of the $1.25 price point and some of the things that are going on, on a macro level out there.
But it will be a positive in a big way for the overall company.
Rupesh Parikh -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst
OK. Great. And then maybe just my follow-up question. Just on the Family Dollar banner, just given the initiatives that you guys plan to make and some of the capital investments over the coming years, do you guys think you can close the gap with your -- I guess, your closest competitor on the operating margin line? Could you get to a high single-digit operating margin within the Family Dollar banner longer term?
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Absolutely.
Rupesh Parikh -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst
OK, great. Thank you.
Operator
Next question will come from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.
Karen Short -- Barclays -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to try this, just a slightly different angle. So there's obviously been expectations in terms of what your new operating profit margin could look like with all the opportunities that you have at both banners.
But as I look at today's press release, everything focuses on investing. So I mean, I wanted to see if you could just triangulate that a little bit. And I mean, I see you'll talk about this at the analyst day, but every single header that you had in terms of strategies is investing as opposed to operating margin opportunity. And investors clearly have a high -- very high number in terms of what the actual margin opportunity could look like.
So any color on that would be helpful.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll throw it to Kevin for a little bit of color. But the way I think about it, yes, we are investing. But also, we're delivering earnings EPS growth throughout the time and top-line growth.
So as Rick and I said, the things that we are investing, they will have a return for long-term sustainable growth. And if you look at our EPS from the midpoint range up, it's a 40% -- just under a 40% increase in EPS, and we moved our top-line up. So yes, we'll be investing in the future, but we're going to be investing with the thought of continuing to drive that top line and the bottom line at the same time.
Kevin Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
The other thing I would say, Karen, as Mike mentioned in his early comments, we do have a new Finance Committee. This committee obviously will be very focused on return on invested capital as we think about things. There are some things we have to do because we need to do it, which is -- you can look at our store standards. We want to make sure we have stores that are -- keep the standards that we expect and our customers deserve.
So those are investments you make. But if you look, a lot of this is capital investment in systems and in our supply chain that, again, it's about productivity and efficiency and making it easier at the store level for that store manager and the assistant manager and that team there that's working very hard every day. So our job at the end is to make their job easier. And that's where these investments will -- may have a big payoff at the end of the day.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. And I would just close with our balance sheet and cash flow enables us to do this. We can invest to keep growing our store count to be a growth company. We can invest in the key enablers and supply chain and IT.
And we can buy back shares to grow our share. So we've got options going forward. It's not just simply investing in expenses.
Karen Short -- Barclays -- Analyst
Great. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Next, we'll go to Michael Lasser with UBS.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So some of the skeptics are arguing that Dollar Tree is going to get a bunch of growth this year from raising its prices by 25% on the bulk of its assortment and seeing some timing benefits from selling through some older cost inventory, and now it's talking about investments. So do you think in light of all that, that the core banner or the enterprise, I should say, can grow both sales and margins next year while you're making these investments?
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, we do.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
And my follow-up question is -- yeah, that's helpful, Mike. My follow-up question is, as you focus your price investments, how do you ensure that you're not going to spark a race to the bottom in light of the very competitive environment that you operate in with some really large competitors?
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, that's important. We've got to be meaningful to our customers first and foremost, and that's what we're going to focus on. And on the other side, we've got Larry here who works very closely with the vendor manufacturers, and we will balance it, right? We'll make good decisions to invest where we need to, to meet the customers' needs in the marketplace. We're just going to simply close the gap to where we are on our KVIs, our key value items, and then just make sure the entire shopping experience is at a great value for our customer.
And it's a balance.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator
Next, we'll go to Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.
Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett Research Advisors -- Analyst
Hey. Good morning, everybody. Rick, it's really great to hear your voice after all these years. My question is on the traffic decline at Dollar Tree.
You talked -- I think you said it was down about 4%. I was just curious how that trended during the quarter, particularly in light of you're introducing more of the new products into the mix. And a follow-up to that would be I think you said 960 SKUs with the plan for 2,000. I think the average Tree store has about eight.
So I'm just curious like how many SKUs you want to change? And how do we think about that rollout over the balance of the year?
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, the 2,000 were the amount that we needed to change. Remember, at lastearnings call our merchants since last September went item by item and put our item on the table and went out and shopped the entire competitive market to make sure that it's -- at $1.25, it is still a great value. And our customers are telling us that in the results. So the 2,000 items are the ones that we thought we needed to invest more in and turn over and/or bring new that we had to discontinue over the last 18 months or just weren't a value anymore.
So the 2,000 is what our goal was, and we're halfway through, 47%. The other half are going to flow through. And as they flow through, we're getting great results. But also remember, not -- and Kevin talked about it, it's a dynamic situation in market right now.
So what we thought six months ago has changed already just because of the cost pressures we're seeing. So our Dollar Tree merchants know that at a fixed price point, they don't have to carry every item, and they drop the item and go get a replacement item and at the margin that we need. And our mix of items always changes out. That's the exciting thing about Dollar Tree.
It's an extreme value and ever-exchanging meaningful assortment. And it's -- and the customers respond, and it's the thrill of the hunt. That's part of our mission at Dollar Tree. They're used to it.
They've always done it at $1. Now they're just doing it at $1.25, and it's working very well.
Kevin Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
And Chuck, on your question about traffic. This quarter, in particular, is very affected by Easter. Easter was two weeks later. So you would have seen the best traffic in the third period and probably the biggest decrease in traffic more than likely in the second period because of the later Easter as well as when the stimulus dollars were released.
So I think those are probably kind of the two factors. It's pretty lumpy because of those two, but that's kind of the factors that are in play in Q1.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
One of the things that we're really seeing excitement around are our seasons are accelerating more than they used to at $1.25 and the meaningful assortment and then with our rollout of our $3 and $5 items that we're rolling out to another 1,500 stores this year. So the combination of the $1.25, $3 and $5 in our seasonal business has really given us a lift that we're excited about. And in quarter 2, if you think there's -- in quarter 1, Kevin talked about the great Easter and Valentine's, and we saw great response from the customers. Quarter 2 is summer, and you got Memorial Day and the Fourth of July.
But the back half of the year is when back-to-school, Halloween and then Thanksgiving and Christmas that we're really setting ourselves up to have a great back half.
Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett Research Advisors -- Analyst
That's great. And just my follow-up would be historically speaking, you look back at other periods of consumer duress, and maybe Rick can opine on this question to a degree. I'm curious how long of a lag it was before you saw that middle-income customer begin to trade down and if you think this current macro environment is going to be different than what we saw over a decade ago.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. They're just -- it's a different pressure this year. But you're right, in 2008, '09 and '10, both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree saw an acceleration in their comp store sales. And there was just a slight drag, but they saw it a little bit in 2008 when it was happening and then '09, '10 and '11, it was sustained.
It's hard to predict what's going to happen now just because it's -- there being pressure for different reasons.
Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett Research Advisors -- Analyst
OK. Great. Thanks very much and good luck.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.

[Operator instructions] We'll next go to Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.
Edward Kelly -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Hi, everyone. Good morning. Rick, great to hear your voice. First thing I wanted to ask is just about the $1.25 and the elasticity improving where you're adding value.
Just more -- a little bit more detail on the number of categories you've done in terms of adding value back and what's left to do. And then how much bigger is the opportunity within discretionary in terms of like adding value or bringing items back? I mean it does seem like that would be the area where there's potentially a more powerful impact.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, actually -- well, thanks for the question. Our discretionary, the value in our discretionary, our customer recognizes, and there wasn't a lot of rework that needed to happen there. And that's evident. That's why our discretionary business comped at 14%, and we really haven't touched it that much.
Where we're focusing the 2,000 items are really concentrated mostly in consumable categories. So in the salty snack, in the carbonated beverage and in the food, that's where these categories we have 47% of the SKUs in. But really, we're going to add more in food. We're going to add more in carbonated beverage and more in salty snack to really drive that consumable.
And it will take time. I -- we believe that's a traffic driver. And as the customers experience the items and appreciate the value we're giving them, over time, we believe that, that will help drive traffic into the overall store, not just those categories.
Edward Kelly -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
OK. And then just a quick follow-up on $3 and $5, can you go faster? Why not go faster? The response seems to be good. Just updated thoughts there.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, it's a great question. We would go as fast as we can. We are going as fast as we can. If you remember last year -- it's really supply chain right now that's tempering our speed.
Last year, we wanted to open up 500. And if you remember, the customers responding so well that we were selling through and the supply chain was slowing things down. So we slowed down our acceleration of rolling it out throughout the year, but we still ended up at 600 stores. So we're going to do -- we accelerate it to 1,500, and it's really depending on the supply chain because we're buying these products nine to 12 months out.
And it's -- we're excited about rolling this out. We're -- our expectations are to get this done as soon in the year as possible, and we're going to continue to roll that out. But we have every expectation to roll this $3 and $5 out throughout the entire network. And that's probably something that we can share at our October analyst day is what that -- what's that looking like.
Because we really like it. We're putting this product in our stores. We're really seeing a benefit on the seasonal side of it. So our $3 and $5 items, combined with our great value at $1.25, is just lifting that entire seasonal sales in those respective stores.
So we're going to keep enhancing the product. We're learning a lot, and it's going to be absolutely dedicated on the discretionary side of the store.
Edward Kelly -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Great. Thank you.
Operator
We'll go next to Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.
Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Hi. Good mornin. Thanks for putting us in. Just wanted to just ask first about freight costs.
There was a comment about maybe annualizing the increases from last year, and I think that's consistent with last quarter. So just curious if you can help us understand just how you view the state of the global shipping backdrop from your seat, what you're expecting from contract versus spot this year and just the overall cost for that.
Kevin Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Kelly, this is Kevin. I'll start with some information on that. And really, in Q1, our freight was up, but it was very consistent with how we had forecasted it.
And again, as we had talked about in March, we expected the first half of the year in particular to be affected by the annualization of the rates we saw in the last half of '21. So that feels like a good place to start. Obviously, diesel fuel has increased, and we've increased our forecast for the current market rates. And here is something to maybe give all of you kind of a metric to kind of think about diesel freight.
So just a $1 change in rate for the year would be about a $63 million headwind. So that's the annualized number. And so you guys can do the math on what that means on a prorated basis. But that kind of gives you a feel for that.
But we have the current market rates as we see it in our forecast and embedded in our guidance. In regards to ocean freight, the backlog is definitely significantly less than a year ago. It's not completely gone, but it's definitely better than it was. It's early.
The contract carrier performance has been pretty much on plan at this point. We are still using chartered vessels, which has been successful and been helpful and continuing to move good. And the NVO rates have pretty much been in line with the way we have budgeted them at this point in time. So from our point of view, the way we came into the year looking at it, we're comfortable with where we're at.
Obviously, it's -- the market can change rapidly, but we feel good about where we're at, at the moment.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. I would just add that from -- add on to what Kevin said, we've been battling this ocean freight for two and a half years, and we felt it probably before anybody else did just because of our fixed price and the amount of containers we import. So this year, we've contracted slightly more than our needs. And it's because we're anticipating a continuation of some blank voyages that will continue to disrupt the supply chain.
And as Kevin said, to fill our needs, we're using a combination of contracts, the NVO and our own dedicated charters. So -- and we've smoothed out our -- the purchasing of what we need. We've smoothed that out to be more consistent and dependable for the carrier. So we've gone into this year with two and a half years of disruption experience.
And as Kevin said, we're -- we think we have a good handle on the cost of it without unknowing any disruption that could happen going forward.
Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Thank you. That's very, very helpful. And then maybe I'll just ask one more about Dollar Tree. As you merchandise against this new $1.25 price point, are you targeting that 36% gross margin today? Or do you maybe leave a little cushion for some higher costs in the future? And as well, do you consider testing even more price points, $1.50 or $2, just given how this is already going.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, we have $1.25 fixed price point that we moved after 35 years, and then we've got the $3 and $5 price points that are fixed price points that we are rolling out as fast as we can over the next couple of years. So we feel really good that we can deliver an unbelievable assortment that is exciting and meaningful and an extreme value for our customers and still delivers on that thrill of the hunt. So we're excited about that. And we -- as you think about our comments about continuing to drive top line and bottom-line performance, we will always keep in mind the margins needed to deliver those two things.
Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Thank you.

Dollar General (NYSE: DG), a nationwide chain of discount stores, has seen its shares climb 22.3% so far this week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The stock closed at $187.60 last Friday, but by Wednesday had risen to $229.45.

So what
The company released its first-quarter results before the markets opened on Thursday, and two things jumped out that excited investors. First-quarter revenue was a reported $8.8 billion, up 4% year over year, and the company issued bullish guidance for the rest of the year.
Dollar General said that despite inflationary pressures and some supply issues, it was upgrading its guidance for revenue growth between 10% and 10.5% for the year and earnings-per-share (EPS) growth of 12% to 14%. It also said it expected to spend $2.75 billion on share repurchases. In the company's first-quarter earnings call, chief financial officer John Garratt said the company expects comparable-store sales and EPS growth to be better in the second half of the year as the first-half comparisons will be adversely affected by sales last year that were boosted by stimulus money.
The guidance was a mild surprise because not everything was rosy in the first-quarter report. The company said that same-store sales were down 0.1% over the same period last year and net income and EPS were down year over year. Net income was listed at $552.7 million, down 18.5% from a year ago, and EPS was $2.41, down 14.5%. Still, even the bad numbers were better than analysts predicted.
Dollar General and other discount stores in the retail sector have done well during downturns. With the markets falling and inflation rising, people -- particularly those with lower incomes -- often look for ways to cut expenses, and that fits into Dollar General's business model.
That point was driven home when competitor Dollar Tree released its earnings on Thursday and had even better numbers. Dollar Tree said it saw sales grow 6.5% year over year to $6.9 billion and EPS of $2.37, up 48%.
Now what
The key for Dollar General will be if it is able to pass along inflationary effects by raising prices. Traditionally, many items have been $1 in the store, but that has changed, and if that doesn't turn customers away, the company can boost profit margins. Investors will want to see another strong quarter as the last quarter was really the first to show the effects of inflation.

BEIJING/TOKYO, May 27 (Reuters) - Asian shares extended overnight global gains thanks to strong results from regional tech firms and U.S. retailers, while investors also took comfort from Federal Reserve minutes showing a pause to its rate hikes is on the cards later this year.
The swing in sentiment left the dollar wallowing at one-month lows, with the euro rising to its highest since April 25.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 1.5% in early trading, the biggest gain in a week, buoyed by a 1.2% rebound in resources-heavy Australian shares, a 2.8% jump in Hong Kong stocks .HSI and a 0.7% rise for blue chips in mainland China .CSI300.
Japan's Nikkei .N225 advanced 1.0%.
The Hang Seng tech index .HSTECH opened 4.5% higher, as first quarter revenues from tech giant Alibaba 9988.HK and Baidu 9888.HK beat forecasts.
The United States will not block China from growing its economy, but wants it to adhere to international rules, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday in remarks that didn't come as a surprise to investors and political analysts.
Wall Street closed sharply higher overnight after optimistic retail earnings outlooks and waning concerns about overly aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed encouraged buyers.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 1.61%, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.99%, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC 2.68%.
Upbeat guidance from retailers such as Department store operator Macy's Inc M.N, discount chains Dollar General Corp DG.N and Dollar Tree DLTR.O appeared to offset dour warnings from their peers in recent weeks.
""Despite the fact that the five day gains on Wall St now at and above 4% suggests that the meltdown has been snapped, there should be no mistaking that this is but earnings relief; - and should not prematurely inspire proclamations of a bull market reboot,"" said analysts at Mizuho Bank.
Tapas Strickland, a director of economics and markets at NAB, said ""equities are sitting in the glow of the FOMC Minutes on Wednesday where it appears markets have interpreted them as opening up the possibility of a Fed pause in Q4 2022, while some note the front loading of hikes may have tightened financial conditions sufficiently.""
The Fed's minutes of its May meeting released on Wednesday confirmed two more 50-basis point hikes each in June and July, but policymakers also suggested the potential for a pause later in the year.
Still, the lift in equities has not split over to other asset markets with yields broadly steady, Strickland noted.
On Friday, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR rose slightly to 2.7649% compared with its U.S. close of 2.758% on Thursday. It had hit a three-year high of 3.2030% earlier this month on fears rapid hikes from the Fed may undermine long-term growth.
The two-year yield US2YT=RR, which rises with traders' expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.4879% compared with a U.S. close of 2.488%.
""The fall in U.S. Treasury yields in the meantime has correlated with falls in inflation expectations, which had been above 3% in the 10yr, and are now in the 2.6% area. All in all, a pronounced decompression of stress,"" said analysts at ING in a note.
Signs that aggressive Fed action may already be slowing economic growth are also emerging. Data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week as the labor market remained tight. A separate report confirmed the U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter.
In the currency markets, the U.S. dollar =USDfell 0.2% against a basket of major currencies, further pulling away from its 20-year peaks hit two weeks ago. The euro EUR= gained 0.26% against the greenback. FRX/
Oil prices eased slightly in early Asian trade after surging to a two-month high in the previous session as investors focused on signs of tight global supply.
U.S. crude CLc1 dipped 0.15% to $113.92 a barrel. Brent crude LCOc1 fell 0.1% to $117.27 per barrel.
Gold was slightly lower. Spot gold XAU= was traded at $1848.79 per ounce. GOL/

2022-05-26 00:00:00+00:00,Retail Earnings Confuse Rather than Clarify,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/retail-earnings-confuse-rather-than-clarify,,,"O
ver the last twenty-four hours or so there has been a rush of retail earnings, the details of which can be found at the always useful Nasdaq.com’s earnings page. Among this morning’s releases were two big dollar store chains, Dollar General (DG), and Dollar Tree (DLTR), along with Burlington Stores (BURL) and Macy’s (M). Yesterday we heard from Williams-Sonoma (WSM) and Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), and the parade will continue later today when Costco (COST) and Gap (GPS) report.
On the surface so far, the news is good. Of those that have reported over the last couple of days, only Burlington has posted a miss of expectations, but even there the stock is trading higher post-release after they showed good sales numbers and issued upbeat guidance. Still, I have often pointed out in these pages that earnings, and retail earnings in particular, are not as straightforward as they sometimes seem.
Where people are spending their money is almost as important as how much they are spending. For example, if the good quarters of Dollar Tree and Dollar General had been outliers, it would suggest that consumers were turning to ultra-low-end outlets to shop, presumably because they were feeling the pinch of inflation and a slowing economy. Needless to say, if that were the case, good numbers for DG and DLTR would not have been a good sign at all. However, that isn’t what we saw. Williams-Sonoma did well too, and they are distinctly high end, while Macy’s, which caters to the middle tranche of consumers, also beat expectations.
So, these numbers are actually quite encouraging no matter how you look at them. They show consumer activity is still strong and, just as importantly, retail businesses managing severe supply chain issues and able to supply them with the things they want to buy. However, just over a week ago, the two biggest retail names, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT), both posted big misses on their first quarter earnings, and a month ago, Amazon (AMZN) also missed in a big way. After Walmart and Target disappointed, I wrote that that had to be bad news for the economy overall.
So, which is it? Are retail earnings a good sign, or a bad one? Is the consumer spending as usual or pulling back?
The honest, if unsatisfying, answer to those questions is ""I don’t know."" I will say, though, that on the basis that wise people change their minds when the facts before them change, I am a lot less pessimistic now than I was a week or so ago. It is much more likely today than it was then that what we saw from WMT and TGT was more about them as companies than it was about weaker consumer sentiment. Both referred to a change in the mix of goods that shoppers were buying, and now it looks quite possible that their woes stemmed from a failure to anticipate that change in preferences and react accordingly, rather than from a reluctance from shoppers to spend.
You can make excuses for Amazon, too. They are so big that they are as much a logistics company as a retailer, and massive increases in fuel costs and the supply chain disruptions could easily explain their disappointing numbers.
When it comes to retail earnings, then, more information has resulted in less, not more, clarity as to how economic issues are impacting the American consumer. However, just a week or so ago, it looked as if they were sending a depressing message, so confusion is at least an improvement. On that basis, and because of the technical signals that I wrote about a couple of days ago, I am much more optimistic about the stock market’s direction than I was a week ago.

May 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed sharply higher on Thursday after a raft of solid retail earnings and easing concerns about overly aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve put investors in a buying mood.
All three major U.S. stock indexes posted solid gains, with economically sensitive consumer discretionary .SPLRCD and microchip .SOX stocks beating the broader market.
On a weekly basis, the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow are on track to snap their longest losing streaks in decades, during which the benchmark S&P plummeted 14.1% and brought it within striking distance of being confirmed as a bear market.
At current levels, all three indexes are poised to notch their biggest weekly gains since mid-March.
""With first quarter earnings essentially over and coming in better than expected, combined with the Fed indicating that they are going to be front-end loading its rate-tightening policy and implying it may pause later in the fall, all of that has given investors reason to feel optimistic,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
Upbeat guidance from retailers appeared to offset dour warnings from their peers in recent weeks.
Shares of department store operator Macy's Inc M.N jumped after it raised its annual profit forecast.
Discount chains Dollar General Corp DG.N and Dollar Tree DLTR.O surged, following their annual sales forecast hikes, suggesting consumers are shopping for less costly goods amid decades-high inflation.
The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) most recent monetary policy meeting calmed fears that the U.S. central bank could turn more hawkish, a concern which has fed into market volatility in recent weeks.
""We have had 65% more daily price moves of 1% or more than the average since WW2,"" Stovall said.
""If the Fed is too aggressive, they'll choke off inflation but also choke off economic growth,"" he added. ""It's like in the winter you want to tap your brakes, not slam on them, to maintain control and avoid spinning out.""
Economic data released on Thursday, including jobless claims, pending home sales and GDP, brought good news wrapped in bad, suggesting the economy is showing just enough softness to prompt a dovish pivot from the Fed by autumn.
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 79.51 points, or 2.00%, to end at 4,058.24 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC gained 301.83 points, or 2.64%, to 11,740.46. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 520.20 points, or 1.62%, to 32,640.48.
Shares of Twitter Inc TWTR.K jumped on news that the social media company is suing billionaire Elon Musk for delayed disclosure of his stake in the company.
U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba Group BABA.N rose after the Chinese e-commerce company beat estimates, even as it declined to provide forward guidance in view of COVID-19 restrictions in China.

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new July 8th contracts and identified the following put contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $140.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.61. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $140.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $137.39 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $156.85/share today.
Because the $140.00 strike represents an approximate 11% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.86% return on the cash commitment, or 15.82% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $140.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $156.85) to be 43%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-05-26 00:00:00+00:00,US STOCKS-Wall St set for higher open on earnings optimism,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-st-set-for-higher-open-on-earnings-optimism,,,"By Devik Jain and Anisha Sircar
May 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open higher on Thursday after strong earnings outlooks from companies such as Macy's, while data confirmed the U.S. economy contracted in the first-quarter, quelling some worries about aggressive rate hikes.
Macy's Inc M.N jumped 13.0% in premarket trading after the department store raised its annual profit forecast, as party-wear demand rebounds.
Dollar General Corp DG.N and Dollar Tree DLTR.O gained 11.4% and 15.3% respectively, after raising their annual sales forecasts, as more Americans turn to discount store shopping with inflation at a four-decade high.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department's report showed U.S. gross domestic product fell at a 1.5% annualized rate last quarter, revised down from the 1.4% decline reported in April under the weight of a record-trade deficit. The economy grew at a robust 6.9% pace in the fourth quarter.
Separately, weekly jobless claims fell to 210,000 last week, consistent with a tight labor market despite rising interest rates and tightening financial conditions.
""The data is supportive of laying the groundwork for a potential dovish pivot several months from now,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital.
""These numbers are indicative that growth is slowing, demand is slowing and maybe prices are even starting to slow. And if all those three things are in place, then the case for a dovish pivot will build over the summer months.""
The report came a day after the minutes of the Federal Reserve's May meeting showed policymakers noted the U.S. economy remained strong, with households in such good shape that it might be harder to get them to stop spending and take the pressure off of prices.
Most Fed policymakers judged that further hikes of 50 basis points would ""likely be appropriate"" at the U.S. central bank's policy meetings in June and July, largely in-line with investors' expectations, helping U.S. stocks close higher on Wednesday.
Markets have sold off sharply this year on increasing worries about an economic slowdown due to aggressive Fed policy moves aimed at reining in surging prices. The war in Ukraine, pandemic-related lockdowns in China and recent dismal corporate forecasts have also weighed down markets.
The blue-chip Dow .DJI and the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX have lost 11.6% and 16.5% year-to-date, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC has fallen nearly 27% as high-multiple growth stocks took a hit from rising interest rates.
At 8:54 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 232 points, or 0.72%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 had gained 28 points, or 0.70%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 52.5 points, or 0.44%.
U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba Group BABA.N added 4.7% after the company posted upbeat fourth-quarter revenue on growing demand for some of its niche online shopping services in China.
Twitter Inc TWTR.N gained 4.4% after Elon Musk pledged an additional $6.25 billion in equity financing to fund his $44-billion offer for the social-media company.
Nvidia Corp NVDA.O fell 3.7% after the chip designer forecast a decline in sales of video game chips in the current quarter, and laid out new supply-chain snags from China's COVID-19 lockdowns.

2022-05-26 00:00:00+00:00,Dollar Tree (DLTR) Surpasses Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-dltr-surpasses-q1-earnings-and-revenue-estimates,,,"Dollar Tree (DLTR) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.37 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.98 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.60 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 19.70%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this discount retailer would post earnings of $1.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.01, delivering a surprise of 12.29%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.
Dollar Tree, which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, posted revenues of $6.9 billion for the quarter ended April 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.47%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $6.48 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Dollar Tree shares have lost about 4.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -16.5%.
What's Next for Dollar Tree?
While Dollar Tree has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Dollar Tree: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.68 on $6.75 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.86 on $27.82 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Discount Stores is currently in the bottom 3% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
Capri Holdings (CPRI), another stock in the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector, has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2022. The results are expected to be released on June 1.
This luxury retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.82 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +115.8%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
Capri Holdings' revenues are expected to be $1.4 billion, up 17.1% from the year-ago quarter.

DLTR reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein sales and earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. The results benefited from the completion of the $1.25 multi-price point initiative at the Dollar Tree stores. Results also gained from robust margins despite the continued increase in freight costs and SG&A expenses.

Shares of DLTR rallied 16% in the pre-market trading session on May 26, driven by the better-than-expected top and bottom lines in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and an upbeat fiscal 2022 view.

Quarter in Detail
Dollar Tree’s earnings improved 48.1% year over year to $2.37 per share and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99. This marked record first-quarter earnings for the company. The bottom-line growth can be attributed to the completion of the conversion of the Dollar Tree banner’s $1.25 price point initiative, which aided both the top line and margins.

Consolidated net sales advanced 6.5% year over year to $6,900.1 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,742 million. Enterprise same-store sales (comps) improved 4.4% year over year. For the Dollar Tree banner, comps were up 11.2%, while comps for the Family Dollar banner dipped 2.8%. The decline in Family Dollar comps resulted from the absence of significant government stimulus in the prior-year quarter. Family Dollar comps were also affected by the temporary closure of nearly 400 stores due to a product recall, which hurt comps by 200 basis points (bps).

Gross profit increased 19.2% year over year to $2,340.5 million, while the gross margin expanded 360 bps to 33.9%. Gains from improved initial mark-on, favorable product mix at Dollar Tree banner, and distribution and occupancy cost leverage mainly boosted gross margin. This was partly negated by higher freight expenses, unfavorable product mix at Family Dollar, markdowns and shrink. The gross margin expanded 690 bps to 40.6% at the Dollar Tree banner and contracted 100 bps to 25.8% at the Family Dollar segment.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 100 bps to 23.3% due to elevated store payroll, the West Memphis distribution center-related issue, and the reconstitution of the board of directors.
