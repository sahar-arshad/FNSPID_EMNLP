2022-06-09 00:00:00+00:00,July 29th Options Now Available For Dollar Tree (DLTR),DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/july-29th-options-now-available-for-dollar-tree-dltr,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options begin trading today, for the July 29th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new July 29th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $160.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $160.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $153.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $161.87/share today.
Because the $160.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.31% return on the cash commitment, or 31.48% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $160.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $165.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.45. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $161.87/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $165.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.92% if the stock gets called away at the July 29th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $165.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $165.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.98% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.09% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $161.87) to be 44%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-06-09 00:00:00+00:00,DLTR vs. BURL: Which Stock Is the Better Value Option?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dltr-vs.-burl%3A-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option,,,"Investors interested in stocks from the Retail - Discount Stores sector have probably already heard of Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Burlington Stores (BURL). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.
Right now, Dollar Tree is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Burlington Stores has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that DLTR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.
DLTR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 19.80, while BURL has a forward P/E of 26.72. We also note that DLTR has a PEG ratio of 1.27. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. BURL currently has a PEG ratio of 3.11.
Another notable valuation metric for DLTR is its P/B ratio of 4.39. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, BURL has a P/B of 16.26.
These metrics, and several others, help DLTR earn a Value grade of B, while BURL has been given a Value grade of C.
DLTR has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than BURL, so it seems like value investors will conclude that DLTR is the superior option right now.

2022-06-09 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Dollar Tree (DLTR) is Marching Ahead of Industry,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-dollar-tree-dltr-is-marching-ahead-of-industry,,,"Dollar Tree Inc. DLTR looks well-poised in a tough industry, driven by its store initiatives, including store growth plans and initiatives to boost store productivity. The company has been recently gaining from the completion of the $1.25 multi-price point initiative at the Dollar Tree stores, as well as robust margins, despite the increase in freight costs and SG&A expenses. Also, the company’s Combo store and H2 renovation initiatives bode well.

Driven by store initiatives as well as measures to control costs, the company reported the 10th straight quarter of earnings beat in first-quarter fiscal 2022. The top line also beat estimates. Both earnings and sales improved year over year. Enterprise same-store sales (comps) improved 4.4% year over year. Gains from improved initial mark-on, favorable product mix at Dollar Tree banner, and distribution and occupancy cost leverage boosted the gross margin.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have risen 61.9% in the past year against the industry's decline of 0.2%. The stock also outpaced the sector’s and the S&P 500’s declines of 47.9% and 5.7%, respectively, in the past year.

 Factors Aiding Growth
Dollar Tree has been optimizing its store portfolio through store openings, renovations, re-banners and closings to stay relevant in the current scenario. It is delivering compelling results for its Key Real Estate Initiatives, which include the expansion of its $3 and $5 plus assortment in Dollar Tree stores, as well as Combo Stores. It also remains on track with H2 Renovations at the Family Dollar stores. Consequently, the company outlined plans to accelerate its key initiatives in fiscal 2022 and beyond.

In fiscal 2022, Dollar Tree expects to complete 800 Family Dollar H2 Renovations as part of the Key Real Estate Initiative. Out of this, 190 will be Dollar Tree stores and 400 will be Family Dollar stores. Within the Family Dollar stores, 350 stores will be in the Combo Store format. Also, management intends to expand the $3 and $5 Plus assortments to more than 1,500 Dollar Tree stores. It expects at least 5,000 Dollar Tree Plus! stores by the end of 2024.

Family Dollar H2 stores have been performing well, with about 450 Family Dollar stores renovated to the H2 format in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. The company currently has 3,300 Family Dollar H2 stores. In fiscal 2022, Dollar Tree expects to complete 800 Family Dollar H2 Renovations as part of the Key Real Estate Initiative.

Moreover, the company completed the rollout of its $1.25 price point initiative to every Dollar Tree store across the United States in February 2022, more than two months ahead of schedule. The move will enable Dollar Tree to reintroduce some customer favorites and traffic-driving products, which were discontinued earlier due to the $1 pricing constraint. Driven by the $1.25 initiative, the company expects increases in comps, sales and gross margin.

Dollar Tree’s restructuring and expansion initiatives, as evident from steady store openings and improvement of distribution centers, are likely to drive revenues. In first-quarter fiscal 2022, Dollar Tree opened 112 stores, expanded or relocated 33 outlets, and shuttered 30 stores. The company completed the renovation of 118 Family Dollar stores to the H2 or Combo Store formats. Additionally, it expanded the multi-price plus offerings to another 790 Dollar Tree stores in the quarter. As of Apr 30, 2022, the company operated 16,162 stores in 48 states and five Canada provinces.

In fiscal 2022, the company expects to open 590 stores, consisting of 400 Family Dollar and 190 Dollar Tree stores. It also plans 1,500 Dollar Tree Plus additions and 800 Family Dollar H2 Renovations. The company is on track to reach its long-term target of operating 26,000 stores, with more than 10,000 Dollar Tree and 15,000 Family Dollar outlets, across North America. Additionally, the company is on track to leverage Family Dollar and Dollar Tree distribution center systems and combined merchandise. This will help bring the latest products into Dollar Tree stores without disruptions.
Robust View
Following the robust first-quarter fiscal 2022 performance, Dollar Tree raised its fiscal 2022 guidance. The company expects consolidated net sales of $27.76-$28.14 billion compared with the $27.22-$27.85 billion mentioned earlier. It anticipates enterprise comps growth in the mid-single digits for fiscal 2022, including a high-single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and almost flat comps in the Family Dollar segment.

Management envisions earnings of $7.80-$8.20 per share compared with the prior mentioned $7.60-$8.00 per share. It expects selling square footage to increase 3.9%. The Dollar Tree segment is likely to deliver an improved operating margin for fiscal 2022, with the gross margin benefiting from its strategic initiatives as well as leverage on SG&A.

For second-quarter fiscal 2022, Dollar Tree expects consolidated net sales of $6.65-$6.78 billion, with enterprise same-store sales growth in the low to mid-single digits. It anticipates earnings of $1.45-$1.55 per share.
Bottom Line
We believe that the solid top line, led by Dollar Tree's several store initiatives and gains from the transition of the Dollar Tree stores to the $1.25 price point, will offset elevated freight costs, softness in the Family Dollar banner and higher SG&A expenses.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dollar Tree's fiscal 2022 earnings is pegged at $8.15 per share, which has moved up by a penny in the past seven days. The consensus mark suggests growth of 40.5% from the prior year’s reported figure. Also, a long-term earnings growth rate of 15.5 drives optimism.
Other Stocks to Consider
We have highlighted three other top-ranked stocks in the Retail - Wholesale sector, namely Boot Barn BOOT, Designer Brands DBI and Chico’s CHS.

Boot Barn, a lifestyle retailer of western and work-related footwear, apparel and accessories, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). BOOT has an expected EPS growth rate of 20% for three-five years. Shares of BOOT have gained 15.9% in the past year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boot Barn’s current-year sales and earnings per share (EPS) suggests growth of 17% and 4.4%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported figures. BOOT has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 25.2%, on average.

Designer Brands, which designs, manufactures, and retails footwear and accessories in North America, flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1 at present. DBI has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 102.5%, on average. The stock has declined 7% in the past year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Designer Brands’ current-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 6.9% and 16.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers.

Chico’s, an omnichannel specialty retailer, presently carries a Zacks Rank #2. CHS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 330.6%, on average. Shares of the company have declined 1.9% in the past year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Chico’s current-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 16.5% and 15%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers.

2022-06-08 00:00:00+00:00,7 Top-Rated Large-Cap Stocks to Buy and Hold,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-top-rated-large-cap-stocks-to-buy-and-hold,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
A time of challenging market conditions (like we’re seeing today) can be a frustrating time to invest. There is, however, a silver lining. A market downturn is a great opportunity to load up on high-quality names. For example, large-cap stocks with strong fundamentals.
When stocks overall move lower, that’s the case for both more speculative plays, as well as sturdier opportunities. The latter may not experience as sharp of a plunge as the former. In fact, some of them, like commodities stocks, can perform well, as rising commodities prices outweigh external factors. Still, if you have a long time horizon in mind, you can enter/add to a position at an ideal price point.
7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for June 2022
So, what are some examples of such plays? Consider these seven top-rated, large-cap stocks. Each one has the potential to deliver solid returns (via appreciation and dividends) for buy and hold investors.
Ticker Company Current Price
CF CF Industries Holdings $91.19
DLTR Dollar Tree $162.51
HSY Hershey Company $211.74
KR Kroger Co. $51.61
OXY Occidental Petroleum $69.87
PAYX Paychex $125.68
SQM Sociedad Quimica Y Minera De Chile S.A. $100.22
CF Industries Holdings (CF)
CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) is a good example of what I was talking about above. Thanks to a boom in commodities prices (in its case, fertilizer), shares are up sharply in what has so far been a down year for stocks.
As the Russia/Ukraine conflict has slashed supply of key fertilizer ingredients like ammonia, nitrogen and urea, it’s no surprise CF stock surged earlier this year. More recently, it has been trading sideways, as investors factor in a pullback in spot fertilizer prices. Yet that doesn’t mean CF Industries’ key tailwind is about to bust out.
Even if prices fall from their highs, they’re expected to remain elevated compared to prior year levels. This bodes well for the stock, as it today trades at a heavily discounted valuation (5x estimated 2022 earnings). An established name in this space, it stands to continue to perform well, during today’s boom, and beyond.
This stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Dollar Tree (DLTR)
Like other stocks in the space, shares in discount retailer Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) plunged in mid-May, following underwhelming earnings reports from two of its peers.
However, within a week, DLTR stock completely bounced back. The reason? Its strong quarterly earnings report. Reporting strong revenue and earnings growth, demonstrating the market’s fears of inflationary pressures affecting its performance were an overreaction. What does this short-term boost have to do with its bona fides as a long-term buy-and-hold play?
Like some other high-quality discount retailers, it’s thriving despite the challenges presented by today’s high rates of inflation. As this factor has little-to-no impact on its growth, Dollar Tree is well positioned to continue steadily increasing its revenue and earnings. This will enable the stock to continue delivering solid returns. With this, consider it one of the best large-cap stocks out there to make a long-term position.

This stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Hershey Company (HSY)
Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) is a defensive play, with a deep economic moat. It also pays out a steady dividend (forward yield of 1.72%), a payout that has gone up twelve years in a row. All these factors make it the kind of stock you want to own in a down market.
These safe harbor bona fides also explain why HSY stock is up for the year. In the move to “risk off,” investors have pivoted to venerable names like this one. It also helps that the confectionary giant has also done a great job of adjusting to the impact of rising raw material, labor and transport costs.
With demand staying robust, despite it passing along costs to the consumer, Hershey raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast in April. More resistant to today’s economic challenges than many other stocks (including some other packaged goods stocks), consider it a buy.
This stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Kroger (KR)
Grocery chain operator Kroger (NYSE:KR) is yet another high-quality, large-cap stock that has performed well in 2022. Even after a pullback last month, it’s up around 14.5% year-to-date.
Speaking of its pullback, the May selloff in KR stock should be seen as a buying opportunity. Why? Its drop was entirely due to the downward pressure put on retailer stocks following the bad quarterly numbers for two large retailers that I referenced above when talking about Dollar Tree.
Although Kroger hasn’t yet reported earnings, the sell-side has raised its earnings forecast in recent months. This suggests the company will show, like it did last quarter, that high inflation is not affecting its performance, like it is for other retailers. Only partially bouncing back in recent weeks, you may want to take advantage of this weakness, by starting to accumulate a long-term position in the stock.

This stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Occidental Petroleum (OXY)
The sharp rise in oil prices, plus Warren Buffett’s big purchase of shares, have resulted in an epic run for Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) so far this year. It’s up 125% year-to-date.
However, don’t take this to mean you’ve “missed out” on this opportunity. This remains one of the best large-cap stocks out there to make a long-term holding. Why? There are many factors, not just Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, that are behind the spiking of crude oil prices. Prices could stay elevated for longer than expected.
Long-term, there’s something else (not talked about that much) that could mean continued growth for OXY stock. That would be its move into “net-zero” oil. Moving into this area could pay off down the road, if stricter environmental regulations require its use. Benefiting from high oil prices, and with a “green” catalyst hiding in plain sight, it’s a buy.
This stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Paychex (PAYX)
In contrast to many of the large-cap stocks listed above, Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) shares are in the red for 2022, down over 6%. Recession fears are likely putting pressure on this payroll, benefits and HR outsourcing company. After all, recessions mean lower employment, hence lower demand for its services.
But it’s possible investors are too pessimistic. Providing back office services is essential for the operation of a small or medium-sized enterprise. An economic downturn shouldn’t have an outsized impact on its operating performance.
PAYX stock also has a relatively high dividend (forward yield of 2.58%). Raising its dividend 8 years in a row, over the past five years it has raised its dividend by an average of 8.53% per year. This stock offers a lot for buy-and-hold investors. It provides a steady return through its dividend. In the years ahead, it could also benefit from steady price appreciation.
7 Oversold Stocks to Buy Right Now
This stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Sociedad Quimica Y Minera De Chile (SQM)
Sociedad Quimica Y Minera De Chile (NYSE:SQM), or SQM for short, is a Chilean fertilizer and mining company. Saying it has been firing on all cylinders lately is an understatement. The company has not only benefited from the boom in fertilizer prices.
A major lithium supplier, it has been benefiting from strong demand, due to its use in the production of electric vehicle (EV) batteries. As a result, its earnings are up substantially. So too, is its stock price. SQM stock is up around 96% since January, and up 112% over the past twelve months.
After another big spike late last month, SQM has pulled back. Further weakness may be ahead. However, it has long-term catalysts like the lithium boom on its side. Coupled with a low valuation (forward earnings multiple of 8.8x), and an above-average dividend (4.57%), long-term investors may want to start slowly building up a position.
This stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.

2022-06-05 00:00:00+00:00,Will Five Below Raise Its Outlook This Week?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-five-below-raise-its-outlook-this-week,,,"Investors are eager for Five Below's (NASDAQ: FIVE) earnings update, set for release this week. The youth-focused retailer's stock has been swinging wildly in recent weeks as rivals reported a mix of good and bad news around consumer spending patterns. Some companies are seeing declining demand for many niches that had been booming. Others are reducing their earnings outlook as costs soar.
Five Below has a good shot at navigating through those challenges thanks to its focus on value and its flexible merchandising strategy. Let's look at how these factors might help the chain report surprisingly strong results on Wednesday, June 8.
Image source: Getty Images.
Sales trends
Five Below's growth strategy involves adding as many as 400 new stores over the next two fiscal years. But first, it will have to show it can continue expanding sales at existing locations.
Comparable-sales growth slowed to just 3.4% in the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, which ended in late January, after booming for most of the year. The company faced a tough year-over-year comparison due to soaring demand a year earlier, driven by financial stimulus payments.
Look for comparable sales to potentially slip into negative territory for the fiscal first quarter. Back in late March, management guided for flat to down 2% comps, and since that time, several retailers have described a challenging selling environment as shoppers shifted spending to different categories. Five Below's success will depend on its ability to respond to these changes by stocking the right products.
Earnings pressure
Both Walmart and Target recently lowered their 2022 earnings outlook, while a few other retailers, including Dollar Tree, affirmed their forecasts. It's not clear yet which of these paths Five Below will take for the rest of the year.
Data by YCharts.
It is likely the chain avoided the inventory challenges that hurt Target, since it doesn't sell many bulky products. Its value focus might even lift demand during this inflationary time.
Follow operating margin for signs of stress here. That figure landed at 13.3% of sales in fiscal 2021, and management is hoping to push it to 14% of sales over time. We'll learn on Wednesday whether the retailer is less optimistic about short-term profitability.
Looking ahead
Last quarter, management articulated a plan to more than triple the current store count to as many as 3,500 locations by fiscal 2030. That outlook implies 400 new launches through fiscal 2023.
Wall Street will be nervous if management revises comparable-sales guidance downward since that might threaten Five Below's store growth ambitions. On the bright side, the company has demonstrated a knack for navigating through a wide range of selling conditions.
If it can repeat that success through today's consumer spending shifts, the stock should reward patient shareholders with market-beating returns.

2022-06-04 00:00:00+00:00,Dollar Tree's Huge Price Hike Could Be Hiding Deeper Problems,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-trees-huge-price-hike-could-be-hiding-deeper-problems,,,"It is hard to knock Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) for increasing sales by 6.5% in the first quarter, a period in which some of the industry's biggest names appeared to struggle. But the good news here just doesn't look quite so great when you step back and dig into the numbers a little bit.
Here's why you might want to take a more cautious approach with Dollar Tree right now.
The good and the not so good
When it comes to good news, it was Dollar Tree's namesake brand that garnered all of the attention. Sales in the first quarter for this business rose a hefty 11.2%. Those are comparable-store sales figures, so it's a pretty robust number given that it measures results for stores that were open for at least a year. Clearly, consumers are going to Dollar Tree and spending more.
Image source: Getty Images.
There's a nuance there that's important because Dollar Tree hiked prices by a massive 25% on most of the products it sells. True, that only means shifting from $1 per item to $1.25, which is kind of small on an absolute basis, but percentage wise, it is huge. So perhaps it is more shocking that comparable-store sales in this division only rose 11.2%. It would seem that a more material increase might have been expected.
Then there's the company's Family Dollar division, which saw comparable-store sales fall 2.8%. To be fair, most of that was the result of store closures related to a ""product-related recall,"" which accounted for two percentage points of the drop (more on this below). However, that still left sales in this division down 0.8%, which the company explained was caused by cycling through ""significant stimulus dollars released in the prior year's quarter."" In other words, people spent less because they had less money to spend. To think that only the Family Dollar business saw this impact seems a bit unrealistic and hints that, maybe, Dollar Tree is facing some sales issues, too.
As for the product-related recall, it was tied to a rat infestation at one of the company's distribution centers. That could be a one-off event, but investors should probably keep an eye on the news here just the same. If there are more such problems, it would indicate worrisome operational issues.
Is there pain to come?
Adding to the worry here is management's commentary during Dollar Tree's Q1 2022 earnings conference call that traffic at the company's stores decreased 3.6% in the quarter. That was likely driven, at least in part, by the company's price hikes. And it also fits in well with competitor Dollar General's (NYSE: DG) first-quarter 2022earnings call/a> comments that it saw traffic decline and that its customers were shopping more ""intentionally."" Or, to put it another way, customers aren't spending money on stuff they don't actually need.
If that becomes a trend at dollar stores, then Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, and Dollar General will all be facing notable sales headwinds. And that comes as all three of these nameplates are also dealing with rising costs thanks to inflation. While hardly unique to these retailers, rising costs for products, employees, and shipping crimp margins and, thus, impact earnings in a negative way.
The offset to these problems is that people who might not normally shop at a dollar store might consider it if inflation is crimping their wallet. So the hit from current customers spending less might be offset by new customers. That's a potential positive, but with names like Walmart and Target likely serving such trade-down customers, competition for those dollars is likely to be fierce. Note that both of these retail giants have highlighted the need to keep prices low in order to retain customers, which suggests they will give up margin to maintain market share.
Glass half empty
It's pretty easy to take a positive view of Dollar Tree's Q1 results, which were -- from a top-level perspective -- strong. However, if you take the time to dig in just a little, there are some issues here that look likely to get worse before they get better. And the bad news looks like it is being hidden by the massive price hike at Dollar Tree's namesake stores.
At the very least, investors should be closely monitoring what happens through the rest of the year, specifically looking for signs of further weakness.

2022-06-03 00:00:00+00:00,3 Highly-Ranked Large-Cap Stocks Worth a Bet,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-highly-ranked-large-cap-stocks-worth-a-bet,,,"The market was strong yesterday, providing investors with a much-needed day in the green. Today, that fun has seemingly come to a halt, with red sweeping across the board. It’s been an exhausting 2022, to say the least, with sellers remaining in control and pushing bulls out of the arena at seemingly every turn.
With the Fed pivoting to a hawkish position, the stock market has priced in the impact of higher borrowing rates. This, in turn, with soaring energy costs and supply-chain bottlenecks, have all spoiled the fun year-to-date.
On a brighter note, the indices are still well above their 2022 lows, which any investor can celebrate. The five-year chart below illustrates that the S&P 500 has bounced off of March 2021 levels so far, another positive note.

A staple found within many portfolios is large-cap stocks. Large-cap stocks are typically classified by companies with market valuations of $10 billion or more.
Large-cap companies are generally more mature, well-known companies within established industries. These stocks are less volatile, have greater coverage, and typically pay dividends. Additionally, they provide stability and pose less risk – these companies are less likely to face an economic or business circumstance that will cause insolvency.
Let’s look at three large-cap stocks – Dollar Tree DLTR, Hess Corporation HES, and Analog Devices ADI – that all sport the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and why these stocks would be solid bets for investors looking for large-cap exposure.
Hess Corporation
Hess Corp. HES is a globally integrated energy company engaging in the exploration, production, development, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas. Year-to-date, shares have been blistering hot, increasing nearly 73% in value and easily outperforming the S&P 500.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The company has reported strong quarterly results. Over its last four quarters, the average EPS surprise has been a double-digit 13%, and in its latest quarter, HES beat bottom-line estimates by a solid 16%.
In addition to solid quarterly results, analysts have been upping their bottom-line outlook rapidly over the last 60 days. For the upcoming quarterly release, the $2.24 EPS estimate reflects a jaw-dropping 830% expansion in the bottom line from the year-ago quarter.
 Additionally, for FY22, earnings are expected to expand by a triple-digit 310%, and for FY23, the bottom line is expected to grow by an additional 40%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The company’s forward price-to-sales ratio of 3.5X is well below 2021 highs of 4.5X and represents a steep 31% discount relative to the S&P 500’s value of 4.1X.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
For investors who seek a stream of income, HES has that covered with its 1.19% annual dividend yield with a payout ratio sitting at 56% of earnings. Additionally, the company has increased its dividend once over the last five years, with a five-year annualized dividend growth rate of 2.3%.
The dividend yield is just marginally below the S&P 500’s 1.43% yield.

Dollar Tree
Dollar Tree DLTR is an operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise and other assortments, operating in all types of sized cities. Year-to-date, DLTR shares have been a hot item, increasing nearly 15% in value and easily outpacing the general market.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The company has chained together an impressive streak of ten consecutive bottom-line beats dating back to 2020, and over its last four quarterly reports, Dollar Tree has exceeded earnings estimates by 13%, on average. Furthermore, the company smoked EPS estimates by a sizable 20% in its latest quarterly release.
The Consensus Estimate Trend for the upcoming quarter has retraced by a concerning 8%, but the $1.56 EPS estimate still displays a notable 26% growth in earnings from the year-ago quarter. Additionally, earnings are forecasted to grow 40% in FY22 and an additional 14% in FY23.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Looking at valuation levels, Dollar Tree’s forward price-to-sales ratio of 1.3X is nicely below highs of 1.4X earlier this year and just above its median of 1.0X over the last five years. Additionally, the value represents a steep 67% discount relative to the S&P 500’s value.

Analog Devices
Analog Devices ADI is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing integrated circuits. Year-to-date, shares have displayed a valuable level of defense relative to the S&P 500, decreasing 5% in value.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The company has been on a blazing-hot earnings streak, exceeding EPS expectations in ten consecutive quarters. Over its last four quarterly reports, the company has an average EPS surprise of a notable 7.7%, and in its latest quarter, ADI beat bottom-line estimates by a substantial 13%.
Analysts have been upping their earnings outlook across the board over the last 60 days, undoubtedly a bullish signal. For the upcoming quarter, the $2.42 EPS estimate reflects a sizable 43% growth in earnings from the year-ago quarter.
Additionally, earnings are expected to climb 43% in FY22 and an additional 9.3% in FY23.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
ADI’s forward earnings multiple sits at 18.3X, well below the median of 21.1X over the last five years and nowhere near 2020 highs of 29.2X. Furthermore, the value represents a slight 2% discount relative to the S&P 500’s forward P/E ratio of 18.6X.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
ADI enjoys rewarding its shareholders via its 1.8% annual dividend yield with a payout ratio sitting at 39% of earnings. Over the last five years, ADI has increased its dividend five times, with a five-year annualized dividend growth rate of a sizable 11.3%. Additionally, the yield is higher than that of the S&P 500.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Bottom Line
Large-cap stocks provide a higher level of defense compared to others. Additionally, these companies have proven themselves over their lifetime and operate within established industries.
All three companies carry the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which further instills confidence as to why they would be solid additions for any large-cap investor.

Top Analyst Reports for Broadcom, Intel and Union Pacific
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc., Intel Corp., and Union Pacific Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
 
You can see all of today's research reports here >>>
Broadcom shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the past year (+23.6 % vs. +13.8%) on the back of strength in networking and server storage segments. Networking is riding on strong adoption of Broadcom's next-gen merchant switching and routing solutions by hyperscalers, enterprises and service providers. Aggressive adoption of its next-generation server storage solutions by hyperscalers is expected to drive top-line growth.
Broadcom expects fiscal third-quarter networking and server storage revenues to grow more than 25% and 60% on a year-over-year basis, respectively. An upbeat third-quarter fiscal 2022 guidance is encouraging. Recently announced VMware acquisition will aid prospects over the long term. However, increasing competition, along with high debt levels, are persistent overhangs.
(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)
Intel shares have declined -13.0% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry's decline of -25.1%. The Zacks analyst believes that the Client Computing Group is expected to suffer due to component shortage. Production delays pertaining to 7 nm ramp up remain a concern. A strained Sino-U.S. trade relationship, imposition of fresh lockdown restrictions in some markets, forex woes and high debt burden remain other concerns.
However, despite short-term headwinds, the company expects demand to pick up in the second half of the year. The company is riding on prospects of the Internet of Things and Mobileye businesses. Mobileye growth should be driven by design wins amid recovering automotive industry. Recovery in the enterprise business of the data center segment is a positive. Intel is developing more integrated solutions that will likely be competitive on a cost per watt basis while offering customized solutions for bigger firms.

Union Pacific shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (+0.6 % vs. -4.4%). The company raised its dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP upped its quarterly dividend by a further 10%. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front. Management anticipates share repurchases in 2022 to be in line with the 2021 levels of $7.3 billion.
The Zacks analyst believes that the company's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. Uptick in freight revenues (up 17% year over year in first-quarter 2022) as economic activities pick up the pace is an added positive.
However, escalation in fuel costs (up 74% in the March quarter) as oil prices moved north induced a 16% rise in the operating expenses. High debt/EBITDA ratio and tepid automotive demand are further concerns. Increased capex may also be bothersome.

2022-06-03 00:00:00+00:00,How Procter & Gamble Is Getting Consumers to Pay More,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-procter-gamble-is-getting-consumers-to-pay-more,,,"Inflation is top of mind today for consumers and investors. For consumer products companies like Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), the aim is basically to push through rising prices without consumers trading down to lower-priced options.
Some companies handle this better than others and, so far, P&G appears to be doing an excellent job of getting consumers to pay more. Here's how.
Any number of ways
Consumer staples companies have a great deal of experience when it comes to raising prices. Right now, the issue is all about offsetting inflation, but hiking prices is basically one of their key mechanisms for growing the top line. There are ""good"" ways and ""bad"" ways to do it.
Image source: Getty Images.
For example, a company can simply charge more. In a broad way, that's what Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) did when it went from charging $1 for everything in the store to $1.25 for most things. But that is not the normal approach, given the shock it might cause to consumers. A company often will raise the price by showing the old cost as a sale price while listing the new, higher cost as the normal price. In this way, consumers kind of 'back into"" the price hike.
Another option is to change the size of packages. Essentially, this means putting less in each package so consumers are buying the same item, but getting less. Or a company can switch to a less expensive ingredient, essentially cutting costs but also potentially reducing product quality. Again, the end result is that a consumer is paying more for less.
These are a few of the big ones; there are other ways companies manage to raise prices in the face of rising costs. But Procter & Gamble prefers to do things a bit more directly. And so far, it is proving incredibly effective.
What it's doing and how well
The core numbers are important here. P&G was able to boost organic sales by 10% in the fiscal third quarter. There were several things that went into that, including price, mix, and volume. Price (charging more) and volume (selling more) are exactly what they sound like, but mix is a bit more complex.
Some companies offer various price points for similar products, so a person can trade down to cheaper alternatives. While it is good to keep customers in the product family, buying cheaper products reduces organic sales.
But a company can also get customers to trade up to higher-priced products. This added 2 percentage points to P&G's sales growth in the fiscal third quarter. This wasn't an across-the-board move, with some product categories seeing better results than others. Notably, P&G's healthcare division witnessed a five-percentage-point boost from mix, nearly double the three percentage points it got from price.
The company highlighted a strong cold and flu season for some of the healthcare group's boost, but also noted ""innovation in sleep and digestive wellness."" The key word there is ""innovation,"" and it is a strong point for P&G, which has a long history of spending on research and development (R&D). Basically, it brought out new products or introduced new variants of existing products that provided enough benefits to justify charging a higher price.
This is perhaps the second-best way to get price increases -- the best being to create an entirely new product category, as P&G did when it introduced the Swiffer. While you can argue that introducing a new product category isn't a price increase, the counter argument is that the new product took price from zero to some positive number.
P&G's product portfolio, which tends to sit at the high end of most of the categories in which it plays, is perfect for the R&D approach to price hikes. In essence, the company is using quality to justify increased prices, which is only possible if you are ""leading"" the industry.
This too shall pass
Procter & Gamble is doing exceptionally well right now as it looks to offset the impact of inflation by raising prices. Offering more quality is management's preferred mechanism, and its consumer products portfolio is filled with opportunities to support the effort.
The problem is that consumers pinched by inflation eventually will start to push back, which is something the company is monitoring closely. That doesn't mean that P&G will stop innovating, just that the near-term benefits of that innovation might not be as apparent. However, the important takeaway here is that the company's current ability to improve mix should be seen as a strength over the long term.

2022-06-03 00:00:00+00:00,Costco's (COST) Stellar Comparable Sales Run Continues in May,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/costcos-cost-stellar-comparable-sales-run-continues-in-may,,,"Costco Wholesale Corporation COST has time and again proved its mettle. The company has weathered multiple market gyrations and still delivered returns to investors. Strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives and emphasis on memberships have been the discount retailer’s primary strengths. These have helped post consistent sales growth.

Impressively, Costco has outpaced the Retail - Discount Stores industry in the past year. We note that shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have appreciated 25.8% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 2.7%.
Stellar Sales Run
Costco’s growth strategies, better price management, decent membership trends and increasing penetration of e-commerce business have been contributing to its upbeat performance. Amid the surging inflation, low-to-middle income consumers have preferred discount stores to meet their day-to-day needs. Cumulatively, these have been aiding this Issaquah, WA-based company in registering impressive sales numbers.

Costco’s net sales increased 16.9% to $18.23 billion for the retail month of May, the four-week period ended May 29, 2022, from $15.59 billion in the last year. This followed an increase of 13.9% in April and 18.7% in March.
 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Impressive Comparable Sales Trend
Comparable sales for the retail month of May jumped 15.5%. This followed increases of 12.6% and 17.2% in April and March, respectively. Comparable sales for the retail month of May reflect an improvement of 17.5%, 17.4% and 2.6% in the United States, Canada and Other International locations, respectively.

Excluding the impacts of changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange, comparable sales for the month under discussion rose 11.8% on improvements of 10.7%, 19.5% and 10.1% in the United States, Canada and Other International locations, respectively.
E-Commerce on the Rise
Costco has been rapidly adopting the omni-channel mantra in a bid to provide a seamless shopping experience, both online and at stores. The company has been gradually expanding its e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia.

We note that comparable e-commerce sales rose 6.3% in May. This followed increases of 5.7% and 8.9% in April and March, respectively. Costco Logistics has bolstered e-commerce capabilities and facilitated the selling of “big and bulky” items.
Bottom Line
Costco continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers based on the expanse and quality of merchandise offered. The company's distinctive membership business model sets it apart from the traditional players. A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming.
3 Stocks Looking Red Hot

2022-06-03 00:00:00+00:00,Top 3 Stocks With Momentum Anomaly to Beat Market Volatility,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-3-stocks-with-momentum-anomaly-to-beat-market-volatility,,,"High inflationary pressures continue to haunt the equity markets as the Fed aims to tame the bearish sentiments through an aggressive rate hike regime. With uncertainty triggering intense volatility, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.

This approach primarily tends to follow the adage, “the trend is your friend.” At its core, momentum investing is “buying high and selling higher.” It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. But before we delve deep into it, let us try to fathom why does the momentum strategy at all work?

There are several behavioral biases that most investors exhibit in their decision-making. And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, are the very reason that makes momentum strategy work.

For example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early. Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.

Furthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.

To sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.

In this context, stocks like Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR, Nutrien Ltd. NTR and Albemarle Corporation ALB are worth betting on.

Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.

Here, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price.
Screening Parameters
Percentage Change in Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get the best stocks that have appreciated steadily over the past year.

Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period. This parameter picks the ones that have witnessed a short-term pullback in price.

Zacks Rank #1: Stocks sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance irrespective of the market conditions. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Momentum Style Score of B or Better: A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors that include volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), handily outperform other stocks.

Current Price greater than $5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.

Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure the stability of price.

Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.

Here are the three of the seven stocks that made it through this screen:

Founded in 1986 and headquartered in Chesapeake, VA, Dollar Tree is an operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise and other assortments. The company offers a wide range of quality everyday general merchandise in many categories, including housewares, seasonal goods, candy and food, toys, health and beauty care, gifts, party goods, stationery, books, personal accessories, and other consumer items. Dollar Tree has gained 56.2% in the past year but declined 2.3% in the past week. It has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 15.5%.

Saskatoon, Canada-based Nutrien is a leading integrated provider of crop inputs and services. It supplies growers through its leading global Retail network and operates more than 2,000 retail locations across the United States, Canada, Australia and South America. The company plays an important role in helping farmers around the world increase food production in a sustainable manner. The stock has rallied 48.6% in the past year but traded flat in the past week. It has a Momentum Score of A.

2022-06-02 00:00:00+00:00,Big Lots Is In a Big Hole,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/big-lots-is-in-a-big-hole,,,"Discount stores have performed wonderfully in this period of rampant inflation, rising gas prices, and higher interest rates. As macroeconomic and geopolitical events put enormous pressure on consumers, they've been turning to deep discounters to stretch their dollars further.
That wasn't the case for the latest business update from Big Lots (NYSE: BIG), however, as the discount home furnishings retailer widely missed Wall Street sales and earnings expectations. Considering that some other mass merchandise discounters like Walmart and Target also badly missed expectations during a deteriorating economic climate, it may just be that this will be a period where only the truly deep discounters can thrive.

A big disappointment
Big Lots said net sales for the first quarter tumbled 15.4% to $1.37 billion as comparable-store sales collapsed 17% from the year-ago period. That led to a loss of $11.1 million, or $0.39 per share. Last year it had reported revenues of $1.63 billion and earnings of $2.62 per share, completely crushing analyst forecasts of $1.46 billion and $0.95 per share, respectively.
While the discounter said the quarter got off to a good start in February and March, things fell off in April as the business ""materially slowed"" because of inflation, supply chain issues, and consumers no longer having stimulus checks to spend on goods.
That stands in contrast to deep-discount chains like Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR), which faced similar circumstances yet blew away Wall Street expectations.
The difference is likely due to Dollar Tree's stores being focused on food and everyday essentials that allow penny-pinching consumers to get more bang for their discretionary buck. The dollar store has gone to great lengths to orient its businesses to focus on consumables that will draw in repeat customer traffic, which was evident in their numbers.
Dollar Tree saw sales climb 6% from last year as comps rose 4.4%, leading to a 48% gain in earnings per share.

A bummer of a year
Unfortunately for Big Lots, it doesn't see the situation improving anytime soon and will ""again lose money"" in the second quarter, although it is taking ""aggressive actions"" to reverse course in the back half of the year. It hopes there will be a significant improvement in the third quarter, and by the fourth quarter, it expects it will have returned to being in line with the year-ago results.
CEO Bruce Thorn said, ""We believe the slowdown was caused by the spending pressure our consumers felt from higher gas prices and broader inflation, which is affecting discretionary spending across the retail industry.""
Last year certainly was a tough comparison to go up against, as a populace generally freed from lockdown restrictions and in possession of stimulus checks, which economists now blame for the rampant inflation we're experiencing, went on a shopping spree.
Last year, Big Lots saw a 13% increase in sales, and profits nearly doubled from 2020. Same-store sales surged over 11% last year.
Compared to 2019 though, Big Lots sales were up 5% on a 1.5% gain in comps, though it did suffer a reversal from the $15.5 million in profits it generated back then. It's clear that the current environment is taking a toll.
Discounting the discounter
Big Lots stock still looks fairly rich for a company expecting near-term losses and flat performance for the year. Shares trade at 23 times trailing earnings, 18 times next year's estimates, and a lofty 45 times the free cash flow it produces.
Investors might want to wait until the stock of this discount retailer is a bit more discounted themselves before buying.

2022-06-02 00:00:00+00:00,Dollar Tree Stock: Benefiting from Inflation and Bracing for Recession,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-stock%3A-benefiting-from-inflation-and-bracing-for-recession,,,"Headquartered in Virginia, Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR) operates a chain of North American discount retail stores. I am bullish on the stock.
It was practically unimaginable just a year or two ago, but here we are: two consecutive months of 8%-or-higher annualized U.S. inflation, plus a GDP growth print that was just revised downward from an already dismal -1.4% to -1.5%. It's enough to convince some folks to avoid the stock market completely, out of fear that inflation will persist and a recession will engulf the economy.
Yet, you don't have to hide out in an all-cash position due to fears of an economic slowdown. Indeed, if inflation remains elevated, the value of your cash will dwindle. Thus, it makes sense to invest in businesses that could survive and even thrive when inflation is elevated and persistent.
When prices get high and pocketbooks get lean, shoppers turn to a particular discount retailer where they can stretch their dollars. At the same time, investors can look to this famous American store chain for a surprising bargain, and a potential bulwark against an economic hard landing.
On TipRanks, DLTR receives a Smart Score rating of 10 out of 10, indicating a high potential for the stock to outperform the broader market.
The Price is Right
Of course, we're talking about the one and only Dollar Tree, where discounts abound and, despite the store's name, the items typically sell for slightly more than a dollar. During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dollar Tree stock held up well compared to some other retail stocks, probably because shoppers flocked to Dollar Tree stores to load up on essential goods.
There might not be as much panic-buying today as there was in March of 2020, but Dollar Tree remains popular as a store where folks can get the most for their money. With a combination of generic and name brands on its shelves, Dollar Tree is like a mecca for sensible shoppers during inflationary times.
As for Dollar Tree stock, it's been wobbly in 2022 so far, but that's to be expected when recession fears are roiling the financial markets. Besides, value-focused investors should be glad to know that Dollar Tree has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 28.13, which is fairly reasonable.
Speaking of good value, in a conference call, Dollar Tree Executive Chairman Rick Dreiling emphasized the store's essential role for struggling Americans during amid ongoing economic challenges.
""In tough times, value retail can be part of the solution to help families stretch their dollars to meet their evolving needs. Dollar Tree and Family Dollar provide convenience as our 16,000-plus stores are located close to millions of households to live and work,"" Dreiling explained.
A Solid Start
So, now we can clearly see Dollar Tree's value proposition to its investors, as well as to the community when inflation strikes and recession looms. Does the company's financial data support a bullish stance on Dollar Tree now, though?
In light of the company's first quarter fiscal 2022 results, Dollar Tree President and CEO Michael Witynski asserted that his company ""delivered a solid start to the year."" Assuredly, there's no shortage of data points to back up Witynski's contention.
First, we can start with the company's top-line results. During Q1 of FY2022, Dollar Tree recorded $6.9 billion in consolidated net sales, up 6.5% year over year. Also, comparable same-store sales at Dollar Tree branded stores increased 11.2%. Plus, Dollar Tree's quarterly gross margin improved 360 basis points year over year, to 33.9%.
Next, we'll turn to the quarterly bottom-line results, which were also impressive. As it turned out, Dollar Tree reported a 19.2% increase in gross profit to $2.34 billion, as well as a 43.2% rise in net income to $536.4 million. On top of all that, Dollar Tree's quarterly diluted earnings per share of $2.37 represented a 48.1% year-over-year increase as well as a company record.
No doubt about it: Witynski was fully justified in saying that Dollar Tree is off to a ""solid start"" in 2022. Moreover, the company's full FY2022 outlook is optimistic as Dollar Tree guided for diluted earnings per share in the range of $7.80 to $8.20. Furthermore, the company raised its full-year guidance for consolidated net sales to a range of $27.76 billion to $28.14 billion.
Dollar Tree's sense of optimism evidently spilled over into Witynski's commentary as he emphasized the company's ""unique and resilient business model"" as well as Dollar Tree's ""earnings power and momentum"" during the conference call. Only time will tell, but it certainly appears that the company should be able to maintain its resilience and momentum in the coming quarters.
Wall Street’s Take
According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus, DLTR is a Strong Buy, based on 11 Buy and three Hold ratings, and one Sell rating. The average Dollar Tree price target is $174.39, implying 8.31% upside potential.
The Takeaway
When economic conditions tighten, Dollar Tree stores can be a place to lighten your financial burden. Similarly, Dollar Tree stock offers good value for cost-conscious investors.
Witynski sounds confident in Dollar Tree's ability to execute throughout the year, but there are data points to support his optimism. So, for a prime bargain and a potential winner when inflation and recession threaten the economy, feel free to go shopping for some shares of Dollar Tree.

2022-06-01 00:00:00+00:00,Got $400? Here Are 3 Stocks to Buy,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/got-%24400-here-are-3-stocks-to-buy,,,"This year has not been kind to stocks -- the S&P 500 is down 13% so far and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is off almost 9%. Tech stocks are doing even worse because they got routed beginning last November, causing the Nasdaq 100 to lose over 23% of its value.
While that puts the tech-heavy index into bear market territory already, with the Federal Reserve looking to tame inflation by aggressively hiking interest rates, the more widely followed indexes could tumble even lower. In fact, investors should probably count on it happening. Market corrections and crashes are part of the investing cycle.
That doesn't mean you should pull your money out of the market and stick it under a mattress. Bear markets are actually a great time to go shopping, as all the stocks you wanted to buy but thought too expensive are suddenly affordable. At the same time, don't try to wait for the bottom; you'll never find it.

The smartest strategy for investors is to be regularly adding money to their portfolios all the time and buying good businesses to own long term. Although you might not get the precise lowest price for the stock, hardly anyone ever does, and for those who do, it's more likely by chance than planning.
With that in mind, if you have $400 to put to work in thestock market today here are three stocks you may want to buy and hold on to for the long haul.
Image source: Destination XL.
1. Destination XL Group
Unlike much of the rest of the retail industry, men's big-and-tall clothing chain Destination XL Group (NASDAQ: DXLG) is seeing strong sales growth despite consumer concerns about a recession. In its recent first-quarter report, sales were up 15% from last year and 13% above 2019. Profits were also 54% above the year-ago period and a complete U-turn from the loss recorded three years ago.
It was during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 that Destination XL had to delist from the Nasdaq exchange because its stock had plunged after its stores were forced to close. It subsequently relisted, and business has been booming, with the retailer reporting five consecutive quarters of rising sales and profits.
The stock is still down 22% year to date, but with shares trading at 5 times trailing earnings, 7 times next year's estimates, and just a fraction of its sales, Destination XL is a bargain at these levels. With Wall Street forecasting that earnings will grow 15% annually for the next five years, it makes the apparel retailer a good, long-term buy.

2. Dollar Tree
Deep discount chain Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) is a retailer that's primed to benefit from a recession because its business is designed to help consumers stretch their wallets. It also just reported earnings that showed customers responding to its value proposition.
First-quarter sales jumped 6% from last year while profits rocketed 47% higher and handily beat analyst expectations. It wasn't that long ago that Dollar Tree found it necessary to broadly raise its prices so that it was no longer a pure-play ""dollar store,"" but by keeping most prices at the $1.25 range and adding in a wider selection of goods in the $2 and $3 range, it was able to increase the quality and number of name-brand products it was able to carry.
As economic concerns have grown, so has Dollar Tree's stock, which is up 17% in 2022. It's nearly doubled from the low point hit last September. Yet even though it's not the bargain-basement stock the others on this list represent, this retail stock has plenty more room to grow, especially if the economy sours further.
Image source: Dutch Bros.
3. Dutch Bros
Drive-thru coffee shop Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) was hurt by rising commodity costs, particularly dairy, which rose 25% in the first quarter and accounts for 28% of its commodity expenses.
Even so, revenue was up 54% for the period, and comps were up 6% year over year, while it remains profitable on an adjusted basis. The coffee chain is growing faster than rival Starbucks, and it's in the early stages of expansion.
Dutch Bros has 572 stores in 12 states, giving it significant room for more growth, and it plans to open as many as 130 locations this year, five more than originally planned. It reiterated its guidance for full-year revenue of $700 million to $715 million, and though inflation will weigh on profitability, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) is expected to be $90 million, 10% above last year and 30% higher than two years ago.
However, analysts forecast revenue to triple over the next five years, and Dutch Bros. should be regularly reporting profits on a GAAP basis. This fast-growing coffee stock could just be the jolt your portfolio needs in the years to come.

Image source: Getty Images.
Winner winner chicken dinners
Shares of Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) and United Therapeutics (NASDAQ: UTHR) beat the daylights out of the broad market last week, rallying 29% and 25%, respectively. This bullishness isn't exactly unusual for these two tickers either. While the Nasdaq itself is down 22.8% year to date, United Therapeutics is up 6.6% for the year, and higher by 37% for the past three months. Meanwhile, Dollar Tree shares are 14.2% higher than where they ended 2021.
For Dollar Tree, investors are celebrating the fact that the inflation bug has not seemingly bitten the retailer like it has many of its rivals (including Walmart). In fact, it appears to be benefiting the discounter. The company -- which is also parent company to Family Dollar stores -- turned $6.9 billion in revenue into per-share earnings of $2.31 during the three-month stretch ending in April, up and 6.5% and 48%, respectively.
Better still, those results topped consensus sales estimates of $6.76 billion and for a bottom line of $2 per share. Same-store sales were up 4.4%. The company's previously released 2022 operating profit guidance of between $7.60 and $8 per share was also reaffirmed as part of Dollar Tree's quarterly report. For perspective, Dollar Tree earned $5.80 per share in 2021.
In short, higher prices aren't causing consumers to tighten their purse strings -- at least not yet. Inflation is, however, prompting people to shop where they're getting the most bang for their buck.
As for United Therapeutics, most of its recent bullishness can be attributed to last week's FDA approval of its inhalation powder treprostinil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Treprostinil, which will be marketed as Tyvaso DPI, will compete with Liquidia's injectable version of the now-generic drug for a piece of the pulmonary arterial hypertension market that's estimated to be worth on the order of $5 billion per year now, according to Global Market Insights, but could be worth closer to $10 billion within the next five years.
Although last week's announcement that the FDA is green-lighting treprostinil clearly boosted the stock, note that United Therapeutics' shares have been climbing for the better part of the past couple of years as investors have been pricing in increasingly compelling odds of such an approval.
Be patient, but not stingy
It's tricky. Most investors innately know a stock's past performance is no guarantee of future results. And in this case, there's a strong argument to be made that any potential bullishness has already been used up; there may or may not be any upside left to tap.
Take a step back and look at both bigger pictures again in their entirety, though. While it is true that both of these stocks may be a bit overbought and ripe for a little profit-taking in the very near term, both companies now sport attractive fundamentals in their own way. Dollar Tree is taming the inflation beast that's proven problematic for so many other retailers, while already-profitable biopharma outfit United Therapeutics now has another revenue-bearing product to add to its portfolio. Any decent pullback from either stock is a buying opportunity for investors who are on the fence with either name.
Just don't wait too long if you're holding out for a lower price. At less than 13 times its trailing earnings, United Therapeutics is already bargain-priced, and Dollar Tree shares aren't exactly expensive, trading at less than 20 times this year's expected profits.

2022-06-01 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks to Buy During a Recession,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-buy-during-a-recession-3,,,"It only seems as if all stocks have been trending downward this year. Yet, there are stocks that always seem to do well when there's a recession -- or even a threat of one.
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), and Flowers Foods (NYSE: FLO) thrived during the last recession, from December of 2007 to June of 2009, and all three are faring well so far this year. That's because they all have a common thread; they provide something that people need, regardless of the economy.
Dollar Tree helps people stretch their money by selling low-cost variety items. Flowers Foods is benefiting because the same trends that led people to cook at home during the pandemic are carrying over -- meaning people see they can save money by buying Flowers' products and eating at home. Johnson & Johnson is a huge healthcare company, and people always need its products, including during tough times.

1. Dollar Tree: Money in the bank
Chances are you have shopped at one of Dollar Tree's discount variety stores or know someone who has. It operates 15,500 stores in the U.S. and Canada under the brands Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.
During the last recession, the S&P 500 index dropped 25.1%; Dollar Tree saw its shares rise 46.9%. Though we're not officially in a recession, the market downturn has sent the S&P 500 downward by 12.8% this year while Dollar Tree is up 17.4%.
DLTR data by YCharts.
The company reported its first-quarter 2022 numbers last week, and they were eye-opening. Revenue was up a reported 6.5% to $6.9 billion and diluted earnings per share (EPS) were up 48.1% to a first-quarter company record of $2.37.
Dollar Tree has increased its gross profit margin 360 basis points to 33.9% during inflationary times by raising its typical price point from $1 to $1.25. It also tightened its supply chain and opened 112 new stores in the quarter while expanding or relocating 33 others and closing 30 stores.
In March, the company said it expected yearly EPS of between $7.60 and $8; then in the first-quarter report, it boosted that estimate to between $7.80 and $8.20. It also boosted expected revenue to between $27.8 billion and $28.1 billion, up from $27.2 billion to $27.9 billion.
Johnson & Johnson: Too big to fail
Johnson & Johnson is a favorite of value investors because it has increased revenue for six consecutive years and EPS for four consecutive years and raised its dividend for 60 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King. It is a huge company with more than 144,000 employees, and despite talcum powder- and opioid-related lawsuits of recent years, continues to navigate forward.
The company's most recent dividend raise was 6.6% to $1.13 per quarter, giving it a yield of 2.5%. Its cash dividend payout ratio is an easily sustainable 56.6%, especially given its strong cash flows.
The shares are up more than 5% so far this year, and that shouldn't be a surprise. During the 2007-2009 recession, its shares did fall 16.2%, but that was still better than the 37.9% drop for the S&P 500. And the stock bounced back quickly both from that recession and the short down period at the beginning of the pandemic.
The company operates in three segments: consumer health, pharmaceuticals, and medtech. The first segment is the only one of the three that didn't see a revenue gain in the first quarter, and the company plans to spin off that segment by November of 2023.
In the first quarter, Johnson & Johnson reported revenue of $23.4 billion, up 5% year over year. EPS declined 16.8% vs. the same period in 2021, but gross profit was listed at $15.8 billion, up 3.7%. The company said it expects yearly EPS between $10.60 and $10.80, showing a gain between 8.2% and 10.2%, and yearly revenue somewhere between $94.8 billion and $95.8 billion, for a gain between 3.8% and 4.8% over last year.
Flowers Foods manages to rise to the occasion
Flowers Foods is another company that should be familiar, if only because of its brands of baked goods, which include Tastykake and the bread brands Wonder, Nature's Own, and Sunbeam, among others.
As a consumer staples company, Flowers Foods is as stable as they come. So far this year, its stock is down less than 1%. During the 2007-2009 recession, its shares lost only about 6%. There's a reason its stock doesn't take big nosedives; when times are hard, people still have to eat, and its baked goods and breads are a big part of our diet.
Flowers has something that sets it apart from many companies: a dividend that has grown for 20 consecutive years. The company raised its quarterly dividend this year by 4.8% to $0.22, giving it a yield of 3.22%, more than two times the S&P 500 average dividend yield of 1.37%. The payout is a bit high at 82%, based on trailing 12-month earnings, but based on expected cash flow, it's a much more reasonable 41%. The company also helps investors by regularly repurchasing shares, and has a plan this year to buy back $25.4 million worth of its stock.
The company has managed to deal with inflationary pressures by raising prices. In the first quarter, it reported revenue of $1.4 billion, up 10.3% year over year. Net income was listed at $85.6 million, up 19.4% over the same period in 2021, and its EPS of $0.40 was up from $0.34 in the first quarter of 2021.
Flowers also upgraded its 2022 guidance for annual revenue to land between $4.764 billion and $4.850 billion, which represents a gain of between 10% and 12%. It did downgrade its adjusted EPS to a range of $1.20 to $1.30, compared to earlier guidance of between $1.25 and $1.35, citing adjustments for inflation and supply chain issues.
All good choices
All three of these companies have proved to be solid choices in a recession and have advantages that others might not have during downturns. Dollar Tree and Flowers Foods are set up to thrive in recessions because they are the type of businesses people turn to in order to save on necessary daily items. Johnson & Johnson doesn't benefit per se from recessions, but its huge size and healthcare items, whether pharmaceutical goods or medtech devices such as knee replacements or lenses for cataract surgery, are the types of products that aren't really optional.
Flowers Foods and Johnson & Johnson have one advantage over Dollar Tree in that both companies offer above-average dividends with a history of raises. That gives long-term investors a little peace of mind to wait out recessions, knowing the stocks provide strong total returns. All three companies have similar price-to-earnings ratios running from a high of 26 for Flowers Foods to 25 for Dollar Tree and 24 for Johnson & Johnson.

Wall Street is becoming increasingly concerned about a recession. According to Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, there is “probably a 30% chance of a recession as you look forward to the next 12 to 24 months.” 
We are also starting to see a slowdown in the housing market with new home sales dropping by 16.6% which was worse than expected. The ISM New Orders Index has also weakened from above 60 at the start of the year to 53.5 in April. There is also weakness developing in cyclical stocks such as trucking, consumer discretionary, and big-box retailers as investors are increasingly concerned about growth.
The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for June 2022
Even in a recession, investors can find pockets of outperformance with the right strategies. For investors who believe that a recession is likely, here are 3 stocks to buy:
JNJ Johnson & Johnson $178.79
EZPW EZCORP $7.69
DLTR Dollar Tree $160.66
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
Source: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.com
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the world’s leading healthcare companies. It operates through 3 divisions: pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer products divisions with approximately 250 subsidiaries. This gives investors broad exposure to the healthcare industry and sufficient diversification to withstand issues at any one unit. It also has one of the largest research and development budgets in the pharmaceutical industry and is aggressive with M&A.
This is also what makes the stock an ideal selection for more adverse economic conditions. Healthcare revenues are disconnected from economic growth which means that it’s a place of safety for investors while the rest of the market sees increasing volatility. Additionally, its massive balance sheet and dividend payments become more enticing in this scenario.
On the operations side, JNJ continues to perform well. This year, the stock is expected to earn $9.80 per share which is expected to slowly increase to $10.24 and $10.93 per share over the next 2 years. Its valuation is also compelling with a forward P/E of 16.7 and a 2.5% dividend yield. The company also has nearly $35 billion in cash for acquisitions or buybacks.
In terms of the POWR Ratings, JNJ is rated an A which translates to a Strong Buy. This is due to its consistent track record of growth, successful drug development, and strong balance sheet. In terms of component grades, JNJ stands out with an A for Stability and a B for Quality. Click here to see more of JNJ’s POWR Ratings.   
EZCORP (EZPW)

EZCORP (NASDAQ:EZPW) owns and operates pawn shops in the United States and Latin America. It offers loans collateralized by possessions or property and also sells pre-owned merchandise. As of September 2021, the company had 516 stores in the US, 508 in Mexico, and 124 in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. 
This is the type of business that does well when consumers are feeling more financial pressure which is certainly the case with rising inflation that is being exacerbated by a potential growth scare for the economy. And, inflation is most hurtful for the type of consumer who makes up EZPW’s customer base as it’s concentrated in food, energy, and rents that is offsetting any wage gains.
The company’s fortunes did take a hit during the pandemic but revenues are now above pre-pandemic levels. Further, the company was able to use this period to trim costs and operating margins. Wall Street analysts are forecasting that this will lead to 61% earnings growth in 2022, while revenues are expected to rise 16%.
Despite these growth expectations, the stock is quite cheap with a forward P/E of 8.9 which is almost half of the S&P 500. With such a strong growth and value profile, it’s not surprising that EZPW is rated a B which translates to a Buy.

Dollar Tree (DLTR)
Source: shutterstock.com/Jonathan Weiss
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) is headquartered in Chesapeake, VA, and was founded over 60 years ago as a variety store in Norfolk, Virginia. Today, the company operates about 15,500 stores in the US and Canada with nearly 200,000 employees. In addition to Dollar Tree, it also owns Family Dollar which it purchased for $8.5 billion. 
Dollar stores have experienced incredible growth over the last couple of decades in part due to their low-cost, no-frills offerings which attract bargain-hunting and budget-conscious customers. As a result, DLTR continues to aggressively expand. Last year, it added 600 new stores and expects to add a similar amount this year. 
Macroeconomic factors have also been supportive as retailers catering to the middle-class have struggled while those focusing on the higher or lower-end have thrived. Of course, the recent combination of inflation, coupled with an economy potentially rolling over, could lead to an increase in revenue for DLTR.
So, it’s not surprising that analysts are forecasting 38% EPS growth and 6% revenue growth this year. Despite this growth potential and favorable macro environment, the stock remains reasonably priced with a forward P/E of 15.0 which is cheaper than the S&P 500. 
In terms of the POWR Ratings, DLTR is rated a B which equates to a Buy. It’s part of the A-rated Grocery/Big Box Retailers which is the 2nd best industry group according to the POWR Ratings. DLTR also has a B for Growth due to expectations for continued earnings growth, unlike many companies who are forecasting a drop in earnings. Click here to see DLTR’s full POWR Ratings.

2022-05-31 00:00:00+00:00,5 Stocks in S&P 500 ETF That Led the Rally Last Week,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-stocks-in-sp-500-etf-that-led-the-rally-last-week,,,"The S&P 500 logged in its best week of the year, jumping 6.5% and wiping out its losses in May, thanks to a slew of upbeat earnings results and an encouraging economic data. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has plunged about 12.3%.

While most of the stocks in SPY’s portfolio have risen, we have highlighted five stocks from various corners of the market that have gained in double digits last week. These include Dollar Tree DLTR, DXC Technology Company DXC, Constellation Energy Corporation CEG, AutoZone Inc. AZO and Generac Holdings GNRC. All these stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold).

The gains came basically in the last two days of the week as strong retail earnings and a slowing inflation report lifted investors’ sentiment. Notably, robust earnings from Ulta Beauty ULTA and Gap GPS infused optimism into the retail sector. Meanwhile, an inflation gauge closely tracked by the Federal Reserve rose 6.3% year over year in April, just below a four-decade high set in March and the first slowdown since November 2020.

Further, the Fed minutes rekindled some interest in the stock market as there were no surprises. The minutes showed that the central bank will continue raising interest rates by a half-percentage point each in June and July to combat surging inflation and to avoid an economic downturn (read: Fed Minutes Rekindle Optimism: 5 ETFs That Surged the Most).

Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust has AUM of $365.5 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year.

2022-05-30 00:00:00+00:00,Wall Street's Best Week Since Nov 2020: 5 Best ETF Areas,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-streets-best-week-since-nov-2020%3A-5-best-etf-areas,,,"Wall Street ended its seven-week losing streak last week. The S&P 500 recorded its best week since November 2020. The S&P 500 was up 6.6% last week while the Nasdaq Composite was off 6.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, which saw its first eight-week losing streak since 1923 in the week ending May 20, advanced 6.2% last week. Small-cap index Russell 2000 gained 6.9%.
Earnings results from several retailers also rekindled bullishness among investors. Macy’s M shares were up 19.3% on May 26 on the lifted guidance for the 2022 profit levels. Dollar Tree DLTR also rose 21.9% on an earnings beat. Another dollar store Dollar General DG also gained 17.5% last week following consumers’ inclination for shopping at dollar stores amid high inflation. Retailer Nordstrom JWN jumped 24% last week due to an earnings beat.
Airlines including JetBlue JBLU and Southwest LUV upped their sales guidance for the current quarter, suggesting upbeat demand discretionary travel. The Memorial Day weekend and the related uptick in discretionary spending also contributed to the market rally last week.
Adding to the upbeat scenario is the decline in the initial jobless claims for the week ended May 21. The same came in at 210,000, declining from the previous week’s reading of 218,000, per a CNBC article. Also, certain U.S. economic data releases have been encouraging so far.
The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production increased 1.1% last month, well above the consensus estimate of 0.5%. Headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 6.3% in April over last year compared to March's 6.6% increase, and core PCE rose by 4.9% compared with 5.2% in the prior month.
Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, believes that U.S. consumer spending is relatively strong. In this regard, she mentioned that the data releases last week “suggest the economy is slowing, and the Fed appears poised to raise rates at a 50 basic point clip over the next two months. But the notion that the consumer, 70 percent of the U.S. economy, is on a spending strike, is overblown as earnings reports coupled with positive guidance indicate otherwise”, as stated in a CNBC article.
Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few ETF areas that topped the list last week.
Energy
S&P Oil & Gas Exploration Bull 3X Direxion GUSH – Up 30.9%
Microsectors Oil & Gas Exp. & Prod. 3X Leveraged (OILU) – Up 29.3%

2022-05-28 00:00:00+00:00,Why Dollar Tree Soared 29% This Week,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-dollar-tree-soared-29-this-week,,,"What happened
Shares of Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) soared 29% this week compared to where they closed on Friday, May 20 after the company reported first-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines.
Revenue of $6.9 billion was 6% above last year's $6.5 billion performance and ahead of analyst forecasts for $6.8 billion. The deep-discount chain generated adjusted earnings of $2.37 per share, handily topping consensus expectations for $2 per share as well as outstripping the year-ago result of $1.61 per share.

So what
It shouldn't be surprising that during a time when inflation is at its highest point in over 40 years, gas prices are at record levels, interest rates are rising, and consumers have less money to spend that they would turn to a deep discounter like Dollar Tree to help stretch their budgets.
The retailer's executive chairman Rick Dreiling told analysts: ""We are in the midst of a very challenging time for consumers as many are living paycheck to paycheck. ... In tough times, value retail can be part of the solution to help families stretch their dollars to meet their evolving needs.""
Dollar Tree owns not only its namesake stores, but also the Family Dollar banner. Among the many initiatives it has launched over the past few years -- all of which President and CEO Michael Witynski says are working -- are combination stores that are half Dollar Tree, half Family Dollar, which give consumers a variety of price points and product selection.
Ever since Dollar Tree ""broke the buck"" and began selling items above the $1 threshold that made it unique among the so-called dollar stores, consumers have responded positively to the broader selection of better quality and name brand goods.
Now what
It's not all blue skies and green grass for the discounter, because along with consumers, retailers are also experiencing higher costs. Diesel fuel, for example, severely impacts trucking companies delivering goods to the stores.
Where the average cost of regular gas is $4.60 per gallon, the average cost of a gallon of diesel fuel is $5.53. Dollar Tree expects cost pressures on domestic freight will continue to rise and it has increased its full-year expense forecast as a result. CFO Kevin Wampler noted that a $1 increase in the cost of a gallon of diesel fuel results in a $63 million headwind for Dollar Tree on an annualized basis. One year ago diesel fuel cost $3.18 per gallon; in 2020, it was $2.39 per gallon.
Dollar Tree, however, has still raised its outlook for the year, increasing its earnings guidance to a range of $7.80 per share to $8.20 per share, from $7.60 per share to $8 per share.

2022-05-27 00:00:00+00:00,Surging Markets Meant to Last?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/surging-markets-meant-to-last,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Yesterday, we saw a bit of a rally after a decline for eight consecutive weeks.
CNBC says, “The Dow and S&P 500 are up 4% and 3%, respectively, for the week. The Nasdaq is also up 2%. The Dow has also posted gains in the last four sessions.”
We could be seeing this surge for a few reasons: It could be a result the Federal Reserve’s minutes released from its last meeting, plus the first-quarter GDP report revision, both released Wednesday.
While we expected positive inflation data that might boost the market, we should be wary of the upward trend rather than jump at the first sign of a clearing storm.
And just this morning, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report for April 2022 was released – the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge.
We saw that, from a year ago, the PCE rose 4.9% but this number excludes volatile food and energy prices that have been a major contributor to inflation running around a 40-year peak. Including food and energy, the PCE increased 6.3% in April. These are still-elevated levels that nonetheless indicate that price pressures could be easing a bit.
A True Bounce or a Bear Trap
The S&P 500 is bouncing off of the support range (where buyers have previously showed up to reverse the downward pressure) just above the key threshold where we would officially dip into bear-market territory. Remember, just last Friday the S&P 500 dropped below 20% in value from recent highs into bear-market territory with intraday trading and have been rallying ever since.
Now, there are a couple of things going on here and one of these things is dip buying. This has been a common theme to see in 2022 as the S&P 500 has been pulling back this year, we see traders coming in and buying. This has yet to be successful as when they come in and buy the dips, it has gone up a little bit just to drop to lower lows. And the question is, will this time be different?
Are we going to be able to break up and through this down trending resistance level or are we eventually going to break down and through this horizontal support level? Be sure to check out last night’s livestream as we look more into what is helping to boost the S&P 500 higher or if this is just a bear trap.
Good News for the Retail Sector
We have already pointed out that despite the negative reaction to retail reports over the last two weeks, consumers are still spending, which increases the chances for a continued market rally later this summer.
Thursday’s data from Macy’s (NYSE:M) and upgraded forecasts from Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) and Dollar General (NYSE:DG) back up our view of the market. Consumers are not only spending on discount goods, but also on high-end products. Investors are using the news as an excuse to accumulate shares.
On the surface, this looks good, and it is certainly better than the alternative. However, we still urge caution. We don’t think this is the end of inflation-based volatility in the short term, so we aren’t going to recommend adding anything to the portfolio yet.
Did you catch our Monday livestream? We kicked off this week by examining which factors combine to push stocks higher after a big drop. (Hint: It has something to do with positive economic indicators and trader sentiment.)
While it may be premature to view these factors as an end to the bear market, we laid out a few scenarios that look promising. Click here to catch the recap.

2022-05-27 00:00:00+00:00,Join the Wall Street's Rebound Rally With These ETFs,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/join-the-wall-streets-rebound-rally-with-these-etfs,,,"Wall Street looks set to end the losing streak this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, which saw its first eight-week losing streak since 1923 in the week ending May 20, has been up 4.4% so far this week. The other two broad-market indices, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite, which witnessed their seven-week lean patch last week, have also gained 4% and 3.4% each so far this week.
Part of this rally can be attributed to investors lobbying to witness a peak in the inflation levels. Moreover, the recently released Fed minutes from the May 3-4 meeting buoyed some optimism among the market participants as there was no element of surprise. The minutes highlighted that the central bank officials are ready to move ahead with several 50-basis point interest rate hikes to control the red-hot inflation readings.
Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, believes that the U.S. consumer spending is relatively strong. In this regard, she mentioned that “To be sure, the data releases this week suggest the economy is slowing, and the Fed appears poised to raise rates at a 50 basic point clip over the next two months. But the notion that the consumer, 70 percent of the U.S. economy, is on a spending strike, is overblown as earnings reports coupled with positive guidance indicate otherwise”, as stated in a CNBC article.
Several retail earnings also rekindled bullishness among investors. Macy’s M shares were up 19.3% on May 26 on the lifted guidance for 2022 profit levels. Dollar Tree DLTR also rose 21.9% on an earnings beat.
Adding to the upbeat scenario is the decline in the initial jobless claims for the week ended May 21. The same came in at 210,000, declining from the previous week’s reading of 218,000, per a CNBC article.
Also, certain U.S. economic data releases have been encouraging so far. The Department of Commerce reported that retail sales in April were up 0.9% month over month, below the consensus estimate of 1%. Year over year, retail sales grew 8.2% in April. The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production increased 1.1% last month, well above the consensus estimate of 0.5%.

Dell Gains Following Strong Quarterly Performance; Sees Record First Fiscal Quarter
Dell (NYSE: DELL) seems to be gaining momentum in thestock market todayfollowing its latest earnings release. After yesterday’s closing bell, the company reported stellar figures across the board in its first fiscal quarter report. According to the press release, Dell’s quarterly earnings per share is $1.84. Moreover, the company’s total revenue for the quarter is $26.1 billion. For comparison, consensus figures on Wall Street are earnings of $1.39 a share on revenue of $25.23 billion. As a result of the noticeable earnings beat, DELL stock would be in the spotlight today. Not to mention, with the recent weakness amongst tech stocks in general, long-term investors could be eyeing the company’s shares now.
Overall, according to Dell, the company posted record figures in terms of first-quarter revenue, operating income, and diluted earnings per share. Also worth mentioning, the company’s operating income is up by over 57% year-over-year.  Speaking on this further is co-CCO Chuck Whitten. He starts by saying “Our first quarter – with record Q1 revenue, operating income and diluted EPS – demonstrates the benefits of having a strong, geographically and sector-diverse business covering the edge to the core data center to the cloud.” Whitten also adds that the adaptability of Dell’s operations positions the company to “pursue growth wherever it materializes in the IT market.”
On top of that, CFO Tom Sweet also added that Dell returned $1.75 billion via share repurchases and dividends throughout the quarter. In the larger scheme of things, it seems like Dell continues to kick into high gear. This would be crucial as the company continues to adapt its offerings to shifting enterprise IT needs. With all this in mind, investors would be looking at DELL stock now.
