Those worries sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) lower again on Friday, extending the correction still further.

Even though the markets were down, investors focused on some success stories. The kinds of stocks they looked at, though, revealed some of the thought process that the investing community seems to be moving toward. Here we'll look more closely at why Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) and Matson (NYSE: MATX) both moved higher significantly on Friday.
Money grows at Dollar Tree
Shares of Dollar Tree finished up more than 5% on Friday. The dollar store retailer made an upper level management move that gave investors a signal that some more drastic changes might be coming to the company in the near future.
Executive board Chair Bob Sasser announced that he will retire from his position. The move will happen before Dollar Tree's 2022 shareholder meeting, according to the release. The 70-year-old Sasser will retain the honorary title of chairman emeritus after retiring.
Sasser has worked with Dollar Tree for more than 20 years, including leading the company as CEO from 2003 to 2017. In his time with the company, Dollar Tree's size has grown more than tenfold using several key metrics, including store count, size of its workforce, annual revenue, and market capitalization of its stock.
It might seem odd for the departure of such a prominent player in Dollar Tree's success to prompt an upward move in the stock price. However, traders are speculating that the activist investors who have focused on Dollar Tree might now have more of a free hand to suggest more sweeping changes at Dollar Tree. If those moves prove to be shareholder-friendly, then it could push the dollar store stock price back to all-time highs and then some.

Matson ships it
Meanwhile, shares of marine shipping company Matson were higher by 11% on Friday. Favorable financial results on Thursday evening helped lift the Hawaii-based company, and better times ahead could continue to lift the stock.
Matson's fourth-quarter financial report was positively stellar. Operating revenue jumped more than 80% year over year to $1.27 billion, wrapping up a year with a 65% rise in operating sales compared to 2020 levels. Net income soared more than four times from year-earlier levels in the fourth quarter, with earnings coming in at $9.39 per share.
Supply chain issues are helping Matson dramatically. Its service to China is an important element of its ocean transportation segment, with elevated demand for expedited service helping to boost sales. Meanwhile, Matson is also seeing hefty volume in its domestic trade, and its logistics business is benefiting from inventory restocking efforts and strong supply and demand dynamics in its core markets.
Even after today's jump, Matson's stock price remains below $100 per share. That puts a ridiculously low earnings multiple on the stock that clearly anticipates supply chain disruptions putting a big crimp in Matson's bottom line going forward. Even if earnings do fall, the question is whether they'll fall so much as to justify making the stock look like an attractive value right now.

2022-02-17 00:00:00+00:00,"Walmart (WMT) Beats Q4 Earnings Estimates, Hikes Dividend",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/walmart-wmt-beats-q4-earnings-estimates-hikes-dividend,,,"Walmart Inc. WMT reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and the bottom lines advanced year over year and surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company continued to increase its share in the U.S. grocery market. The company’s solid efforts to enhance the e-commerce game have been helping it stay firm against the growing competition.

Walmart concluded fiscal 2022 on a strong note, with impressive momentum in all three segments. WMT performed well amid escalated supply-chain costs as well as pandemic-related hurdles. Encouragingly, management unveiled a hike in its annual dividend.
Quarter in Detail
Walmart’s adjusted earnings of $1.53 per share rose 10.1% from the year-ago period’s figure of $1.39 and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50. Total revenues of $152.9 billion grew 0.5% and beat the consensus mark of $151.4 billion. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, total revenues climbed 0.6% to $153 billion. Revenues were hurt to the tune of about $10.2 billion related to divestitures.
Walmart Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Walmart Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Walmart Inc. Quote
Consolidated gross profit margin expanded 10 basis points (bps) to 23.8%. Management remains focused on competitive pricing globally. The gross margin at Walmart U.S. grew 54 bps due to efficient price management and a mix, somewhat countered by high supply-chain costs that came in at more than $400 million.

Adjusted operating income at cc rose 6.2% to $6 billion. However, the metric was adversely impacted by divestitures to the tune of about 60 bps. Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales remained flat year over year. This reflects robust sales growth and a decline in expenses for COVID-19, offset by investments in wages.

Segment Details
Walmart U.S.: The segment’s net sales grew 5.7% to $105.3 billion in the reported quarter. U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, improved 5.6% due to a 3.1% rise in transactions and a 2.4% increase in the average ticket. Comp sales represented robust underlying business trends, led by in-store traffic and aided by sturdy consumer spending and robust holiday season sales. Comp sales grew across the general merchandise, grocery and health & wellness categories. The segment saw an increased market share in grocery.

E-commerce negatively impacted comps by 80 bps. E-commerce sales in the segment rose 1%. On a two-year stack basis, e-commerce sales surged 70%. As of the fourth quarter, Walmart U.S. had 4,600 pickup locations and 3,500 same-day delivery stores. The company remodeled more than 140 stores during the reported quarter. Adjusted operating income at the Walmart U.S. segment grew 0.3% to $5.2 billion.

Walmart International: The segment’s net sales fell 22.6% to $27 billion. Divestitures hurt the segment’s net sales by $10.1 billion. On a cc basis, net sales dropped 22.1% to $27.2 billion. The strength in Flipkart, Mexico and China was an upside. Adjusted operating income, on a cc basis, slumped 12% to $0.8 billion.

Sam’s Club: The segment, which comprises membership warehouse clubs, witnessed a net sales increase of 16.5% to $19.2 billion. Sam’s Club comp sales, excluding fuel, grew 10.4%. While transactions grew 7%, the average ticket rose 3.2%. Comp sales saw broad-based strength across categories, mainly led by food. However, tobacco hurt comp sales.

Membership income climbed 9.1% in the quarter, reflecting solid membership trends, with a record total member count. The plus penetration rate also ascended and reached an all-time high. E-commerce fueled comps by 100 bps. E-commerce net sales jumped 21% at Sam’s Club on a robust direct-to-home show and solid curbside performance. The segment’s operating income came in at $0.5 billion, up 41.1% year over year.
Other Financial Updates & Developments
Walmart ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $14.8 billion, long-term debt of $34.9 billion and total equity of $91.9 billion. In fiscal 2022, WMT generated operating cash flow of $24.2 billion and incurred capital expenditures of $13.1 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $11.1 billion.

The company allocated $6.2 billion for dividend payouts and $9.8 billion for share buybacks during the fiscal. In a separate release, Walmart raised its annual dividend by about 2%, taking it to $2.24 per share for fiscal 2023. This marks the company’s 49th straight annual dividend hike.
Guidance
Walmart issued its view for fiscal 2023. The company expects consolidated net sales growth of nearly 3% at cc. Excluding divestitures, the metric is likely to grow nearly 4%.

U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, are likely to be more than 3%.

Consolidated operating income is expected to grow nearly 3% at cc and at a greater rate than net sales on excluding divestitures. Management envisions earnings per share (EPS) growth in the mid-single digit range. Excluding divestitures, it is expected to rise 5-6%.

2022-02-16 00:00:00+00:00,Kohl's (KSS) Fuels Growth: Adds 400 New Sephora Locations,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/kohls-kss-fuels-growth%3A-adds-400-new-sephora-locations,,,"Kohl's Corporation KSS unveiled plans to add another 400 Sephora at Kohl’s shops after seeing the success in the first 200 stores. This takes the total of Sephora at Kohl’s locations to 600, which keeps the alliance between the two companies on track to achieving their goal of 850 stores by 2023. This is likely to further enhance customers’ experiences at Kohl’s stores.

Apart from this, Sephora at Kohl’s announced plans to add six new prestige beauty brands to its wide product range this spring season. These brands, which include Murad, Clarins, Jack Black, Living Proof, Versace and Voluspa, will bolster Sephora at Kohl’s existing solid portfolio that comprises renowned brands like Rare Beauty, NARS, Charlotte Tilbury, Kiehl’s, Giorgio Armani, Olaplex, Clinique and Sephora Collection.

These efforts reflect KSS’ constant efforts to strengthen the business alongside enhancing customers’ experiences by offering them more beauty products at more locations. Kohl’s launch of Sephora on its digital platform has also been receiving a favorable customer response.

Growth-Oriented Efforts
Kohl’s has been benefiting from its strong alliances. The company has been strengthening its ties with the retail giant, Amazon, to drive traffic. Incidentally, the company has been gaining on the rollout of its Amazon returns program nationwide. According to this program, Kohl’s stores accept free, unpackaged and easy returns for Amazon customers.

Apart from this, Kohl’s has been benefiting from its growing digital business, especially amid the pandemic-led customers’ increased shift to online shopping. The company remains focused on making investments in this business, which has seen its sales more than double since 2014. In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, digital sales were robust, increasing 6% year over year and 33% on a two-year basis. Digital sales contributed 29% to sales in the reported quarter. Given the need of the hour, management has been speeding up its digital marketing and enhancing its website to cater to customers’ needs. The company’s solid endeavors to boost mobile traffic have augmented the adoption of the Kohl app, making it a vital constituent of online sales.

To improve online offerings, KSS has been expanding its e-commerce fulfillment centers alongside strengthening in-store pickups. The company’s Buy Online, Pickup In Store, Buy Online Ship to Store, curbside pickup and Amazon Returns initiatives are noteworthy. Other efforts to bolster digital sales include Smart Cart, Your Price and personalized search.

Kohl’s is also benefiting from its strategic framework introduced in October 2020. The strategic plan focuses on four key areas, driving the top line, expanding the operating margin, implementing disciplined capital management and undertaking an agile accountable and inclusive culture. Under its top-line growth initiative, the company intends to become the most trusted retailer of choice for the active and casual lifestyle. Also, it expects to reignite growth in women’s business and build a significant size beauty business. This is likely to be aided by the alliance with Sephora. Further, Kohl’s is on track to grow its Active and Outdoor category to 30% of its business. Expanding the outdoor via prudent alliances like the recent Eddie Bauer launch and strengthening of its athleisure opportunity through the launch of FLX are impressive steps in this direction.

The abovementioned expansion of Sephora at Kohl’s and the addition of new brands are likely to help KSS to keep its growth story going. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 13.9% in the past six months compared with the industry’s rise of 20.5%.

2022-02-15 00:00:00+00:00,7 Stocks in the Crosshairs of Activist Investors ,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-in-the-crosshairs-of-activist-investors,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
A combination of poorly performing stocks and an ongoing focus by activist investors on corporate governance suggests that 2022 will be ripe for corporate battles between management and significant shareholders. 
At least, that’s according to a recent article on stocks from Fortune and Cox School of Business finance professor Shane Goodwin.
“Hedge fund activists like Bill Ackman or Carl Icahn are going to be focused on companies that are ‘clearly underperforming’ and ‘maybe there’s an opportunity within the industry for sale,’” Godwin says. “In fact, any companies that are underperforming, ‘whether they were just newly [public], or whether they’ve been public for a very long time, are definitely going to be in the crosshairs.”
7 Housing Stocks To Sell if You Think the Boom Is Going To Bust
Godwin says that these stocks, new or old, will be targeted by activist investors in the year ahead if their stocks haven’t been performing. 
I’m particularly interested in the consumer discretionary sector, so I’ve put together a list of seven stocks that are currently in the crosshairs of investors. Some are buys. Others are not. I’ll tell you which are which.
Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG)
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR)
TreeHouse Foods (NYSE:THS)
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (NASDAQ:CBRL)
GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY)
Kohl’s (NYSE:KSS)

Stocks Activists Are Circling: Harley-Davidson (HOG)
Source: Alex Erofeenkov / Shutterstock.com
When you’re an activist investor, sometimes you have to rattle a few cages. That’s what New York City-based H Partners Management has done with the iconic motorcycle brand. 
The investment firm first bought 3.5 million Harley shares in Q2 2020. It has since added to its position. In February 2021, it reported it owned 4.2 million additional shares of HOG. That made it the fifth-largest shareholder. By the end of September 2021, it raised its ownership stake to 11.2 million shares. By the end of the year it owned 12.3 million shares, good for 8% of the company. 
Right around Christmas, it notified the company that it wanted a seat on Harley’s board. While it didn’t have a problem with Harley’s strategic direction, it did have issues with the company’s corporate governance and executive compensation. 
On Feb. 3, Harley-Davidson gave H Partners its wish. 
The two parties agreed to cooperate moving forward. As part of this agreement, Jared Dourdeville, a partner at H Partners, is joining the company’s board and will serve on both its human resources committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee. 
“Under the leadership of Jochen Zeitz, we believe Harley-Davidson’s best days are ahead, and we look forward to partnering with the Board, leadership team, and employees to reinvigorate this iconic American company,” Dourdeville said in the joint press release.
Harley Davidson stock is up 15% over the past 52 weeks,. In 2020, Zeitz earned $9.4 million in total compensation. That was 57x the median employee’s total compensation of $166,164.
Dollar Tree (DLTR)

Like a lot of activist activity, it all starts rather innocently. A few shares here, a few shares there, and the next thing you know, they’ve got a major stake in the company and are looking for changes. 
In November, New York City investment manager Mantle Ridge was reportedly putting together potential investors for a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that could then build a stake in Dollar Tree. Mantle Ridge was started by former Pershing Square partner Paul Hilal. It isn’t alone in its desire to make changes to the discount retailer. 
In 2019, Starboard Value wanted the company to spin off its Family Dollar banner. It also started a proxy fight to appoint its own slate of board members but eventually dropped the idea.    
In December, Mantle Ridge went down the Starboard path by nominating its own slate of directors to replace the current board members. Hilal would like to see Richard Dreiling, the CEO of Dollar General (NYSE:DG) from 2008 to 2015, hired by Dollar Tree. 
Mantle Ridge’s $1.8-billion stake is good for 9.9% of the company. Analysts see Dreiling’s hiring as a major positive for DLTR stock. Given Mantle Ridge tends to work on one company at a time and replaced CEOs of target companies in the past, shareholders should expect a continued push to appoint Dreiling to the top job.
TreeHouse Foods (THS)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
Jana Partners, a New York hedge fund, owns 9.4% of the food and beverage company. At the end of December, Bloomberg reported that Jana would appoint two directors to the company’s board. 
Jana originally invested in Treehouse in February 2021. It convinced the company to undertake a strategic review with the possibility of an outright sale. In March, Jana and Treehouse announced an agreement that would see Jana appoint two independent directors to the company’s board. 
However, the standstill and voting commitments from the agreement expired in December, which is why Jana is now going after two more board seats. 
In November, Treehouse announced that it would explore strategic alternatives such as an outright sale or the divestiture of its meal prep business. It has retained financial and legal advisors for this process. 
Over the past year, THS stock has lost 17%; stocks in the S&P 500 are up 13%. While its share price rallied after its November announcement, it has since fallen back to where it traded before it said it would explore alternatives.
You can bet that either Jana gets more people on Treehouse’s board or it finds a buyer.
Stocks Activists Are Circling: Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (CBRL)
Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com
In one of the longest-running feuds in corporate America, Biglari Holdings (NYSE:BH, NYSE:BH.A) sent a letter to Cracker Barrel shareholders in December that laid out the holding company’s current concerns with the strategic direction of the restaurant and retail chain. 
As the letter states, Biglari owns 8.7% of the company. According to Cracker Barrel’s most recent proxy, that makes it the third-largest shareholder behind Vanguard and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).
However, as recently as September 2014, Biglari owned 19.8% of Cracker Barrel’s shares. Back then, activist investor Sardar Biglari tried unsuccessfully on three occasions to join its board. That was after he unsuccessfully tried to get the company to pay a $20 special dividend – it would have cost the company $475 million and doubled its debt – and put itself up for sale. 
Like a bad stench, the board told him to get lost. But he’s back.
“It has become increasingly clear that management lacks a credible strategy with which to create value in the present business climate, and that the Board, which primarily consists of directors with minimal relevant experience in the casual dining space, is unable to provide the necessary oversight. Management’s waning credibility is reflected in the Company’s stock performance,” Biglari stated in his Dec. 14, 2021 letter to shareholders.
Speaking of stock performance, over the past two years, Biglari’s stock generated lost 23% over the last five years, while CBRL stock is up 3% over the same period.
I actually wrote about Biglari back in 2013. He’d been on Cracker Barrel’s case since 2011. That’s a decade ago. 
The man needs to get a hobby.
GoDaddy (GDDY)
Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com
Starboard Value acquired a 6.5% stake in the web services firm in late December. Starboard paid $800 million or an average of $70.64 a share. 
According to CNBC, in the 45 times the hedge fund has taken an activist position in a company, it’s delivered a 42.25% return, 2.4x the S&P 500.
There are three moves the hedge fund could push for at GoDaddy.
The first is to get a seat on its board. It can nominate its own choices until March 4. Investors should expect a press release any day announcing its own nominations. 
Secondly, Starboard can work with GoDaddy on an operational plan that better balances growth with profits. Its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are about half those of its peers. 
Lastly, in combination with installing operational efficiencies, GoDaddy can buy back its shares. The company’s trailing 12-month free cash flow (FCF) is $550 million. Starboard would likely want an FCF margin of at least 20%, one-third higher than what they currently are. 
Over the past three years, GoDaddy’s total return was 10%, about half the return of the entire U.S. market.
Kohl’s (KSS)
Source: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.com
In 2018, I included Kohl’s CEO Michelle Gass on a list of seven women-led companies delivering for shareholders. She’d only been in the top job for six months at the time. However, having joined the company in 2013, and was appointed as CEO-elect in October 2017, I felt like she’d made a large contribution to the company over the years and deserved the promotion.
Since becoming CEO-elect, Gass has been working to implement a business strategy to help the budget department store thrive and prosper. Despite partnerships with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Sephora, it hasn’t been easy due to Covid-19 and the consumer’s move t0 e-commerce purchases. 
It also hasn’t helped that she’s had activist investors nipping at her heels as she’s worked to make the business more competitive.
In early December, Engine Capital LP, which owns about 1% of the company, pushed for the company to sell itself or spin off its e-commerce operations. Engine Capital believes the business is worth $75 a share – it currently trades around $59. 
Macellum Advisors, which owns 5%, have requested at least one seat on its board, and it would like the company to undertake a strategic review. That’s often code for putting up the for sale sign.
Lastly, Starboard Value has apparently offered $64 a share for the company, about an 8% premium based on current prices. Kohl’s has been tightlipped about any of the activist investors’ demands.
With three activists circling, it’s clear KSS stock is worth more than $59 a share. How much more? We’ll soon find out.
Stocks Activists Are Circling: Peloton Interactive (PTON)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
The company’s products were all the rage during the pandemic. Now that the world is moving to a more normal routine, sales have fallen, and with it its share price. PTON is down 33% in the past three months alone. It now trades just a few dollars above its September 2019 IPO price of $29. 
I’m not surprised that Peloton’s shares have gone in the toilet. The fitness equipment market has relatively low margins and a consumer base that is very fickle. I said as much in May 2020. It’s a tough business to consistently grow sales and profits. 
In January, activist investor Blackwells Capital wrote an open letter to Peloton’s board. The New York-based alternative asset manager suggested that the board fire then-CEO John Foley and consider selling the business to a strategic buyer. 
“Remarkably, the Company is on worse footing today than it was prior to the pandemic, with high fixed costs, excessive inventory, a listless strategy, dispirited employees and thousands of disgruntled shareholders. And no wonder, the latter, given that Peloton underperformed every other company in the Nasdaq 100 over the last twelve months,” stated Blackwells Capital Chief Investment Officer Jason Aintabi. 
Now, Peloton faces a patent infringement lawsuit from iFit Health & Fitness Inc., the maker of Nordic Track home-fitness equipment. 
I don’t always agree with activist investors and their tactics, but in this case, Blackwells Capital was right on the money. On Feb. 8, Foley stepped aside as CEO and the company announced it was cutting 2,800 jobs.

2022-02-15 00:00:00+00:00,What's in Store for BJ's Restaurants' (BJRI) Q4 Earnings?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/whats-in-store-for-bjs-restaurants-bjri-q4-earnings,,,"BJ's Restaurants, Inc. BJRI is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2021 results on Feb 16, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 262.5%.
Q4 Estimates
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line is pegged at a loss of 2 cents. In the prior-year quarter, the company had reported an adjusted loss per share of 80 cents. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $297.3 million, suggesting an improvement of 51.2% from the prior-year quarter.
Factors to Note
BJ's Restaurants fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from improvement in traffic and comps. Comps in the quarter to be reported might have gained from solid recovery in dining room sales. Robust off-premise sales owing to an expanded family feast and bundle offerings are likely to have favored the company’s quarterly performance. Focus on unit expansion, slow-roasted protein platform and Beer Club subscription services may have contributed to the fourth-quarter performance as well. The company has been benefiting from its focus on refining and streamlining its menu for improved traffic.

The company has been receiving positive reviews with respect to its beer subscription service — Beer Club. It has been witnessing high customer engagement, courtesy of new beer releases and program benefits. Higher pre-opening costs, marketing expenses and costs related to sales-boosting initiatives are likely to have dented the company’s margin in the quarter to be reported. Particularly, slow roasting ovens and handheld tablets are adding to the restaurants’ costs.

2022-02-14 00:00:00+00:00,Albertsons Companies (ACI) Likely to Sustain Bull Run in 2022,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/albertsons-companies-aci-likely-to-sustain-bull-run-in-2022,,,"The year 2022 might be a bit challenging for the stock market, thanks to rising inflation and supply chain bottlenecks that may decelerate the speed of the economic recovery, at least in the first half. So, you need to be smart when it comes to investment. The right choice of stock may fetch you higher returns even amid changing market dynamics. We present you one such stock, Albertsons Companies, Inc. ACI, that looks well-poised heading into the new year, given its sound fundamentals and growth efforts.

Amid a tough operating environment, this Boise, ID-based company has made multiple changes to its business model to adapt and stay relevant. Shares of this food and drug retailer in the United States have climbed 72.4% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 30.6%. There is a likelihood that Albertsons Companies with a long-term earnings growth rate of 8% can attain new highs. A VGM Score of A highlights this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock’s upside potential. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
This Bull Run Has Momentum
Albertsons Companies’ focus on providing efficient in-store services, enhancing digital and omni-channel capabilities, and increasing productivity has been contributing to its upbeat performance. The company’s decent performance continued in third-quarter fiscal 2021 as well. The quarter marked the third straight positive sales and earnings surprise, wherein both the top and the bottom lines improved year over year.

Efforts to boost assortments, especially in the fresh and Own Brands categories, continue to elevate the customer experience. The company’s right assortment in each local market, loyalty program, and ease of checkout through frictionless and contactless payments have been aiding in attracting customers. The company, through its “just for U” loyalty program, has been acquiring new customers and retaining old members as well as incentivizing them to spend more and buy more often. During the third quarter, membership increased 17% year over year to reach 28 million members.
 Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Albertsons Companies’ Own Brands products resonate well with customers. The company under its Own Brands portfolio offers more than 13,000 high-quality products at attractive price points and remains committed to bringing more innovative products to shoppers. We believe that the company’s private-label offerings are expected to do well in the quarters ahead. During the third quarter, the company continued to introduce Own Brands across all its banners. Notably, sales penetration increased about 15 basis points to 25.1% from the year-ago period.

2022-02-12 00:00:00+00:00,Dollar Tree Faces Backlash From Price Hikes: Will That Hurt Real Estate Investors?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-faces-backlash-from-price-hikes%3A-will-that-hurt-real-estate-investors,,,"While many retailers struggled immensely during the pandemic, one breed of retailer shined: dollar stores. At a time when consumers had to be cash-savvy, dollar stores came to the rescue, allowing customers to load up on household essentials on the relative cheap.
At this point, the U.S. economy is in a much stronger place than it was in 2020 and the first half of 2021. But the flip side of that is that inflation has been rampant since last summer, putting a strain on consumers' wallets.
Retailers are feeling the crunch, too. Between general inflation and supply-chain bottlenecks, it's been costing retailers more to procure inventory. And some chains now have no choice but to pass those higher costs on to their customers.
Image source: Getty Images.
One such chain is Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR). After upholding its $1 price point for 35 years, Dollar Tree is now putting an end to $1 pricing, raising its main price point to $1.25.
Not shockingly, it's a move that isn't sitting well with consumers so far. And that could have disastrous consequences, not just for Dollar Tree but also for real estate investors.
Consumer pushback has already begun
At a time when just about everything from groceries to gas to apparel is costing more, the last thing budget-conscious consumers can stomach is a discount retailer hiking prices too. And so far, consumers are already pushing back.
In December, Dollar Tree added $1.25 prices to more than 2,000 of its 8,700 stores. Meanwhile, Coresight Research noted a 6.2% drop from Dec. 27 to Jan. 3 in the number of customers who purchased nonfood items at Dollar Tree compared to the prior two weeks. Other chains did not see similar drops.
As such, the fear is that as Dollar Tree implements price hikes at more of its stores, its customer base will shrink. Not only might consumers head to competing dollar stores (where most products actually cost $1), but they might also choose to take their business to big-box stores like Walmart, which are known for their competitive price points.
Real estate investors could get hurt, too
During the pandemic, numerous retailers closed stores and left shopping center operators in the lurch with vacancies to fill. Dollar stores, meanwhile, have been a shopping center mainstay for years, and based on their success during the pandemic, they're in a strong position to continue to branch out.
But if Dollar Tree sees a strong decline in revenue due to customer pushback, all of that might change. Not only might the chain stop thinking about expansion, but it may be forced to shutter stores, adding to shopping centers' vacancy crisis. As such, real estate investors with retail REITs (real estate investment trusts) in their portfolios could feel the impact.
While it's premature to predict the demise of Dollar Tree based on its new price point, it's clear that consumers aren't happy about it. Whether that has a minimal impact or an extreme one is yet to be determined as Dollar Tree rolls out its new pricing model across more stores.

2022-02-11 00:00:00+00:00,Stocks & ETFs to Fall for in the Valentines' Week,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stocks-etfs-to-fall-for-in-the-valentines-week,,,"The United States will be showered with love as 53% of its adults are planning to celebrate this Valentine’s Day. The pandemic has not dampened the excitement among consumers. About 27% of the population who are not celebrating, still plan to observe the occasion. Total spending would be a total of $23.9 billion (up from $21.8 billion in 2021), per NRF.
January data from Google Search reveled searches for “Valentine’s Day gifts for her” were up 300% year over year and searches for “best Valentine’s Day gifts for him” were up 200%.  Consumers are spending $175.41 on average this year, up about 6% from last year, per the report. Naturally, the day of love translates into a great day for business. Exchanging chocolates, greeting cards, flowers, gifting precious metals should remain at the front and in the center.
Let’s dive a little deeper:
Candies, Cards & Flowers Continue to Remain Ageless  
Since the pandemic can’t affect exchanging gifts like classic candies, cards and flowers, these businesses should see no adverse impact this year. About 56% of consumers are planning to buy candies, followed by greetings cards (40%) and flowers (37%). The Hershey Company HSY is likely to be one of the best bets this year. Shares of companies like 1-800 Flowers.Com Inc. FLWS should also get a nudge-up.
Who Forget Gifting Diamonds to His Valentine?
Apart from candies, flowers or greeting cards, gifting jewelry this Valentine’s Day has become popular than ever before. Total spending on jewelry could touch a high of $6.2 billion, per NRF. About 30% of men (up from 27% in 2021) and 14% of women (up from 10% in 2021) are planning to buy jewelry. Spending projections have also increased as per person spend for men went up from $59 in 2021 to $75 while per person spend for women doubled to $24. Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Brilliant Earth Group BRLT is a great pick here.
Gifting An Experience: A Booming Trend
About 41% (up from 33% in 2021) is planning an evening out while 41% plan on gifting an experience, up from 36% last year. In this regard, restaurant ETF AdvisorShares Restaurant ETF EATZ and experience ETFs like Defiance Hotel, Airline, and Cruise ETF CRUZ and ALPS Global Travel Beneficiaries ETF JRNY should benefit.
 Shopping Online Amid the Pandemic
Online purchasing would continue to rule as about 41% of consumers are planning to buy their Valentine’s gifts online this year — the highest in the survey’s history. ProShares Online Retail ETF ONLN is a beneficiary of the trend. With all the celebration around, who can get forget Amazon AMZN, a hot destination of online shopping.
Dollar Store: A Winner Too?
Visiting department stores (32%), discount stores (28%), and local small businesses and specialty stores (18%) would also remain a trend. Consumers have been showing an inclination for small businesses as one of the top five shopping destinations. Several discount retailers like Costco COST and Dollar Tree DLTR may win from the trend and make VanEck Vectors Retail ETF RTH a winner.

A massive push to rebuild the crumbling U.S. infrastructure will soon be underway. It’s bipartisan, urgent, and inevitable. Trillions will be spent. Fortunes will be made.

2022-02-11 00:00:00+00:00,"Expedia Group (EXPE) Q4 Earnings Beat, Revenues Rise Y/Y",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/expedia-group-expe-q4-earnings-beat-revenues-rise-y-y,,,"Expedia Group, Inc. EXPE reported adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share for fourth-quarter 2021, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.3%.

Notably, the bottom line compares favorably with the prior-year quarter’s loss of $2.64 per share but declined 69.9% sequentially.

Revenues of $2.28 billion surged 148% year over year but declined 23.1% from the previous quarter. Further, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 billion.

Year-over-year revenues growth was driven by strong recovery across all its lines of business, owing to increasing travel resiliency of people. Moreover, improved travel demand from the year-ago quarter contributed well.

However, the sequential fall was primarily attributed to the travel disruptions caused by the rapidly spreading COVID variant, Omicron.

Nevertheless, the impacts of the current COVID-19 wave seem to be less severe than that of the previous waves, which remains a major positive.

Expedia Group’s gross bookings were $17.5 billion, which increased 131% year over year. However, the figure decreased 6.7% from the prior quarter, owing to a sequential decline in lodging, air, and other travel products due to the seasonality effect and disruptions caused by Omicron.

Although the coronavirus pandemic-led uncertainties continue to persist in the global travel industry, growing confidence among people regarding travel remains a tailwind. Optimism regarding the ongoing vaccination drive remains another positive.

This should translate into high consumer spending and result in an upside in the stock market.

Spending is expected to hit the second highest in 15 years as Americans are expected to spend an average of $175.41 per person or a total of $23.9 billion on Valentine’s Day this year as per the National Retail Federation’s survey. This is up from $164.76 or $21.8 billion in 2021 and behind $27.48 billion spent in 2020.

Given an uptick in seasonal sales, companies selling Valentine’s Day products will see a boost in sales and a resultant surge in their stock price. So, hearty investors could show their affection and love to some stocks in order to exploit the near-term trend.

Candy (56%), greeting cards (40%) and flowers (37%) remain the most popular gift items this Valentine’s Day. About 31% of respondents plan to gift an “evening out” this year, up from 24% in 2021 for a total of $4.3 billion. About 22% will opt to gift jewelry to a special someone.

2022-02-10 00:00:00+00:00,"BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) Strong on Omni-Channel, Supply Efforts",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bjs-wholesale-club-bj-strong-on-omni-channel-supply-efforts,,,"BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. BJ is steadily climbing up the charts, thanks to its robust business strategies and sound fundamentals. Sturdy membership trends, assortment-enhancement initiatives, advanced digital capabilities and a robust real-estate pipeline have been driving BJ's comparable sales (comps) for a while now. BJ delivered the third straight quarter of comps growth during third-quarter fiscal 2021.

Although the persistent supply-chain and sourcing challenges are concerning, management has been undertaking prudent actions for sometime to counter these headwinds. Recently, BJ's Wholesale Club agreed to purchase the assets and operations of four refrigerated distribution centers and the related private transportation fleet from its partner Burris Logistics. This will help the buyer insource its perishable supply chain. This deal consists of four perishable goods distribution centers (Rocky Hill, CT; Orlando, FL; Elkton, MD; Independence, KY) along with the personnel of these facilities, the associated real property and the capital assets for operations.

Via the addition of four distribution centers and a transportation fleet, BJ's Wholesale Club will be able to strengthen its supply-chain facilities and drive overall growth. This will aid BJ to offer top-quality and fresh products to its consumers. In fact, BJ's Wholesale Club’s partnership with Burris Logistics already complements its perishable business and supports supply-chain functions. Burris Logistics is quite a popular enterprise offering temperature-controlled distribution and logistics services across the United States.
More Strategic Details
BJ's Wholesale Club’s focus on simplifying assortments, boosting marketing and merchandising capabilities, expanding into high-demand categories as well as building own-brands portfolio bodes well. During third-quarter fiscal 2021, BJ’s own brands penetration increased to 23% of the merchandise sales.

Management is also focused on enhancing the omni-channel capabilities to offer best to the customers. BJ's Wholesale Club has been directing resources toward expanding digital capabilities for a while to better engage with members and provide them with a convenient way to shop, including same-day delivery, curbside pick-up and buy-online, pickup-in-club, etc.

BJ built a strong digital portfolio with Bjs.com, BerkleyJensen.com, Wellsleyfarms.com, delivery.bjs.com and its mobile app. This enables members to buy, review products and digitally add coupons to their membership card. Cumulatively, these endeavors are consistently contributing to growth in membership signups and renewals, resulting in higher membership fee income, higher average members per club and aiding comps.

In addition, BJ's Wholesale Club also holds a three-year exclusive agreement with CommerceHub, a leading e-commerce platform allowing online order fulfillment and delivery solutions. BJ’s partnership with Citizens Pay to provide online financing solutions for large purchases also bodes well.

2022-02-09 00:00:00+00:00,Zacks Earnings ESP: A Better Way to Find Earnings Surprises for Retail and Wholesale,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/zacks-earnings-esp%3A-a-better-way-to-find-earnings-surprises-for-retail-and-wholesale-18,,,"Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.
We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.
The ability to identify stocks that are likely to top quarterly earnings expectations can be profitable, but it's no simple task. Here at Zacks, our Earnings ESP filter helps make things easier.
The Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained
The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information.
With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure. The system also utilizes our core Zacks Rank to provide a stronger system for identifying stocks that might beat their next quarterly earnings estimate and possibly see the stock price climb.
Bringing together a positive earnings ESP alongside a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better has helped stocks report a positive earnings surprise 70% of the time. Furthermore, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
Stocks with a ranking of #3 (Hold), or 60% of all stocks covered by the Zacks Rank, are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. Stocks with rankings of #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy), or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market; Strong Buy stocks should outperform more than any other rank.
Should You Consider Dollar Tree?
The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Dollar Tree (DLTR) earns a #2 (Buy) 21 days from its next quarterly earnings release on March 2, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.80 a share.
By taking the percentage difference between the $1.80 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.78 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Dollar Tree has an Earnings ESP of 1.07%. Investors should also know that DLTR is just one of a large group of stocks with positive ESPs. All of these qualifying stocks can be filtered by ESP, Zacks Rank, % Surprise (Last Qtr.), and Reporting date.

2022-02-08 00:00:00+00:00,Should Direxion NASDAQ100 Equal Weighted Index Shares (QQQE) Be on Your Investing Radar?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-direxion-nasdaq100-equal-weighted-index-shares-qqqe-be-on-your-investing-radar-4,,,"Looking for broad exposure to the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market? You should consider the Direxion NASDAQ100 Equal Weighted Index Shares (QQQE), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 03/21/2012.
The fund is sponsored by Direxion. It has amassed assets over $408.74 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.
Why Large Cap Growth
Companies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.
While growth stocks do boast higher than average sales and earnings growth rates, and they are expected to grow faster than the wider market, investors should note these kinds of stocks have higher valuations. Further, growth stocks have a higher level of volatility associated with them. They are likely to outperform value stocks in strong bull markets but over the longer-term, value stocks have delivered better returns than growth stocks in almost all markets.
Costs
Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.35%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 4.28%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 43.60% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Healthcare round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Tesla Inc (TSLA) accounts for about 1.54% of total assets, followed by Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).
The top 10 holdings account for about 12.08% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
QQQE seeks to match the performance of the NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index before fees and expenses. The NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index consists of companies in the NASDAQ-100 Index but each of the securities is initially set at a weight of 1.00% of the Index. The NASDAQ-100 Index includes 100 of the largest non-financial securities listed on NASDAQ based on capitalization.
The ETF has lost about -10.31% so far this year and is up about 1.36% in the last one year (as of 02/08/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $72.55 and $90.09.
The ETF has a beta of 1.04 and standard deviation of 24.06% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 104 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
Direxion NASDAQ100 Equal Weighted Index Shares carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, QQQE is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Growth area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.
The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) and the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) track a similar index. While Vanguard Growth ETF has $80.47 billion in assets, Invesco QQQ has $189.09 billion. VUG has an expense ratio of 0.04% and QQQ charges 0.20%.
Bottom-Line
An increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.

2022-02-07 00:00:00+00:00,7 Stocks Activist Investors Have in Their Sights,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-activist-investors-have-in-their-sights,,,"Most investors tend to shy away from troubled companies because they can really weigh on returns. Activist investors, on the other hand, actively seek out underperforming businesses, acquiring big equity stakes in the anticipation of forcing changes that will improve the share price.
Activist investors target companies that are poorly managed, inefficient, overpaying for acquisitions or suffering from a slew of other maladies that detract from shareholder value. They then push actions that they believe will benefit stockholders such as business restructurings and spinoffs, share repurchases and dividend hikes.

And a new category of activist investor has also emerged in recent years: those primarily concerned about environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. ESG activists successfully lobbied for seats on the board of Exxon Mobil (XOM) last year and are pushing Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) to spin off its renewable energy business.   
Here are seven stocks on the radar of activist investors. Some of these companies are newly under siege, while others are in embroiled in proxy fights and still others are listening and make changes. 
Just understand that while activist investor campaigns sometimes produce results that dramatically improve the share price, activist-targeted stocks should be approached with caution. According to a 2019 Harvard Law School report, just 17% of activist investor campaigns that year were successful; the vast majority of campaigns – 56% – either failed or were still in progress one year later.
Still, sometimes, an activist investor's involvement alone can be enough to drive at least short-term gains.

Peloton Interactive
Market value: $8.1 billion
Dividend yield: N/A
Peloton Interactive (PTON, $24.60) became an instant success story during the early days of the pandemic when mandatory gym lockdowns caused demand for in-home fitness equipment to skyrocket. 
During the latter part of 2020, PTON was delivering triple-digit sales growth and a roughly $170 share price. The company, which made its public debut just two years ago, makes digitally connected stationary bikes and treadmills. In addition, it has roughly 5.9 million members on its platform, which includes its Peloton digital app that streams live and on-demand fitness classes.
A series of setbacks over the past year have resulted in a roughly 84% 12-month share-price decline through Feb. 4 – as well as the company swinging from a net profit to a net loss. 
Peloton's woes began last May when the company issued a voluntary recall of its treadmills due to reported injuries among users. In August, the company cut the price of its less-expensive bike by 20%. Shares fell again in December when a popular character on HBO Max's ""Sex and the City"" show was depicted dying of a heart attack after taking a Peloton spin class. 
These troubles were only exacerbated in early 2022 amid headlines that PTON was temporarily halting production of its bikes and treadmills due to weak demand – though CEO John Foley denied the press reports.
Amid this turmoil, PTON caught the eye of investment firm Blackwells Capital. A late-January report in The Wall Street Journal indicated the activist investor has accumulated a stake of less than 5% in PTON and is calling on the company to fire its CEO and put the business up for sale. According to the WSJ, Blackwells believes Peloton would be a good acquisition for a larger technology company like Amazon (AMZN) or Apple (AAPL) that also have fitness products. (On Feb. 7, the stock spiked higher on unconfirmed reports the company has received buyout bids from several suitors, including Amazon.) 
Despite these recent setbacks, there are still Wall Street firms that are believers in PTON stock. Stifel analyst Scott Devitt in January upgraded PTON to Buy from Hold, arguing that the recent selloff is overdone, especially considering Peloton is still expanding its subscriber base. Analysts from Needham, Loop Capital and BofA also recently reiterated their Buy ratings.
Consensus analyst estimates look for Peloton to deliver a per-share loss this fiscal year and next, making these shares best-suited for highly risk-tolerant investors.

Unilever
Market value: $132.7 billion
Dividend yield: 4.0%
Consumer goods giant Unilever (UL, $51.40) hopes to increase profits by divesting struggling brands and expanding its foothold in higher-growth categories. 
The company, which owns well-known brands like Dove soap, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr's soups, expanded its wellness and supplement product lines in early 2021 via the purchase of leading holistic health product maker Onnit. In mid-November, Unilever agreed to sell its worldwide tea business, which includes brands like Lipton and TAZO. 
More recently, Unilever faced backlash from investors in mid-January when it revealed it bid $68 billion for GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) consumer products business – an offer GSK turned down. UL shares dropped more than 14% on the news.
However, shares bounced back amid reports hedge fund Trian Partners, led by prominent activist investor Nelson Peltz, has built a stake in Unilever. Peltz has prior experience with consumer goods companies, having been on the board of directors at Procter & Gamble (PG) and previously been a stakeholder in Mondelez (MDLZ). 
While Trian Partners hasn't commented publicly on Unilever's business, Peltz met with the firm's CEO last September to discuss a Ben & Jerry's boycott after the ice cream brand refused to sell its products in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Unilever is dodging this thorny issue by putting its ice cream brands, which also include Breyer's and Klondike, in a standalone unit.
On the heels of the activist investor news, Unilever disclosed plans to cut 15% its regional and divisional management roles, which the company says will help to trim costs and speed up decision-making. Unilever also says it will not increase its bid for the GlaxoSmithKline business.   
This is likely good news to British fund manager Terry Smith, whose Fundsmith investment vehicle is Unilever's 13th largest stakeholder. Smith called the attempted acquisition a ""near death experience"" and called on Unilever to focus instead on improving its operating performance.
As for its financial performance, in its most recent earnings report, Unilever said sales were up 4.4% year-over-year through the first nine months of 2021, while earnings were up 1.7%. UL cautioned that rising inflation will impact results into next year, but said it will take ""appropriate price action"" to offset higher costs.  
Analyst opinions on UL stock are mixed, though they have a slightly bullish tilt. Those in this camp cite the company's strong brands, operating leverage and generous dividend as reasons to invest in UL.

Huntsman
Market value: $7.8 billion
Dividend yield: 2.1%
Huntsman (HUN, $35.81) is a global manufacturer and marketer of specialty chemicals, which are produced by three business units and manufacturing operations in 30 countries.
Strong pent-up demand in 2021 coming out of the pandemic helped Huntsman deliver 51% sales growth and 97% adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) gains during the September quarter. 
However, the company's long-term performance has been lackluster. Since going public 17 years ago, Huntsman's shares have risen only about 50%. In addition, recent sales and EBITDA gains are mainly due to price increases; volume grew only 2% year-over-year.  
There's room for improvement to these operating results, says hedge fund Starboard Value. The activist investor recently acquired an 8% stake in Huntsman and declared plans to seek four seats on the company's board of directors. 
""We invested in Huntsman because of the Company’s strong market positions, diverse product portfolios, innovative chemistries and difficult to replicate manufacturing footprint,"" Jeff Smith, managing member at Starboard, wrote in a letter to Huntsman CEO Peter Huntsman. ""We firmly believe that with the right Board in place, Huntsman can be a best-in-class company in its industry and generate significant value for all shareholders.""
In response to Starboard's comments, Huntsman said it was pursuing a potential sale of its slower-growing textile effects division, initiating a $1 billion share repurchase program and tying the majority of future executive compensation to performance goals. The company also highlighted shareholder value created last year via the $2 billion sale of its commodity chemical portfolio, which both sharpened its focus on higher-margin businesses and contributed to a total shareholder return that roughly doubled between 2017 and early 2022.
Jeffries analysts (Buy) think Huntsman is poised for ""transformative"" M&A activity over the next several years – which could help fend off activist investor attacks. 
Deutsche Bank analyst David Begleiter, meanwhile, added HUN stock to its ""Catalyst Call Buy"" list in January and sees the company ""pulling out all stops"" to deliver great December quarter results and 2022 guidance ahead of its March shareholder meeting where HUN shareholders will vote on adding Starboard nominees to the board. Begleiter also expects Starboard to offer detailed recommendations that it believes will benefit all HUN shareholders before the March meeting.
HUN shares appear undervalued at the moment, trading at 10.3 times forward earnings, a nearly 30% discount to industry peers and roughly 30% below the company's five-year average.

Kohl's
Market value: $8.3 billion
Dividend yield: 1.7%
Kohl's (KSS, $59.68) operates 1,162 department stores across the U.S. Like many bricks-and-mortar retailers, Kohl's has struggled due to competition from online rivals. The company hopes to turn its business around by growing higher-margin active brands to 30% of sales, rolling out Sephora kiosks in 850 of its stores and stepping up investment in its e-commerce business, which is delivering steady double-digit sales gains.
KSS opened Sephora kiosks in 200 stores last year and grew active brands by 20%. These actions supported 16% sales gains during the September quarter and record adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter. The company also strengthened its financial position, ending the quarter with roughly as much cash as long-term debt ($1.9 billion) on its balance sheet. These strong results led to a 22% increase in full-year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance.     
Despite improved results, Kohl's is under pressure from two activist investors – Engine Capital and Macellum Advisors. Engine Capital wants Kohl's to sell itself or spin off its e-commerce business. Macellum is pushing for the company to add board members with retail experience and/or to explore a potential sale of the business. Analysts value Kohl's real estate holdings at $6 billion-$7 billion, or nearly 80% of the company's market valuation. 
A bidding war has attracted potential buyers. Acquisition company Acacia Research is offering $64 per share for KSS and private equity firm Sycamore Partners is reportedly willing to pay $65 – though the retailer turned down both bids in early February. 
Credit Suisse analyst Michael Binetti estimates fair market value is closer to $70-$80 per share, which he derives by valuing Kohl's real estate at $6.5 billion and its operations at a 3 to 4 times EBITDA. Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, meanwhile, thinks Kohl's shares could fetch over $85 per share.
UBS analyst Jay Sole, on the other hand, thinks that rising inflation and interest rates, coupled with inventory buildup, will hurt the company's sales and margins this year. Sole cut his KSS rating to Sell in January.
Whatever the outcome, buyout speculation has been good for KSS investors, who have seen shares rise nearly 20% this year. Even with this surge, KSS remains cheap, trading at just 8.2 times forward earnings – a greater than 40% discount to retail peers and nearly 55% less than its five-year average.

Ericsson
Market value: $41.7 billion
Dividend yield: 2.0%
Sweden-based telecom Ericsson (ERIC, $12.44) is one of the world's largest providers of telecom equipment, infrastructure and services. The company also recently became the worldwide leader in 5G when its chief rival, China-based Huawei, was hit with sanctions by the Trump administration. Ericsson currently supplies telecom equipment to all three major U.S. carriers – AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ) and T-Mobile (TMUS).  
In its fiscal 2021, Ericsson generated 4% year-over-year sales growth, 29% EPS gains and a 44% improvement to adjusted free cash flow. ERIC also announced plans to further increase EBIT margins by expanding its enterprise business via the acquisition of cloud communications firm Vonage, and developing a global network platform to capitalize on 5G rollouts. 
Ericsson announced the $6.2-billion acquisition of Vonage (VG) in late 2021 and expects it to create $400 million of cross-selling synergies by 2025 and sees cost efficiencies emerging after the deal is closed sometime within the first half of this year. Ericsson also anticipates the acquisition will be accretive to adjusted EPS and free cash flow beginning in 2024. 
In January, Ericsson came under attack from Swedish investment firm Cevian Capital, one of its top three shareholders. Cevian complains that Ericsson is not doing enough to improve its stock price and delivered a list of demands to the company that include divesting or spinning off its managed services business, reducing losses in digital services, and better articulating its goals and strategies for its enterprise business.
The activist investor also criticized the Vonage deal, questioning Ericsson's willingness to pay more than 50 times EV/EBIT, with EV standing for enterprise value, for Vonage when the company could repurchase ERIC stock at 8 times EBIT. 
ERIC shares are up more than 14% year-to-date, but are still priced roughly 30% below peers and 77% lower than the stock's five-year average forward P/E.

Dollar Tree
Market value: $30.0 billion
Dividend yield: N/A
Dollar Tree (DLTR, $133.49) owns approximately 15,500 discount variety stores across the U.S. and Canada operates under its Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree Canada brands. In a recent nod to inflation, Dollar Tree hiked the price point for most merchandise from $1.00 to $1.25. 
The company's sales increased 4% year-over-year during the September quarter, fueled by 125 new store openings and 450 sites renovated in its combo store format, which puts Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands under one roof. Same-store sales increased slightly by 0.6%, but earnings per share fell 30% due to higher-than-expected freight costs.  
Activist investors are targeting Dollar Tree because of total returns that fall far short of its main competitor. Over the past five years, DLTR shares have risen roughly 70% compared to a nearly 200% gain for Dollar General (DG).
In November, hedge fund Mantle Ridge acquired a $1.8-billion stake in Dollar Tree and is pushing for aggressive changes that include replacing the company's entire 11-member board. The activist investor also wants to give a leadership role to former Dollar General former CEO Richard Dreiling. DLTR responded by offering to add Dreiling to its board, engage him as a consultant and give Mantle Ridge a role in re-shaping the board.    
UBS analyst Michael Lasser thinks that this dispute between the two parties can be settled amicably and likes Dollar Tree's new plan to create $3 and $5 price points in its stores to attract shoppers.  
DLTR shares have risen 18% since Mantle Ridge unveiled its equity stake in mid-November and don't look especially cheap at the moment. The stock is trading at 24 times forward earnings, which is a 32% premium to itss five-year average.
This is not Dollar Tree's first run-in with activist investors. The company was targeted by Starboard Value four years ago, which dropped its proxy fight after DLTR implemented some of its' recommendations.

GoDaddy
Market value: $12.7 billion
Dividend yield: N/A
GoDaddy (GDDY, $76.45) was an early pioneer in the website hosting space, which helped the company double its revenues in the five years following its 2015 initial public offering (IPO). However, new cloud-based challengers like Shopify (SHOP) have recently emerged to capture market share, which is creating big challenges for GDDY.  
GDDY hopes to recapture some of its mojo with new web-based tools for marketing, digital payment, website design and security. These new point-of-sale products helped GoDaddy boost revenues 14% year-over-year in the September quarter. While earnings per share declined, unlevered free cash flow grew 12% and the company is guiding for 16% free cash flow growth in 2021.
In late 2021, Wall Street learned GoDaddy was on the radar of hedge fund Starboard Value. Regulatory filings revealed the activist investor acquired a 6.5% stake in GDDY. Starboard Value hasn't yet disclosed its strategy for boosting returns, but has considerable expertise in this space, having taken Web.com Group private in a $2 billion deal four years ago and guided its subsequent merger into Symantec.  
Jeffries analyst Brent Thill named GoDaddy a top value play in 2022 after learning of Starboard Value's involvement. Thill agrees with the hedge fund's assessment that GDDY is undervalued, and feels the company is not getting the recognition it deserves for its rising free cash flows. He has a Buy rating on the stock.
Investor interest in shares peaked in late December shortly after Starboard Value's stake was announced, but shares are down roughly 10% since then. GDDY stock is still valued much more richly than web-based peers, but is trading at a nearly 56% discount to its five-year forward P/E ratio.

2022-02-04 00:00:00+00:00,"Amazon (AMZN) Q4 Earnings Crush Estimates, Sales Rise Y/Y",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-amzn-q4-earnings-crush-estimates-sales-rise-y-y,,,"Amazon.com AMZN reported fourth-quarter 2021 earnings of $27.75 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.89 per share. The bottom line significantly increased 96.9% year over year and from $6.12 per share reported in the previous quarter.

Net sales of $137.4 billion rose 9% year over year and 24% sequentially. Notably, the figure was within the management’s guidance of $130-$140 billion. However, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $137.9 billion.

North America revenues (60% of sales) rose 9% from the year-ago quarter to $82.4 billion. International revenues (27% of sales) declined 1% year over year to $37.3 billion. Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) revenues (13% of sales) rose 40% year over year to $17.8 billion.

Solid AWS momentum contributed well to top-line growth of the company.

The robust performance delivered by Amazon during the holiday season drove top-line growth. Notably, it witnessed record-breaking sales during Black Friday and Cyber Monday on which apparel, beauty, home and toys were the top-selling categories.

Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers, especially small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), remained a major positive. During the holiday season, more than 130,000 sellers worldwide exceeded sales of $100,000 on Amazon store. Sellers in the United States sold an average of 11,500 items per minute during Black Friday and Christmas. The company witnessed huge success in the Great Indian Festival sales event, in which around 30,000 sellers generated sales above $100,000.

All these factors led to year-over-year growth of 11% in sales generated by third-party seller services, which stood at $30.3 million in the reported quarter.

Strong momentum across Prime members remained another positive. The company witnessed strong growth in its subscription services in the reported quarter. Sales from the services went up 15% from the prior-year quarter to $8.12 billion.

Expanding physical presence was a tailwind. Sales from physical stores grew 17% year over year to $4.7 billion.

Additionally, strengthening smart device offerings continued to benefit the company’s fourth-quarter performance.

However, the company witnessed softness in the online store sales, which decreased 1% year over year to $66.1 billion. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates were other concerns.

Uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic, foreign exchange fluctuations, changing customer preferences, labor shortages in the market and supply-chain disruptions remain overhangs for the company.

Nevertheless, Amazon’s strong global presence, growing Prime momentum, robust data center network and an increasing number of AWS regions, improving Alexa skills, expanding smart devices portfolio, and growing efforts toward gaining strong traction among small and medium businesses are likely to drive its near-term financial performance.

Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, Amazon Care, Kuiper and Zoox remain other positives.

Notably, Amazon has announced a price hike for the monthly and annual subscriptions of Prime.

Shares of the company have risen 10.9% in the pre-market trading, which can be primarily attributed to the robust performance of AWS in the fourth quarter and the Prime price hike.
Amazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Prime & Retail Efforts
The company continued to make strong efforts toward bolstering its Prime program and the retail business.

Amazon’s rising investment in the expansion of its quick delivery services such as Free Same-Day Delivery and Faster Same-Day Delivery services across the world continued to drive its momentum among Prime shoppers. Notably, Free Same-Day Delivery is currently available in more than 90 metro areas in the United States and 58 metro areas in Europe. It is also available in Tokyo, Japan. Further, Faster Same-Day Delivery is available in 24 metro areas in the United States at present.

In addition to these, the growing adoption of Amazon’s cashier-less technology remained positive. Starbucks opened a “pickup cafe” with Amazon Go store in New York City, which allows customers to order food or beverages for pickup through the Starbucks app and collect them
from the Amazon Go store.

In London, Sainsbury's, one of the largest supermarket chains in the U.K., opened a SmartShop Pick & Go store, leveraging the Just Walk Out technology of Amazon.

Amazon’s partnership with Affirm to offer buy now, pay later flexibility continued to drive its customer momentum.

Apart from these, expanding original content and the overall content portfolio on Prime Video continued to accelerate Prime engagement.

We note that Prime Video streamed series named The Wheel of Time, Harlem, Fairfax and the final season of The Expanse in the fourth quarter.

Also, original movies, Being the Ricardos and The Tender Bar, premiered on Prime Video in the fourth quarter.

Prime Video streamed 28 local originals internationally. Maradona: Blessed Dream (Argentina), Burning (Australia), Inside Edge Season 3 (India), and The Ferragnez - The Series (Italy) are few among them.
 
The company’s growing momentum in live sports streaming was another positive. Prime Video had the strongest viewership for live sports in the fourth quarter, with the 2021-2022 Thursday Night Football season, which delivered the highest average minute audience. Also, the Manchester United vs. Arsenal soccer game on Dec 2, 2021, became the most-watched Premier League match ever.

Additionally, the strengthening momentum of Amazon Music contributed well.
Expanding AWS Portfolio: A Key Catalyst
AWS, which witnessed strong top-line growth, continued to gain customer momentum in the fourth quarter, courtesy of its highly reliable services portfolio.

In the fourth quarter, Amazon unveiled a visual development environment — AWS Amplify Studio — which enables web application user interface creation with minimal coding.

The company introduced AWS Private 5G, which enables enterprises to deploy and scale their 5G mobile network seamlessly.

AWS announced a managed service called AWS IoT FleetWise, which helps collect and transfer data from millions of vehicles to the cloud in real-time cost-efficiently.

It announced AWS IoT TwinMaker, which helps in the quick creation of digital twins of devices, equipment and processes.

The company unveiled three Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, namely C7g, Trn1 and Im4gn/Is4gen/I4i.

It announced four storage services and capabilities — Amazon Simple Storage Service Glacier Instant Retrieval, Amazon FSx for OpenZFS, Amazon EBS Snapshots Archive and AWS Backup.

AWS introduced six capabilities for Amazon SageMaker, namely Canvas, Ground Truth Plus, Studio, Training Compiler, Inference Recommender and Serverless Inference.

The company unveiled a managed wide area network (WAN) service, namely AWS Cloud WAN, which aids in the seamless development, management, operation and monitoring of a global network with the help of a central dashboard.

It also announced the general availability of Babelfish for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition, which helps run Microsoft SQL Server applications on Amazon Aurora seamlessly.

The company rolled out AWS Mainframe Modernization, which aids in the quick migration of mainframe and legacy workloads to the cloud.

It introduced serverless options for Amazon Redshift, Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka, and Amazon EMR. Also, the company unveiled three database capabilities — Amazon RDS Custom, Amazon DynamoDB Standard-Infrequent Access and Amazon DevOps Guru for RDS.

Coming to regions and Availability Zones, the company has 81 Availability Zones across 25 geographic regions. The company intends to roll out additional 24 Availability Zones and eight AWS regions.

On the heels of the expanding services portfolio, regions and Availability Zones, AWS experienced strong growth in its clientele with the addition of United Airlines, Rivian, American International Group, Qualtrics, Richemont and Gilead Sciences, which selected AWS as the preferred cloud provider.

Aurora selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider for machine learning training and cloud-based simulation workloads. Also, adidas and Under Armour picked AWS as its preferred cloud provider for SAP.

Nasdaq signed a multi-year agreement with AWS in a bid to accelerate the development of advanced cloud-enabled infrastructure for the world's capital markets.

Discovery expanded its relationship with AWS to drive its transformation in the cloud. The Federal National Mortgage Association — Fannie Mae — picked AWS to shift IT workloads from on-premise data centers to AWS.

Pfizer picked AWS to leverage its capabilities in analytics, machine learning, compute, storage, security, and cloud data warehousing for its laboratory, clinical manufacturing, and clinical supply-chain efforts. Also, Roche Group utilizes AWS for its majority of cloud workloads.
Robust Smart Devices Portfolio
Amazon’s strength in the smart devices portfolio continued to benefit its performance in the fourth quarter.

The company’s expanding portfolio of Fire TV remained beneficial. Notably, the number of Fire TV devices sold across the world stands at 150.

Apart from this, advancing skills and features of Alexa helped the company in gaining traction among customers in the reported quarter.

Strengthening Echo smart speaker offerings contributed well. The company added a motion detection feature with the help of which Echo devices recognize movement through ultrasound technology.

Additionally, Amazon rolled out the Amazon Smart Air Quality Monitor in Canada, France, Italy, Spain, the U.K., and the United States.
Quarter in Detail
Product sales (52% of sales) increased 0.5% year over year to $71.4 billion. Service sales (48% of sales) rose 21.1% from the year-ago quarter to $65.9 billion.

On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow was an outflow of $9.1 billion in the reported quarter against an inflow of $2.6 billion in the prior quarter.
Guidance
For first-quarter 2021, Amazon expects net sales between $112 billion and $117 billion. Further, net sales are expected to grow 3-8% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales is pegged at $121.33 billion.

2022-02-03 00:00:00+00:00,Why Dollar Tree (DLTR) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-dollar-tree-dltr-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again,,,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Dollar Tree (DLTR), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry.
When looking at the last two reports, this discount retailer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 10.24%, on average, in the last two quarters.
For the last reported quarter, Dollar Tree came out with earnings of $0.96 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.95 per share, representing a surprise of 1.05%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.03 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.23 per share, delivering a surprise of 19.42%.
Price and EPS Surprise
Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Dollar Tree lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Dollar Tree currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.07%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.
Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

In latest developments, management agreed to purchase the assets and operations of four refrigerated distribution centers and the related private transportation fleet from its partner Burris Logistics. This will help the buyer insource its perishable supply chain. However, terms of the deal remained under wraps.

This deal consists of four perishable goods distribution centers (Rocky Hill, CT; Orlando, FL; Elkton, MD; Independence, KY) along with the personnel of these facilities, the associated real property and the capital assets for operations. The pending buyout is unanimously approved by both companies’ boards and is subject to regulatory and traditional closing conditions. This is likely to conclude during the second quarter of 2022.

Via the addition of four distribution centers and a transportation fleet, BJ's Wholesale Club will be able to strengthen supply-chain facilities and drive overall growth. This will aid BJ to offer top-quality and fresh products to consumers.

BJ's Wholesale Club’s partnership with Burris Logistics dates back to more than 20 years. This partnership complements BJ’s perishable business and supports supply-chain functions. Burris Logistics is quite a popular enterprise offering temperature-controlled distribution and logistics services across the United States.
What’s More?

2022-01-23 00:00:00+00:00,"Got $1,000? 3 Inflation-Resistant Real Estate Investments to Make",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/got-%241000-3-inflation-resistant-real-estate-investments-to-make,,,"So, you have $1,000 you want to invest somewhere that will stand up to inflation? A great way to leverage that opportunity is to think about the long term, about how you can grow that money through this inflationary cycle and those yet to come.
Identifying great companies and then sticking with them is the key to building wealth through this economic cycle and any other, and real estate investing has a lot to offer. This is where real estate investment trusts (REITs) come in.
Most REITs own and operate income-producing properties and pass the vast majority of their taxable income and tax liability on to shareholders. They're a great vehicle for tapping into the profit potential of all kinds of real estate and can often hedge against inflation by raising the rent on their properties, especially if they have a tenant base that's pretty inflation-resistant itself.
Here are three examples in three different industry segments, each of which would be a good choice for someone wanting to invest $1,000 and let it sit and generate passive income and capital appreciation for years to come.

Alexandria Real Estate Equities
Alexandria Real Estate Equities (NYSE: ARE) is a major owner and operator of lab and related office space in the thriving life-sciences research and development communities in markets such as Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, New York City, North Carolina's Research Triangle, and Bethesda, Maryland.
While it's a member of the office sector, this REIT's clients are businesses that don't readily lend themselves to remote work. For instance, Alexandria's lineup of 700 or so tenants includes a who's who of big pharma, including the two leading COVID vaccine makers, Pfizer and Moderna. The latter, in fact, will have Alexandria as the landlord for its new corporate and research and development (R&D) headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Alexandria's clients tend to be well-heeled, so they can pay the rent even as it rises. Income also will be rising in coming years as the company brings on about 25 million square feet of new rentable space in various stages of development. That will be on top of the 64 million square feet of income-generating space the REIT already has.
Realty Income
The ability to pass on rising costs is key to an operation's ability to fight inflation. Net-lease retail REITs fit that bill particularly well by requiring the tenant to pay for taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs even as they rise. Combine that with a rock-solid list of tenants in essential businesses and a long record of consistently rising shareholder payouts, and you get Realty Income (NYSE: O) -- one of the most solid members of the REIT world.
Realty Income has more than 650 tenants spread across its 11,000 or so properties throughout the U.S., with a sprinkling in the U.K. and Spain to boot. Its biggest clients include Dollar General, Dollar Tree-Family Dollar, 7-Eleven, Walgreens and FedEx.
These are the kinds of companies that are loathe to change locations and typically sign long-term leases with rent escalations built in. And that helps ensure Realty Income can continue to build on its record of paying dividends every month, without exception, for more than 50 years.
PLD Total Return Level data by YCharts.
Prologis
Prologis (NYSE: PLD) is the largest of the industrial REITs, providing critical logistics and warehouse space to about 5,800 tenants through its portfolio of approximately 1 billion square feet of wholly or partly owned properties in high-growth markets in 19 countries.
Amazon, Home Depot, and FedEx head up that list of major tenants occupying what Prologis describes as two major areas of focus: business-to-business and retail/online fulfillment. The logistics facilities those businesses require are now at a premium due to COVID-19 driving e-commerce demand and global supply chain disruptions that are, in turn, creating a new emphasis on ""just in case"" warehouse space closer to home for major enterprises of nearly every type.
Prologis Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hamid Moghadam made headlines last fall when he said that America's warehouse space was basically sold out. His company's just-released fourth-quarter 2021 report says Prologis properties were 98.2% leased at year-end and, in Moghadam's words, ""Demand for our 1 billion square foot global portfolio shows no signs of slowing and we are positioned ideally to meet our customers' most critical real estate needs.""
