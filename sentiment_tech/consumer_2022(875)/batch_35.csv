2022-01-25 00:00:00+00:00,eBay Q4 Earnings Preview: 1 Key Metric to Watch,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-q4-earnings-preview%3A-1-key-metric-to-watch,,,"E-commerce retailer and auction site eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) could report fiscal 2021 fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 1. The company thrived at the pandemic's onset when hundreds of millions of people switched much of their shopping to online platforms for fear of contracting COVID-19.
Now that billions of doses of effective vaccines against the coronavirus have been administered, folks are cautiously returning to old shopping habits in person. The reversal of pandemic behavior is hurting eBay's sales and customer engagement. Still, the rise of supply-chain bottlenecks and shortages could have played a positive role in eBay's upcoming earnings results. This is one metric investors should pay attention to in Q4. Let's look more closely.

Consumers may have returned to eBay
Recall that eBay does not own any of the inventory for sale on its website. Instead, its role is to connect buyers and sellers and facilitate transactions on its platform. eBay makes money by taking a percentage of each sale (the take rate) and it has been upping that portion. From second-quarter 2020 to third-quarter 2021, eBay increased its transaction take rate from 9.2% to 12.1%. The rise in its take rate was the primary reason eBay increased revenue by 11% year over year in Q3.
Gross merchandise value (the total sum of sales on its platform) declined from $21.7 billion in Q3 2020 to $19.4 billion in Q3 2021 (ended Sept. 30). The fall in spending on eBay coincides with the economy's reopening. Widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines has allowed folks to feel safer venturing outside where they have more options for spending their money. Of course, if people are spending more money shopping in person, that will be detrimental to e-commerce businesses like eBay.
However, the pandemic has also led to another evolving trend: worldwide supply-chain shortages. While it's true that folks are feeling better about resuming some activities they gave up since the pandemic's onset, working in person does not appear to be one of them. It makes sense looking at it from a laborer's viewpoint; your wages are roughly the same, but you are at risk of contracting a potentially deadly virus on the job.
It's no surprise that fewer people are willing to work under these conditions -- and many others are unable to do so because of infection during any given week. So the production and movement of goods have been constrained, and consumers are more often finding their favorite items sold out.
Therein lies a potential tailwind for eBay -- the site is rarely sold out of anything. If an item is sold out at your favorite retailer, eBay probably has it for sale. Of course, it is probably listed at a higher price, but you can choose to pay the premium and make the purchase. So the persistence of supply-chain shortages throughout the holiday quarter could have boosted eBay's gross merchandise value.
What it could mean for eBay investors
Analysts on Wall Street expect eBay to report revenue of $2.6 billion in Q4 and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.00. If it hits the EPS estimate, that would be an increase of 16.3% from the same quarter a year earlier.
eBay's stock is already down over 10% year to date in 2022. If it surprises to the upside, it could cause its share price to reverse.

This video was recorded on Jan. 06, 2022.
Chris Hill: Today on Motley Fool Money in the wake of a record year, we've got three potential IPOs investors should be keeping their eyes on in 2022. That plus the deal of the day coming up right now. I'm Chris Hill, joined by Motley Fool Senior Analyst, Bill Mann. Thanks for being here.
Bill Mann: Hey, Chris. How are you doing? Happy new year.
Chris Hill: Happy new year. We've also got a pair of partnerships, one in consumer goods, one in EVs. We will. Get to those soon, but we're going to start with the deal of the day. Reuters is reporting that The New York Times (NYSE: NYT) has agreed to buy The Athletic, a subscription-based sports site, in a deal worth $550 million, shares of The New York Times up one percent earlier today, perhaps an indication that Wall Street likes the price of this deal. There are a couple of things to get to hear Bill, but let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first because you and I had the same reaction when we saw this headline, which was, ""If this is true, I really hope The New York Times doesn't screw up The Athletic.""
Bill Mann: Chris, it's so funny because you put out a tweet late last year or last week just listing your love of The Athletic and how it was a great gift. I want to turn this into an advertising segment for The Athletic. But to me, it is a wonderful sports page and it is, I think, what The New York Times sports page used to be and should still be today. Yes, it will be interesting to see if The New York Times manages to screw up The Athletic from a user perspective because to me, this 550 million that they spent is something that they should have had in-house anyway, starting 15 years ago. This is something that New York Times should have been able to dominate.
Chris Hill: Let's talk about the business of The New York Times for a second. We will come back to The Athletic, but you look at the stock, it's basically flat over the past year, but you widen that out to five years. This has been a solidly market-beating stock. Maybe the Iconic Newspaper brand in the United States and one of the few in the world, the way that the business has really adapted to mobile, adapted to online, built up their digital subscription business. You have to tip your hat to them because for years they really weren't getting it done. Over the past five years or so, they've really had a great run in terms of growing the underlying business of what they do.
Bill Mann: They really have. To click out even further, the stock of The New York Times is basically the same place as it was in 2003. That seems like bad news. That seems like for people who've owned this company for a long time, it has not gone that well. They basically just gotten whatever dividends were paid, but it's a ten-bagger since 2009. You can understand very well in the newspaper business, in the media journalism business, what existential crisis they faced in the rise of the Internet, in the rise of free content. The New York Times has done a very good job in reorienting itself into an online first-world. They deserve all sorts of credit for that.
As a business though, some of the ways that they have done this was by stripping certain news bureaus in certain segments of their business bare. This is what worries me as someone who adores The Athletic is that that's an easy move for them. They can look and they could say, ""Okay, we're no longer going to have someone who is going to cover Boston College sports"". That which they do now. We're no longer going to have somebody who covers Watford Football Club, which they do now because it's easier and as a business to concentrate on the big stuff. But that's what's made The Athletic special so as a user, I'm concerned. As a lover of business, I understand exactly why The New York Times is making this move, and I think it will be a good one for them. Hopefully, it will be a good one for us.
Chris Hill: Just to wrap up when you think about Spotify buying The Ringer, this reported deal, if this gets finalized, it is going to be interesting to see if there are other sports sites out there that either get approached or put themselves out there on their own. In terms of The New York Times, it seems like a smart use of $550 million, but this is one of the reasons we say acquisitions are tough because not all of them work out.
Bill Mann: Not all of them work out. This is $550 million that by all rights The New York Times never should have had to spend. Whatever else you want to say about The New York Times, it is the journal of record for the largest, most important city in the United States of America and one of the most important cities in the world. The moves they have had to make were the things that allowed entities like Barstool Sports, like The Athletic to become the media powerhouses that they are.
Chris Hill: For the second day in a row, shares of Rivian Automotive are down more than five percent. Among the problems facing the electric vehicle maker is the fact that automaker Stellantis announced a partnership with Amazon, in which Amazon will provide Cloud services and in-vehicle software starting in 2024. Just a reminder because I needed to be reminded of this, Stellantis is the company formerly known as Fiat Chrysler, a number of automotive brands including Dodge, Jeep, Maserati. I think, among other things, Bill, this is maybe a little bit of a wake-up call for at least some people out there that just because Amazon has a financial stake in Rivian, does not mean that Amazon is not going to work with other automotive companies.
Bill Mann: Oh, yes. When you heard Stellantis, doesn't that sound like it's a treatment for ringworm or something? Stellantis may cause excess hunger. I understand why they would rebrand. I think in a world in which a lot of the most speculative companies have been hit really hard, Rivian up until this last week was one of the final survivors. It is a reminder that when you have a smaller company, which Rivian is, I know it's got a huge market cap but it is a tiny company. The big company that are paired together, the big company ultimately views that small company as an option, as optionality. If they have other deals that they can sign that helped the big company, they are obviously going to. Stellantis, now that we know that it's not a treatment for something or for athlete's foot, is a huge company with huge nameplates that have an interest in the electric vehicle market. They have an interest in being a player in this segment. There's just no guarantee that Rivian with 200 cars on the road, 200 trucks on the road at this point is going to be the winner. Amazon wants to be the winner and they don't really care that much what the vehicle is that gets them there.
Chris Hill: By the way, on yesterday's show, Emily Flippen and I were talking about Nikola, and two things out of that. One, I mentioned Ford's F-150 in comparison because that's where my brain went. Obviously, Nikola makes semi-trucks not pick up. I apologize to the dozens of listeners,
Bill Mann: They are all trucks to you, pal.
Chris Hill: For not connecting the dots there. But one of the things we talked about was just, you think about a company like Apple and the years of rumors that Apple is going to produce a car at some point. We'll see whether or not that comes to fruition. You look at this announcement, this partnership between Stellantis and Amazon, do you think somewhere in Amazon, there are aspirations to eventually be an automaker or do you think they are content at least for now just to say, ""No, we want to provide the Cloud services. We want to provide the software. We're not interested in actually making the steel and the wheels"".
Bill Mann: It's funny you say that because I think a lot of people miss with Amazon now, particularly with their logistics business. They already are in the steel bending and the heavy capital markets, they really are. There is nothing about the EV industry or the automotive industry that I would put beyond a company like Amazon as forward-seeking as they are. The thing that is true about Amazon though is that they have gone about going into new markets in one of two ways. They've either tried to be first, they've tried to create a new market, or they've gone in once the market is situated. There's a very famous Jeff Bezos quote, ""Your margin is my opportunity"". You look at the EV industry and you look at the promises that are being made, there was a great Wall Street Journal article that came out last year and it was about the EV SPACs that came out and five different SPACs for electric vehicle companies promised or forecast that they were going to make $10 billion in revenue within the next five years which sounds awesome and it is because it's only been done by one company ever and that's Google. I think that Amazon right now is making lots of bets and this is not necessarily a negative for Rivian, but they are not the only people that Amazon is going to dance with, and I think it would have been a mistake to consider that otherwise from the start.
Chris Hill: Last thing before we move on, just broadly in the electric vehicle industry, what are you watching this year? This is one of those industries that's grown significantly over time, both in terms of the players involved and in terms of the optionality for investors. What are you watching?
Bill Mann: To me, the most interesting companies in the EV space are not actually Apple or Sony, or even Rivian. To me, the most interesting ones in the space are the companies that are already making a whole lot of cars that are making that shift. There was a report that Volkswagen and Toyota were preparing to put $170 billion into the EV industry, into their own EV gains. Now, I don't know about you, but to me, $170 billion is a lot. That is a lot of money that they are bringing to bear to come into this market. They already have the manufacturing know-how, they have the supply chains. They really are the companies that are the ones that Tesla, I think should be thinking about, as opposed to the Rivian's and the Lucid's of the world, which have a much longer way to go and have that same learning curve to go through that Tesla has already gone up.
Chris Hill: Constellation Brands is the beer, wine, and spirits company with a portfolio that includes Corona beer, Modelo, Robert Mondavi wines. Third-quarter revenue was higher than expected, but the earnings report takes a back seat to the announcement that Constellation Brands is teaming up with Coca-Cola to create cocktails under the Fresca soft drink brand. Fresca mixed cocktails are due to launch here in the United States later this year. I think if you're a shareholder of either of these businesses, you got to be excited about this news.
Bill Mann: I think you're pretty fired up about this news. Once again, as an American eater and an American drinker, I'm also pretty excited about this news. There really is a third player here and it is this. I think the pandemic really pushed this forward. What you're seeing with companies like Constellation is a war that's going on with them versus the Beer Companies. They have found an opportunity where liquors can replace beer in a lot of segments. It has not been that case forever, down to the fact that there are different excise taxes for a serving of spirit versus the serving of beer. I think the beer manufacturers are the ones who need to be really nervous about this trend, about the canned and pre-packaged liquor and spirit drinks that are coming onto the market faster and faster and faster, especially as it pertains to PepsiCo and Coke getting involved. Because neither PepsiCo nor Coke have any truck with the Brewing Industry. This to me is great news for them, it is further news to be concerned about. If you are a Brewing Company, and InBev, Boston Beer, companies like that.
Chris Hill: You look at what Hard Seltzer has done for various beverage companies over the past 4-5 years in terms of the growth of that beverage, it makes sense to Coca-Cola would look at Fresca, essentially a grapefruit carbonated beverage and say, oh, we think we can do something here. Coca-Cola says that right now Fresca is the fastest-growing brand in their soft drink portfolio, and I get that that's off a base that's much lower than Coke or Diet Coke. But still, this really seems like something to get excited about. Not just for consumers for beverages like you and me, but for the shareholders of these companies. I'm reminded, Bill, of Bill Newlands, who is the CEO of Constellation Brands. He's been there almost three years, he currently spent the first two years on the job undoing a lot of what his predecessor did and dealing with the start of the global pandemic. But the stock is up around 50 percent since he took over. That's pretty good when you consider how much time he spent essentially rearranging things.
Bill Mann: It's funny as you were saying that, my mind start wondering, is there any beverage that's more of like a hidden MVP than grapefruit in the alcohol space as a mixer? It's really an underrated mixer.
Chris Hill: No, I think that's a big impetus for why they're doing that.
Bill Mann: I do too. But just as you said grapefruit, I don't really get excited for grapefruit juice or grapefruit, but grapefruit as a mixture for naughty drinks, I am all about. Constellation Brands has been a roll-up forever. They had a bunch of different disparate areas. They were in golf. They were in a bunch of different segments that had no real tie, and although golf and drinking really are a direct tie-in, but not something that's necessarily that exploitable. They have done a really good job streamlining in the last three years, and now they're making some moves. They're making moves that have happened really because of the changes and habits that have been brought by the pandemic. To me, Constellation Brands, it's always been an interesting company because it's been a mismanaged one. It's not mismanaged anymore.
Chris Hill: When this launches later this year, I'm pretty inclined to just pick some up, invite myself over to your back patio and we've been several for ourselves.
Bill Mann: Trust verify my friend, trust verify.
Chris Hill: Bill Mann, thanks so much for being here.
Bill Mann: Thanks, Chris. Good to see you. [MUSIC]
Chris Hill: There were hundreds of IPOs in 2021. Some splash here than others. Businesses like Robinhood, Bumble, and yes, Rivian Automotive, raised billions each in their IPOs last year. What IPOs, can investors look forward to this year? Dylan Lewis has more. [MUSIC]
Dylan Lewis: I'm joined by Motley Fool contributor Brian Feroldi. I think the one thing we can probably say with some confidence, Brian, is we're going to see some big names in 2022. We already have a confidential filing from a particularly big consumer-facing brand, and we have rumored IPOs for some other ones as well. We're going to talk about some of the most anticipated ones for 2022. I think we should start with Instacart. This is a business that has really been at the forefront of the pandemic, like a Zoom-type business, where as soon as March 2020 hit, they were front and center because they were uniquely positioned to meet the challenges of the pandemic for consumers.
Brian Feroldi: You said it right. Instacart had a fabulous 2020, and if you're not familiar with the business, Instacart is an operator of a grocery delivery and pickup service primarily in United States and Canada. Users can go on their website or use their mobile app to order over 500 million products across their catalog and get deliveries from over 40,000 stores in 5,500 cities. Now, in exchange for doing so, they offer a pretty modest delivery fee, four dollars if it's a same-day order, over $35. You could also have charged extra fees if you want to one-hour delivery or delivery from a club store or for delivery fees is under $35. But to your point, this is a service that saw rapid growth in 2020 due to COVID.
Dylan Lewis: Yeah, and I think what they're trying to do is really establish an ongoing relationship with these folks who have flocked to the platform. I'm someone who uses the service in the pandemic, having never used it before because I got COVID in late 2021 and I was in a position where I needed to be able to order groceries despite not being able to leave my house. It was absolutely fantastic, was able to put in an order and then within a couple of hours had the groceries at my door. Used it several times and it made staying at home a lot easier. I think they are trying to establish that ongoing relationship with users through more of a membership model. We see them aggressively pushing this Instacart Express membership which is zero dollar delivery fee on every order over $35 and also bring down the service fees as well. Brian, I think one of the things that's interesting about this business is it was rumored to be going public in 2021. Those plans were later push back as Instacart transition mid-year from founder Apoorva Mehta at the helm to his chosen replacement, Fidji Simo, who is now running the company as CEO. Typically we tend to see a new management team get a little bit of a grace period before that company will come public.
Brian Feroldi: Yeah, that makes sense. That might be a little bit unfortunate of the timing there. To your point, they reported some extremely rapid growth over the last year. It's going to be interesting to see if that growth rate maintains moving forward, which will allow them to generate the valuation that they want to get. But the bulk case for this company is pretty straightforward. It's very clear that consumers really like having groceries and other items delivered directly to the door as opposed to going out in shopping form. Instacart is the clear rear in the space and they own roughly three-quarters of the third-party intermediary grocery sales market. It's obvious to me that that market is going to continue to grow although at what rate is up for debate.
Dylan Lewis: Yeah, I think if you're looking for other things to be positive about this business, I think there's some optionality here. One of the reasons that they were looking to delay their IPO in addition to leadership changes is they talked about building out the services for the grocery stores that they serve. I think one of the other things to keep an eye on is what they're able to do with their ad market. They've talked a little bit about the ad business that they think they might be able to build. Long term, they see it being worth something in the tens of billions of dollars. The new CEO, Fidji Simo, has a decade of experience at Facebook. She was the head of the Facebook app before she left. I think she probably knows a thing or two about monetization, Brian. The challenge I think for me with this company is what does growth look like for a business? You mentioned the torrid year-over-year growth in 2020, 3x revenue from the year before. We're probably looking at something much more moderate in 2021, 10-15 percent. What does this look like long term for this company?
Brian Feroldi: That is the real question and it really is going to depend on can they get that advertising business up and running, and will consumers continue to use this product moving forward? That's just something we're going to have to wait and find out.
Dylan Lewis: The second company we want to talk about is Reddit. If you didn't know about this company prior to March of 2021, you heard about it. It was almost impossible to avoid, Brian, in the new cycle in the early part of the year.
Brian Feroldi: Yes, for those that are unfamiliar Reddit is a hybrid mix of a social media platform, a news platform, a content aggregator platform, and an online community, all in one. This company burst onto the scenes in 2021. Thanks to the subreddit WallStreetBets, which made a whole lot of noise related to GameStop and AMC. That really put this company on every American's radar.
Dylan Lewis: Yes, it's funny. It's one of those sneaky big Internet properties that people either love or have never heard of. I think they benefited tremendously from basically the marketing event that was WallStreetBets and Reddit and everything that was happening with GameStop and AMC in the early part of 2021. But just to give you a sense of the reach of this company, Reddit is in the top 10 most visited websites in the US, according to SEMrush, ahead of the likes of eBay, Walmart, Twitter, ESPN, and CNN. It's one of those sneaky big businesses but it looks a little bit more like a Twitter or a Snap when you look at some of the user numbers. In fact, it's even smaller than those properties, Brian.
Brian Feroldi: Yes, it's very clear that the company is still figuring out the monetization path forward while they have about 52 million daily active users. They brought in about $100 million in advertising revenue in the second quarter of this year. That's a $400 million annualized run rate. They are well below the monetization rate of many of their peers?
Dylan Lewis: Yes, and I think a lot of the things that people are going to look at when they see this business is going to be similar to criticism that were lobbed at the likes of Snap and Pinterest when they were coming public. How big is the user group for this business really going to be? How effective are their monetization efforts going to be while they aren't very monetized right now via ads and via some light membership model things are exploring. It's a big opportunity for them. It's also saying that they have to realize over time.
Brian Feroldi: It certainly is, and platforms like this that draw and that many eyeballs have a whole bunch of optionality naturally embedded into them while they clearly haven't made that advertising a superstar as of yet. With that, many people come into this platform every day and it's clearly beloved by your users. It's very likely that they could roll out some services in the future that open up new revenue opportunities.
Dylan Lewis: Yes, and I think one of the major risks that people need to keep in mind is because this is a user-generated content platform, they are going to run into a lot of the criticism of content moderation, really their moderation practices as they come public. I think there's going to be up more scrutiny on this business. We've started to see it already and there's a long history with content moderation for this company. But when you are a publicly traded company, when you have a little bit more awareness that your business exists even for people who aren't users, that comes with more scrutiny, Brian.
Brian Feroldi: Certainly is. Another risk to keep in mind is those 52 million users they have, they tend to be very tech-savvy users themselves which means that they're very confident with using things like ad-blockers to making sure that those things don't see their eyeballs. That stands in direct contrast to other platforms that have billions of users, some of which may not be as tech-savvy. That might be a long-term headwind for Reddit to drive revenue growth.
Dylan Lewis: One final thing I'll throw in here, and I don't know if this is necessarily a bear-case item or a bulk case item for this company. But a statement that could really go either way because the company was the gathering place for WallStreetBets. There is going to be a large retail following for the stock, it's just the way it is. Reddit co-founder and CEO, Steve Huffman said, ""I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our shareholders to be users"". I think that's the attitude that you generally want management to have. But I think Brian, we have seen the retail investor community on Reddit do some pretty wild things to stocks. Hard to know if at the valuation this is likely coming public at 10 billion, maybe 15 billion, they'll be able to move it very much, but it's going to be a stock that's in the news quite a bit once it comes public.
Brian Feroldi: Yeah, certainly will. I'm very confident that their users are going to absolutely love the business and the brands. It'll be curious to see once they start talking about the company's stock on Reddit, what happens next.
Dylan Lewis: Brian, the final company we're going to talk about is Stripe. It might be the most fantastic private company you've never heard of. I think it's the easiest way to explain this business.
Brian Feroldi: The ads are very good that if you are listening to this, you have interacted with Stripe and you probably didn't know it. Stripe is a fintech company that is focused on a software-as-a-service business model. Essentially, what they do is they mediate payments between companies and their customers. They have a whole bunch of tools that make it easy to accept payments in over 135 currencies all around the world. In addition to that, their platform can help things like accepting in-person payments at stores, rolling out buy now, pay later features. They offer advanced security. You can offer tools for reporting, for invoicing. You can issue virtual and physical cards, you can get financing through Stripe Capital. In essence, this company is a lot like Square.
Dylan Lewis: Yeah, and we've seen that's a wildly successful business model. Payments are a wonderful place to be. It almost doesn't matter where you are in the value chain for, Brian.
Brian Feroldi: It is a very lucrative place to be. As a feather in this company's hat, not only does it have thousands of customers out there, including the likes of Instacart, Salesforce, Amazon, Slack, and more. But both Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, who are both co-founders of PayPal, were early investors in this business.
Dylan Lewis: Yeah, you generally like to see that a lot of people have made a lot of money investing alongside PayPal Mafia. I don't expect this business to be any different. Of the companies we've talked about, Brian, this is the largest one by far. The implied valuation is deep in the tens of billions already.
Brian Feroldi: Yeah, that's going to be a major challenge for this company moving forward to grow into that valuation that is likely to garner once it comes public. But the bulk case for this company is really strong. I mean, it's a natural tailwind from e-commerce growth, a natural tailwind from growth in emerging markets, the switching costs are going to be high. This is a founder-led business. In fact, I predict that once we dig into this company's S1, we're going to really like what we see.
Dylan Lewis: That's the thing with all these discussions, is we're going off of what we know. Private companies are notoriously secretive about their information and so we're going to have to wait to get more and so we can really make up our minds on these businesses. The nice thing is, Brian, over the course of the year, we're going to get to see all of these filings come in and hopefully even more. Some of those smaller businesses that offer some even more upside. Can't wait until we do. Until then. Thanks for joining me, Brian.

2022-01-24 00:00:00+00:00,PetMed (PETS) Q3 Earnings and Revenues Miss Estimates,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/petmed-pets-q3-earnings-and-revenues-miss-estimates,,,"PetMed (PETS) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.21 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.30 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.38 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -30%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this pet pharmacy company would post earnings of $0.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.31, delivering a surprise of -8.82%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.
PetMed, which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $60.72 million for the quarter ended December 2021, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.91%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $65.9 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
PetMed shares have lost about 5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -7.7%.
What's Next for PetMed?
While PetMed has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for PetMed: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.31 on $71.5 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.14 on $282.17 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Commerce is currently in the bottom 23% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
eBay (EBAY), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2021.
This e-commerce company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.99 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.6% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.
eBay's revenues are expected to be $2.61 billion, down 9% from the year-ago quarter.

2022-01-21 00:00:00+00:00,Got $500? 3 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy Right Now,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/got-%24500-3-no-brainer-stocks-to-buy-right-now,,,"The new year looks like it's starting off on the wrong foot for investors. After a 27% increase in 2021, the S&P 500 stumbled in January. Tech stocks continue to fall as the world copes with the relentless economic woes of the pandemic. But that doesn't mean there aren't any great investing opportunities. If you have $500 available to invest after paying off any debt and saving for emergencies, there are great options that offer different benefits when the market may not look like it's in growth mode. Consider Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST), Realty Income (NYSE: O), and PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL).
1. Costco
Costco stock didn't make a lot of waves last year, but it still gained more than 50%. That's a lot more than many growth stocks, and once again, it demonstrates the retail behemoth's market power.
Image source: Getty Images.
Costco's sales have been rising since the pandemic started, but unlike other retailers whose comparable store sales -- or sales at stores open at least a year -- have begun to decelerate as people go back to other kinds of spending, Costco's continue to stay robust.
Costco is among a small number of companies that release monthly reports, and in December, revenue increased 16% while comparable sales rose 14.5%. In the 2022 first fiscal quarter, which ended Nov. 21, revenue increased 17%, and comps increased 15%.
There might be several reasons for Cosco's superior performance. One important and probably temporary catalyst is inflation. As prices rise, consumers tend to shop where they can get the most for their money, and Costco's low prices attract more customers. Costco has also had to raise some prices to account for rising costs due to both inflation and supply chain issues. But there are many reasons to be confident that Costco will keep growing even in a regular economic atmosphere or in any kind of market.
Costco ended fiscal 2021 with an 18% revenue increase to $192 billion. Customers love shopping there because of its low prices, and it typically boasts around a 90% membership retention rate.
Executive memberships are increasing, which cost double the standard membership fee, and the company still has a relatively low store count -- 828 worldwide, with only 572 in the U.S. It opened 20 stores in fiscal 2020 and plans for 27 new stores in 2022.
Wherever the economy turns this year, Costco is likely to be a winner. Shares cost almost $500 these days, but one share can get you far.
2. Realty Income
When the stock market is volatile, there's one thing that can help you get through: dividends. Although, as we saw in 2020, even dividends can stop when the situation calls for it. That's a highly unlikely scenario, though -- most companies have continued their dividends throughout this difficult time. Even if you're not counting on dividends to fund retirement, they can be a great source of income to hedge against unstable market prices for any portfolio.
Image source: Getty Images.
Realty Income is one of the best dividend stocks on the market. It pays a monthly, growing dividend with a high yield -- 4.3% at the current share price.
The company has increased its dividend 112 times since it went public in 1994 and has paid out 618 consecutive monthly dividends since its founding in 1969. That continued throughout the 2008 crash and all of the smaller corrections over decades.
Realty Income is structured as a real estate investment trust (REIT). It owns properties all over the world, and it's increased its property count from 630 when it went public to more than 10,000 today, including its merger with VEREIT at the end of 2021. It has 650 tenant clients in 60 industries, but its focus on essentials makes it stand out. Its top three clients are 7-Eleven, Walgreens, and Dollar General.
Shares cost less than $70, so even if you don't have a lot to invest, you can benefit from owning Realty Income stock.
3. PayPal
PayPal stock has been on the receiving end of the backlash against tech stocks, and its value has fallen 29% over the past year. It's one of the major companies powering digital payments, and with the shift to online shopping and other forms of cashless payments, PayPal continues to grow in importance and sales.

In 2020, PayPal posted some of its best quarters ever, but it began to slow toward the end of 2021. That was due to tough comps to beat from 2020, its split with eBay, and the general macroeconomic environment. it still posted a 26% year-over-year increase in total payment volume to $310 billion and a 13% revenue increase to $6.8 billion in the third quarter; it's expecting an 18% year-over-year revenue increase for all of 2021.
PayPal isn't anywhere near slowing down. It recently signed a new deal with Amazon for users of it Venmo service to be able to use the app at checkout, and many companies are signing up for QR code checkout. Digital payments are only going to get stronger, and PayPal has an edge in its size and innovative culture.
At the current price of about $170, the shares are trading at 42 times trailing 12-month earnings. That brings the valuation down to a more reasonable level in line with -- or even inexpensive compared with -- the company's future growth prospects. That makes this a great time to buy shares of this fintech stock.

2022-01-21 00:00:00+00:00,The Worst Mistake PayPal Investors Can Make Right Now,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-worst-mistake-paypal-investors-can-make-right-now,,,"High-growth tech stocks have been getting hammered in recent months, thanks to heightened economic uncertainty caused by soaring inflation, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and tightening monetary policy. Among this unfortunate group is fintech leader PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), whose stock is down roughly 41% over the past six months. At recent prices, the business sported a market cap of $205 billion.
While it's easy to take your signal from the rest of the market, you're always better off ignoring the noise and thinking independently. Using this perspective, the worst mistake PayPal shareholders can make right now is to panic and sell their stock.
Let's find out why.
Image source: Getty Images.
PayPal is a winning investment
Since spinning off from eBay in July 2015, PayPal's stock has returned nearly 400%, crushing the broader S&P 500. The company has been a winning investment because of its impressive fundamentals. From 2015 through 2020, annual sales more than doubled from $9.2 billion to $21.5 billion. During this time, net income and operating cash flow jumped 242% and 130%, respectively.
Pioneering the growth of electronic payments has certainly been lucrative for PayPal. And the rise of online shopping has helped propel this trend. Total payment volume (TPV), a key metric to pay attention to, was a whopping $310 billion in the most recent quarter (third-quarter 2021 ended Sept. 30), up 26% year over year. What's more, PayPal added 13.3 million net new active accounts during the three-month period. The company is clearly still operating at a high level, which you wouldn't know by looking at the stock price.
This year, management expects revenue to jump roughly 18% compared to 2021 to reach $30 billion. While this was below Wall Street's expectation of $31.6 billion, it would nonetheless be a solid year-over-year gain and in line with PayPal's past yearly growth. There's also a high probability that TPV will approach $1.5 trillion for all of 2022, a truly gargantuan amount.
For this remarkable historical performance, and for the potential of continued success, investors are being asked to pay just 42 times trailing-12-month earnings. This is near the lowest level PayPal's stock has traded at in the past few years. Investors who decide to cash out of PayPal now because of its poor recent price performance are likely missing out on continued market-beating returns in the future. Now might actually be a great time to buy PayPal shares.
PayPal has a massive user base
Perhaps nothing exemplifies PayPal's dominance in the world of digital payments more than its burgeoning customer base. Through the end of the third quarter on Sept. 30, the business had 416 million active accounts, a figure that climbs higher with each passing quarter. PayPal checkout is currently available at 75% of the top 1,500 North American and European retailers. This ubiquity is unmatched.
Introducing new product features is vital to attract more individuals to PayPal's platform. The company revamped its flagship mobile app last year, adding early direct deposit and shopping rewards to existing capabilities like investing in and checking out with crypto and buy now, pay later (BNPL). ""Those customers that are using our installment paid product, our buy now pay later product, have a 21% increase in engagement, relative to other customers,"" CFO John Rainey said on the Q3 earnings call.
Boosting PayPal's prospects is a new partnership with Amazon, which will allow U.S. customers to check out with their Venmo balances starting sometime this year. It is the first third-party payments partnership Amazon has entered into, demonstrating just how powerful a brand PayPal really is.
This massive user base allows PayPal to benefit from a network effect: As more individuals sign up for a PayPal account, the value for merchants rises, as they now have a bigger potential customer base; and the opposite is also true, with more participating merchants growing the number of places consumers can shop. This only strengthens PayPal's competitive position over time.
I expect 2022 to be a positive year for PayPal's stock, primarily as a result of the unwarranted pessimism priced in today. If you're a shareholder, I urge you to hold onto your shares. The potential for market outperformance is still very much alive.

2022-01-20 00:00:00+00:00,My Top 2 Dividend Stocks for February,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/my-top-2-dividend-stocks-for-february,,,"Dividend stocks are great for generating a steady stream of income. Most public corporations that pay a dividend do so at regular intervals like quarterly or semi-annually. And once dividends are established, companies are hesitant to cancel or reduce them because they understand that investors are relying on those payments.
If you are looking to invest in dividend stocks, here are my top two for February.
Image source: Getty Images.
Target
Target (NYSE: TGT) has such an excellent history of paying dividends that it qualifies as a Dividend King. That is a company that has paid and increased its dividend for 50 consecutive years.
In the last decade alone, Target has increased its dividend per share from $1.10 to $2.68. That means dividend investors in Target in 2012 are getting more than twice the dividends per share they started with.
Moreover, Target has plenty to room to keep increasing that dividend. Target's most recent dividend payout ratio was just 21.5%. Dividends are paid out from earnings; a company can decide what portion of profits it wants to pay in dividends and how much to keep to reinvest in the company. A dividend payout ratio of above 100% is not sustainable in the long term. Even at a payout ratio of just 21.5%, Target boasts a dividend yield of 1.43%.
Target's dividend yield dropped since 2019 because of the rapid rise in its stock that's more than tripled since then. Still, Target's stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 16, leaving room for stock price appreciation to continue.
eBay
eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) does not have a long history of paying dividends like Target; eBay only started paying a dividend in 2019. However, eBay has the potential to be an excellent dividend stock, primarily because the company runs on an asset-lite business model. eBay has built a platform that brings buyers and sellers together and takes a percentage of each transaction. It does not spend money building and maintaining brick-and-mortar stores or accumulating inventory.
That means eBay can eventually and sustainably carry a higher dividend payout ratio. Most recently, that payout ratio was only 3.76%, but there is a likelihood eBay will increase that over time. Already, eBay raised its dividend per share from $0.56 in 2019 to $0.64 in 2020. That's an increase of 14.3% and good for a dividend yield of 1.13%.
What's more, eBay has grown earnings per share at a compounded annual rate of 19.2% in the last decade. Recall, dividends are paid out of earnings, and the robust earnings growth could fuel dividend growth over time.
Fortunately for investors, eBay is selling at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14. A meager dividend payout ratio, double-digit earnings growth, and an inexpensive valuation make eBay an excellent dividend stock to buy in February.

2022-01-19 00:00:00+00:00,3 Growth Stocks You Can Buy Right Now With Less Than $100,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-growth-stocks-you-can-buy-right-now-with-less-than-%24100-1,,,"Last year was a good one for the S&P 500. Much like consumers who opened their wallets en masse after being locked in their homes for months due to the pandemic, the benchmark index turned on the afterburners in 2021 and outperformed both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq by its widest margin in over two decades.
The S&P 500 surged 27%, marking only the sixth time it has beaten the other major indexes. That was also more than double its average return and its fifth-best performance in almost 50 years.
Image source: Getty Images.
If you ignore the sudden plunge the stock market experienced at the onset of the pandemic, it has been on an incredible tear since the end of the Great Recession in 2009. The broad market index has quadrupled in value over that time period, turning an investment of $10,000 into almost $43,000 today.
That could suggest it's only a matter of time before the market crashes again, meaning if you've got only a little money to spare to invest in the stock market, you want it to go a long way and not get wiped out in any downdraft. So if you've got $100 or less available -- and you don't need it for emergencies or to pay bills -- the following three stocks are a great place to start.
Image source: Getty Images.
JD.com
I'm the first to admit investing in Chinese stocks these days seems risky. Beijing is cracking down on the biggest, most successful companies, seemingly as a reminder of who holds the real power in the country. And JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) is certainly a fast-growing, profitable e-commerce giant.
Since going public in 2014, JD.com has returned nearly 250% while the S&P 500 has ridden 150% higher in the same time frame. But there's a good reason for the dichotomy. China is a massive market opportunity with 1.4 billion people who -- like much of the rest of the world -- have increasingly embraced online shopping. The company's third-quarter revenue hit $33.9 billion, up 25% over the year-ago period.
Unlike Amazon.com or rival Alibaba, JD.com is more of a marketplace for third-party sellers like eBay than a seller of goods itself. Its broad selection of items is attracting ever greater numbers of customers to the site; active customers hit 552.2 million last year. That's some 25% more than in 2020.
At $76 a share, JD.com trades for just under six times next year's earnings estimate. Analysts, though, are forecasting that the e-commerce giant will grow earnings 24% annually for the next five years. So it could be a good deal for someone with just $100 to invest.
Image source: Lovesac.
Lovesac
Sit back and relax with modular furniture maker Lovesac (NASDAQ: LOVE), something of a contrarian stock pick for an investor with only a little money to put to work.
The ""sactional"" maker is hard at work changing how people shop for furniture as the pandemic forced consumers to switch from being hands on and having a natural revulsion to paying shipping costs to willingly buying online. Because Lovesac already had a robust e-commerce presence prior to the pandemic, along with a physical retail footprint, it was easily able to make the transition while others struggled.
And business is booming. Third-quarter sales jumped 56% to almost $117 million compared to a year ago while the company's gross margin is an impressive 50%. Wall Street sees Lovesac turning into a billion-dollar business by the middle of the decade.
Analysts are maintaining a $106 consensus price target for the shares over the next year. That's an 84% upside over the current $58 per share price. So modular furniture could be the perfect stock for investing couch potatoes with only a few dollars available.

Plug Power
Investors have been waiting a long time for hydrogen fuel-cell technology to reach critical mass, particularly as Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) has long promised it's just around the next corner. While that corner never seems to materialize, we may finally be on the brink of it occurring.
Recently KeyBanc Capital Markets released its forecast for the industry and -- gadzooks! -- it expects the technology to rocket from $1.1 billion last year to $300 billion by 2030. That's an 86% compound annual growth rate.
Analyst Leo Mariani told investors in a research note that fuel-cell companies will see their business get a turbo-boost from a ""rapidly growing market for their services as fuel-cell adoption is poised to accelerate this decade."" He initiated coverage of Plug Power with an overweight rating, putting a price target of $40 per share on the fuel-cell pioneer (that's 60% upside from its $25 per share level today).
Plug Power shipped 4,559 GenDrive material fuel-cell products in the third quarter along with 16 hydrogen infrastructure systems, some 23% more for each compared to last year. Still, it continues to post losses, and the global supply-chain issues that are impacting all industries, as well as inflation, continue to pressure Plug's margins.
Plug Power, though, sees a future for hydrogen fuel cells that goes well beyond its primary forklift market. And if Wall Street is even only partly correct about its growth potential, Plug could have a bright future ahead of it that would potentially turn $100 into far more.

Matt Frankel: Danny, why don't you tell us about MercadoLibre, why you saw it so early on in the cycle, and why you love it for 2022?
Danny Vena: To be honest, the reason that I really was sold on MercadoLibre more than a decade ago, is if you look at the trends that the company is riding, the two biggest e-commerce and payments. This was a company that was ahead of the curve. They were the first and probably leading large e-commerce platform in Latin America.
They added a payments segment soon after they went public. Latin America is a place where a lot of folks still do business in cash. You'd be surprised because it's something like half of the transactions in the region are still done in cash. This is a place where more than 50% of the people in Latin America don't have a credit or debit card and so as a result of that, payments was a big deal for them and a reason why e-commerce wasn't being adopted early.
The fact that they had this payment method where folks could go into their local convenience store, similar to 7-Elevens that you would see here, and say, I want to put this money in my account, and they put money into their Mercado Pago account that made it so that customers could actually join the e-commerce revolution. This was a story of a company making all the right moves early on. The reason that I'm still really sold on MercadoLibre is if you look at their most recent quarter, revenue grew 73% year-over-year.
Their payments growth was very high and what's driving the payments growth now is the fact that they've moved beyond just being a payment method for their platform. Their payments have now moved into other websites and other brick-and-mortar stores, and so their payments are growing very quickly. This is such an early-stage story. Latin America has twice the population of the United States. Basically, I see all of these things converging to form something of a once-in-a-generation opportunity. So far, MercadoLibre is one of my best-performing stocks ever. I still see MercadoLibre growing multiples from here going forward.
Frankel: I love MercadoLibre. It was one of my first pandemic buys when the market crashed in March of last year just because I thought I missed the boat and then boom I saw an opportunity to get in at a decent price. I'm starting to see that again right now. I think it's lost about 50% since the highs. MercadoLibre is just like you said a great opportunity in that region. I love what they're doing on the fintech side of the business because financials are my specialty. It often gets called the Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) of Latin America.
Jason Hall: It's so much more than that.
Frankel: It's so much more, I would call it the Amazon, the PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), the eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) all in earlier stages of the business cycle.
Vena: The Shopify (NYSE: SHOP).
Frankel: The Shopify and you can go on.
Vena: The Square [Block] (NYSE: SQ).
Frankel: There's a whole list so.
Hall: What's the big Chinese e-commerce company?
Frankel: Alibaba (NYSE: BABA).
Hall: I think that maybe that's more appropriate to be honest with you. It's just such an incredible business. Yet you are talking about where it is in the cycle. This is a 23-year-old business but Latin America is still single low, mid-single digits in terms of e-commerce penetration. It is just getting started. I heard Marcos Galperin, the Founder and CEO in an interview with actually I think was PayPal CEO during the lockdown was doing these. I think he's still doing them but he said it's his mission to make Latin America a cashless society. That tells you right there in one sentence where their focus is.
Last thing I want to say, data. We talked about Upstart (NASDAQ: UPST) and so many of these other companies and data and where it is. I think people under-appreciate how much data MercadoLibre has about its merchants, about its customers that can help it grow its lending business on both sides of that coin can help us with logistics, can help it add all of those fintech things that it does, all the payments since there does, I don't think we give them enough credit for the amount of data that they have.

2022-01-16 00:00:00+00:00,Now Is a Great Buying Opportunity for This Giant Fintech Stock,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/now-is-a-great-buying-opportunity-for-this-giant-fintech-stock,,,"There are 33 million merchants that now accept PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) worldwide. In this clip from ""3 Minute Stocks Updates"" on Motley Fool Live, recorded on Jan. 5, Motley Fool contributors Brian Feroldi and Brian Withers discuss why they think PayPal is on the right track and why now might be a prime time to buy.

{% sfr %}
Brian Feroldi: PayPal, ticker symbol PYPL. This is a FinTech giant so the key value to watch is total payment volume. That is a key metric. For the most recent quarter, that number was up 26% to $310 billion. That is an annualized run-rate of $1.2 trillion with a T, up 19%. Really good. Even more amazing, this company used to be essentially 100% dependent on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) for everything. eBay revenue is now 3% of the total. That's great. Now, revenue growth was significantly below that. Revenue only grew 13% to $6.18 billion, and that was actually shy of Wall Street's estimates a little bit. Now, the company signed up 13.3 million net new active accounts during the quarter, that was up 15%. That brings the company's total number of users to 416 million net new accounts and 33 million merchants now accept PayPal worldwide. Now, on the bottom line, adjusted earnings-per-share only grew 4% to $1.11. That was ahead of their guidance. The company cranked out $1.3 billion in free cash flow. That figure itself was up 20%. Venmo, which PayPal owns, continues to be a very bright spot for this business. Venmo, total payment volume was up 36% to $60 billion, that's rapidly approaching more than 20% of total payment volumes. Company's balance sheet is fantastic, $20 billion in cash, $9 billion in debt. The big news from the quarter though was that starting this year, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Venmo will have a relationship with each other so that's step one to getting PayPal and Amazon to be hooked up with each other. Company's buy now, pay later capabilities is now operating at a $8 billion dollar run-rate and nearly a million merchants offer buy now, pay later services. Crypto is growing. It's crypto usage was up 15%. A company closed on its acquisition of Paidy, which is a leading FinTech provider in Japan. For the rest of the year, guidance was pretty good, all things considered. Total payment volume in the upcoming quarter, about 13%. Total payment volume for the full-year between 32-33%, that should lead to revenue growth of 18% and 55 million net new account adds during the period. We saw just like with many companies, some of PayPal's growth got pulled forward into 2020, and that has been a headwind in 2021. But if you look up and down what this company is doing, no doubt in my mind, this is on track.
Brian Withers: Yeah, Brian. Wow. This company is firing on all cylinders. I decided to take a quick look at the stock price, and it's down from its high, 38%. Is this a buying opportunity?
Feroldi: Yes.
Withers: Alright-y. [laughs]
Feroldi: Very much so. This is a phenomenal compounding machine. It's currently trading under 40 times next year's earnings. That's pricey in absolute terms but this is a wonderful business. I still think it's capable of producing high double-digit, high teens revenue growth, not to mention all of the acquisitions that are out there that they potentially made to accelerate that further. They're buying back stock. They're improving margins. They're increasing partnerships. They just signed up with Amazon. This company is doing very well.

2022-01-16 00:00:00+00:00,Is There An Opportunity With eBay Inc.'s (NASDAQ:EBAY) 46% Undervaluation?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-there-an-opportunity-with-ebay-inc.s-nasdaq%3Aebay-46-undervaluation,,,"Does the January share price for eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.
What's the estimated valuation?
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast
2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031
Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.12b US$3.19b US$3.40b US$3.59b US$3.77b US$3.91b US$4.04b US$4.15b US$4.26b US$4.36b
Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x10 Analyst x9 Analyst x4 Analyst x4 Analyst x4 Est @ 3.74% Est @ 3.21% Est @ 2.83% Est @ 2.57% Est @ 2.39%
Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$2.9k US$2.8k US$2.8k US$2.8k US$2.7k US$2.6k US$2.5k US$2.4k US$2.3k US$2.2k
(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2031 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.4b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.0%) = US$91b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$91b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$47b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$73b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$63.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
NasdaqGS:EBAY Discounted Cash Flow January 16th 2022
The assumptions
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at eBay as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.119. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Looking Ahead:
Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For eBay, we've put together three essential factors you should assess:

See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of January 10, 2022
Toby Bordelon: Talking about Nintendo. I just want to go through this really quickly. We haven't touched on this company in a while. Just a quick update here, 2021 was a good year for Nintendo fans. We got a new Switch, the Switch OLED. I don't know if any of you guys picked one of those up or not, but many people did. It was the best-selling console in the U.S. for 2021, outselling the Xbox, and the PS5, and the new Xbox.
Part of that is availability. You can actually buy a Switch. You can find one fairly easily. You cannot so easily find a new PlayStation or a new Xbox. That's part of what's feeding into this, I think. But it's also a cheaper price point. It's more portable. It's just a more casual device.
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Sony (NYSE: SONY) I think get all the attention because they're the high-end stuff there, the exciting console with the latest technology, but the Switch is super popular. It was a must-have device in the pandemic. I don't know if you guys tried to get one in 2020. It was very difficult to do. People were scalping these things on eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) for double or triple the price at some point.
Availability is much easier now so that's not an issue. But the market doesn't seem to like the stock, down about 20 percent in the past year. That's weird to me given the popularity of the Switch. The more it sells, the bigger the audience is for them to produce games. They produce their own games. This is an internal network effect if you will.
The company is, I think, well-positioned to take advantage of some aspects of the metaverse with that built-in audience, very popular casual games, well-known IP, doing well licensing their stuff out. They could do well here. They could do well in the metaverse as this continues to evolve.
You talked about some of that licensing that's out there now. Nintendo World opened I believe late last year in Japan at Universal Studios. They're opening up areas in Universal Studio Parks in Florida, California, and Singapore soon. That's happening. They've got LEGO and Nintendo sets now. They're taking their IP, they're expanding off this popular IP. There's some nostalgia effect I think for people of our generation going on there.
But this is a company that is a little bit different from others. They control both the games, they make their games, their own IP, and the hardware. That makes it different than something like Sony or Microsoft, which is more focused on the hardware, though they do make their own games as well, or someone like Activision (NASDAQ: ATVI) or Take-Two (NASDAQ: TTWO), which is solid on the game side.
I don't know that the market fully appreciates the flexibility and the uniqueness of this little business model and the differentiation in terms of the model there and the market position. It is a little bit different than what's out there.
There's not really a lot of major news here, but I just wanted to update people on this. I like this business. It has been more of the same in the last few quarters. I think honestly that's a good thing. Solid business, one you should take a look at.
Brian Feroldi: I had no idea that Nintendo Switch was doing that well. We're an Xbox family, so I didn't think it was going to be outselling Xbox. But do you think this is a stock that video game investors should put at the top of their list?
Bordelon: I think so. I think it's one you certainly should consider because they have both pieces here. They have the content and the hardware while being a pure-play video game company. Look at the other big hardware makers, Microsoft and Sonys, those are not pure plays.
I think if you're someone who says, ""I want to start investing in the video game industry,"" this is a great place to get started. I don't think you stop here. It's certainly not the only company you want to have in your portfolio, but I think it's hard to think of a better company as a good starting point for investing in this space and learning more about it.

Don't let a short-term shift distract you from fantastic revenue growth
Pinterest has been under significant pressure lately, as you can see in the chart above. Since peaking in early 2021, not only has there been a notable rotation out of high-growth technology stocks, but Pinterest's user base has actually declined a bit in recent quarters.
Image source: Getty Images.
Now, a social media company with a declining active user base might sound like a big red flag, but it's important to take a step back and consider two very important points. First, Pinterest's user decline is likely a temporary headwind caused by the gradual lifting of COVID-19 restrictions rather than any problem with the business itself.
Think of it this way -- until mid-2021 when vaccines became widely available in the United States and in many other countries, people had more time than ever to sit inside and search for ideas on Pinterest. Now that the world is gradually returning to normal, a temporary decline in users isn't a surprise.
Second and most importantly, Pinterest is doing a fantastic job of monetizing its user base. The company's average revenue per user is up 37% over the past year, including 81% growth in average revenue per user (ARPU) from the international user base, which makes up about four-fifths of the total. With international users still generating less than 7% of what the average U.S. user does, there's tremendous revenue growth potential if Pinterest can close the gap.
A fintech behemoth with lots of room to grow
PayPal has declined significantly in recent months, but the company's business is firing on all cylinders. Its total payment volume increased 26% year over year in the most recent quarter and is now over $1.2 trillion on an annualized basis, and more than 416 million active users are on the platform. And excluding the planned wind-down of its eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) relationship, PayPal's revenue grew by 25% in the third quarter of 2021 -- remarkable growth for such a massive business.
However, don't make the mistake of thinking PayPal doesn't have any room to grow. Worldwide cashless payment and money transfer volume is estimated to be about $185 trillion, and PayPal has been incrementally adding revenue streams through smart acquisitions.
A massive market opportunity
MercadoLibre is often called the ""Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) of Latin America,"" but even that title might not do the company justice. I'd go so far as to call it the Amazon, PayPal, and maybe even the eBay and Square (Block) (NYSE: SQ) of Latin America, and at much earlier stages of each company's business cycle.
On the e-commerce side of the business, MercadoLibre's marketplace saw $7.3 billion in gross merchandise volume in the third quarter, up 30% year over year on top of already massive pandemic-fueled growth the year before. And on the fintech side, MercadoLibre's total payment volume grew by 59% year over year and is now more than $80 billion annualized. These numbers sound impressive, and they certainly are, but they represent about 4% and 7% of Amazon's and PayPal's numbers, respectively.
Invest with the long term in mind
To be perfectly clear, while all three of these companies are fantastic businesses with excellent growth potential, that doesn't mean they're going to be home run investments overnight. I have no idea what they'll do over the next few months (or even the next year or two), and if conditions aren't favorable for growth stocks -- say, interest rates continue to rise faster than expected -- they could certainly decline further in the near term.
I'm confident that investors who measure their returns in decades and buy these stocks now will be very glad they did. But be prepared for some ups and downs along the way.

When it comes to consumer stocks in the stock market, investors often have plenty of choices to pick from. Despite the ongoing pandemic and inflation fears, some of the top consumer stocks posted strong gains in 2021. Many even believe that travel and leisure are sectors ripe for investing in this year as rising case counts may not deter consumers from taking holidays. Apart from this section of the market, other parts of the consumer economy continue to press ahead. 
For instance, Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F)announced that it is planning to nearly double the production of its highly anticipated electric F-150 Lightning. In fact, the all-electric pickup’s initial planned production was about 40,000 units. In September last year, it was increased to 80,000 units, and now, almost doubled to 150,000 units. Evidently, this shows strong consumer demand for the pickup.
Meanwhile, online sports betting is now officially legal in New York. Last Thursday, the state’s gaming commission gave the green light to four mobile betting operators to start taking wagers last Saturday. As such, the Gambling.com Group (NASDAQ: GAMB) has developed two New York specific websites for betters to find up-to-date info on sports betting. With all this news in the consumer market, here are 5 top consumer stocks to watch in thestock market today
Consumer Stocks To Watch In The Stock Market Today
Gamestop Corporation (NYSE: GME)
DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ: DKNG)
Discovery Communications Inc. (NASDAQ: DISCA)
Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD)
eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY) 
Gamestop 
Starting off our list, we have GameStop, one of the largest video game retailers in the world. The company focuses on offering games, entertainment products, and tech through its e-commerce properties and stores. In the past year, the stock has received a ton of retail trader attention, pushing its valuation to new highs. In fact, GME stock has risen over 600% in the past year.
Just last week, GameStop announced that it will be launching a division to develop a marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Accordingly, the NFT marketplace will focus on virtual video game products. This includes outfits and accessories for avatars, which users can deploy in various games. Currently, GameStop has hired 20 people to work on the NFT marketplace. It is also reportedly working with two crypto companies to develop games that use blockchain and NFT technology, according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke to the Wall Street Journal. With that being said, is GME stock one to watch?

DraftKings
DraftKings is a company that operates as a digital sports entertainment and gaming company. The company aims to provide users with daily sports and sports betting opportunities. On top of that, it also develops and licenses sports betting and casino gaming platform software for online and retail sportsbooks. With DKNG stock falling more than 60% since its peak in March last year, could things finally be turning around?
As New York became the 18th state to legalize online sports betting, DraftKings launched its mobile and online sportsbook last week. The company was among the first few operators to launch in the Empire State. Subsequently, this launch comes ahead of the NFL Playoffs, arguably one of the busiest periods for betting activity in the year. The state gaming commission gave the green light to four of the nine operators who have met the necessary requirements to operate. Given this news, is DKNG stock worth considering right now?

Discovery
Discovery is a global media company. In detail, the company provides content across multiple distribution platforms, ranging from pay-television (pay-TV) to direct-to-consumer (DTC) subscription products. The company’s portfolio consists of brands that may be familiar to many. Namely, Discovery Channel, Food Network, Animal Planet, and Travel Channel.
Last Friday, DISCA stock was upgraded to buy from neutral at Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), or BofA for short. This upgrade was based on the optimism about the TV titan’s merger plan with WarnerMedia, now owned by AT&T (NYSE: T). With the combination of highly complementary assets, the merger will have the potential to “create a global media powerhouse driven by creative and content leadership”, BofA analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote in a commentary. In this case, the WarnerMedia-Discovery merger could become a true rival to Netflix and Disney+ in the streaming space. With this in mind, does DISCA stock deserve a spot on your watchlist?

MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is a top e-commerce stock that underwhelmed investors in 2021, falling 19.5%. Even worse, the current stock price is down about 47% from 52-week highs set in mid-January.
Should that stock performance scare investors in 2022, or does it present an opportunity?

What happened to MercadoLibre in 2021
MercadoLibre is an e-commerce and digital payments company based in Argentina that services users in 18 Latin American countries. It operates a large gamut of services tied to e-commerce and payments in a region with more than 600 million people and one of the fastest-growing internet penetration rates in the world.
Based on that, MercadoLibre is well-positioned for explosive success. It has a huge addressable market that it is uniquely suited to capture, and this market is rapidly adopting technologies that MercadoLibre provides.
MercadoLibre demonstrated tremendous growth when the pandemic started and shopping and payments moved more toward online alternatives. It posted triple-digit percentage revenue and total payment volume (TPV) growth for four consecutive quarters. That growth began to moderate in the second and third quarters of 2021, but business was still robust. In the third quarter, MercadoLibre's revenue increased 73% to $1.9 billion, and total payment volume rose 59% to $21 billion. Gross merchandise volume (GMV) reached a record $7.3 billion. There were more than 78 million unique active users at the end of the third quarter, up from 76 million last year. Keep in mind that these outstanding numbers were on top of last year's super growth, so the ""moderation"" figures were still enviable.
The only cause for concern was when MercadoLibre hit a snag in the fourth quarter of 2020 (reported on March 1, 2021) and the first quarter of 2021 when it posted an unusual loss, which it attributed to expenses related to loans, foreign exchange rates, and lower net interest income due to falling interest rates. But it got back to profitability in the second quarter.
In other words, it really was nothing short of a great year. But between slowing growth and a skyrocketing valuation, investors got scared off.
Why you can have confidence for this year
The company has been taking new directions recently, purchasing smaller companies and investing in new technology. In October, it partnered with Latin American venture capital company Kaszek to form a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) to invest in new technology. In November, it launched an alliance to combat counterfeit goods, and in December, it acquired Chilean payments company Redelcom to bolster its payments strategy. It has also upgraded its loyalty program to strengthen its connection to its customers and encourage more activity on its platform. Getting more customers to join also ties in its fintech services by enabling digital services associated with payments and delivery.
The company has been seeing phenomenal growth in its off-platform business, which encompasses transactions by users not using MercadoLibre's e-commerce services. MercadoLibre is the company's e-commerce business, similar to Amazon or eBay. It offers fintech features related to e-commerce transactions, but it also offers those fintech features for general usage by other retailers, consumers, and companies needing payments processing. Total payment volume for digital accounts, which comprise digital wallets, peer-to-peer transactions, and card transactions, increased 101% to $5.5 billion in the third quarter.
Management said that new user growth is still accelerating since the pandemic, and retention rates are stronger. Transactions per buyer are increasing, and the company's Net Promoter Scores, which measure how many people would recommend MercadoLibre to a friend, are at their highest levels.
The stock's valuation has become much more reasonable at the current price, with shares trading at 132 times forward 12-month earnings. That's not inexpensive, but it's also not outsized for a high-growth company.
MercadoLibre has been a fantastic stock to own, having gained more than 500% over the past five years and easily beating the market on a long-term basis.

At this price, and with its opportunities, MercadoLibre looks like a great buy for 2022.

Supporting e-commerce in Latin America
The e-commerce revolution has changed how U.S. consumers buy their goods. Several businesses like payment providers, shipping companies, and e-commerce platforms themselves have grown massively and generated huge shareholder returns through this change. MercadoLibre owns every one of these segments in Latin America, making it a fantastic investment opportunity.
It started in 2003 with Mercado Pago (its digital payment platform) and MercadoLibre (its classifieds page), much like Craigslist. Later, MercadoLibre expanded to include bidding elements like eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) and a standard e-commerce platform like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). In 2019, the e-commerce business was the largest of its kind in Latin America.
Mercado Pago found more uses than just MercadoLibre's platform. It can be used as a peer-to-peer payment platform and to buy and sell crypto in Brazil. Brick-and-mortar retailers also benefit and can accept Mercado Pago, allowing customers to go cashless. In Mexico, cash use decreased by 23% after Mercado Pago was introduced.
Another leg of the company is Mercado Envios, its logistics business. This allows sellers to seamlessly ship their goods after purchases are made. Businesses can even offer same-day or next-day deliveries using Mercado Envios Full when products are stored in MercadoLibre's warehouses; it's currently available in Mexico and Chile.
The results back up the opportunity
While MercadoLibre stock is off more than 30% from its highs, its business is growing quickly. During the third quarter, revenue was up 72.9% to $1.9 billion on a currency-neutral (FX) basis. Gross merchandise volume (GMV) rose 23.9% to $7.3 billion. Both are coming up against tough pandemic-driven comparisons. In 2020, its third-quarter revenue and GMV growth were 148.5% and 117.1%, respectively. As these comparisons fade away over 2022, look for MercadoLibre to continue reporting strong growth.
Examining individual segments in the third quarter reveals strength across the board. Mercado Envios had a remarkable 86% managed network penetration across all its markets, meaning it had a hand in 86% of some portion of the shipping process. Overall in Latin America, Envios is responsible for delivering over 37% of the items shipped in the region, with Envios itself fulfilling 65% of all packages delivered in Mexico. This demonstrates the outstanding market opportunity still left to capture.
Mercado Pago's total payment volume (TPV) grew an FX 59% to $20.9 billion during the third quarter. Its on-platform payments (those made directly interacting with MercadoLibre) only grew 29% and were used in 96% of transactions, meaning its growth will be tied into GMV. However, its off-platform payments rose 79% and captured a 64% market share, showing there is still room to grow.
Many Latin American countries have a rising middle class with growing disposable income, creating a growth catalyst for commerce in general. MercadoLibre is strategically positioned to capture or process much of the new wealth.
A historically low valuation
At a 9 times price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, MercadoLibre has reached a valuation not often seen over the last five years.
MELI PS ratio data by YCharts.
Each time it has reached this point, the stock has quickly rebounded to trade in the lower-teens range. Additionally, if MercadoLibre maintains its growth rate and valuation, the stock will appreciate identical to the revenue increase, an astounding investment proposition. However, the market could also be reevaluating its growth prospects, leading to a potentially lower valuation. Even if this happens, investors should stick with MercadoLibre, as growth will continue driving the stock price over the long term.
For how large MercadoLibre is, it doesn't generate a lot of profits. During the third quarter, it produced a net income of $1.92 per share or a 5.8% margin. This profit accounted for nearly three-quarters of all earnings so far in 2021. If MercadoLibre can turn the profitability corner, the market will recognize its achievement and value it differently throughout 2022. Also, it would separate MercadoLibre from other unprofitable growth stocks, and it likely wouldn't get dragged down as much during sell-off periods.
MercadoLibre is undervalued and might be worth purchasing as soon as possible to get the stock at the lowest price. Investors must be prepared for volatility, as it has seen multiple drawdowns of 30% or more, including a 45% decline this year. Even with these setbacks, holding on to MercadoLibre for multiple years has been a winning strategy. If you've missed out on its rise, now could be a great time to get in.

*Stock Advisor returns as of December 16, 2021
Rachel Warren: The stock I wanted to talk about is Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY). This is a company I cover pretty frequently. I'm a shareholder of Etsy and for me, one of the industries that I think about top-of-mind when we talk about digital transformation or transformation, as we're going to talk about here in a minute, can mean so many different things to so many different people and companies.
But one area I think of is e-commerce, because not only is it revolutionizing the way that people shop and the way people buy the daily goods that they've relied on forever. But it's also changing the ability of people to change their financial future.
One of the things I love about Etsy is that it's predicated on this business model of vintage and unique and specialty and handmade items where you have sellers going on the platform from all over the world to sell these specialty things that you just really can't find anywhere else.
Not only does that create a lot of opportunity for small business owners, or maybe someone that are finally pursuing their side hustle or lifelong dream of monetizing a business idea they've had, but it also provides a really neat way as the consumer to find goods and items that you really can't find elsewhere.
I love that aspect of Etsy's business model. The company recently acquired Depop, which is a well-known platform where you can basically resell used clothing. It also acquired a company called Elo7, which is essentially been called the Etsy of Brazil so it's been making a lot of moves to expand its business.
Shares of the company are up about 30% year-to-date, which actually surprised me. I thought it might be down because the stock has been a bit all over the place. We'll see where it lands before January. This is another one of those companies that was hailed as a pandemic stock.
But I think the company has proven that it is much more than that. Just a quick look at a couple of metrics. In the first nine months of this year, the company's revenue grew 45% compared to the first nine months of 2020. Marketplace revenue on the platform was also up by a similar amount, year-over-year net income. In the first nine months of 2021 was up 65%, compared to the same period in 2020.
Active sellers were up 102% year-over-year, in that nine-month period, while active buyers were up 40% year-over-year during the nine-month period. I am loving these figures, I'm loving the fact that not only are more people coming on to list whatever specialty item they want to sell, even as we're entering a new hopefully phase in the pandemic, that people are also continuing to shop on the platform in droves.
I myself I'm a frequent user of Etsy for specialty jewelry. I love that I can go on there and there's a jeweler found in Bulgaria that I love their items and I'll buy things from them as an example, just really random things that you just can't find anywhere else.
One final point here that I thought was really interesting. The company recently launched something called a Star Seller program, which the company said ""defines what success looks like by celebrating and rewarding our top rated sellers."" It has improved several customer service metrics critical to the Etsy platform, such as on-time shipping and responsiveness so essentially boosting those incentives for sellers on the platform, which is something we've seen a lot with other e-commerce sellers as well.
""The company is also focused on transitioning buyers to our buy on Etsy app."" Management said, ""We believe this is the best way to transact on Etsy, personalizing the on-boarding experience and helping buyers discover items and shops that align with their tastes and preferences.""
Making acquisitions, growing its top and bottom line at an astonishing rate, incentivizing sellers, and also growing shopping on its mobile app. These are all the things you want to be seen from an e-commerce platform like Etsy that's operating in such a competitive space so one to watch for sure if you're not already invested.
Demitri Kalogeropoulos: That's great. I'll just jump in real quick. I want to add two things, two reasons why I like this business too. Number one is they have a niche that they really dominate and it's not just like they're an e-commerce seller, their top six categories cover almost 90% of their sales in the top, I'll just name the top two here, homewares and home furnishings and number two, like you mentioned, Rachel, jewelry and personal accessories.
When you think you could compare that to something like eBay, I follow eBay a lot and they're more broad e-commerce retailer, but I don't know the relevant rankings for them, but I'm sure it's not those two.
I'm sure it's probably consumer electronics, for example, which you can buy anywhere else. You can't really duplicate their merchandise that they have available. The number two thing that really jumped out at me when I was looking through their stuff is their take rate, which is the fee that they can charge sellers, mostly is 18%, which just blows me away because eBay has been working really hard to get that number up to 10% over the last three years.
Rachel Warren: Wow.
Demitri Kalogeropoulos: Because I believe, obviously a lot of the stuff is more smaller brands and things like that to help a lot more hands-on service, but interesting. That gives you a good indication it can be pretty profitable.
Rachel Warren: That's awesome.
Asit Sharma: Yeah. Really liking that discussion. Etsy shareholder here as well. I think they play a nice role in this growing gig economy. Very liberating for people who want to turn a side hobby into something more, or a passion into a business. I think it's a great virtual opportunities stock in that sense. Their use of technology is really persuasive as well.
I'll just quickly add here that they have done a really nice job of understanding how to push users to what users want to get to. Sounds easy but it's one of the hardest things to do in e-commerce visual interface. If I've got certain aesthetic in mind, especially on a site like Etsy, how do I translate that idea that I've got into something that the platform itself will be able to then interpret and show me various versions of that? Etsy does such a good job with that and it's not by accident.
They have spent a lot of money on their own artificial intelligence and machine learning, and over the years, they I think have typically become very skilled. If you've got a certain aesthetic, something that you want, a home furnishing or a certain type of table, just generally look and you're instantly intrigued by, enamored by. I've enjoyed it as a shareholder, and I've dropped probably too much on that platform over the years [laughs] just because I think they're so effective at what they do.
Rachel Warren: I feel you.

2022-01-07 00:00:00+00:00,Is PayPal Poised for a Bull Run in 2022?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-paypal-poised-for-a-bull-run-in-2022,,,"Last year was not a good one for PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL). Thanks to consecutive revenue misses in the second and third quarters, the payments company has seen its share price fall more than 19% in the past year. With people largely stuck at home and shopping online, the pandemic was a boon for PayPal's products and services. However, investors might have soured on the company's prospects as things begin getting back to normal.
But the business still has solid fundamentals and a bright future, and the stock might be a good value right now. So is PayPal ready to bounce back in 2022?
Image source: Getty Images.
Strong financial position
I don't think PayPal's stock performance in 2021 is justified given how well the company has been performing. In the most recent quarter, revenue jumped 13.2% compared to the same period in 2020. And PayPal added 13.3 million net new active accounts during the three-month period, bringing the total to an incredible 416 million. If PayPal keeps adding users at a fast clip, investors will be happy.
PayPal has always sported some superb financial metrics. Its profit margin of 20.1% is excellent, and over the trailing 12 months, the business produced $5 billion in free cash flow on revenue of $24.6 billion. Even more impressive is that PayPal had cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling $20 billion (as of Sept. 30, 2021), showcasing a fortress-like balance sheet that affords the leadership team the flexibility to invest for growth.
To prove that PayPal's business is still thriving, it's worth mentioning that an astounding $310 billion of payment volume flowed through the company's platform in the most recent quarter, up 26% year over year. And engagement keeps improving, with the average account completing 44.2 transactions in the past 12 months.
Expanding its addressable market
In September, PayPal unveiled an upgraded mobile app. It was equipped with a whole range of capabilities, including bill payment, high-yield savings, shopping deals and rewards, and early direct deposit. I think this year will show consumers' propensity for a one-stop financial tool in their pockets, supporting PayPal's growth.
PayPal's $2.7 billion acquisition of buy now, pay later lender Paidy expands the company's geographic footprint in Japan, the world's third-largest e-commerce market. I think it will prove to be a sound strategic move. Additionally, in an effort to find ways to monetize Venmo, PayPal has partnered with Amazon to allow U.S. customers to check out with the peer-to-peer payments app. This boosts Venmo's appeal to users.
These initiatives show that PayPal has a ton of optionality in its business model, with numerous opportunities to expand its reach in new product categories and markets around the world. I expect much of the same in 2022.
Valuation looks attractive
PayPal today trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 45, a level the stock has been above for most of the past five years. Like other fast-growing fintech stocks Block and Upstart Holdings, PayPal hit a rough patch over the past few months. I think the general investor sentiment is that this pandemic winner won't do so well when things slowly normalize and in-person shopping rebounds. The stock skyrocketed 117% in 2020, so the performance in 2021 could simply be the result of a stock that rose too much too fast.
Wall Street analysts forecast PayPal's earnings will rise just 14% year over year in 2022. But the business has beat estimates in each of the past four quarters, making it possible that analysts are a bit too pessimistic about the current year's prospects. Furthermore, it's not out of the question for PayPal to fetch a higher P/E as the year progresses, particularly as management continues its track record of remarkable business execution.
Since it was spun off from eBay in July 2015, PayPal's stock has only had one losing year, and that was in 2021. The market tends to overreact on both the upside and the downside. The high probability of strong financial results, new products and geographic expansion, and an attractive valuation make me believe that PayPal will be a big winner in 2022.

2022-01-07 00:00:00+00:00,Polish parcel locker firm InPost's deployments beat own 2021 target for APMs,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/polish-parcel-locker-firm-inposts-deployments-beat-own-2021-target-for-apms-0,,,"Adds details, background, CEO quote
Jan 7 (Reuters) - Polish parcel locker firm InPost INPST.AS said on Friday it had deployed more automated parcel machines (APMs) globally and in Poland than it had originally targeted.
In 2021, the number of globally deployed APMs, already factoring in the July acquisition of France's Mondial Relay, rose 66% year-on-year to 20,367, including 16,445 operating in Poland, the company's key market.
InPost had targeted 19,350-19,900 APMs globally, while in late December it said it was on track to meet its guidance of 16,000-16,300 APMs in Poland by the end of 2021.
The company is also active in Italy, and Britain where it last year struck deals with eBay EBAY.O and supermarket chain Tesco TSCO.L to install APMs near its stores.
Helped by the busy Christmas season for postal operators, InPost's parcel volumes in its key Polish market rose 21% year-on-year to 126.6 million over October-December.
""We saw record daily volumes in December,"" Chief Executive Officer Rafal Brzoska said in a statement, adding that more than 2.5 million parcels were ordered on Dec. 22 and 23 alone.
The fourth-quarter volumes growth was however slower than in the previous one, and below the full capacity the company prepared for Christmas.
In December, InPost, which also counts Amazon AMZN.O and Polish e-commerce platform Allegro ALEP.WA among its clients, introduced same-day delivery to 20 cities in Poland, with guaranteed delivery to APMs by Christmas Eve for parcels dispatched on Dec. 22 at the latest.
The firm's pick-up and drop-off points (PUDO) parcel volumes in France, where it acquired parcel platform Mondial Relay in July, grew by 14% year-on-year over October-December, while customer usage of newly deployed APMs was stronger than it had expected.

2022-01-06 00:00:00+00:00,A Look at the 3 Best NFT Stocks,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-look-at-the-3-best-nft-stocks,,,"NFT, or non-fungible tokens, is the hottest buzzword right now, with many companies venturing into NFTs. According to a Market Insider report, 2021 was a “breakthrough year” for the sale of NFTs, as total sales volume hit $14 billion.
But what are NFTs? NFTs are digital assets like art, music, or videos created using blockchain technology. Each NFT has a unique digital signature that makes it difficult for NFTs to be exchanged for one another, and no two NFTs can be equal.
What is blockchain? Blockchain's meaning is a network that holds “blocks” of transactions.
Content creators can monetize their content through royalty payments or by selling their art directly to consumers in a unique way through NFTs.
Let us look at some of the best NFT stocks about which analysts are bullish, using the TipRanks stock comparison tool.
Funko (NASDAQ: FNKO)
Funko is a pop culture consumer products company whose products include plush and action toys, vinyl figures, apparel, board games, and accessories.
Funko made its foray into NFTs last year through the acquisition of a major ownership stake in TokenWave for an undisclosed amount. It was TokenWave that developed TokenHead, a website and mobile app that showcases and tracks around 10 million NFTs and has approximately 100,000 visits each day. It is available on both the iOS and Android platforms.
In Q3, the company also launched multiple Digital Pop! NFT Collections that were “sold out in minutes,” according to the company.
In December, Jeffries analyst Stephanie Wissink came away impressed after hosting a call with the company’s executive management. The analyst pointed out numerous growth drivers for the company. Those include steady licensing rates in the mid-teens, as Funko offers licensed content in a wide variety of product categories.
The analyst added that there are other positives for the stock, including growing strength in the direct-to-consumer category and LoungeFly category of products and “real value” when it comes to Funko’s NFT strategy.  
As a result, the analyst is upbeat about the stock, with a Buy rating and a price target of $25 (39% upside) on the stock.
Besides for Wissink, 2 other analysts are also bullish on the stock, with a consensus rating of Strong Buy based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The average Funko stock prediction of $26.50 implies upside potential of 47.4% to current levels.
PLBY Group (NASDAQ: PLBY)
PLBY Group is a leisure, lifestyle, and pleasure company, and owner of the Playboy brand. Similar to FNKO, PLBY Group ventured into NFTs last year. The company did this by partnering with Nifty Gateway, an all-in-one platform owned by Gemini that can be used to buy, sell and store collectibles and digital art.
The aim of this collaboration was to create a series of digital art collaborations between Playboy and Nifty on the Nifty Gateway marketplace. PLBY is of the opinion that its Playboy-themed NFTs could create cross-selling opportunities between its physical products and digital artworks and is also looking at loyalty programs.
Indeed, in Q3, the company’s CEO, Ben Kohn, outlined its strategic roadmap, stating that the Group has made “meaningful progress” against the three strategic pillars.
This includes expanding its direct-to-consumer (DTC) commerce business in the United States, “optimizing our licensing partnerships in key territories and categories, and driving new recurring revenue growth initiatives with a focus on innovative digital offerings such as our soon-to-launch creator-led platform, CENTERFOLD, and our NFT Rabbitars, which we plan to develop into a membership experience.”
The company had unveiled its collection of Playboy Rabbitars NFTs in October last year, consisting of 3D rabbit characters.
Following its strong Q3 results where revenues surged 67% year-over-year, Loop Capital analyst Daniel Adam, while keeping a Buy rating on the stock, raised the price target from $29 to $50 (111.95% upside), all because of NFTs.
The analyst stated in his research note to investors that while his initial coverage of the stock had not accounted for NFTs in his financial model, the news that PLBY sold out $9 million worth of Rabbitars with hours of the NFTs launch was a “testament to the massive opportunity” that existed for the stock.
Two other analysts besides for Adam are also optimistic about the stock, with a consensus rating of Strong Buy based on a unanimous 3 Buys. The average PLBY Group stock prediction of $48.67 implies upside potential of 106.3% to current levels.
When it comes to TipRanks Investors, they are also very positive about the stock. The TipRanks Crowd Wisdom tool indicates that 11.5% out of 538,832 portfolios have upped their holding of PLBY in the last 30 days.
eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY)
eBay is another company that ventured into NFTs last year, by allowing the sale of NFTs on its platform. eBay had stated on its website, following the launch of NFTs, “In the coming months, eBay will add new capabilities that bring blockchain-driven collectibles to our platform.”
The company has not given any color on the sale of NFTs so far. But it is increasingly concentrating on its Marketplace platform and has sold off several business segments over the past two years, including StubHub, Classifieds, and EBAY Korea.
Around two days back, KeyBanc analyst Edward Yruma reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $90 (39.6% upside) on the stock. The analyst perceives that over the next 18 to 24 months, the company could earn more than $1 billion of incremental EBITDA through advertising.
This is because the analyst’s fieldwork regarding the Promoted Listings Advanced (still in beta phase) that was launched back in September and Promoted Listings Express initiatives made him optimistic about the company’s advertising business.
The rest of the analysts on Wall Street are cautiously optimistic about the stock, with a consensus rating of Moderate Buy based on 7 Buys and 12 Holds. The average eBay stock prediction of $78.06 implies upside potential of 21% to current levels.

2022-01-04 00:00:00+00:00,3 Luxury Resale Stocks to Buy Before Market Doubles by 2030,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-luxury-resale-stocks-to-buy-before-market-doubles-by-2030,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The market for luxury apparel is booming as the world becomes more and more aware of its importance. Against this backdrop, luxury resale stocks will do very well.
Pre-owned accessories are a hot commodity, with shoppers eager to invest in high-quality goods that their favorite celebrities wear on-screen or off. The industry is expected to grow by 10% to 15% annually over the next decade. This success can be partly due to changes within our consumer behavior, as well as specialized digital trading platforms that allow buyers and sellers to collaborate more effectively.
Management consulting firm McKinsey & Company conducted a study on this topic and came out with findings that confirm the resale trade is doing very well. Luxury resale is an opportunity that brands cannot miss, and those brands who choose not to participate risk missing out on this significant market.
7 Cheapened Stocks to Buy As We Ride Into 2022
There are many reasons brands invest in the resale market, with high margins and valuable brand identities on their minds. Some remain cautious, though: they know that protecting these assets requires careful planning before diving into any new venture. A brand that can maintain this level of craftsmanship, durability, or sustainability has an attractive aura about them.
Brands that want to stay ahead of the curve and expand their offerings should consider participating in luxury resale markets. By expanding into this space, brands can appeal to more consumers with committed clientele while staying up-to-date on digital innovation; they won’t have any trouble reinforcing sustainability efforts because new opportunities will always be available.
So, without further ado, here are three luxury resale stocks for increased exposure to the fast-growing space:
The RealReal (NASDAQ:REAL)
eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)
Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY)
Luxury Resale Stocks: The RealReal (REAL)

The RealReal is the go-to destination for anyone who wants to sell their unwanted luxury items. With an online marketplace and brick and mortar stores, it has an excellent business model that can cater to a wide variety of customers. Based on the circular economy, it sells authentic vintage clothing (including designer brands), fine jewelry from major designers, and artwork and home decor items.
In the third quarter of this year, revenue skyrocketed to $119 million. The company has seen a 50% increase in the value of goods passing through its platform. This is a whopping 53% increase from last year and 43 percent more than we saw in Q3 2019. The third quarter of 2021 was also roughly 45% higher than the value seen in 2019 before this pandemic. The company handled about 38% more orders versus last year. RealReal hopes that it can maintain these positive trends through the end of this year.
However, the markets are not giving this stock the love it deserves. Shares have been down 8% in the last month. There is a lot of upside at the moment. You can catch this one at a discount before market forces push it up eventually.
eBay (EBAY)

Despite not grabbing as many headlines as its heyday, eBay continues to be a force in the tech world. Like other companies in the space, eBay saw a record increase during the second half of 2020 due to the pandemic. However, sales volume is stabilizing now, leading to anxiety for many investors.
The company’s profits have been steadily declining for the past two quarters, and this trend will continue. In the third quarter, eBay posted revenue growth of 11% year on year. However, sales fell 21% versus the year-ago period. eBay’s growing, niche business sectors helped it beat its sales targets again this quarter. The company is now up on organic revenue growth and profits for the second straight time.
However, despite these positive developments, the markets did not react favorably. Investors were quickly shifting their focus to eBay’s holiday quarter outlook that called for another substantial growth deceleration. Company executives predict that organic sales will land between 3% and 5%, compared to 10% sequentially.
The muted outlook is why eBay stock trades at just 3.5x trailing price-earnings. In the world of luxury resale stocks, you cannot get any bigger or better than eBay. Although recent earnings reports show the company is slowing down, few can compete with its brand value.
Luxury Resale Stocks: Etsy (ETSY)
Source: quietbits / Shutterstock.com
Etsy is a place for people who love handmade goods and vintage items. Users can find anything from jewelry, bags, or clothing to home decorating supplies such as furniture pieces. The rule of thumb is that vintage items must be at least 20 years old.
Etsy’s asset-light business model did very well during the pandemic. Even though Etsy has been experiencing challenging comps from the year-ago period, their organic growth remains robust. Thanks to its highly localized system, the company handled supply chain issues very well. Etsy offers a unique, personalized experience for its shoppers, providing the company with incredible growth and profitability.
The company has grown its gross merchandise sales at a strong rate. It is able to maintain high margins because of its organic growth. However, management has stressed that investors should expect to see significantly lower margins moving forward. Growth metrics skyrocketed during the pandemic but will eventually level off in the coming months.
The markets, though, have priced this one to the moon. There is very little incentive to purchase stock at current price multiples. Although the business model leads to much confidence, it is best to wait for the dip before buying more shares.

2022-01-03 00:00:00+00:00,Surprising Analyst 12-Month Target For RCD,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/surprising-analyst-12-month-target-for-rcd,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Invesco S&P 500— Equal Weight Consumer Discretionary ETF (Symbol: RCD), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $176.49 per unit.
With RCD trading at a recent price near $156.59 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.71% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of RCD's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are PVH Corp (Symbol: PVH), Garmin Ltd (Symbol: GRMN), and eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY). Although PVH has traded at a recent price of $106.65/share, the average analyst target is 19.14% higher at $127.07/share. Similarly, GRMN has 14.81% upside from the recent share price of $136.17 if the average analyst target price of $156.33/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting EBAY to reach a target price of $76.05/share, which is 14.36% above the recent price of $66.50. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of PVH, GRMN, and EBAY:
Combined, PVH, GRMN, and EBAY represent 5.03% of the Invesco S&P 500— Equal Weight Consumer Discretionary ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
Invesco S&P 500— Equal Weight Consumer Discretionary ETF RCD $156.59 $176.49 12.71%
PVH Corp PVH $106.65 $127.07 19.14%
Garmin Ltd GRMN $136.17 $156.33 14.81%
eBay Inc. EBAY $66.50 $76.05 14.36%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2022-01-01 00:00:00+00:00,Will JD.com Be Worth More Than Tesla by 2032?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-jd.com-be-worth-more-than-tesla-by-2032,,,"Since the market bottom during the onslaught of the pandemic, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has returned over 1,400% for investors, a return only a few meme stocks can rival. Its meteoric rise helped the electric vehicle maker break through the trillion-dollar valuation, and it's now worth more than the next 30 or so auto manufacturers combined! That includes the likes of Ford, GM, and Toyota, as well as EV upstarts such as NIO, Xpeng, and Rivian.
To put that in perspective, Tesla has delivered over 628,000 EVs through the first three quarters of 2021, and if it should sell another 270,000 or so, it will have delivered 900,000 vehicles this year, a phenomenal growth record for the EV industry leader.
Image source: Tesla.
Yet through November, Ford has sold more than 1.7 million vehicles, and though the chip shortage continues to wreak havoc on carmakers, the Blue Oval should end the year with twice as many vehicle sales as Tesla. Now add in all the cars sold by other old-line car manufacturers, and it's understandable why some analysts think Tesla's $1,086 per-share stock price is a bit overblown.
An internet sales behemoth
Certainly Tesla is having a banner year, but so is Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com (NASDAQ: JD). Third-quarter revenue for the internet retailer jumped 25% from last year to hit $33.9 billion (or more than three times as much as Tesla recorded for the period).
During the annual Singles Day sales event, an 11-day shopping extravaganza participated in by retailers across the country, JD.com alone generated $54.6 billion in gross merchandise volume. Again for more perspective, Amazon generated sales of $11.2 billion across its two-day Prime Day event.
Obviously the Chinese market is orders of magnitude larger than that of the U.S., and unlike Amazon, JD.com operates more like eBay because it's a platform for third-party sellers to sell goods rather than selling products itself. Yet that just underscores how undervalued JD.com seemingly is. It has a market capitalization one-tenth that of Tesla, or $107 billion. That also puts it about a third of the size of rival Alibaba, which has had a spate of weak earnings reports.
Not so for JD.com. Annual active customers are running 25% higher than last year, hitting 552.2 million, and service revenue surged 43% to $5.1 billion. It's entering new markets like groceries and pharmacy, which will diversify its business away from consumer electronics and appliances, while establishing a physical retail presence through JD Mall, a Xian, China shopping mall. That's actually in addition to JD Super Experience, a store for consumer electronics it opened in March.

Clouds on the horizon
Of course, it's risky business to invest in Chinese stocks these days as Beijing continues to apply pressure to tech giants and the wealthy. There has always been a bit of push and pull between capitalist businesses operating in the communist country and the government, but that government has been waging a battle against the monied interests in China for over two years now.
JD.com has said it has nothing to worry about as it complies with all the edicts of the government, but you never know where the mercurial rulers and regulators will target next.
Still, Wall Street remains generally upbeat about the e-commerce giant and has set a consensus one-year price target of $103.50 per share, or about 51% above where it currently trades.
A race to the finish line
Over the next decade, it seems likely JD.com's value will increase significantly, even with the headwinds of closer regulatory scrutiny, simply because the genie of online shopping can't ever be put back in the bottle. The internet retailer is an integral part of the Chinese economy, and breaking that bond would be disastrous for everyone.
Can it gain Tesla-like heights? While becoming a trillion-dollar company seems hard to imagine, even over the next decade, a combination of Tesla having a more down-to-earth valuation, coupled with JD.com's own value growing, makes it quite possible, even likely, that the e-commerce leader could be worth more than the EV maker.
