2022-03-08 00:00:00+00:00,These Leading Discount Retailers Are Outperforming the Market,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-leading-discount-retailers-are-outperforming-the-market,,,"As costs have spiked for businesses, it’s become increasingly difficult for even the leading discount retailers and other low-cost stores to maintain prices at a fixed level. Last month, data from the Labor Department showed the producer price index (PPI) rose 1% for the month of January and 9.7% for the prior 12-month period – a near-record high going back to 2010. 
We’ll get a further glimpse into February’s PPI next week, while the latest CPI data comes out this Thursday. Lower-than-expected numbers could signal an easing of supply chain issues which could lead to cooler consumer prices, while hotter inflation prints may exaggerate the move even further.
Discount retailers primarily sell low-margin consumables such as food, household staples, and seasonal goods. It becomes more challenging for these companies to hold costs low when their own costs are skyrocketing. That’s why it’s very important – particularly in this type of market environment – to identify businesses that are able to pass on these increased costs to consumers without any negative effects.
One of the more defensive businesses, discount retailers are consumer staples that are fairly resilient. The leaders in this space exhibit high pricing power. They can pass on rising costs without losing much volume at all. These defensive companies tend to fare better during inflationary periods and market downturns.
Let’s take a deeper look at two leading discount retailers that are outpacing their peers. Both companies are part of the Zacks – Retail and Wholesale Sector, which ranks in the top 44% out of 16 Zacks Ranked Sectors. By targeting stocks within the top sectors, we can dramatically improve our investing results.
Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR)
Dollar Tree operates discount variety retail stores. The company is the largest single-price-point retailer in North America. DLTR provides consumable products such as food and personal care items, household paper and chemicals, health and beauty items, as well as clothing and other fashion accessories.  Dollar Tree was founded in 1986 and is headquartered in Chesapeake, VA.
DLTR was the last major dollar store chain that kept prices at $1 or under before raising prices to $1.25 several months ago. The company acquired Family Dollar back in 2015 to expand its retail reach; it now operates over 16,000 stores in 48 states and five Canadian provinces.
DLTR has been on a hot streak in terms of earnings surprises, exceeding estimates in each of the past nine quarters. The retailer chain posted Q4 EPS last week of $0.91, a +24.66% surprise over the $0.73 consensus. DLTR has posted a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of +11.76%, helping push the stock 36.87% higher in the past year. The stock hit a 52-week high today.
Dollar Tree, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
Analysts covering DLTR have upped their full-year EPS estimates by +7.55% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $7.83, translating to 35% growth relative to last year. Sales are expected to climb 5.63% to $27.8 billion.
Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST)
Costco is a global operator of membership warehouses, offering branded and private-label products across a variety of merchandise categories. The company provides groceries, appliances, sporting goods, office supplies, furniture, houseware items, media products, jewelry, food courts, pharmacies, and tire installation centers. COST operates over 800 warehouses as well as several e-commerce websites. Costco was founded in 1976 and is based in Issaquah, WA.
COST generates revenue from two sources: store sales (98% of revenue) and membership fees (2% of revenue). The company reported its fiscal Q2 results last week, posting EPS of $2.92 – a +8.55% surprise over estimates. Revenues of $51.9 billion also beat expectations. We can see the trends in both earnings and sales have been quite favorable:

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
COST has surpassed earnings expectations in each of the past four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of +13.29% over that timeframe. The stock has responded in kind, advancing over 70% during the past year.
Costco Wholesale Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
Analysts covering COST have also increased their full-year EPS estimates by +3.35% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is now $12.96, reflecting potential growth of 16.97% relative to fiscal 2021.
These two discount retailers are bucking the downtrend of the market.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-03-07 00:00:00+00:00,Your Cardano Gains Are Impressive; Here’s Where to Put Your Profits,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/your-cardano-gains-are-impressive-heres-where-to-put-your-profits,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Cardano (ADA-USD) isn’t having a good year in 2022. It’s down about 40% through March 6. But, then again, how many are? Even Bitcoin (BTC-USD), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has lost around 20%.
Source: Stanslavs / Shutterstock
We’re living in volatile times at the moment. Off the top of my head, I can think of four major issues: a war in Ukraine, Covid-19, record inflation, and rising interest rates. You’d be delusional on the scale of Putin to think ADA-USD shouldn’t be getting banged around.
The reality is that since the end of 2020, Cardano has appreciated by 426%.
How many S&P 500 index companies can make that claim? For that matter, how many U.S.-listed stocks with a market capitalization of $30 billion — Cardano’s recent market cap — can make that claim?
Not many.
If you’re one of the lucky ones who bought in early 2021, my suggestion is you take enough profits off the table to cover your investment. Then sit back and enjoy the ride.
7 Funds to Buy to Sidestep the Stock Market Volatility
In the meantime, what should you buy with the profits? I’ll look at a sampling of stocks with a similar market cap to Cardano but aren’t nearly as volatile.
Good Alternative for Your Cardano Profits
My first option is a bit of a contrarian play. Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) has a market cap of $31.4 billion, almost identical to Cardano’s. Moreover, DLTR stock has done well over the past year, up 37.3%.
However, the discount retailer is not without warts.
The business is going through a significant change at the moment. In November, it announced that it would raise its baseline prices from $1 to $1.25 for the first time in its history. For those who thought it was a reaction to rampant inflation, they’d be wrong.

Click to Enlarge
“This decision is permanent and is not a reaction to short-term or transitory market conditions,” Fortune reported Michael Witynski, Dollar Tree’s president and CEO in their third quarter earnings report. “[The] Company believes this is the appropriate time to shift away from the constraints of the $1.00 price point in order to continue offering extreme value to customers.”
I live in Canada. Montreal-based Dollarama (OTCMKTS:DLMAF) has been very successful with multiple price points above $1. It wasn’t easy implementing them at first, but the payoff was there for shareholders. Dollarama stock is up 652% since it went public in late 2009 at 17.50 CAD ($13.82).
Dollar Tree reported fourth-quarter 2021 results on March 2. The company’s sales were $7.12 billion, $350 million higher than analyst expectations. On the bottom line, it earned $2.01 a share, 23 cents better than the estimate.
Dollar Tree’s come out of its funk. As a result, I expect big things in the next 12-24 months from its stock.
North of the Border Alternative
A strong energy market got that much more robust with the war in Ukraine. As a result, oil and gas prices are through the roof. One oil and gas company that benefits from higher prices is Calgary-based Cenovus Energy (NYSE:CVE). It has a market cap of $32.0 billion, right in Cardano’s wheelhouse.
On the surface, Cenovus might not look like the best investment at the moment. It reported Q4 2021 earnings in early February. Thanks to a $1.9 billion non-cash impairment charge from its U.S. Manufacturing segment (refining), the company lost 408 million CAD ($322.3 million).
However, its adjusted funds flow from operations was 1.95 billion CAD ($1.54 billion), 485% higher than in Q4 2020. Its adjusted funds flow from operations was 7.25 billion CAD ($5.73 billion) for the entire fiscal year, 6,095% higher than a year earlier.
In 2021, Cenovus paid 23.6 billion CAD ($18.6 billion) to acquire Husky Energy. The acquisition increased its total proved plus probable reserves by 24% to 8.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. It is now Canada’s third-largest oil and gas producer.
As Hal Holbrook’s character, Lou Mannheim, said in Wall Street, “Kid, you’re on a roll. Enjoy it while it lasts, ‘cause it never does.”
Cenovus is a buy until further notice.
The Bottom Line
In late February, Input-Output (IOHK), the people behind Cardano, updated what it will be up to in 2022. Primarily, it’s focused on scaling the platform to handle the volumes of transactions handled with the introduction of sustainable finance (RealFi) for real people.
I don’t think there’s any doubt that Cardano has the potential to revisit $2 by the end of the year. I’ve stated many times in past articles that it has honest-to-goodness utility. That hasn’t changed.
What has changed is the global economic environment. It’s a tinderbox. Cryptocurrencies, like stocks, have been exceptionally volatile investments. Until Russia stands down, that won’t change. It can’t.
For this reason, I would continue to exercise caution concerning your crypto investments. If you’re in for the long haul, cover your initial cost, and hold on tight.

2022-03-04 00:00:00+00:00,What Are the Best Stocks to Buy for Inflation? Here Are Our Top 10 Picks ,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-are-the-best-stocks-to-buy-for-inflation-here-are-our-top-10-picks,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
U.S. inflation rates took off last year and the trend persists in 2022. Annual inflation soared to a staggering 7.5% in January — a record level last seen back in 1982. Individual incomes could fail to catch up with rising prices and escalating costs of living, while high inflation can wipe away significant chunks of purchasing power from retirement portfolios. Its therefore important that investors look up the best stocks to buy for inflation protection right now.
The truth is, the effects of high inflation can be extremely ugly if not well hedged against in an investment portfolio. Not all companies are the same, and most businesses will face rising operating costs, shrinking margins and declining sales volumes as they fail to pass rising costs to price-sensitive customers, who tighten their belts as inflation bites their pockets.
Thus, investors should buy more stocks of resilient consumer defensive businesses with high pricing power. These can pass on rising costs to customers without losing volumes. Companies offering exposure to inflation resilient commodities, real estate and consumer basics can fair better during inflationary periods.
7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever
These 10 best stocks to buy for inflation could help shield a retirement portfolio from the negative impact of high inflation:
Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN)
Walmart (NYSE:WMT)
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR)
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP)
Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS)
Freeport-MacMoran Inc. (NYSE:FCX)
AvalonBay Communities (NYSE:AVB)
Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG)
Let’s have a closer look at each.
Best Stocks to Buy for Inflation: Tyson Foods (TSN)
Source: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com
Tyson Foods is one of the world’s largest food companies, producing around 20% of the beef, pork, and chicken in the United States.
The company’s fourth-quarter 2021 sales increased by 11.8% to beat analyst expectations despite weaker volumes because of inflation-justified pricing. Although first-quarter 2022 saw sales volumes increase by a mere .3% year-over-year (YOY), average prices increased by 19.6% YOY to boost revenue and expand Tyson Foods’ operating income margins.
Inflation has been a significant driver of revenue and earnings growth for TSN stock lately. Tyson Foods successfully passes down inflation to its customers and increased its revenue without increasing business volumes. The company gets more profitable as meat prices rise.
Further, consumers usually keep buying basics like protein even if their real incomes shrink with rising inflation. This presents TSN as one of the best stocks to buy for inflation protection in a portfolio. Its business remains intact.
TSN stock has returned over 858% total return over the past 20 years and increased its dividend by more than 1,000% during the past decade.
Walmart (WMT)
Source: Harun Ozmen / Shutterstock.com
Retail giant Walmart sells consumer brands that continue to perform well during inflationary periods. Known as a “discounter,” the grocery store and e-commerce giant sees inflation as an opportunity to gain market share and emphasize its commitment to value for customers.
Walmart’s total revenue for 2021 was $572.8 billion, up 2.4% while the company divested of business that could have contributed $33 billion more to the business.
Consumers flock to value offerings as inflation bites their purchasing power, and Walmart stock is a perfect inflation stock to buy right now if investors expect high inflation to persist for longer. The business enjoys growing market share during troublesome inflation times.
7 Top Growth Stocks to Carry You Through 2022
“We’ve always been an inflation fighter for customers,” Walmart CFO Brett Biggs said in an interview with CNBC. “Our scale and the product breadth that we have allows us to do things in a way that is beneficial to customers and beneficial to shareholders.”
Best Stocks to Buy for Inflation: Dollar Tree (DLTR)
Source: shutterstock.com/Jonathan Weiss
Dollar Tree is an American multi-price-point chain of discount variety stores operating more than 15,000 stores throughout 48 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces.
The retail giant held the line on the $1 price point for over 30 years, but due to rising inflation, the company changed its strategy by bringing prices above $1. This allows Dollar Tree to offer consumers more product selections, rack in more revenue and protect margins to make DLTR one of the best stocks to buy for inflation.
The retailer is aggressively expanding its Dollar Tree Plus branded store network to capture the increasing number of price-sensitive consumers. Plans are in place for the value retailer to reach 5,000 Dollar Tree Plus stores by 2024.
Analysts expect net income margins to rebound in 2022 and attach a five-year earnings growth rate estimate of 14.9% per annum on DLTR stock.
Most noteworthy, DLTR stock exhibits strong momentum right now. Shares trade near their all-time high of $149.37. Any dips could be perfect buying opportunities.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is a leading multinational semiconductor company that could offer inflation-beating returns this year. Demand for AMD’s market-leading chips has surged in recent years as the company steals Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) market share across the board, and that trend might not change soon.
AMD’s revenue increased by a staggering 68% YOY in 2021. Gross margins expanded to a record 48% and operating margins grew from 9.4% in 2019 to 22% in 2021. The company has rediscovered its mojo, and the market expects sales to rise 54% in 2022 as AMD consolidates its lead in the high-end enterprise chips market.
Most noteworthy, even if personal computer (PC) demand softens up after the work-from-home surge during the COVID-19 pandemic, AMD, Intel and Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) product prices are still expected to increase in 2022.
AMD’s asset-light business model, which outsources manufacturing to foundries, could somewhat insulate it from rising operating costs as inflation soars.
7 Metals Stocks to Buy to Mine Profits in 2022
$10,000 invested in AMD stock 10 years ago could have grown to more than $162,000 today with dividend reinvestments.
Best Stocks to Buy for Inflation: Coca-Cola (KO)
Source: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.com
One of the leading global beverages giants The Coca-Cola Company is a relatively safer bet that produces massive earnings and free cash flows during inflationary times. KO stock should benefit from its strong global brands that continue to thrive even as inflationary pressures wreck household spending patterns.
Although costs from aluminum cans to labor and shipping surged over the last year, Coca-Cola has managed to increase its product prices in the face of growing global demand. As a low-labor-cost business, Coca-Cola should emerge largely unscathed from any high-inflation-induced economic stress.
In its 2022 guidance, the company has a 7% to 8% revenue growth target, accompanied by a 8% to 10% annual increase in earnings per share and strong free cash flow generation. Investors could still earn respectable, relatively low-risk returns on Coca-Cola’s stock in the long term.
$10,000 invested in KO stock 10 years ago could have grown to nearly $25,000 today, with dividend reinvestments. The current KO stock dividend yields 2.8% annually.
PepsiCo (PEP)
Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com
PepsiCo stock shares many attributes with Coca-Cola, but it enjoys an added inflation advantage that KO lacks. The company owns strong consumer brands that will remain attractive even if inflation bites, but there’s more.
The company has popular small-priced consumer snacks including Fritos, Walkers, Cheetos, Lays and Doritos that could show low price elasticity of demand if it adjusts prices for rising costs due to inflation.
7 Butchered Tech Stocks With Plenty of Hope Left
Most noteworthy, PepsiCo controls its supply chain up to the retail store. It has room to control costs. PEP stock investors should take note that fourth-quarter revenue rose 12.4% despite single-digit volume increases.
Best Stocks to Buy for Inflation: Mosaic Company (MOS)
Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com
The Mosaic Company’s stock is one of the best stocks to buy for inflation because it supplies basic primary agricultural inputs its customers can’t resist buying even as prices rise. Mosaic sells potash, phosphate and chemicals.
Canpotex, Mosaic’s joint-venture with Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) recently signed a huge deal to supply China and India with potash fertilizer at prices double 2021 levels. The latest Canpotex contracts price with India Potash and China at $590 per metric ton through December 2022 compares favorably with $247 per metric ton negotiated by Belarusian suppliers last year.
MOS stock is well-positioned to outperform the market in 2022. Its investors could easily reap above-inflation returns as they hold this stock.
Freeport-MacMoran Inc. (FCX)
Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.com
Still, with commodities companies, Freeport-McMoran mines for more copper than any publicly-traded firm in the world, and the company benefits from rising copper prices as world economies rebound post the pandemic.
World copper prices have risen dramatically over the past three years, and prices could continue to soar as electric vehicles (EV) begin to replace our old internal combustion engines during this decade. An increased focus on green energy projects across the world means increasing demand for copper wire. Additionally, the company’s rising gold production amplifies FCX stock’s upside as gold prices rebound with geopolitical crises in 2022.
7 Best Stocks to Buy for a Recession
FCX stock investors could see the company reap growing revenues, earn increasing profits and distribute ever-abundant cash flows as commodity prices rise.
Best Stocks to Buy for Inflation: AvalonBay Communities (AVB)
Source: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.com
AvalonBay Communities is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns a growing portfolio of 297 apartment communities containing 87,992 apartment homes in 12 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Real estate is a beautiful asset class to add to any portfolio, largely for its proven ability to retain real value during inflation.
Rentals and real estate prices are some of the biggest components in any national inflation statistics. As a residential real estate operator, AvalonBay’s asset values rise with inflation, and the trust’s short-term leases protect its income from rising inflation as rentals are renegotiated at each lease expiry date.
Most noteworthy, the market remains hot as housing formation continues to accelerate since the early 2000s — a trend that could persist into the next decade. More than three million families were created during the COVID-19 pandemic. More tenants are coming.
Rent growth should insulate investors in AVB units from inflation impacts, and growing distributions could shield a retirement portfolio’s purchasing power from inflation effects. Returns may closely track or beat general inflation.
Bunge Limited (BG)
Source: Shutterstock
Agricultural commodities giant Bunge Ltd. demonstrated in 2021 how a well-positioned business can wildly benefit from rising inflation.
Its agribusiness segment sales increased by 45% YOY in 2021 despite a .7% decline in comparable volumes. Likewise, refined and specialty oils sales jumped 39% over 2020 revenue even as volumes declined by 3.4% annually. Commodity price inflation lifted BG’s earnings margins and boosted its cash flows.
Analysts expect a further 39% revenue growth in 2022 as commodities continue to rally this year. BG stock has returned nearly 12% so far this year, and returns could be higher if the business executes well again this year.

2022-03-04 00:00:00+00:00,"Big Lots (BIG) Q4 Earnings Lag Estimates, Comparable Sales Fall",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/big-lots-big-q4-earnings-lag-estimates-comparable-sales-fall,,,"Big Lots, Inc. BIG reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2021, with the top and the bottom line declining year over year. Earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while sales met the same.

This Columbus, OH-based player reported earnings of $1.75 per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89 per share. The metric declined from earnings per share (EPS) of $2.59 reported in the year-ago quarter. Management had guided EPS of $1.80-$1.95 for the fiscal fourth quarter.

Net sales inched down 0.3% to $1,732 million year over year but came in line with Zacks Consensus Estimate. The year-over-year downside was due to soft comparable sales. Comparable sales fell 2.3% against a 7.9% rise seen last year. Management highlighted that its fourth-quarter sales were below expectation owing to more-than-anticipated inclement weather in January and the impact of spike in omicron on traffic along with some inventory challenges. Net new stores and relocations contributed roughly 200 basis points (bps) to sales. Total sales rose 7.8% from fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 levels. On a two-year basis, comparable sales rose 5.4%, reflecting sustained underlying growth.

 More on Results
Broyhill, one of the company’s key owned brand continues to deliver promising growth. Broyhill brand rose 7% year over year and contributed nearly $140 million to quarterly sales. During the quarter, Real Living brand was up more than 20% year over year.

The company highlighted that its e-commerce business has grown 3.5 times from 2019 levels in terms of profitability. Management believes that e-commerce will become a $1-billion business in the next few years. The company offers curbside pick-up, ship from store capabilities and same-day delivery via Instacart and pick-up. Management continues to witness nearly 65% of its demand being fulfilled via such capabilities. Big Lots continues to experience strength in the Operation North Star strategy and is focused on its key drivers, including customer growth, merchandise productivity, e-commerce and store count.

Gross profit declined to $646.1 million from $685.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The company’s gross margin contracted to 37.3% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 39.4%. Gross margin was hurt by shrink and freight headwinds.

In the reported quarter, selling and administrative expenses came in at $541.2 million, up from $520.6 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The metric (as a percentage of net sales) expanded to 31.2% from the prior-year quarter’s tally of 30%. BIG recorded an operating profit of $67.5 million compared with nearly $131 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.
Other Financial Details
Big Lots ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $54 million and long-term debt of $4 million. Total shareholders’ equity was $1,007.4 million. Inventories increased 32% to $1,238 million in the fiscal fourth quarter.
For 52-weeks ended Jan 29, 2022, BIG generated net cash worth $193.8 million from operating activities. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $38 million, while the metric came in at $161 million for fiscal 2021. Capital expenditure for 2022 is expected between $210 million and $230 million.

During the reported quarter, Big Lots repurchased 2.1 million shares worth $91 million. For fiscal 2021, management repurchased 7.7 million worth $418 million. The board also announced a quarterly cash dividend of 30 cents a share, payable Apr 1, 2022, to shareholders of record as of Mar 18.

In 2021, Big Lots opened 23 net new stores, which are performing above expectations. For 2022, the company expects to open more than 50 net new stores, roll out more programs to drive merchandise productivity along with improving its supply chain infrastructure. During the year, the company will accelerate its next-generation furniture sales strategy. The program is presently in action across more than 120 stores. The company plans to scale up the program to almost 650 stores by the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The move will result in almost two points of benefit to the annualized comp for the company.

Outlook
For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, management anticipates EPS in the range of $1.10-$1.20. The view takes into account a comparable sales growth of roughly 10% compared with 2019’s level, same as a low double-digit decline in comparable sales compared with first-quarter 2021. Management expects nearly 130 bps growth from net new and relocated stores in the quarter.

The company expects the quarterly gross margin rate to decline by roughly 50 bps year over year, thanks to higher-than-expected freight costs and increased shrink accrual rate. Management also expects a slight year-over-year rise in expense dollars, mainly due to additional supply chain expenses, inflationary wage impacts and new store-related costs. Such a rise in costs are somewhat likely to be offset by the variable expense impact of reduced sales as well as reduced bonus and equity compensation expense.

For fiscal 2022, the company expects comparable sales and gross margin rates to be almost flat year over year. Management expects modest operating expense deleverage owing to inflationary impacts and growth-related investments.

Shares of the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have declined 15.9% compared with the industry’s 5.6% fall.

2022-03-04 00:00:00+00:00,"Burlington Stores' (BURL) Q4 Earnings Miss, Revenues Rise Y/Y",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/burlington-stores-burl-q4-earnings-miss-revenues-rise-y-y,,,"Burlington Stores, Inc. BURL reported lower-than-expected results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2021. Nevertheless, the top and the bottom line compared favorably with the respective year-ago tallies. Quarterly performance was primarily buoyed by the successful execution of the Burlington 2.0 initiative. Also, BURL’s store-related efforts, including smaller store prototype, have been on track for a while.

Lower-than-expected results for the fiscal fourth quarter coupled with a soft comparable-store sales (comps) and operating margin view for the first quarter and fiscal 2022 weighed on the stock. Consequently, shares of Burlington Stores have plunged 13% in the trading hours on Mar 3. Over the past six months, the stock has decreased 21.5%, wider than the industry's 15.4% decline.
Insight into the Headlines
Burlington Stores delivered adjusted earnings of $2.53 per share, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22. However, the bottom line increased 3.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $2.44 per share but decreased 21.2% from $3.21 recorded in fourth-quarter fiscal 2019.

Total revenues of $2,609 million climbed 14.3% from the last fiscal year’s reported figure and 18.1% from the fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 figure. Net sales increased nearly 18% from the fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 number to $2,603.5 million while Other revenues decreased 23.6% to $5.5 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stood higher at $2,781 million for the reported quarter.

Comps grew 6% from the fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 reading. Lower traffic and reduced spending per shopper mainly induced comps decline. Lower traffic in December was due to external factors, including the surge in the omicron variant and warm weather.
Margins
Gross margin was 39.8% in the reported quarter, down 230 basis points (bps) from the fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 actuals. Merchandise margins grew 30 bps, more than offset by a 260-bps rise in freight expense.

Adjusted SG&A as a rate of sales was 22.2%, improving 50 bps from the fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 actuals. Product sourcing costs included in SG&A came in at $159 million, up from $89 million seen in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Product sourcing costs represent the processing goods expenses via supply chain and buying costs. Higher supply-chain costs mainly caused the deleverage.

Adjusted EBITDA decreased 12% from the fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 tally to $307 million. The metric also showed a decline from adjusted EBITDA of $280.2 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.

Adjusted EBIT was $241 million, down 18% from the fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 reading. However, the metric showed a jump from the adjusted EBIT of $223.5 million witnessed during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Adjusted EBIT margin fell 410 bps from the fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 finals.
Other Financial Aspects
This presently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Burlington Stores ended the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,091.1 million, long-term debt of $1,541.1 million and stockholders’ equity of $760.4 million. It exited the fiscal fourth quarter with $1,685 million of liquidity, including $1,091 million of unrestricted cash and $594 million available under its ABL facility.

Burlington Stores ended the quarter with $1,555 million of outstanding total debt, comprising $957 million under its Term Loan Facility, $572 million of Convertible Notes and no borrowings under its ABL Facility. During the reported quarter, management extended the maturity of the ABL facility from June 2023 to December 2026, and increased the size from $600 million to $650 million and lowered applicable interest rate margins.

Merchandise inventories were $1021.7 million, up 31.4% from the fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 tally. Comparable store inventories fell 30% from the level recorded in the same quarter of fiscal 2019. Reserve inventory accounted for 50% of the total inventory at the end of the reported quarter.

Burlington Stores bought back 344,492 shares for $100 million under its share repurchase plan in the fiscal fourth quarter. As of Jan 29, 2022, BURL had $150 million remaining under the share repurchase authorization. In February, BURL’s board authorized repurchasing up to an additional $500 million, slated to be executed through February 2024.

BURL exited fiscal 2021 with 840 stores after opening 101 stores, relocating 17 and shutting down 5, thus adding 79 net new stores. Of the new stores, 48 were in the 30,000 square foot or smaller, representing the latest small store prototype. For fiscal 2022, management intends to open 120 stores, adding 90 net new stores. It aims to relocate or close 30 stores in the aforementioned period. About 80 of such stores will be opened in the smaller format. Over the next five years, 75% of the stores will be introduced in the small format.
Outlook
Management did not provide specific sales and earnings view for fiscal 2022 (the 52 weeks ending Jan 28, 2023) due to the prevalent pandemic uncertainty and the pace of recovery of customer demand. Burlington Stores anticipates witnessing significant freight and supply-chain cost pressures through the fiscal fourth quarter.

Management assumes a baseline comp decline in mid-single-digits for the full fiscal. This will cause an operating margin deleverage of nearly 150 bps. The estimate indicates that freight and supply-chain expenses will remain at high levels through the middle of the ongoing fiscal year and then start to abate.

For fiscal first quarter, comps are expected to decrease in mid-teens with the operating margin deleverage of 750 bps from the level reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. On a stack basis, the fiscal first quarter plan suggests comps growth of about 5% from the fiscal 2019 level and a deleveraged operating margin of 400 bps. This deleverage will be mainly due to increased freight and supply-chain expenses.

Capital expenditures, net of landlord allowances for fiscal 2022, are likely to be roughly $725 million.

2022-03-03 00:00:00+00:00,2 Monster Stocks to Buy Without Any Hesitation,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-monster-stocks-to-buy-without-any-hesitation-0,,,"Realty Income (NYSE: O) and Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) are two companies that offer dependable returns backed up by their consistent growth. These businesses, though vastly different, offer great long-term opportunities for investors. Neither stock is inexpensive, but their high valuations reflect the confidence investors have in the companies' expected sales in the coming years.
Their business models appear to be relatively recession-proof. While Realty Income's tenants are primarily in retail, for the most part, they operate in businesses that are not threatened by the rise in online sales. Intuitive Surgical is an industry leader in robotic surgery, which, because of its increased safety and ability to cut costs, is expected to increase. Many of the procedures done by Intuitive Surgical's robotic systems can't be put off, even during a recession, such as heart bypass surgeries or prostate cancer surgeries.

Realty Income's reliability offers multiple rewards
Realty Income is well known to dividend investors because it pays out a dividend monthly rather than a quarterly one. There's a lot more to what makes the real estate investment trust (REIT) a monster stock: consistent dividend increases, steady growth in adjusted funds from operation (AFFO), and reliable share price growth.
The stock's price is up more than 12% this year, and over the past 10 years, it has delivered a total return of 205%. The monthly dividend is $0.2465 per share, giving it a yield at current prices of 4.24%. It has increased its dividend for 97 consecutive quarters.
Realty Income released its 2021 year-end report on Feb. 22 and reported $3.59 in AFFO per share, up 5.9% over 2020. Over the past decade, the company has grown AFFO per share by 74.3%. With REITs, AFFO is a more predictable indicator of performance than the traditional earnings per share (EPS) metric because it eliminates the negative effect of depreciation on real estate investments that are more likely to gain in value. I also used adjusted AFFO rather than simply FFO because AFFO takes into account the capital expenditures that are typically needed to maintain properties.
The dividend is rather safe because Realty Income sticks with long-term leases (with an average of nine years left on its leases) to well-known retailers like Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), Dollar General (NYSE: DG), and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR), and not one of its tenants is responsible for more than 4.1% of its portfolio of 11,136 properties.
In the fourth quarter, Realty Income collected 99.5% of its rents, and its properties were 98.5% occupied. The company's AFFO payout ratio in 2021 was 78.5%, slightly higher than the industrial REIT industry average of 76.1% in the third quarter, but considering the quality of the company's clients and the long-term leases of Realty Income, its payouts are still safe.
Intuitive Surgical keeps building on its base
Intuitive Surgical leads the industry in sales of robotic-assisted surgery machines and their peripherals. Intuitive's shares are down more than 18% year to date, but up more than 18% over the past 12 months and its total return is more than 425% over the past 10 years, outdistancing the S&P 500 average of 370% over that time.
The company is a monster stock because of its consistent revenue growth. Apart from 2020, when the pandemic led to fewer elective procedures that require Intuitive Surgical's systems, the company has increased revenue every year since 2014. Over the past 10 years, it has grown annual revenue by 162%.
Last year, Intuitive reported $5.7 billion in revenue, up 31% over 2020, with annual earnings per share (EPS) of $4.66 in 2021, compared to $3.02 in 2020. In the fourth quarter, it reported $1.55 billion in revenue, up 17% year over year, and the company said it grew its da Vinci Surgical System installed base to 6,730 systems last year, up 12% over 2020. Keeping in mind the pandemic still had a big negative impact on elective procedures last year, it's easy to see how the company is set up for an even larger jump this year.
The number of installed systems is crucial to Intuitive's business because it makes more money from the regular updating of instruments, accessories, and other services from its robotic systems than it does selling the actual systems. For example, in the fourth quarter, the company made $469.9 million from the 385 da Vinci systems it sold, and $1.08 billion in revenue from instruments, accessories, and services for its systems.
The healthcare company has significant tailwinds that make it a good long-term choice. As a pioneer in robotic surgery, it has a market edge that is reinforced by the high switching expense of robotic systems, which can cost as much as $2.6 million, not counting the consumables that go with them and the training costs of using them.
On top of that, there is plenty of growth expected in the industry. A report by Mordor Intelligence values theglobal marketfor surgical robotics at $4.43 billion in 2020, rising to $9.59 billion by 2026, giving it a compound annual growth rate of 11.4% over that period.

The markets have been volatile to start this year, but that could work out in investors' favor. Right now, you can take advantage of the a momentary a dip in their prices to gobble up shares. Of the two, I think there's more long-term growth potential for Intuitive Surgical, though both stocks are solid choices if you're looking for strong long-term returns with rewarding dividends.

2022-03-03 00:00:00+00:00,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Discretionary ETF (RCD) a Strong ETF Right Now?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-invesco-sp-500-equal-weight-consumer-discretionary-etf-rcd-a-strong-etf-right-now-0,,,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Consumer Discretionary ETFs category of the market, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Discretionary ETF (RCD) is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 11/01/2006.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.
Market cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.
Fund Sponsor & Index
RCD is managed by Invesco, and this fund has amassed over $470.84 million, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Consumer Discretionary ETFs. RCD, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Discretionary Index.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Discretionary Index equally weights stocks in the consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.40% for this ETF, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.59%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
ETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
Representing 100% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Consumer Discretionary sector.
Looking at individual holdings, Tesla Inc (TSLA) accounts for about 2.35% of total assets, followed by Ford Motor Co (F) and Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR).
RCD's top 10 holdings account for about 18.84% of its total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF has lost about -10.75% so far this year and it's up approximately 3.71% in the last one year (as of 03/03/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $131.66 and $160.55.
RCD has a beta of 1.40 and standard deviation of 29.46% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 65 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Discretionary ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Consumer Discretionary ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.
Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR) tracks MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Discretionary 25/50 Index and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLY) tracks Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index. Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF has $6.06 billion in assets, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF has $19.70 billion. VCR has an expense ratio of 0.10% and XLY charges 0.10%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Consumer Discretionary ETFs.

Peter Lynch Stock Ideas
About Peter Lynch: Perhaps the greatest mutual fund manager of all-time, Lynch guided Fidelity Investment's Magellan Fund to a 29.2 percent average annual return from 1977 until his retirement in 1990, almost doubling the S&P 500's 15.8 percent yearly return over that time. Lynch's common sense approach and quick wit made him one of the most quoted investors on Wall Street. (""Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it,"" is one of his many pearls of wisdom.) Lynch's bestseller One Up on Wall Street is something of a ""stocks for the everyman/everywoman"", breaking his approach down into easy-to-understand concepts.

2022-03-03 00:00:00+00:00,"Abercrombie (ANF) Dips on Q4 Earnings & Sales Miss, High Costs",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/abercrombie-anf-dips-on-q4-earnings-sales-miss-high-costs,,,"Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ANF posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 results, wherein both top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, earnings declined year over year, while sales improved. Results were mainly impacted by inventory delays due to supply-chain headwinds during the holiday season, as well as the surge in Omicron cases.

Following the dismal top and bottom-line performance, as well as a bleak outlook, Abercrombie’s shares declined 13.1% on Mar 3. Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 11.8% in the past year against the industry's decline of 39.7%.

 Overall Sales & Earnings Picture
Abercrombie delivered adjusted earnings of $1.14 per share in fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28 and declined 24% from $1.50 earned in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decline in the bottom line can be attributed to inventory delays during the peak holiday season and the surge in Omicron cases, which led to soft sales trends in the quarter.

Moreover, margins in the quarter were impacted by higher freight costs due to supply-chain woes and increased operating expenses related to elevated payroll and marketing expenses.

Net sales of $1,161.4 million advanced 4% year over year but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,180 million. However, sales declined 2% from the comparable fiscal 2019 period. Digital net sales rose 17% to $556 million, and represented 48% of total sales. Sales in the quarter were mainly impacted by unexpected inventory delays for the peak holiday selling period, primarily impacting Hollister and Gilly Hicks.

However, the company noted that average unit retail (AUR) improved across all brands, regions and channels due to reduced promotions, markdowns and clearance activity. This marked the seventh consecutive quarter of AUR growth for the company.
Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
  Abercrombie & Fitch Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Abercrombie & Fitch Company Quote
Sales By Region and Brands
Sales were strong in the United States, up 7% year over year to $841.7 million. However, International sales declined 4% to $319.7 million, owing to lower sales in the EMEA and APAC regions, mainly because of the disruptions from COVID-related lock-downs and restrictions. Compared with fourth-quarter fiscal 2019, sales in the United States improved 3%, while international sales were down 14%.

Sales in the EMEA region fell 4% year over year to $226.1 million. The company witnessed increased impacts in the U.K. through most of the quarter, while the Netherlands and Austria continued to experience COVID-related closures. In APAC, sales declined 21% to $46.2 million.

Brand wise, net sales at Hollister advanced 2% year over year to $668.8 million, while at Abercrombie, sales increased 6% to $492.6 million.
Margins
Gross profit dipped 0.3% year over year to $677.1 million. The gross margin contracted 220 basis points (bps) to 58.3%. However, the gross margin improved 10 bps compared with fourth-quarter fiscal 2019. In the quarter, the company witnessed $80 million (700 bps) of increase in freight costs, which was more than offset by higher AUR growth across brands and channels.

Operating expenses, excluding other operating income, increased 5.4% from the year-ago period to $581 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher payroll and marketing expenses, partially offset by a decline in store occupancy expenses. Operating expenses also declined 2.7% from fourth-quarter fiscal 2019. The decline versus fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 was driven by investments in marketing, increased digital fulfillment expenses and higher incentive-based compensation, partially offset by savings in store-related expenses.

As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 50.2% declined 30 bps from 50.5% in the prior-year quarter, while it increased 230 bps from 47.9% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2019.

Adjusted operating income totaled $100 million, down 23.7% from $131.5 million in the year-ago quarter. We note that the operating margin expanded 310 bps to 8.6%.
Other Financials
Abercrombie ended fiscal 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $823.1 million, long-term gross borrowings of $303.6 million, and stockholders’ equity of $826.1 million, excluding non-controlling interests. The company had liquidity of $1.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2021, including cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings of $248 million under the ABL Facility. Net cash provided by operating activities was $274 million for fiscal 2021.

In fiscal 2021, the company spent $97 million toward capital expenditure, of which one-third was allocated to stores and the remainder for digital technology and maintenance needs. For fiscal 2022, the company anticipates a capital expenditure of $150 million.

In the quarter under review, the company repurchased 4.1 million shares for $142 million. It repurchased 10.2 million shares for $377 million in fiscal 2021. The company now has $358 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization announced in November 2021.
Store Update
In the fiscal fourth quarter, Abercrombie opened 15 stores and closed 21 stores. This brings the total store openings to 38 and store closures to 44 in fiscal 2021. As of Jan 29, 2022, the company’s total store base was 729, including 524 stores in the United States and 205 stores internationally.
Outlook
For first-quarter fiscal 2022, management envisions net sales growth in the low-single digits from the first-quarter fiscal 2021 level of $781 billion.

Abercrombie expects the gross profit rate to decline 400 bps year over year compared with the first-quarter fiscal 2021 reported rate of 63.4%. The guidance takes into account incremental adverse impacts of about $65 million of freight cost pressure compared with the prior year. This is likely to be partly offset by an increase in AUR.

The company anticipates operating expenses, excluding other operating income, to increase 6% from the adjusted operating income of $436 million reported in first-quarter fiscal 2021. Abercrombie expects to deliver operating margin above the pre-pandemic levels in the fiscal first quarter, as it has evolved its gross margin and expense structure to absorb a significant portion of the pressures from higher levels of inflation.

For fiscal 2022, the company anticipates net sales growth of 2.4% from $3.7 billion reported in fiscal 2021. It expects the United States to continue outperforming the EMEA and APAC regions. However, it is cautiously optimistic about the trends in these regions as COVID restrictions continue to be updated.

The gross margin is expected to decline 200 bps from 62.3% in fiscal 2021. The company expects freight and raw material inflation of 300-400 bps in fiscal 2022, with most freight expenses weighted in the first half and raw materials in the second half. The company expects to partly offset these headwinds with higher AUR, driven by a rise in selected tickets and a continued decline in promotions.

Abercrombie anticipates operating expenses, excluding other income, to increase in a range similar to sales, suggesting an increase of 2-4% from the fiscal 2021 reported level. The company expects an effective tax rate in the high 20% range for fiscal 2022. Considering the above-mentioned expectations, management expects an operating margin of 7-8% for fiscal 2022.

DLTR has posted mixed fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 results, wherein earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while sales lagged the same. Meanwhile, sales improved year over year but earnings declined.

Higher-than-expected freight costs in the reported quarter primarily hurt bottom-line growth and the gross margin. Compelling results from the H2, Dollar Tree Plus and the new Combo Stores, which are part of the company’s key initiatives, drove the fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 results.

Shares of DLTR declined more than 3% on Mar 2 due to the sales miss. However, shares of the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 2% in the past three months against the industry's decline of 6.6%.

 Quarter in Detail
Dollar Tree’s earnings declined 5.6% year over year to $2.01 per share but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.79. The year-over-year decrease can be attributed to dismal margins and rising SG&A costs.

Consolidated net sales rose 4.6% year over year to $7,044.7 million but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,127 million. Enterprise same-store sales (comps) improved 2.5% year over year. For the Dollar Tree banner, comps were up 3.1%, while comps for the Family Dollar banner rose 1.7% year over year.

Gross profit declined 0.7% year over year to $2,137.1 million, while the gross margin contracted 160 bps to 30.2%. The decline in the gross margin can be attributed to elevated freight costs and recall-related markdowns, partly negated by continued improvement in shrink, positive product mix and lower distribution costs. The gross margin contracted 50 bps to 35.6% at the Dollar Tree banner and 320 bps to 23.4% at the Family Dollar segment.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, expanded 40 bps to 22.1% due to elevated store payroll, card transaction fees, legal fees, and costs related to conversions at all Dollar Tree stores in the United States.

While the operating income declined 15.1% to $578.8 million, the operating margin contracted 190 bps to 8.2%, driven by a soft gross margin. Segment-wise, the operating margin contracted 100 bps to 15% for Dollar Tree and 330 bps to 2.7% at the Family Dollar segment.
Balance Sheet
Dollar Tree ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $984.9 million. Net merchandise inventories increased 27.4% to $4,367.3 million. It had net long-term debt (excluding current maturities) of $3,417 million and shareholders’ equity of $7,718.5 million as of Jan 29, 2022.

In fiscal 2021, the company repurchased 9,156,898 shares for $950 million. As of Jan 29, 2022, Dollar Tree had $2.5 billion remaining under its existing authorization. For fiscal 2021, it expects to incur a capital expenditure of $1,021.2 million.

Store Update
In fourth-quarter fiscal 2021, Dollar Tree opened 174 stores, expanded or relocated 24 outlets, and shuttered 65 stores. The company completed the renovation of 23 Family Dollar stores to the H2 or Combo Store formats. As of Jan 29, 2022, the company operated 16,077 stores in 48 states and five Canada provinces.
Key Real Estate Initiatives Update
Dollar Tree is delivering compelling results for its key initiatives, which include the expansion of its $3 and $5 plus assortment in Dollar Tree stores, as well as Combo Stores. It also remains on track with H2 Renovations at Family Dollar stores.

In fiscal 2022, the company expects to complete 800 Family Dollar H2 Renovations as part of the Key Real Estate Initiative. Out Of this, 190 will be Dollar Tree stores and 400 Family Dollar stores. Within the Family Dollar stores, 350 stores will be in the Combo Store format. Also, management intends to expand the $3 and $5 Plus assortments to more than 1,500 Dollar Tree stores.

The company revealed plans to launch a $1.25 price point initiative for the majority of Dollar Tree’s assortment in a bid to expand its offerings, and launch products and sizes. The move will enable Dollar Tree to reintroduce some customer favorites and traffic-driving products, which were discontinued earlier due to the $1 pricing constraint. The transition was implemented to all Dollar Tree stores by the end of February 2022, more than two months ahead of time.
Outlook
For first-quarter fiscal 2022, Dollar Tree expects consolidated net sales of $6.63-$6.78 billion, with enterprise same-store sales growth in the low-single digits. It anticipates earnings of $1.95-$2.10 per share.

For fiscal 2022, the company expects net sales of $27.22-$27.85 billion and same-store sales growth in the low to mid-single digits. Management envisions earnings of $7.60-$8.00 per share.

ROST reported mixed results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2021, wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the top line missed the same. Meanwhile, earnings declined year over year and sales improved from the prior year. ROST provided a two-year comparison for all metrics as the pre-pandemic period reflects a more precise comparison base due to the closure of stores through most of fiscal 2020.

Management also outlined its view for fiscal 2021 and the first quarter. Also, it revised its long-term store growth targets, given the increased store closures and bankruptcies in recent years. The company also provided an upbeat view for fiscal 2023 and beyond.

The Ross Stores stock rallied 9.1% in the after-hours trading session on Mar 1, driven by the bottom-line beat in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and the upbeat long-term targets. Shares of the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have lost 11.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 8.2%.

 Q4 Insights
Ross Stores reported earnings of $1.04 per share, down 18.8% from $1.28 reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. However, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. Results benefited from strong customer demand during the holiday season, which aided sales, offset by the negative impacts of the surge in Omicron cases during the peak holiday selling period and continued supply-chain congestions. Cost pressures related to freight, wages and COVID-19 hurt the margins and the bottom line.

Total sales of $5,020.6 million improved 18.1% year over year but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,031 million. Sales benefited from broad-based growth across certain merchandise categories and regions, as well as robust comparable store sales (comps). The children and men's categories performed well in the holiday selling period, and the Midwest and Southeast regions were the outperforming regions. Sales trends were also robust at the dd's DISCOUNTS business.

In fourth-quarter fiscal 2021, comps increased 9% from fourth-quarter fiscal 2019, owing to higher average basket size, partly offset by a decline in transactions.

Cost of goods sold (COGS) of $3,773.6 million increased 19.5% year over year and 17% from the level in fourth-quarter fiscal 2019. As a percentage of sales, COGS was 75.2%, an increase of 90 basis points (bps) year over year and 210 bps from fourth-quarter fiscal 2019. Domestic freight expenses rose 100 bps and distribution costs increased 70 bps, mainly on the ongoing supply-chain headwinds and higher wages. We note that elevated ocean freight costs hurt merchandise margins that declined 50 bps, while buying costs increased 20 bps. However, higher expenses were somewhat offset by occupancy leverage of 30 bps on higher sales volume.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses of $755.9 million increased 9.5% year over year and 25.6% from the fourth-quarter fiscal 2019. SG&A, as a percentage of sales, declined 120 bps year over year and increased 140 bps from the pre-pandemic levels to 15.1%. The increase from the pre-pandemic levels resulted from higher holiday-related pay incentives, as well as elevated wages and COVID-19 costs. Ross Stores recorded net COVID-related expenses of roughly 35 bps in the fourth quarter, which had a greater impact on SG&A expenses than COGS.

The operating margin of 9.8% declined 350 bps from fourth-quarter fiscal 2019. The decline can be attributed to the aforementioned expense-related headwinds despite robust top-line growth.
Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
  Ross Stores, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ross Stores, Inc. Quote
Store Update
As of Jan 29, 2022, Ross Stores operated 1,923 outlets, including 1,628 Ross stores across 40 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, as well as 295 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states.

The company plans to open 30 stores in first-quarter fiscal 2022, comprising 22 Ross and eight dd's DISCOUNTS. For the fiscal year, the company expects to return to normal store opening targets, with plans to open 100 stores. This will include 75 Ross and 25 dd's DISCOUNTS stores. Additionally, it anticipates closing 10 older stores in fiscal 2022.

Given the large retail closures and bankruptcies over the past several years, Ross Stores raised its long-term store growth targets. The company expects “Ross Dress For Less” to expand to 2,900 stores, compared with the previously mentioned 2,400 stores. Additionally, it anticipates dd’s DISCOUNTS to expand to 700 stores versus the earlier stated 600 stores. This represents a 20% increase in potential store growth targets, bringing it to 3,600 stores. This indicates a significant growth from the company’s store count of 1,923 stores at the end of fiscal 2021.
Financials
Ross Stores ended fiscal 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $4,922.4 million, long-term debt of $2,452.3 million, and total shareholders’ equity of $4,060.1 million.

As of the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, consolidated inventories increased 23% versus the comparable 2019 period, driven by an increase in in-transit merchandise, owing to longer lead times resulting from the supply-chain headwinds. Average store inventory decreased slightly from the fiscal 2019 levels. Merchandise packaway levels were at 40% of total inventories compared with 46% at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2019.

Concurrent to the earnings release, Ross Stores authorized a new two-year share repurchase program. Under the program, the company intends to buy back shares worth up to $1.9 billion through fiscal 2023. This replaces the company’s existing repurchase program that was announced in May 2021 and had authorization worth $850 million remaining. Under the May 2021 program, the company bought back shares worth $650 million in fiscal 2021.

Also, the company raised its quarterly cash dividend by 9% to 31 cents per share, payable Mar 31, 2022, to shareholders of record as of Mar 15, 2022.

For fiscal 2022, the company plans to spend $800 million toward capital expenditure, with outlays for further investments in the supply chain to support long-term growth and technology to increase efficiencies across the business and market share growth.
Outlook
Going into fiscal 2022, Ross Stores expects difficult year-over-year comparisons from the prior year due to last year's government stimulus payments and reduced COVID-19 restrictions, leading to extraordinary consumer demand. These factors led to robust sales in Spring 2021.

Moreover, the company anticipates continued headwinds from the industry-wide supply-chain dynamics and other risks from inflation in consumer demand, as well as cost within its business.

Ross Stores expects comps to be flat to up 3% compared with 13% growth in fiscal 2021. Total sales are expected to increase 2-6% in fiscal 2022. Earnings per share for fiscal 2022 are envisioned to be $4.71-$5.12 per share compared with $4.87 in fiscal 2021. Operating margin is projected to be 11.6-12.1%, reflecting a decline from fiscal 2021. The deleverage can be attributed to lower same-store sales projections, as well as ongoing expense headwinds, which are expected to continue, particularly in the first half of fiscal 2022.

Net interest expenses are expected to be $70 million in fiscal 2022, while depreciation & amortization (including stock-based compensation) are likely to be $560 million. The company predicts effective tax rate of 24-25% for fiscal 2022, with shares outstanding expected to be 348 million.

Ross Stores notes that it is up for adverse year-over-year comparisons from the aforementioned stimulus benefits and increased demand. However, it has witnessed greater headwinds from elevated freight and wage expenses in early fiscal 2021.

Consequently, the company anticipates comps to be down 2-4% for first-quarter fiscal 2022 compared with 13% growth in first-quarter fiscal 2021. Sales are expected between a decline of 2% and growth of 1% from the prior-year period. Ross Stores expects earnings per share of 93-99 cents per share compared with earnings of $1.34 in first-quarter fiscal 2021.

The company expects operating margin to be 10.2-10.6% in the fiscal first quarter, down from 14.2% in the prior-year quarter. The operating margin is expected to be affected by negative comps forecast, and elevated freight and wage expenses. Net interest expenses are estimated to be $19 million, while the tax rate is expected to be 25%. Shares outstanding are likely to be 350 million.

Coming to its long-term targets, the company anticipates returning to double-digit earnings per share growth by fiscal 2023 and beyond. The rise is likely to be driven by robust comps growth, operating margin expansion, accelerated store opening and ongoing share repurchase program.

(ANF) and Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR) on Wednesday reported results for the fourth quarter, with results at Abercrombie & Fitch missing analysts' estimates, while profit at Dollar Tree surpassed analysts' expectations, but quarterly revenues missed them.
Abercrombie & Fitch initiated net sales guidance for the full-year 2022, in line with estimates, while Dollar Tree initiated earnings guidance in line, while evenue outlook was below estimates.
Specialty retailer Abercrombie & Fitch reported net income attributable to the company of $65.51 million or $1.12 per share, down from $82.39 million or $1.27 per share in the prior-year quarter.
Excluding items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $1.14 per share, compared to $1.50 per share in the year-ago quarter.
Net sales for the quarter grew 4 percent to $1.16 billion from $1.12 billion in the same quarter last year.
On average, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to report earnings of $1.27 per share on revenues of $1.18 billion for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items.
Hollister brand sales were up 2 percent to $668.78 million and Abercrombie brand sales grew 6 percent to $492.58 million from last year.
Sales in the U.S. grew 7 percent to $841.69 million, while international sales declined 4 percent to $319.67 million from last year.
Looking ahead, the company now projects net sales growth in the low-single-digits for the first quarter from last year's $781 million and 2 to 4 percent for the full-year 2022 from last year's $3.7 billion.
The Street is looking for net sales $799.96 million for the quarter and net sales growth of 2.7 percent to $3.83 billion for the year.
Meanwhile, Dollar Tree reported that net income declined to $454.2 million or $2.01 per share from $502.8 million or $2.13 per share in the prior-year quarter. Net sales for the quarter grew 4.6 percent to $7.08 billion from $6.77 billion in the same quarter last year. Same-Store Sales were up 2.5 percent.
The Street expected the company to report earnings of $1.77 per share on revenues of $7.12 billion for the quarter.
Net sales at Family Dollar stores increased to $3.92 billion from $3.71 billion, with same-store sales growth 1.7 percent, and net sales at Dollar Tree stores grew to $3.16 billion from $3.06 billion, with same-store sales growth 3.1 percent
Gross margin for the quarter contracted 160 basis points, driven by higher freight costs and recall-related markdowns, partially offset by improved initial mark-on and favorable product mix, reduced shrink and leverage on distribution costs.
The company said it recently completed a successful conversion to a $1.25 price point across all Dollar Tree stores in the U.S., more than two months ahead of schedule, which significantly enhances its ability to provide a meaningful assortment at extreme value to shoppers.
Looking ahead to the first quarter, the company estimates earnings in a range of $1.95 to $2.10 per share on consolidated net sales between $6.63 billion and $6.78 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales for the combined enterprise.
Analysts expect the company to report earnings of $1.66 per share on sales of $6.80 billion for the quarter. For fiscal 2022, the company now projects earnings in a range of $7.60 to $8.00 per share on consolidated net sales between $27.22 billion and $27.85 billion, based on a low-to-mid single-digit increase in same-store sales and about 2.8 percent square footage growth.
The Street is looking for earnings of $7.60 per share on sales of $28.04 billion for the year.
The Company plans to open 590 new stores and to renovate 800 Family Dollar stores in fiscal 2022, consisting of 190 Dollar Tree stores and 400 Family Dollar stores.

2022-03-02 00:00:00+00:00,"Urban Outfitters (URBN) Q4 Earnings Miss, Sales Improve Y/Y",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/urban-outfitters-urbn-q4-earnings-miss-sales-improve-y-y,,,"Urban Outfitters Inc. URBN reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Inflationary pressures from inbound freight, delivery expenses, raw materials and wages hurt the overall profits in the reported quarter. Also, the ongoing supply-chain headwinds and higher transportation expenses were deterrents.

Nonetheless, both metrics improved on a year-over-year basis. Sales across URBN’s all brands and the Retail segment grew from the comparable period’s level in fiscal 2020. URBN provided a two-year comparison for all metrics as the pre-pandemic period reflects a more precise comparison base due to the closure of stores through most of fiscal 2020 induced by the coronavirus pandemic. Shares of this currently Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) player have decreased 15.9% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 10.9% dip.

We note that demand in the fiscal fourth quarter was solid and is likely to continue through spring. During the first four weeks of the fiscal first quarter, the total Retail segment comp sales increased more than 20% from the same-period level in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2020. All brands across both geographies are positive.
Deeper Insight
This lifestyle-specialty retailer delivered earnings per share of 41 cents, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents. The bottom line increased 41.4% from 29 cents recorded in the comparable quarter of the year-ago fiscal and 105% from 20 cents earned in the quarter ended Jan 31, fiscal 2020.

Net sales for the three months ended Jan 31, fiscal 2022, rose 13.9% from the same-period level of fiscal 2020 to $1,332.2 million. The metric also rose 22.4% from the last fiscal year’s reading. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly sales is pegged at $1,332 million.

Brand wise, net sales were up 5.4% from the comparable period’s level in fiscal 2020 to $474.4 million at Urban Outfitters, 13.8% to $558.7 million at Anthropologie Group and 28% to $276.2 million at Free People. Nuuly, the subscription-based rental service for women’s clothes, contributed $17.3 million to net sales, reflecting an increase of 188.3% from the comparable period’s level in fiscal 2020. However, Menus & Venues’ net sales amounted to $5.6 million, down 17.6% from the comparable period’s reading in fiscal 2020.

We note that the comparable Retail segment’s net sales grew 14% from the same-period level of fiscal 2020 on a robust double-digit rise in digital channel sales. Growth was partly offset by a low double-digit negative retail store sales due to lower store traffic. Each brand recorded positive retail segment comps, led again by the Free People Group brand, which delivered mid double-digit comps.

By brand, the comparable Retail segment’s net sales jumped 49% at the Free People Group, 14% at the Anthropologie Group and 3% at Urban Outfitters. While net sales at the Retail segment improved 15% from the comparable period’s level in fiscal 2020, the metric at the Wholesale unit plunged 22%, mainly due to lower Free People Group’s sales to promotional wholesale customers.

Robust strength in the digital channel fueled the Retail unit’s growth. The digital channel recorded mid double-digit sales gains in North America and even greater strength in Europe. Higher sessions, improved conversion and increased AURs aided digital growth. Digital customer growth was also sturdy, with total customers rising 30% from the fiscal 2020 level. All brands and geographies recorded growth.
An Insight Into Margins
In the quarter under review, gross profit climbed 5.4% from the same-quarter level of fiscal 2020 to $367.3 million. However, adjusted gross margin contracted 222 basis points (bps) to 27.6%, mainly due to lower initial merchandise markups as well as higher delivery and logistics costs. This was partly offset by lower merchandise markdown rates in the Retail unit and leveraged store occupancy expenses. Increased transportation expenses weighed on merchandise margins in the quarter.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses shot up 11.6% from the fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 level to $314 million. As a percentage of net sales, the metric leveraged 48 bps to 23.6%, mainly owing to a disciplined store payroll management and overall cost control. This upside was partly offset by higher digital marketing and creative expenses to boost digital sales and customer growth.  

Urban Outfitters recorded an operating income of $53.3 million, down 20.6% from the fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 level. As a rate of sales, the operating margin decreased 170 bps from the level registered in the quarter ended Jan 31, fiscal 2020, to 4%.
Store Update
In fiscal 2022, URBN inaugurated 56 retail outlets, such as 17 Urban Outfitters, 9 Anthropologie Group and 29 Free People (including 18 FP Movement stores), and one Menus & Venues restaurant. URBN shuttered 18 retail locations, including three Urban Outfitters stores, eight Anthropologie Group stores, five Free People stores and two Menus & Venues restaurants. In the aforementioned period, two franchisee-owned stores were opened, one each of Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie Group stores.

As of Jan 31, 2022, URBN operated 261 Urban Outfitters stores in the United States, Canada and Europe; 238 Anthropologie Group stores in the United States, Canada and Europe; 173 Free People stores in the United States, Canada and Europe; 10 Menus & Venues restaurants; two Urban Outfitters franchisee-owned stores and one Anthropologie Group franchisee-owned store.

In fiscal 2023, management plans to open about 46 stores and close 14 outlets. URBN intends to open 16 FP Movement stores in the same fiscal year with a target of achieving $1 billion worth FP Movement brand sales.
Other Financial Details
Urban Outfitters ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $206.6 million and total shareholders’ equity of $1,745.7 million. As of Jan 31, 2022, total inventory increased 39.1% from the fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 level to $569.7 million.

URBN generated net cash of $359.3 million from operating activities during fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2023, management projects capital expenditures of nearly $225 million.

Urban Outfitters repurchased and subsequently retired 2 million shares for nearly $56 million during fiscal 2022. It bought back and subsequently retired 0.5 million shares for roughly $7 million in fiscal 2021. As of Jan 31, 2022, URBN had 23.9 million shares remaining under its share repurchase programs.
Outlook
Management is impressed with solid consumer demand, which is likely to continue throughout the first quarter of fiscal 2023. URBN’s first quarter-to-date comp sales rate is above the fourth-quarter rate. Urban Outfitters now expects first-quarter sales to increase mid-teens from the fiscal 2020 actuals. Retail segment sales are expected to come in the mid-to-high teens’ range, while the Wholesale segment sales might be approximately flat.

Moreover, gross margins for the fiscal first quarter are anticipated to plunge more than 100 basis points from the fiscal year 2022 reading, mainly due to the ongoing supply-chain headwinds and higher inbound product transportation costs. Also, the markdown rate in the same quarter will likely increase from the fiscal 2022 actuals. Favorable occupancy rates may partly offset lower merchandise margins in the quarter from the same-period level of fiscal 2022.

We note that total growth in SG&A is likely to exceed sales growth for the first quarter and fiscal 2023. Higher SG&A expenses will be due to increased store labor costs from the year-ago fiscal level. Management believes that the SG&A growth rate in the fiscal first quarter will be more significant than the other quarters of fiscal 2023.

[Operator instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Mike Witynski, Dollar Tree's president and chief executive officer.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Randy. Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm extremely proud of the team's strong performance during our transformative fourth quarter. We delivered comparable sales increases at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, both representing improvements from the prior quarter on a two-year stack basis.
Our EPS of $2.01 exceeded our $1.69 to $1.79 guidance range. Importantly, we recently completed a successful conversion to $1.25 price point across all Dollar Tree stores in the United States, more than two months ahead of schedule, which significantly enhances our ability to provide a meaningful assortment at extreme values to our shoppers. We continue to have terrific performance on other key strategic initiatives, including the expansion of our $3 and $5-plus assortments to another 1,500 Dollar Tree stores as well as our Combo Stores and H2 renovations at Family Dollar. The Dollar Tree segment delivered a comp sales increase of 3.1%, cycling a 2.4% increase from the prior year's quarter.
A 5.5% two-year stack quarterly comp was our best of the year and represented a sequential improvement of 90 basis points from Q3. Discretionary continues to perform extremely well at a 5.4% comp. We are continuing to experience record sell-throughs of our seasonal and holiday merchandise. The strongest performing categories included candy, Christmas seasonal, party celebrations, crafts, and stationery.
For the quarter, discretionary represented more than 57% of our sales, up 130 basis points from the prior year's quarter. For the Dollar Tree banner, December was the strongest comp month of the quarter as we were cycling a slight negative from the prior year. November was a low single-digit positive comp, and January was our lowest comp month as we cycled the strongest comp month of the prior year's quarter. Family Dollar delivered a positive 1.7% comp against the 8.1% increase a year ago.
This represented the fourth consecutive quarter that Family Dollar two-year comp stack exceeded 9%. The consumable side of the business comped just below a positive 3%, while the discretionary was a low single-digit negative as we are cycling stimulus dollars from the prior year. The Family Dollar business continues to gain share. The strongest-performing categories include pet, candy and snack and beverage.
For the quarter, consumables represented just over 73% of sales. At Family Dollar, November was our strongest comp month of the quarter, closely followed by December. Both periods were above the quarterly comp of 1.7%. January was a negative comp as we cycled a double-digit comp from the prior year related to the release of stimulus dollars.
Additionally, retail in January was impacted by omicron variant, much colder and stormier weather than the prior year, and the lapsing of the monthly child tax credit advanced payments. The comps at both banners were again driven by an increase in average ticket, partially offset by a decline in transaction count. Last week, we completed the rollout of our $1.25 price point initiative to every Dollar Tree store across the U.S., more than 7,800-plus stores. This milestone completed more than two months ahead of our targeted date is a testament to the commitment and teamwork between our support teams, our merchandising organizations, and our field leadership teams, demonstrating our ability to execute.
This strategic endeavor will enable Dollar Tree to ultimately drive store traffic and productivity, customer loyalty, and operating performance while enhancing our ability to navigate the business through higher periods of higher cost. We have been considering this move for some time. In recent years, we have lost many items that are customer favorites and key traffic-driving consumable products from our assortment due to the constraints of the $1 price point. Additionally, we have been operating through a higher cost environment as it relates to inflation, tariffs, supply chain, and labor costs.
The new $1.25 price point enhances our ability to materially expand our assortments, introduce new products and sizes and provide families with more of their daily essentials at a great value. In preparation for this move, our merchandising teams have taken on the Herculean task of reviewing thousands of product SKU by SKU or item by item to reassess the value through comp shops of our competitors. Many of our products, especially on the seasonal and discretionary side, are still considered to be an extreme value at the new $1.25 price point. For those products that are considered new or to be reinvested in with the larger quantities or package sizes, we have a clear -- a very clear and focused and urgent plan to bring that product into our stores.
These assortment changes will be taking place throughout the year, but we do expect 50% of the categories, new and revested in products, to be in the store by midyear. Example of the products already in the stores are carbonated beverages and salty snacks, all at the $1.25 price point. I could not be more proud of our team's smooth execution of the transition to the $1.25 price point. Initially, we rolled out the program to a diverse segment of more than 100 stores across the U.S.
Then we expanded to nearly 200 stores across three metropolitan markets. And starting in December, we embarked on seven waves of multistate introductions. The signage, training, and talking points equipped our field leadership teams to execute the store's checklist to complete the transitions. The teams embraced the project, rolled up their sleeves, and got it done.
Feedback from our shoppers has indicated they clearly understood the change in pricing. Stores were easy to shop, and the signage was very clear. The key has always been and always will be enabling us to deliver extreme value to our customers. We are focused on exceeding shopper expectations for the value at $1.25, just like we have been at the $1 price point for more than 30 years.
We have been closely tracking the performance of converted stores on a daily basis item by item, category by category. We have seen relatively consistent reaction in performance across various demographics, geographies, and store sizes. Among our findings are the following. Our new and reinvested SKUs are driving improved performance in their categories, including in the food, snack, and beverage, which are all very important traffic-driving categories.
Our seasonal and discretionary continue to outperform consumable, but we believe this can balance out as we continue to modify the assortment on the consumables and deliver greater value for our customers. As you would expect, we are seeing comp lift sales to the stores that have transitioned to the $1.25, partially offset by a decline in unit sales in the teens. As we go through the year, we expect to see a greater lift to the gross margin in the first half of the year as we sell through the current inventory. And importantly, as I have stated before, we have confidence we can get back to our historic 35% to 36% annual gross margin range this year even with the continuation of elevated freight costs.
And as we reinvest in the key categories to deliver extreme value, we expect to see improved traffic and productivity as we move throughout the year. I've shared much about the $1.25 price point as it is where many investors are focused, and it is transforming our company. But I want to be clear that we are very pleased with the continued progress we are seeing across each of our strategic initiatives. Regarding Dollar Tree Plus, we finished the year with a multi-price product in approximately 660 stores, well beyond our original target of 500 stores.
At Dollar Tree, our $3 and $5-plus assortment will be expanded to another 1,500 stores in fiscal '22. Customers are responding very well to holiday, seasonal, and discretionary categories, and we will continue to grow and improve this initiative. At Family Dollar, our Combo Stores are working. Customers love shopping the best of Family Dollar and Dollar Tree in one easy-to-shop local store in their community.
The stores are driving a material comp sales lift, increased productivity, higher gross margins, and improved operating performance. We ended the year with more than 240 Combo Stores and are planning to add another 400 Combo Stores this year. We ended the year with 3,815 Family Dollar stores in the H2 format. We are planning for another 800 H2 store reservations in fiscal 2022, which we believe will bring our store fleet current and will enable us to reallocate time, effort, resources, and capital from the renovation program to other value-creating initiatives as we move forward.
I will now hand the call over to Kevin to provide details on Q4 performance and our outlook for fiscal 2022.
Kevin Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mike, and good morning. For the quarter, consolidated net sales increased 4.6% to $7.08 billion, comprised of $3.92 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.16 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 2.5% as we cycled a 4.9% increase from a year ago, representing a 70-basis-point improvement from Q3 to 7.4% on a two-year stacked basis. Comps for the Dollar Tree segment increased 3.1%.
Family Dollar same-store sales increased 1.7%, cycling a strong 8.1% increase from last year. On a two-year stacked basis, Dollar Tree comps increased 5.5%, which was a 90-basis-point improvement from Q3. And Family Dollar increased 9.8%, which was a 70-basis-point improvement from Q3. Dollar Tree's comp was comprised of a 6% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 2.8% decline in traffic.
Family Dollar experienced a 4.6% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 2.7% decline in traffic. Gross profit was $2.14 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 30.2%, compared to 31.8% in the prior year's quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment declined 50 basis points to 35.6% when compared to the prior year's quarter.
Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance included merchandise costs, including freight, increased 110 basis points driven by higher freight costs, partially offset by increased initial mark-on, and increased sales of higher-margin discretionary merchandise. This increase was partially offset by shrink that improved 30 basis points related to favorable inventory results and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate. Distribution costs improved approximately 20 basis points, resulting primarily from lower COVID-19-related expenses and sales leverage, partially offset by higher hourly wages. And occupancy costs decreased approximately 10 basis points as a result of the leverage from the comp sales increase in the quarter.
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment declined 320 basis points to 23.4% in the fourth quarter. The year-over-year delta included the following: merchandise costs, including freight, increased 220 basis points related to higher freight costs and an unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by higher initial mark-on. Markdowns increased 90 basis points, primarily related to our recent product recall in our Arkansas distribution center in 404 Family Dollar stores. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased 40 basis points to 22.1% of total revenue, compared to 21.7% in Q4 last year.
For the fourth quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of total revenue increased 50 basis points to 20.6% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Other SG&A increased approximately 50 basis points, resulting from higher card transaction fees and operating taxes, along with marketing and store supply costs associated with the transition to the $1.25 price point. Payroll costs increased 10 basis points, resulting primarily from higher store hourly payroll costs due to minimum wage increases and higher healthcare costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. And depreciation cost decreased 15 basis points primarily due to lower store impairment write-offs and leverage due to the increase in comp store sales.
For Family Dollar, the fourth quarter SG&A rate as a percentage of total revenue increased 10 basis points to 20.7%, compared to 20.6% in the prior year's quarter. Other SG&A expense increased 25 basis points primarily due to lower miscellaneous income, an increase in card transaction fees, and an increase in insurance costs related to general liability claims. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 15 basis points due to higher store asset impairment charges and expenditures associated with the store renovation program. Store facility costs increased five basis points primarily due to higher repairs and maintenance expenses, including snow removal, partially offset by lower telecommunication expenses.
And payroll expenses improved 35 basis points, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and field management vacancies, partially offset by higher store hourly payroll, resulting from higher labor rates. Corporate support and other expenses as a percentage of total revenue were flat when, compared to the prior year's quarter at 1.4%. Operating income was $578.8 million or 8.2% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Nonoperating expenses totaled $79.6 million, comprised primarily of net interest expense, including debt extinguishment costs of $46.5 million associated with our debt refinancing in the quarter.
The effective tax rate was 9%, compared to 22.3% in the prior year's fourth quarter, resulting primarily from a deferred tax benefit related to state entity restructuring. Company had net income of $454.2 million or $2.01 per diluted share. This compared to net earnings of $502.8 million or $2.13 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter. Combined cash and cash equivalents at year-end totaled $984.9 million, compared to $1.42 billion at the end of fiscal 2020.
Outstanding debt as of January 29 was $3.45 billion. For the year, the company repurchased $950 million in shares at an average price of $103.75. The company did not repurchase shares during the fourth quarter as our board has engaged in discussions with Mantle Ridge. We currently have $2.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Compared to the prior year, inventory levels increased 39% at Dollar Tree and 17% at Family Dollar. The higher levels of inventory are comprised of significant increases in goods on the water year over year as we rebuild inventory levels as well as increased capitalized freight costs based on much higher rates during the year. We do not anticipate any additional material inventory markdowns related to the recent Family Dollar voluntary product recall. Capital expenditures were $271.6 million in the fourth quarter versus $191.8 million in Q4 last year.
For fiscal 2022, we expect that consolidated capex will be approximately $1.3 billion, which will be focused on 590 new stores, consisting of 400 Family Dollar and 190 Dollar Tree stores; 1,500 Dollar Tree Plus additions and 800 Family Dollar H2 renovations; the addition or replacement of frozen or refrigerated capability to select Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores; supply chain construction and upgrades and information technology system projects. Depreciation amortization totaled $188.7 million for Q4, compared to $182.9 million in the fourth quarter last year. For fiscal 2022, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $750 million. Our initial outlook for fiscal 2022 includes the following assumptions.
For same-store sales for the enterprise, we are forecasting low to mid-single-digit positive comps for the year. Considerations for 2022 include the following: the company incurred approximately $33.5 million in COVID-19-related costs in fiscal 2021. We expect these costs to be minimal in fiscal 2022. We will be cycling the third round of stimulus check that totaled an estimated $386 billion in March of 2021.
And later in the year, we will be cycling the monthly advanced child tax credit payments that began in July of 2021. We expect continued pressure on store and DC payroll based on competitive markets, states increasing minimum wages, unemployment levels, and completing the company's many initiatives. We expect to incur more than $165 million in store minimum wage changes and market adjustments. In addition, we are investing more than $30 million in DC hourly wages.
We continue to partially offset these average hourly rate increases through productivity and efficiency initiatives. Import and domestic freight will present cost pressures due to the annualization of fiscal 2021 rates in the first half of 2022. In addition, diesel fuel prices are expected to be significantly higher in 2022. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we've not adjusted our outlook for the currency rate changes.
Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $33 million for Q1 and approximately $129 million for fiscal 2022. We estimate consolidated net sales for the first quarter will range from $6.63 billion to $6.78 billion based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales for the combined enterprise. Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.10. Consolidated net sales for full fiscal 2022 are expected to range from $27.22 billion to $27.85 billion.
The company estimates diluted earnings per share will range from $7.60 to $8, which at the high end implies a consolidated operating income margin of 9%. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 24.3% for the first quarter and 24.1% for fiscal 2022. Our weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 226.5 million shares for Q1 and 226.7 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases.
And as previously mentioned, we currently have $2.5 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. I'll turn the call back over to Mike.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Kevin. I am more encouraged and enthusiastic about our business and the opportunity than ever before. After a few years of Dollar Tree delivering operating margins lower than we like, I believe we are poised to benefit from our initiatives to deliver materially improved operating performance. Because of our team's dedication, focus and execution, we have one of the most important milestones behind us: converting more than 7,800 stores to the new pricing strategy, providing value to our customers and a meaningful assortment is at the forefront.
And as we reinvest in and market the extreme value assortment at Dollar Tree, we are confident store traffic and productivity will improve throughout the year, which will contribute to shopper loyalty. Value and convenience is more important than ever to our customer in today's environment. We are dedicated, aligned, and focused. The ability to execute our key initiatives is paying off and setting a solid foundation for improved operating performance.
We delivered an EPS of $5.80 in fiscal 2021, and the high end of our guidance range this year is $8, representing a 38% increase. I believe we are at an inflection point to exhibit our earnings power in the years ahead. This year, we are laser-focused on meeting our customer needs while driving our initiatives that are delivering the best returns. These initiatives, combined with our robust balance sheet, will position us to deliver long-term value for our stakeholders, customers, associates, suppliers, and our shareholders.
I would like to once again thank every one of our more than 200,000 associates for all they have accomplished over the past two years through the unprecedented challenges presented with COVID-19 supply chain issues and labor shortages. Our teams are there every day to serve millions of shoppers across the U.S. and Canada. We have accomplished quite a lot in the last 18 months but, in many ways, I feel that we are just getting started.
But the future is bright for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Before we take your questions, I'd like to provide a brief update on our ongoing engagement with Mantle Ridge. We continue to have constructive dialogue with Mantle Ridge and our shareholders. And indeed, we have been meeting weekly with Paul Hilal of Mantle Ridge and Rick Dreiling.
Accordingly, we will not be addressing any Mantle Ridge-related questions during the Q&A portion of ourearnings call Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] We will now take our first question from Scot Ciccarelli of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Scot Ciccarelli -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Good morning, guys. Thanks for the information. So, Mike, given your comments on the decline in units at Dollar Tree, is it fair to assume that the Dollar Tree stores are roughly generating high single-digit comps after the price conversion? And then secondly, are you surprised at the magnitude of the unit decline? I guess it doesn't quite seem to reconcile with some of the comments that the consumers have been really accepting the price changes, so any color there would be helpful.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Thanks. And so on the unit decline, I mean, we have the same exact sensitivity models that many of you do on, units, comps, transactions, and then margin enhancement. And going into it, we've been watching this for the last 18 to 24 months.
And because of the vendor cost increases on our key consumable items that drive traffic for the last 18 months, vendors have eliminated items, downsized items, or raised the price on items that we have lost in our assortment. And over those 18 to 24 months, we have seen unit declines and transaction reduction because of that. So it wasn't a surprise to us. We knew where we needed to invest our dollars.
And as we rolled this out and tested it, it really confirmed -- and our customers told us, here's where we needed to do our work. And that's why it does three things for us. We're able to improve our assortment and move to the $1.25 and really bring back items that consumers like and that are extreme value and high traffic-driving categories. And that will improve our traffic and our consumable sales going forward.
The other thing it does is it enables us to, again, I keep saying, get back to 35% to 36% gross profit margins in this high-cost environment. And then lastly, it allows us to improve our operating performance in a higher-cost environment. And offsetting, and as Kevin said and we shared, our high end of our range, EPS range, is $8, a 38% increase. And that's absorbing the $600 million in freight that we assumed last year.
And then Kevin just shared another $200 million in labor between the stores and DCs. So that's why this strategy is so important to us. And the unit decline, as we see the new items come in, we see the customers responding very quickly. And many of you even pointed out, as you've done your store inspections, you've seen some of the new products in our carbonated beverage, in our salty snacks, in our meat snacks, and we expect those sales to slowly improve.
And even with the unit decline where it's at, you've seen how it's translated to an improved operating income, as you saw that we beat fourth quarter by $0.25. So no, we're not surprised. But yes, we are working diligently to get the new product in to reverse that trend that's been existing for 18 months and really deliver what the customer wants at that extreme value on both the consumable side to drive traffic and the discretionary side that they know us for.
Scot Ciccarelli -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
OK. Thank you very much.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Matthew Boss of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Matthew Boss -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Great. Thanks, and congrats on the nice quarter. So on the top line, could you help provide maybe a comp forecast by banner if we broke apart the low single-digit comp guide for the first quarter? Mike, what are you seeing from your low-income customers so far in February, and just how best to think about the delta between low single digits in the first quarter and low to mid-single digits for the year on the comp side?
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. We're not -- we haven't broken it out by banner. But our customer, last year, as you know, they were -- they had a lot of stimulus dollars in their hands between the stimulus dollars, the child tax credit and then the food stamp environment and then the extra unemployment, and many of those are going away. So not only are they going away, but then on the other side, it's the highest inflation you've seen in 40 years.
So they are starting to see pressure on their rent bills, their heating bills, their gas bills, their utilities, and their food bills. So we think that this value segment that we're in and this undeniable value that we're going to deliver at a $1.25 and our great values at Family Dollar at convenient locations are really poised well to deliver what the customer is looking for.
Matthew Boss -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Maybe just a follow-up, Kevin, on gross margin. Is it -- could you walk through maybe some of the moving pieces embedded this year in the forecast? Specifically, what are you embedding for freight, and how best to think about gross margin drivers from here at both the Dollar Tree banner and Family Dollar?
Kevin Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. I think as you look at the gross profit section of the P&L, so obviously, the biggest headwind continues to be freight. And as I spoke to the first half in particular -- so as we went through 2021, rates climbed quarter to quarter until that kind of finally flattened out at the back half of Q3. So the first half of the year continues to see some pretty good pressure there.
And that shouldn't be a surprise to anybody, I think. And as we look at the year, we do not see things getting better in the supply chain world of -- and moving product and the rates that are required to continue to move goods. And it's not just the rates to pay for the goods. It's also the rates you pay.
Once you got -- once it gets into the port, it's costing more to move the product. So drayage is more, storage costs are more. Everybody is trying to charge for equipment. So there's a lot of pressure on a lot of different places as it relates to moving products.
So I think that's a big one. The other one is diesel costs. Diesel costs are up basically, I think, just over $1 year over year at this point in time right now. So that adds a significant amount to the pressure as well as we think about it.
And then again, I think -- to your point, I think we faced stimulus dollars, in particular in the Family Dollar business, in Q1. Discretionary business, if you remember, a year ago in Q1 Family Dollar, had a very large comp, a double-digit comp. So we would see unfavorable mix in Q1 as it relates to our Family Dollar business. So those are some of the things that are -- some of the moving pieces that are kind of going on.
And then I think the other thing that we think about from a -- and Mike kind of talked about it already, is the investment, the reinvestment in the product that we're making at Dollar Tree. The consumers let us know where we need to continue to look at our value proposition. The merchants are doing a great job working through that, and we're flowing new goods, and we'll continue to flow goods throughout the year. So I think that will be an important piece of it.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Michael Lasser of UBS. Please go ahead. Go ahead, Michael. Your line is open.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. What is the comp lift that you are getting from $1.25 price point? And how wide does the lift vary across stores and geographies? And as part of that, how has it -- the move to $1.25 impacted customer shopping sequences? Have you seen some customers who just aren't coming back after realizing the price change?
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Thanks, Michael. And we did -- the consumer was a huge important part of this and our ability to deliver meaningful assortment to them. And we did consumer research, in-depth research, back in October, and we just recently finished it up.
And I've seen some of the analysts have done their own in-depth research. And the most important thing is, is the research tells us that they trust Dollar Tree and that Dollar Tree is the most recognized and trusted brand in the value $1 segment. Period. This is after the $1.25 price change.
They expressed the likelihood to continue to shop of above 85%. They still want to recommend our stores above 77% of our shoppers. And there's an emotional connection still. Our customers still believe they're getting a good value for the money.
And we receive higher marks than our competitors at a good value even at a $1.25. So our customer, bringing our customer along, is critical. And the reason that that's enabling that is on our discretionary side, it's $1.25. Our comp shops still tell us where we are winning.
And our -- when I said a Herculean task, our merchants starting last fall, so November, December, and January and a little bit into February, went item by item. They did complete category reviews and reviewed item by item, line by line, and went out and comp-shop them, every item, and brought it in and wanted to make sure that at a $1.25, this item still stood up as a great value to the competitive market. And where we saw that, we see the unit sales where we would expect them. And then to your point, you see unit declines where we aren't competitive, and we knew that over the last 18 months.
But what the breaking the $1 does and going to $1.25 is really it lets us get the new assortment in, and we're so excited about it. They -- over the last three months, our entire merchant team not only went through a line review category by category, but they also did our January trip. And our January trip that we bought for the back half of this year is some of the most exciting items that we've had, and our customers are going to be wild about it compared to what they're seeing in the marketplace. And then the new items where we're delivering, we're seeing an improvement in unit sales as we bring those in.
And we absolutely believe that throughout the next six to seven months, as the consumable side and those new items start to flow in, we will see units just begin to come up, and we will see our sales come up accordingly. And we will maintain that customer loyalty from our customers. They still believe we're the No. 1 value in the $1 segment because they're seeing the inflation, the highest in four decades.
So they see what's happening in the marketplace, and they trust us. Our merchants have worked very hard. And I think over the first half of the year, we will slowly get better and better in units and in our traffic going forward. And the most important thing, even with the extra cost that Kevin talked about in our freight in the first half, we still believe we can deliver that 35% to 36% margin.
So it's the flow-through that's going to be so important while we're bringing in the new items to drive that top line. And to answer your question, across geographies, we really don't see any difference in unit declines across geographies, competitive makeup, or demographics. It's really similar. And when we had a foot in both camps, our $1.25 stores moved very similar to our $1 stores.
There was not a -- the gap didn't get worse or better. It just moved very similar. So it was very consistent across that perspective, too, which gave us permission to move as quick as possible to get that new assortment in and really leverage this for our customers going forward.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
Mike, in the past, you've helpfully provided the comp lift that Dollar Tree saw from the Dollar Tree Plus, which is 6%. Is there an equal number that you can give us for the $1.25? And then how do you turn this into a longer-term comp driver for the business to make sure it just doesn't have -- it's not just a one-and-done impact for 2022 and then the business goes back to experiencing some challenges longer term? Because, for example, does this open the door to move from $1.25 to $1.50 that could provide even more missionizing flexibility to drive the business down the road?
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So what $1.25 going forward enables us to do is -- really going forward, the $1.25 will allow us to bring in great assortment to drive traffic and meet the customers' need at a fixed price point and differentiate us just like we've been differentiated for 30 years. We think the $1.25 allows us to do that. But to your point, then how do you continue to drive our comp store sales at the Dollar Tree Plus? That's why we're accelerating that to another 1,500 stores.
And I've shared we want to get to 5,000 stores going forward. So we think that the growth in Dollar Tree, similar to a lot of you have referred to Dollarama up in Canada, we believe that this is going to be a point where we can continue to drive comp store sales, improved assortment with our $1.25, $3 and $5 assortment. So going forward, we're going to do 1,500 this year. We're going to continue to grow another large amount of stores the following year.
And then we're also at Dollar Tree Plus items at the $3 and $5, we're planning for and looking to expand it in 2023, so not only grow the store count but expand the assortment and depth inside the store. So that will enable continuous comp growth year over year as we move forward. And to answer your question on the -- we just completed the assortment. We will share more as we get forward on the comp store growth with the unit decline.
It is -- we are very confident we can be in that low to mid-single-digit comps. But even at that, it translates and flows through at a higher margin and leveraging throughout the P&L to a 38% increase in our EPS. So that's why we're very excited about the improvement that this year will bring. And as we move forward, now that we have the whole fleet on there in the prior quarters, we'll definitely share more details because it will be the whole fleet and inconsistent time frame.
Throughout the last three months, we were -- just in December, we had a few thousand stores, but it was during the Christmas. January, we're rolling out more stores, but it was in a cycling. January was a tough month for retail. And then February was in our cycling bad weather from last year, and we had one of the best Valentine's we've ever had.
So there's just been a lot of moving parts. So once it stabilizes and we have the whole fleet down here, we'll absolutely share it. But it is doing exactly what we thought it would, and it's delivering that EPS we expect it to.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
And just to clarify, just because you don't want to provide it at this point, the market should not interpret it that the response -- the comp lift response has been disappointing?
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Not at all. No. No. And it's evident by our 25% beat in the fourth quarter and 38% increase in EPS.
This is -- and the key is this really enables us -- I can't stress enough, it enables us to bring back those key items on the consumable side that, over the last 18 to 24 months, have just slowly disappeared. And they were one by one. It wasn't all at once. But over time, we lost unit sales on the consumables and comps out of the consumables, which ultimately lost transactions counts the last 18 months.
And you've seen it in our reporting every quarter. What this enables us to do is bring back all of those items and then even more new items. And I'm so excited about the assortment that you're going to see flowing in there, and our customers are excited. Our end caps with the brand name leaders of carbonated beverage, four feet of meat snacks that we brought back are really going to be key traffic-driving items that we see will accelerate as they increase throughout the first half of this year.

[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
John Heinbockel -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst
Hey, Mike. I want to start with what do you think happens to total assortment inside the Dollar Tree, let's say, over the next year and then broader than that, right? Because you don't want the assortment, I would imagine, to get significantly larger than it's been historically. And then what do you do with -- and you guys don't have the kind of tight planograms that some others do. Can you go back and do a strategic replanogramming and space allocation, maybe giving more to consumables? And when would that happen?
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. No. it's a great call. We can't -- this line item review, we went category by category.
And we strategically looked at what drives traffic and give it the appropriate space needed. And we aren't planogrammed, and that enables us to bring in great new items and bring out closeout items and invest in wow items and throw the hunt items to really get the customer excited about seeing newness in our stores. And as we look at the store, the $1.25 items, and then there's $3 and $5, I believe, going forward, we will move -- we will monitor the productivity in dollars and profitability. And our stores are -- we don't have a shelf stretcher inside our stores.
You're right. There is the only a set amount of linear footage. But we believe we can continue to optimize based on the customers' reaction on the $3 and $5. And when we have those category -- those items, they are highly productive and deliver higher pending profit and more efficiencies throughout the supply chain and inside the store.
So we will manage that going forward. And I -- we'll continue to look at the space we need for the right consumables to drive the traffic. And then we will grow the discretionary based on the productivity and continue to manage that going forward. Just as we have over the last 35 years, we've flexed the space accordingly.
John Heinbockel -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst
And then maybe as a follow-up to that, right? So you talked about reinvesting some of this gross margin benefit. Is that more likely to be in consumables, right, to drive traffic for discretionary? And once you get to that 35% to 36%, would you like to run that kind of margin-neutral? And whatever benefit you get on EBIT margin is leveraged, right, from the higher comp?
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. We'd like to definitely get to 35% to 36%, but we believe there may be upside beyond that. And as you just said, it's the stick and runner that a retailer always does. They want to do what they need to, to have great value and drive that top line and then at the margin that they need to deliver continuous improvement in EPS.
John Heinbockel -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst
OK. Thank you.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Please go ahead.
Paul Lejuez -- Citi -- Analyst
Hey. Thanks, guys. Maybe just going back to the Dollar Tree comp impact from the move to $1.25. I think you said you didn't want to give a specific number, but you did share that units were down mid-teens.
And I think, all else equal, if units weren't down, you would have seen a 25% comp lift, if my simple math is right. So can you just confirm that you're actually seeing a net high single-digit to low double-digit comp lift in those stores? And if that is the case, is that how you're planning that concept comp for F'22? And are you ordering units down in that mid-teens rate that you've experienced thus far or something better than that? And then just -- I guess I'll ask my follow-up now. I'm just curious which categories you're seeing more or less elasticity.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So as I said before, we haven't shared the comp on the rollout because we just got everything rolled out. But we have shared, we believe, in our forecast going forward in our guidance is low to mid-single-digit comps that we're very confident we can achieve. And even with that, the lower units and the comp in that range still delivers a 38% growth in our EPS.
And what was the second part of the question? Oh, the categories. The elasticity is it's exactly where we thought it would. Our customer gives us -- we have such great value. And I've said this before, when we go to buy and create our seasonal items on the discretionary side, we go out in the comp shop, and we find $5 and $7 items.
And we -- our merchants will make those items at the $1. That's why we're known for such great value on the discretionary side. So when we move to $1.25, our discretionary units are still selling very, very well. And our customer research tells us that, and our sales tell us that.
And then it also, as I've shared on the consumables side is where we're seeing the unit decline. But as we bring in those new items, the unit decline -- in fact, the categories are positive comp, where I've shared the last 18 months, they were negative and we were losing units. Where we've already introduced the items and they're flowing in, it's absolutely reversed and starting to trend in a positive nature.
Paul Lejuez -- Citi -- Analyst
Good. So how does that influence your plan units in terms of managing inventory?
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So we're planning to feed that growth that we talked about. And we're buying on the discretionary side, like we always buy, to continue to drive our seasonal and our discretionary side. And the good thing is we're getting every consumable item we can't right now in the marketplace.
And our new items that we're bringing in, we're buying as many as we can. And the time line to replenish that is most of that is domestic. So we can keep feeding the sales growth and unit growth as it happens.

We'll take our next question from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Edward Kelly -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Hi, guys. Good morning. Mike, I wanted to ask you, rolling out the $1.25 without the new product makes it difficult for you to showcase what this ultimately means for your customers over the long term. Are you -- I mean it doesn't sound like it, but based upon what you've seen so far in like looking forward, are you concerned at all about the gap in time between the $1.25 and when the new product comes in and what that could potentially do to customer loyalty? And then as part of this question, can you just talk a bit more about how the merchandising from here changes the cadence around that? What percentage of the SKUs are actually going to change for customers? How important is bringing things back, right, that you haven't sold historically? Any additional color on all that would be great.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. It's extremely important to bring back items that they haven't seen. And as I've reiterated several times, in the last 18 to 24 months, we've seen our discretionary sales decline and over -- especially -- it has accelerated. As everybody has seen throughout last year, our vendors were getting pressure, costs were increasing, and inflation is at the four decades high.
So we needed to move for several reasons: one, to quickly get in that assortment that we wanted; and number two, we needed to be simple for the organization. We can't have our merchants buying $1 assortment and $1.25 assortment and mixing it up. We need it to be crystal clear for them. And they went to task in the last three to four months and went through that entire line, item by -- line review and category review item by item.
And now the items are flowing back in. So we didn't want to confuse our customers and confuse our merchants and confuse our operators. So we moved to $1.25 as fast as we did. And we're bringing our customers along with us.
Absolutely, we're afraid of our customer thought process. That's why we did in-depth research back in October when we first introduced it. And our customers told us, because of the increases they're seeing in the marketplace, the $1.25 is still an extreme value. They also told us after we moved to $1.25, Dollar Tree is their No.
1 trusted store, by far, in the $1 segment and value segment. And I think some of you have done research stating the same thing, that Dollar Tree's trust and brand loyalty is still there. And now as these new items at the $1.25 flow in, it's even going to increase from there. And we -- it's very important for us to get this item in as soon as possible.
And that's why we believe that throughout the year, as this flows in, we will see the units improve in the categories that we've addressed. The categories on the discretionary side are already a great value because the market has moved significantly around us. So we think we're in a great position. When the customer's stressed more than ever, highest inflation in four decades, they're getting pressure on their rents, on their fuel for their cars, on their heating bills, and on their food bills, they're going to come to Dollar Tree and Family Dollar now more than ever because of the great value that we have.
Edward Kelly -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
And just a quick follow-up. On the gross margin on Dollar Tree, why wouldn't the early part of the year, particularly the first half, be much higher than 35% to 36% just given what's going on from a pricing standpoint and then that normalized toward the end? Is that a fair assessment?
Kevin Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
I think as we think about it, Ed, there is that possibility. Obviously, because we haven't changed as much of a product, it's in process. But again, I think the other side of that is just a little bit of the freight market and the diesel costs and some things like that. Obviously -- we obviously hope there's upside to that, but we still got to go out and work through the quarter and prove it at the end of the day.
Edward Kelly -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Understood. Thank you.
Operator
We will now take our final question from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Hey, everyone. Good morning. So I guess my one question is when we look at the guidance on the face, it looked -- it felt a bit conservative. Mike, you mentioned the units down mid-teens, and then there's some higher inventory costs.
I wanted to ask you if there's points of conservatism. You mentioned that as you roll out new units, you're seeing a new product. The units look like they're getting better. I don't know much on -- how the costs flow through throughout the year, but can you talk about the points of conservatism that could be in this model throughout the year?
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. We're -- and I'll toss it to Kevin on a few line items. But overall, we just got completed, and the merchants just went through their line-by-line items. So we -- it is a wait and see.
We think that we're going to see traction throughout the year to drive the comp and the improved unit decline and reverse its course. So we've put out based on what we know now to be a model of the low to mid-digit comps, and the most important thing is at that higher-margin price point. So we think there's -- as we see, if the items start flowing in faster than what we want, then yes, we believe that then there could be some higher sales.
Kevin Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. I think as we look at it, as we've talked about some of the things, the bigger headwinds, obviously, labor is a big one. At the end of the day, with the continued investments that we continue to make and the workforce, and so I think we have to think about that. But I think, again, as Mike has said many times, as this assortment changes, it does give us the opportunity to potentially, hopefully, outperform this guidance at the end of the day.
But I don't know that it makes sense to go beyond where we're at, at this point, to Mike's point, given the fact that we've just got all the stores converted. It's been somewhat lumpy from a business standpoint given the January time frame and with omicron and weather between January and February. So there's a lot of different things as -- so I think Mike's statement about getting into the first quarter, and hopefully, all of this all kind of settles out, it will give us a much better read and give us, obviously, the data that we'll be able to speak to and make changes if changes are warranted.
Mike Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. And I would just reiterate, this is a trend. Moving beyond the $1 price point enable us to unlock our assortment and really deliver a 38% improvement in our EPS. And for long term, the way I think about it, it continues to move beyond that.
And then we're bringing in 1,500 more Dollar Tree Pluses and growing that year after year going forward and how that's going to leverage our sales and productivity of our stores and margin dollars. And then when you look at our Combo Stores on the Family Dollar side and getting 400 of those going, all of our initiatives will keep driving our top line at a better margin rate and enhance the EPS as we go forward, not only this year but in the years to come.
Operator
And we will now take our final question from Michael Montani of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Michael Montani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask on the inventory side, if you could help us to understand what is the build there in terms of units versus pricing given some of the accounting and how we can get comfortable with that relative to sales. And then I just had a follow-up question.
Kevin Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. I think if you look at inventory, obviously, the number, they sound like big increases. You got to remember that -- a couple of things. One, there's more -- we've been -- we've had a backlog trying to get inventory moved for some time now.
We still have a backlog of inventory. It's taking longer to get goods from Asia through the ports and into our distribution centers. So there's an element of the goods on the water being higher that are just because of the fact that it's taking -- instead of being 30 to 40 days, it's now 50 to 60 days to get goods from one place to the other. I think the other side of it is, as I spoke to, is the freight rates that we've talked about all this past year, the additional $600 million of freight, a large -- obviously, that gets capitalized into inventory and doesn't come through the P&L until you sell those goods.
So there's a large portion of freight costs that are also part of this build. And what you got to remember is Dollar Tree import's significantly more than Family Dollar, so that's why the Dollar Tree side of it is higher. We feel very good about our inventory position. I mean, obviously, I would tell you that our merchants would like to have more goods than they have right now.
In certain categories in particular, it's -- but -- so we feel very good about where we're at from an inventory perspective. And I think if we compared it probably to two or three years ago -- probably three years ago, it would probably look pretty reasonable if we looked at it on a store basis.
Michael Montani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
OK. And then just a follow-up on the ticket, if I could, for Family Dollar. If I heard correctly, that was up, I think, 4.8%. So can you just give some color there in terms of like units per transaction versus inflation and mix?
Kevin Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. I think as you look at it, I think there is some, obviously, inflation in that number. And I don't have it broken out, but I would guess it's probably about half of that number potentially, maybe about 2% as we look at the price increases that have been incurred over the last 12 months in particular. So that's probably about where it falls out.
Michael Montani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

Dollar General (NYSE:DG) stock has not been a “dollar store” for some time. I have been covering the company for nearly a decade, since before it lost the fight to buy Family Dollar, eventually acquired by DollarTree (NASDAQ:DLTR).
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Dollar General is a general store. It matches merchandise to markets. Where it sees opportunity and can get a license, it sells liquor. Where people are poor and don’t buy bananas, it sells pork rinds.
The result has been envious success. In its most recent quarterly earnings release, operating profits were 7.8% of sales. That’s even better than Target (NYSE:TGT), which is the new hotness among retailer analysts.
As the world adjusts to high gas prices and inflationary pressures, Dollar General could do even better.
The New DG
Dollar General has been quietly building a second chain, whose growth is now accelerating. It’s called PopShelf, and shoppers I know love it.
7 Metals Stocks to Buy to Mine Profits in 2022
The concept was launched in October 2020 and it’s now up to 50 units. The company hopes to have 1,000 in place in three years. Some will be inside existing DG locations. Others will be free-standing.
PopShelf  is a cross between Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) and TJX’ (NYSE:TJX) Home Goods. Most are in prosperous suburbs, and appeal to women who like organizing. Dollar General is starting the chain in the Southeast but has plans to spread it across the country.
Dollar General also owns a third chain, DGX, a grab-and-go store in central cities. Its slogan is “Xpress for Less.”
The Original DG
The original Dollar General chain has over 17,000 stores and opened about 500 between February and October of last year. The company next reports March 17, with $2.56/share of net income on $8.69 billion in sales expected.  The stock is down over the last three months, partly due to economic conditions, but also because of a rare miss on the third quarter. But it still expects earnings of about $10/share for the full year, on sales of about $34 billion.
Dollar General stock isn’t cheap. Despite being down 13% for the year to date, you’re paying over $1.35 for each dollar of sales, with a price to earnings ratio of about 20. Few retailers get that kind of premium. It’s a higher price to sales ratio, but just half the PE, of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), whose stock it was tracking until recently.
The man behind this success is Todd Vasos, who may be the best retailer you’ve never heard of. He joined the company in 2008 after a career at various pharmacy companies and was named CEO in 2015.  Harkening to his roots, he recently said Dollar General stores are in “health deserts”  and hired a chief medical officer.
Vasos’ employment contract was due to end last year. This worried me.  The company launched a nationwide search for his successor, but his contract carries an automatic yearly renewal. Little has been written about the search since early in 2021.
The Bottom Line
When a good company’s stock goes on sale, it’s a good time to buy it. DG stock is on sale right now.
I expect accelerating top-line growth, thanks to the new chains and expansion into health care. Dollar General is also the most profitable general retailer out there. I don’t expect that to change.
None of the nine analysts following Dollar General at Tipranks says sell, and 7 have it on their buy lists. Their price target represents a modest 17% gain. DG stock is now at its lowest price since last May. That’s why I finally got some.

Comparable sales increased for the 19th successive quarter. The metric gained from strength in both store and digital channels. However, margins remained under pressure, thanks to supply-chain bottlenecks and higher freight costs.

Without a doubt, Target has been focusing on store refurbishments, enhancing digital capabilities and expanding same-day fulfillment options, keeping speed and convenience in mind. The company provided an upbeat outlook for fiscal 2022. We note that shares of this Minneapolis, MN-based company have increased 15.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s rise of 22.2%.
Sales & Earnings Picture
Target reported adjusted earnings of $3.19 per share that outshone the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.86 and rose 19.2% from the year-ago period.

The big-box retailer generated total revenues of $30,996 million that increased 9.4% year over year but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $31,515.5 million. We note that sales jumped 9.4% to $30,616 million, while other revenues rose 11.1% to $380 million.

Meanwhile, comparable sales for the quarter increased 8.9%, backed by 8.1% jump in the number of transactions. Average transaction amount rose 0.7%. Again, digital comparable sales grew 9.2%, while comparable stores sales rose 8.9% during the quarter.

Target’s debit card penetration contracted 90 basis points (bps) to 11.5%, while credit card penetration shrunk 40 bps to 8.9%. Total REDcard penetration declined to 20.4% from the year-ago quarter’s 21.7%.
Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Margins
During the quarter, gross margin decreased 110 bps to 25.7%, reflecting pressure from higher supply chain costs owing to increased compensation and headcount in the distribution centers as well as higher freight and merchandising costs. Meanwhile, operating margin expanded 30 bps to 6.8%.
Other Financial Details
During the fourth quarter, Target paid dividends of $432 million. This reflected an increase of 32.4% in the dividend per share. The company repurchased shares worth $2.3 billion, thereby retiring 9.7 million shares at an average price of $237.00. At the end of the quarter, the company had roughly $12.3 billion remaining under its share-buyback program approved in August 2021.

This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $5,911 million, long-term debt and other borrowings of $13,549 million and shareholders’ investment of $12,827 million.
Outlook
Management expects quarterly, year-over-year profit performance will be variable during the year, and generally improve as the year progresses. It envisions first-quarter fiscal 2022 operating margin rate to be favorable in relation to historical performance but well below first-quarter fiscal 2021 rate of 9.8%.

Target guided low-to-mid-single digit revenue growth, an operating margin rate of 8% or higher, low-single digit growth in operating margin dollars, and high-single digit increase in adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2022.

In fiscal 2023 and beyond, Target stated that it expects mid-single digit growth in total revenues and high-single digit increase in adjusted earnings per share. It forecast mid-single digit growth in operating income. Management anticipates capital expenditures of $4-5 billion for each year.

2022-03-01 00:00:00+00:00,PREVIEW-America's belt-tightening to hit sales at dollar stores,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/preview-americas-belt-tightening-to-hit-sales-at-dollar-stores,,,"By Praveen Paramasivam
March 1 (Reuters) - Wall Street expects U.S. dollar stores to report slower sales growth for the holiday season as high inflation and waning federal stimulus made consumers spend less on non-essentials.
Known for their $1 products, America's two largest cut-price stores Dollar General Corp DG.N and Dollar Tree Inc DLTR.O have been battling margin pressure by raising prices and focusing on more expensive products from clothes to home decor.
However, those efforts have met with a muted response as pressures mount on low-income families, Wall Street analysts believe.
""Their customer really is feeling it between gas prices, food and heating,"" said Gabriella Santaniello, founder of retail research firm A Line Partners.
""They (customers) are really just focusing on the necessities, and they're just not buying really anything else.""
CONTEXT
Dollar Tree said in November it would start selling most products for $1.25, up from $1, due to inflation. U.S. producer prices rose by the most in eight months in January.
Dollar Tree's November-January quarterly earnings on Wednesday will show to what extent its price rises may have deterred customers or pushed them towards alternatives such as Walmart Inc WMT.N.
Offsetting the negative impact of higher prices, however, high inflation could also draw non-typical customers into dollar stores for cheaper fresh produce and cereals, Santaniello said.
""The impact might be not great but this might lessen the blow,"" she said.
THE FUNDAMENTALS
** Analysts polled by Refinitiv expect Dollar Tree's per-share profit to decline 17% to $1.77, with same-store sales growth slowing from a year earlier
** Dollar General, which reports on March 17, will likely report modest declines in profit and same-store sales
WALL STREET SENTIMENT
** Dollar General's current mean price target implies a 23% upside to Monday's close, while Dollar Tree's is 9% higher
** Shares in both retailers are rated ""buy""

2022-03-01 00:00:00+00:00,Broadcom (AVGO) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/broadcom-avgo-to-report-q1-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-cards,,,"Broadcom AVGO is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Mar 3.

 Broadcom Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
Broadcom Inc. price-eps-surprise | Broadcom Inc. Quote
 Let’s see how things have shaped up for Broadcom prior to this announcement:
Factors to Consider
Broadcom’s top-line growth is expected to have benefited from strong demand for its PON fiber in the broadband market, driven by the pandemic-induced work-from-home and online-learning waves. Continued solid demand for DOCSIS 3.1 cable modems has been a key catalyst.

Robust adoption of Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E for access gateways, courtesy of solid demand from homes, enterprises, telcos and other service providers, is expected to have contributed to revenue growth across the broadband end market in the fiscal fourth quarter.

Acceleration in 5G deployment, production ramp-up and increase in radio frequency content are expected to have driven top-line growth.

Broadcom’s fiscal first-quarter performance is likely to reflect synergies from the buyouts of CA and Symantec’s enterprise security business. The pandemic-induced work-from-home trend may have favored the adoption of cloud-based infrastructure software solutions, which is likely to get reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s top line.

These factors are anticipated to have aided Broadcom’s Infrastructure software revenues.

Broadcom is also benefiting from its partnership with Google Cloud.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.
