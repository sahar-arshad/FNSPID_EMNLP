2022-02-17 00:00:00+00:00,Should You Buy eBay Stock Ahead of Earnings?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-ebay-stock-ahead-of-earnings,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) was one of the prime beneficiaries at the onset of the pandemic. Folks looked to the e-commerce retailer and auction site for goods they needed and wanted while avoiding shopping in person.
The trend is reversing for eBay as economies are reopening worldwide. With that backdrop, the company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, Feb. 23. While long-term investors generally don't buy or sell a stock based on short-term events, there are some who use earnings reports as markers for whether or not to add to their holdings or as clues for potential discount opportunities. With that in mind, let's see if investors should buy this retailer's stock before the report's release.

eBay is taking a larger share of each transaction
eBay doesn't own or sell the products on its platform. Instead, it creates and manages the platform that brings together buyers and sellers. To generate revenue, eBay collects a varying fee from every transaction on the platform.
Arguably, buyers and sellers are equally crucial to eBay's success. Buyers would stop visiting the site if there weren't attractive items to buy. In contrast, sellers would stop going through the trouble of listing items if there weren't many willing buyers.
The coronavirus pandemic brought millions of new buyers to eBay. From Q2 2020 to Q1 2021, eBay's total active buyers increased from 161 million to 166 million. That said, eBay is now shedding active buyers as economies reopen and shoppers again have alternatives.
Further, management implemented a new strategy of reduced marketing and promotions aimed at lower-value buyers. The two forces acting together have caused active buyers to fall from the peak of 166 million to 154 million at the end of Q3.
Fewer buyers could be one of the main reasons gross merchandise value (total value of sales) has fallen by over 12% year over year to $19.4 billion. The metric is vital because eBay derives its revenue by taking a percentage of this value as its fee. Still, eBay increased its revenue year over year, despite falling gross merchandise value.
How did it accomplish this feat? By raising the percentage it takes from each transaction. eBay's transaction take rate has increased from 9.2% in Q2 2020 to 12.1% in Q3 2021.
You might assume that sellers aren't too thrilled about the increased levy. However, you couldn't tell by the number of sellers on eBay's platform, which remained flat at 19 million over the last year.
Beefing up services
Perhaps sellers are pleased with how eBay offers more value for the increased fees. In recent quarters, eBay has been beefing up its services to induce more transactions. One of the primary friction points on eBay's platform is trust between buyers and sellers, and that's precisely where management has focused on increased investments.
In the latest of these initiatives, eBay announced on Jan. 25 it would offer an authentication service for trading cards over $750 listed on eBay. Consumers can now shop with peace of mind, knowing that eBay will authenticate these cards to ensure they're not fakes and are delivered as advertised.
Trading cards are a significant category on eBay, accounting for $2 billion in gross merchandise value in the first half of 2021. Authentication for trading cards comes in addition to expensive handbags, sneakers, and watches.
Is eBay stock a buy?
eBay stock is trading at a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 15.7 and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13.2. These prices are roughly what it has sold for, on average, in the last five years. The company may continue to experience headwinds in the near term as the stay-at-home trend reverses.
However, in the longer run, an increasing share of shopping is moving online. Further, eBay is now taking a larger share of each transaction and reinvesting some of the increases, beefing up its services. eBay may not be an explosive growth stock, but it offers investors good value at its current price. The stock is likely worth buying before or after the upcoming earnings report, especially if you are planning to buy and hold long enough to benefit from the company's growth over time.

*Stock Advisor returns as of January 20, 2022
Matt Frankel: Guys, what do you think of Adyen currently? Business-wise, I feel they're one of the best-in-class in operations, financials, and tailwinds. But even after a decent drop, it's a crime to call it reasonably valued. Any thoughts?
Well, I don't necessarily agree with that it's a crime to call it reasonably valued, and I'll tell you why. If you're not familiar, Adyen is a payment processor. They're based in the Netherlands, which is why a lot of Americans haven't heard of them. They're truly a global payment processor, so their volume is right between Square (NYSE: SQ) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), so they are big. They focus on big merchants. They don't have a consumer-facing business really, which is why a lot of Americans haven't heard of them either. Their customers include companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY), Uber (NYSE: UBER), the big ones, eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY). If you remember a few years ago, eBay dropped PayPal as its main payment processor and that made a lot of news that was in favor of Adyen.
No other payment processor has gotten the attraction with large enterprises the way Adyen has. They do it profitably and they do it all over the world. The U.S. is about a quarter of their revenue and climbing. I like Adyen, I think, if you want some foreign exposure. Of course there's other dynamics at play like foreign exchange risk, because most of the revenue is not in U.S. dollars. But if you want a payment processing company that's not Square or PayPal, that's one to definitely look at.
Lou Whiteman: Much more embedded, too, with these big businesses, as you mentioned. I mean, Square has artisanal roots and PayPal, mostly small businesses. Adyen has a lot of really huge customers -- the one-stop shop, whether or not it's point-of-sale or online. I do say, I'll tell you without going -- because this goes well beyond fintech, so I will keep this brief, but valuation is a weird topic right now. I hear it a lot on Motley Fool Live sometimes in terms of, I hated this idea of, well, such and such company was at this value. The business hasn't changed, so we'll get back to it. I hate that analysis, because that doesn't even consider the fact that it might have been a mistake three months ago.
But where I do think it works is if this is when you have to start looking at total addressable market and see what's out there. Adyen, I think, is pretty early in a huge land grab with multiple winners, but they are coming into the United States. I think Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS), you're going to see them coming into new markets. The other big catalyst out there is, honestly, as, Matt, as you say, people don't know about if they just decide to get a New York listing, I think that would be a huge catalyst toward getting higher. I really like this company. I don't own it, but this is one I keep looking at, saying, why don't I own this?

2022-02-17 00:00:00+00:00,PayPal's User Growth Will Slow: Should Investors Worry?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paypals-user-growth-will-slow%3A-should-investors-worry,,,"Since hitting an all-time high of $308.53 last July, shares of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) have fallen dramatically, losing more than 60% of their value at Wednesday's prices. The company's revenue growth has decelerated, as the pandemic boost seems to be fading away. Investors are now questioning the payments giant's future.
Additionally, the company's massive user base, now at 426 million, isn't likely to expand at the rapid pace we've seen over the past few years. That's because PayPal's management team will no longer try to add as many customers to its platform as possible, instead opting to focus on increasing engagement.
Here's why that's not necessarily a bad thing.
Image source: Getty Images.
Quality over quantity
In 2020 and 2021, PayPal added a total of 121 million net new active accounts. The business undoubtedly benefited from the rise in electronic payments, as traditional brick-and-mortar retailers were temporarily shuttered during the initial stage of the pandemic.
2022 won't come close to resembling the recent past for PayPal, as management expects to add just 15 million to 20 million net new active accounts during the year. And CEO Dan Schulman even walked back his prior target of having a total of 750 million active accounts by 2025.
Instead of quantity, the leadership team will now emphasize gaining high-value customers who are engaging more with PayPal or Venmo and will increase revenue per active account. To do this, PayPal is paring back on utilizing incentive-based campaigns, which actually resulted in 4.5 million illegitimate accounts (that needed to be deleted) in the most recent quarter. Capital will now be invested mainly to get existing customers to engage more, a strategy that management believes reduces churn and results in a stickier, more lucrative user base.
""From an overall marketing point of view, our marketing investment, it's going to be relatively on par with what we did last year, but we are going to rebalance quite a bit toward marketing new products and services to our base, possibly additional investment in incentives for engagement and other things like that,"" Erica Gessert, PayPal's senior vice president of finance and analytics, said on the fourth-quarter earnings call.
New features like buy now, pay later and cryptocurrency trading have shown outstanding success at getting customers to transact more on PayPal's platform. These types of users generate a far better return on investment for the business than less engaged accounts, a group PayPal will start to let drop off instead of trying to keep.
Should investors worry?
Even if new user signups slow down this year, the management team thinks 2023 will be a return to normalized levels of customer adds. They forecast the massive fintech will add roughly 35 million new accounts on an annual basis starting next year, when some of the pandemic-related choppiness hopefully starts to subside.
Adding 35 million highly engaged net new active accounts year in and year out -- which don't require costly incentives and promotions on PayPal's part -- seems like a positive situation for the company. Therefore, I don't think investors have anything to worry about here. All of the problems facing PayPal right now appear to be temporary, yet the market is treating the business like its remarkable success is sure to be over, punishing the stock over the past several months.
Shareholders should pay close attention to revenue per active account going forward to make sure the leadership team is executing on its strategic pivot. Because the stock has been beaten down so much, now might be a good time to buy PayPal shares for investors who have been on the sidelines.

2022-02-16 00:00:00+00:00,2 Growth Stocks That Have Crashed but Are Still Great Long-Term Buys,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-growth-stocks-that-have-crashed-but-are-still-great-long-term-buys,,,"The stock market as a whole isn't crashing, but some stocks certainly are. And some of the declines look to be over the top and exaggerated. For investors, that creates buying opportunities and being able to pick up some quality stocks at reduced prices.
Both Seagen (NASDAQ: SGEN) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) have fallen sharply from their highs last year. However, neither business is broken, and they could be excellent growth stocks to hang on to for the long term. Here's why you may still want to consider adding them to your portfolio.
PYPL data by YCharts
1. Seagen
Seagen is a business you can feel good to invest in, because it makes treatments to help fight cancer. So if it succeeds, that benefits the healthcare industry and society at large. Its top-selling drug is Adcetris for treating various kinds of lymphoma, and it also has a newly approved drug for cervical cancer. What's more, it has ongoing clinical trials for breast, bladder, and colorectal cancer.
The company's challenge, however, is that it is not profitable. Seagen has reported a net loss in each of its past four quarterly results. But revenue is looking better. For the last three months of 2021, net product revenue rose 26% year over year to $369.2 million. For the full year, it increased by 38% to $1.39 billion. And in 2022, the company expects that number to reach between $1.48 billion and $1.55 billion. At the midpoint, that would represent a year-over-year increase of 9%.
There is yet hope for profitability as the company generates gross margins of 80% or better. However, right now research and development expenses typically make up similar percentages of revenue as well. That's not necessarily a bad thing as investment in the business is needed for Seagen to grow.
In the long run, there could be much more growth on the horizon. One reason is that in September 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for the company's cancer drug, Tivdak, to treat metastatic cervical cancer. At its peak, analysts believe the drug could bring in more than $1 billion in annual revenue.
Seagen will require some patience if you're waiting for the business to get out of the red. But its stock is trading right around its 52-week low, and that could make for a solid growth investment to just buy and hold for years.

2. PayPal
Fintech company PayPal fell out of favor with investors this month after the company announced guidance that wasn't what analysts were seeking. Although the company's revenue of $6.92 billion for the latest period (ended Dec. 31) came in above the $6.87 billion analysts were expecting, it was the guidance that had them worried about what lies ahead for the business.
In 2022, the company projects that its revenue will rise between 15% to 17% while analysts are hoping for growth of around 17.9%. One of the headwinds that PayPal is facing is that online marketplace eBay is moving away from PayPal and instead using its own managed payments system.
It's such a significant impact on the business that on its investor update, PayPal separates out growth numbers that exclude eBay. In 2021, for instance, the company's revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $25.4 billion. But when factoring out eBay, the growth rate is actually a more impressive 29%. (That's because eBay represented a greater portion of PayPal's revenue in 2020 than in 2021.)
Although PayPal's business may have taken a hit as a result of the change at eBay, it still has many growth opportunities ahead. For example, the company launched a digital wallet last year through a new app that allows users to manage their finances. With it, they can also buy, sell, and hold crypto -- and that can be a significant growth catalyst, given the excitement around cryptocurrencies.
PayPal's business does not look to be in dire shape, and the steep sell-off of late looks to be a significant overreaction. The guidance miss was by less than a percentage point. And if investors are worried about the impact of eBay, that has already been priced into the stock.
Today, shares of PayPal trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 25 -- that's a downright bargain compared to rival fintech stock Block, which is at a forward P/E of 85.

2022-02-15 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting EBAY Put And Call Options For May 20th,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-ebay-put-and-call-options-for-may-20th,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options become available today, for the May 20th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 94 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new May 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.88. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $52.12 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $59.36/share today.
Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 70%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.24% return on the cash commitment, or 20.34% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.25. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $59.36/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.24% if the stock gets called away at the May 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.16% boost of extra return to the investor, or 27.81% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 43%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 39%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $59.36) to be 33%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

In 2020, it took the S&P 500 just six months to make up all the ground lost during its collapse at the start of the pandemic, and then it quickly went on to set new record highs. From trough to peak, the broad market index has doubled in value in less than 18 months.
It shows the wisdom of always staying in the market because you never know what will spark a sharp reversal. It also means there's never a bad time to invest -- and always having money available, even small amounts, is a good strategy for everyone.

A correction will eventually happen. It always does. But so does the recovery phase that more often than not turns into a raging bull market. If you discount the COVID-19-fueled decline two years ago, the stock market has been climbing inexorably higher for some 13 years since the end of the Great Recession.
Tech stocks have been a key reason behind that drive, though the market began turning against the sector late last year. While their values remain elevated from where they were, there are bargains still to be found, and the four following tech stocks are ones that you should buy and hold for the long term.

JD.com
Like the rest of the world, Chinese consumers have embraced online shopping, and JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) is increasingly where they're turning to shop. Active customers hit 552.2 million last year, up 25% from 2020, helping to drive third-quarter revenue to $33.9 billion, also a 25% year-over-year gain.
Part of the reason for its success is that unlike rival Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), JD.com is more of a marketplace for third-party sellers than a seller of goods itself, making it more akin to eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY).
Over the past year or so, however, China has become a risky place to invest as Beijing cracks down on tech companies and those it deems have become too successful. JD.com has so far escaped the scrutiny that's fallen on Alibaba and others, and maintains it will continue to do so. So for investors who understand the risk involved should the government turn its sights on the e-commerce platform, JD.com is a tech stock that should offer generous returns for years to come.

Cohu
For many investors, this stock might just as well be Co-who?, but Cohu (NASDAQ: COHU) is a fast-growing supplier of specialized testing and handling equipment for the world's largest semiconductor manufacturers. It's also positioned to capture the biggest trends in the industry because of its exposure to the automotive industry, more devices tapping into the Internet of Things, and the rollout of 5G networks.
Semiconductor demand is at record levels in the auto industry alone as the global chip shortage has affected the production of vehicles all around the world. Cohu continues to add new auto manufacturers as customers, and two of them account for over 20% of Cohu's revenue. That does represent some concentration risk in the equation should one or both of them move their business elsewhere, but with the market screaming for computer chips, there is a wide runway for Cohu to grow for many years.
At just 10 times trailing earnings and 11 times next year's estimates, some of the lowest valuations in the sector, Cohu is a tech growth stock that should grow and outperform for investors.

AT&T
Now just might be the best time to buy AT&T (NYSE: T). Earlier this month Ma Bell revealed its plan for the spinoff of its Warner Media division and the effect it would have on its dividend payment. The market sent its stock careening lower, and now the telecom giant trades at nine times trailing earnings and seven times estimates, making its stock very cheap.
Ever since AT&T said it would be doing the spinoff (which the market cheered) and cutting the payout (which was booed), its stock has been falling. Shares are now 27% below the highs they were at last May.
Yet the proceeds from the spinoff will allow AT&T to pay down a good chunk of its debt while focusing future capital expenditures on its core telecom business, which is now in growth mode. The rollout of 5G is going to power a lot more than computer chips for smartphone sales, and AT&T has a leading position in the space, even ahead of rival Verizon (NYSE: VZ).
And while AT&T has always been a dependable dividend payer with a payout that currently yields 8.5% annually, even with the coming 50% haircut it's still going to be a top dividend stock on the other side. Wall Street also expects the new $1.11 per share payout to grow again and exceed its current level by 2026.
With a business arguably better positioned than it has been in years and a still-hefty dividend payment, AT&T is a set-and-forget stock for your portfolio.

Tesla
Unlike most of these other tech stocks to add to the long-term portion of your portfolio, Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock is not cheap by traditional metrics. The electric car maker trades at more than 900 times earnings(!), 17 times sales, and 100 times the free cash flow it produces. While shares traded north of $1,200 each not too long ago, they're down 25% since.
Yet Tesla is only just hitting its stride, selling almost 1 million vehicles last year, or about half of what the biggest old line manufacturers produced. So in just over 10 years, it has surpassed some of the biggest names in the industry in terms of production, and with new gigafactories regularly coming online, CEO Elon Musk just might hit his goal of 20 million EVs by 2030.
Tesla is now also consistently profitable, something other EV makers can't say. Though some analysts say the share price should be closer to $150 than $1,000, Tesla has more growth to come.

2022-02-13 00:00:00+00:00,Shopify Earnings: Watch for a New 2022 Outlook,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/shopify-earnings%3A-watch-for-a-new-2022-outlook,,,"Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) stock has plummeted since late 2021 as investors worry about slowing growth for the e-commerce tech platform. The nearly 50% decline might mean market-thumping returns from here, though, if the business maintains some of the impressive momentum shareholders have enjoyed over the past few years.
With that idea in mind, let's look at a few metrics to follow in Shopify's upcoming earnings report, set for Wednesday, Feb. 16.
Image source: Getty Images.
Market share updates
The pandemic added noise around Shopify's growth rate as more commerce was temporarily done online. The company notched several quarters of over 90% year-over-year growth in 2020 and 2021, for example.
Executives said that the selling period through late September represented a more normalized environment. Revenue expanded 46% thanks to a growing merchant base, higher selling volumes, and increased spending on its premium services. ""The strength of Shopify's flywheel was on display"" in the third quarter, CFO Amy Shapero said in late October.
Management said that the fourth-quarter period would likely be strong even as Shopify adds fewer merchants compared to the record result in late 2020. Shopify should reach roughly $1.7 billion in sales, according to Wall Street analysts, which would translate into an over 70% increase.
Look for market share to rise against huge peers like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY). ""We expect our [transaction volumes] in the fourth quarter to continue to grow substantially faster than the e-commerce market,"" Shapero told investors in October.
Cash and finances
Management at the time warned about several short-term pressures to cash flow and profitability, including the fact that soaring platform engagement is falling in comparison to 2020. Rising costs and supply chain challenges aren't helping, either.
Still, look for Shopify to report impressive gross profitability that's offset slightly by rising spending on the platform. Adjusted operating income rose to 18% of sales through the first nine months of 2021 compared to 12% a year earlier. The rate of increase slowed sharply in Q3, though, and might decelerate even more over the next few quarters.
SHOP Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts
That decline helps explain why many investors have become more conservative about the stock lately. It's unclear where Shopify's profitability will settle after jumping higher through most of the past two years.
The outlook
The biggest question heading into Wednesday's report is whether CEO Tobi Lütke and his team see a bright 2022 ahead. Management's long-term outlook is likely brighter than ever, but the next 12 months might be characterized by slower growth and rising costs.
These factors wouldn't hurt the bullish investing thesis. Shopify is spending more on its platform to handle record engagement, after all. And sales trends were always bound to take a step backward after demand stampeded online through the early phases of the pandemic.
That's why investors should look at the stock's slump over the last few months as a buying opportunity instead of any sign that the business is stumbling. Shopify is gaining share in an industry that's likely to grow quickly over many more years, notwithstanding a temporary pullback as the world emerges from the pandemic.

*Stock Advisor returns as of January 10, 2022
Demitri Kalogeropoulos: The company I'm bringing to highlight today is eBay. I'm sure everyone knows this. We were talking about e-commerce a bit. There's a lot of ways to get exposure to the e-commerce space. eBay is unique for a bunch of reasons, I have been following the company for a while.
Obviously, it's a marketplace that some people don't know that it's one of the top three e-commerce companies in the world basically because they handle so much volume.
They facilitated about $20 billion worth of merchandise sales in the past quarter. That, for example, compared to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which is the leader basically, Amazon is more in that $58 billion space, almost three times as much but still, these are huge numbers. eBay is a global company.
But it's a marketplace, so they're not selling their own products, they're just connecting buyers to sellers, so the actual eBay's revenue is in that more like $2.5 billion range.
That's one of the things that's interesting about this stock because it's got that asset-light model, a whole different approach. It doesn't have to spend all that cash on the fulfillment centers and the big inventory. It can just focus on basically doing that connection and gets paid to similar. We've talked about Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) before.
It's that similar model where they charge sellers a fee somewhere around that. eBay is in around that 10% range. Etsy's is way higher. That does wonders if you like finances in a company and you prefer that over really high-growth.
eBay's operating margin is somewhere around 25% of sales and you can compare that to about 6% for Amazon and Walmart (NYSE: WMT). Similarly, huge e-commerce giants.
It's also a cash-generating machine because of that model and they pour most of that cash right back to the shareholders. They spent $2 billion just last quarter on buybacks and they paid a dividend so we don't get a lot of that. That's still pretty rare in the e-commerce industry.
Obviously, it's not growing as quickly because that's the trade-off when they don't operate their own inventory. Sales growing about 10% in this past quarter. But if you like a dominant brand with an asset-light operating model and you like direct cash returns, you might want to take a closer look at eBay.
Asit Sharma: Nice. That was really succinct, Demitri. A really good overview there. You've been a fan for a while as I remember of this company.
Kalogeropoulos: I've been following them there for a while. It's just like I said, some of those numbers are just head-turning. I think it's something like operating cash flow with something like 30% of sales routinely. It's just so much. Such a cash business. That's really what attracts me.
Sharma: Sometimes the best investments are right in front of us.

2022-02-10 00:00:00+00:00,Is Adyen Stock a Buy Now?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-adyen-stock-a-buy-now,,,"Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y), the Dutch digital payments company that convinced eBay to ditch PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) back in 2018, lost nearly 40% of its market value over the past three months as rising interest rates sparked a grueling rotation away from higher-growth tech stocks.
PayPal's messy fourth-quarter report in early February exacerbated the pain by dragging down Adyen and its other fintech peers. But has Adyen's steep decline, which reset its valuations to more sustainable levels, made it a worthwhile investment for patient investors again?
The differences between Adyen and its rivals
Adyen provides an end-to-end platform for payments, data, and financial management services. Its software can be directly integrated into existing online, mobile, and in-store payment platforms with a few lines of code. That integration enables merchants to accept over 250 payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, mobile wallets, and other payment apps.
Image source: Getty Images.
Adyen doesn't provide a dedicated consumer-facing app like PayPal, nor does it provide peer-to-peer payment services like PayPal's Venmo and Block's (NYSE: SQ) Cash App. It also doesn't provide any cryptocurrency trading services, stock trading tools, or physical debit cards.
Instead, Adyen's backend services enable merchants to issue their own virtual payment cards, which function as branded mobile wallets, and maintain their own payment and data systems.
That behind-the-scenes approach makes Adyen more comparable to PayPal's Braintree, Shopify Payments, and Stripe. It also makes Adyen easier to analyze than PayPal and Block, which both have a lot more moving parts.
How fast is Adyen growing?
Adyen posted its full-year numbers for 2021 on Feb. 9. Its growth in revenue, processed volume, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) all accelerated significantly from 2020, when the pandemic shut down many brick-and-mortar businesses.

Data source: Adyen. YOY = Year-over-year.
Ayden's growth improved throughout 2021 as those headwinds waned, and it maintained its long-term outlook for growing its annual revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) ""between the mid-twenties and low-thirties in the medium term"" by roping in more businesses.
However, Adyen's take rate -- or the percentage of each transaction it retains as revenue -- dipped from 22.5% in 2020 to 19.4% in 2021. It attributed that decline to a higher mix of lower-margin retail customers, which partly offset the growth of its higher-margin enterprise customers.
On the bright side, Adyen's EBITDA margin still expanded from 59% in 2020 to 63% in 2021 as its operating leverage improved. It also reiterated its long-term guidance for boosting its EBITDA margin ""above 65%"".
It's growing a lot faster than PayPal
Analysts expect Adyen's revenue and EBITDA to both rise 38% in 2022, and for its net income to grow 42%. Based on those estimates, Adyen's stock trades at 38 times this year's sales and 80 times forward earnings.
That makes it a lot pricier than PayPal, which trades at just five times this year's sales and 27 times forward earnings. However, analysts expect PayPal's revenue and earnings to increase just 16% and 1%, respectively, this year, as it grapples with its final decoupling from eBay (which ends in the second half of 2022), competitive challenges, and various macroeconomic headwinds.
Adyen's stock looks more attractively valued than it did three months ago, but its high valuations could still expose it to rising inflation and interest rates.
Is it the right time to buy Adyen?
Adyen is arguably a simpler and better-run fintech company than PayPal or Block. It's not suffering a major slowdown like PayPal, and it isn't obsessed with the volatile Bitcoin market like Block.
But Adyen's stock is still priced for perfection at these levels, and its upside potential could be capped by the market's limited appetite for high-growth stocks. I'd recommend nibbling on Adyen at these levels, but investors should realize they're still paying a hefty premium for this fintech favorite -- even after it was nearly cut in half over the past three months.

2022-02-09 00:00:00+00:00,Dutch payment company Adyen's H2 core profit jumps 51%,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dutch-payment-company-adyens-h2-core-profit-jumps-51-0,,,"By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Adyen NV ADYEN.AS, the Dutch company that helps to process payments for Netflix, Facebook and Uber, on Wednesday said prospects for its business remained strong as it reported a 51% jump in second-half core earnings.
Earnings before interest, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose to 357.3 million euros ($408.0 million) in the July-December period, while revenue rose 47% to 556.5 million euros.
Analysts had expected EBITDA of 346 million euros on revenue of 552 million, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.
Adyen shares have fallen 27% this year amid a wider technology sell-off.
The company is profitable but enjoys a high valuation based on expectations of continued strong growth.
Adyen said its EBITDA margin in the second half rose to 64% from 62%, and repeated its medium-term target of a compounded annual growth rate of around 25%-30%.
Recent critical analyst reports have focused on the company's exposure to large clients including eBay EBAY.O and Facebook owner Meta FB.0.
The company says it is benefiting from long-term trends in the way consumers order and pay for goods, which have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Adyen also helps vendors handle payments in stores and is often attractive to large companies that sell both online and offline goods, and in multiple countries.
""Results were bolstered by the unrelenting rise of online commerce globally, and an increasing need for merchants to implement unified commerce shopper journeys,"" Adyen said, as well as the ""disappearance of cash"".

2022-02-08 00:00:00+00:00,This Is Why Unity Software Is More Than Just a Metaverse Stock,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-is-why-unity-software-is-more-than-just-a-metaverse-stock,,,"Today's video focuses on Unity Software (NYSE: U) and itsearnings call reported on Feb. 3. This company is mainly discussed as a metaverse stock, but in its most recent earnings, it showcased numerous partnerships outside the gaming market. Here are some highlights from the video.
In early December, eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) partnered with Unity to bring selected sellers a 360-degree view solution, allowing sellers to showcase their items in a more realistic 3D image. The partnership may not be a big moneymaker for Unity, but it shows how its tools are used outside the gaming industry.
Running a manufacturing factory can be a logistics nightmare, and moving heavy equipment around to test new setups can take a long time and be expensive. So-called digital twins solve these problems by presenting a digital version of a factory that allows management to test new setups to improve logistics, costs, and more without disrupting the manufacturing process. On Jan. 7, Unity announced that Hyundai Motor Company would be building a digital-twin factory using Unity's solutions.
Here are two of my favorite things mentioned during theearnings call First, management believes revenue can be at or above 30% over the long term. Second, Unity is expected to break even on a non-GAAP basis within its fiscal year of 2023.

Buying These 3 Stocks Now Just Might Be the Smartest Move You'll Ever Make",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/have-%243000-buying-these-3-stocks-now-just-might-be-the-smartest-move-youll-ever-make,,,"The biggest regrets often involve roads not taken. That's true for life, in general, but it's especially applicable to investing. Many investors kick themselves later for not buying the stocks of great companies with tremendous growth prospects earlier.
Not every stock offers a realistic chance to achieve huge gains. But if you have $3,000, buying these three stocks just might be the smartest move that you'll ever make -- at least from an investing standpoint.

1. MercadoLibre
It's easy to focus exclusively on U.S. stocks. However, some of the biggest opportunities are with international stocks that target emerging markets. MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) stands out as one of the best in the category.
If you're not familiar with MercadoLibre, picture a combination of Amazon.com, eBay, and PayPal with a Latin American twist. MercadoLibre's e-commerce marketplace is akin to Amazon and eBay. Its Mercado Pago digital payment platform is similar in some respects to PayPal. And MercadoLibre focuses exclusively on the Latin American market.
Investment firm Morgan Stanley projects that the e-commerce market penetration rate in Latin America will jump from 9% last year to 16% in 2025. As the biggest player in the market, MercadoLibre stands to benefit the most from this growth. The company's digital payment revenue should expand in tandem with its e-commerce business.
We're talking about a potential market of at least $160 billion within three years. MercadoLibre's market cap is only around $50 billion. With its shares down almost 50% since September 2021, this stock looks like a great pick to buy at a discount.
2. Teladoc Health
Here are two numbers you need to know: $2.6 billion and $261 billion. The former is the amount of revenue that Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) expects to generate this year. The latter is Teladoc's total addressable market -- in the U.S. alone.
Can Teladoc grab a significant chunk of its addressable market? I think so. The company already ranks as the leader in virtual care. Teladoc offers the broadest array of services in the industry. Its client base tops 12,000 with 76 million members.
The easiest path to growth for Teladoc is expanding its reach within its existing client base. Teladoc estimates this opportunity is around $75 billion. New products and services such as Primary360 virtual primary care could enable Teladoc to continue winning additional clients as well.
Many investors seem to have written off Teladoc. The stock has plunged 75% from its high set in early 2021. But with its market cap now below $12 billion and an enormous potential market, Teladoc appears to be a surefire winner over the long run.
3. Vertex Pharmaceuticals
Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) reigns as the king of the cystic fibrosis (CF) market. There are four approved therapies that treat the underlying cause of the genetic disease -- and Vertex owns all of them. The good news is that Vertex has only tapped a little over half of the CF market so far. Its closest rival is only in phase 2 testing.
The big biotech plans to expand beyond CF as well. Vertex and partner CRISPR Therapeutics expect to file for regulatory approvals of CTX001 in treating sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia later this year. The gene-editing therapy could have a multibillion-dollar opportunity.
That's just the tip of the iceberg, though. Vertex is advancing VX-147 into late-stage testing within a matter of weeks in treating APOL1-mediated kidney diseases, which has a bigger patient population than CF.
Then there's the huge wild card with the company's type 1 diabetes candidates. Vertex CEO Reshma Kewalramani said in the company's fourth-quarter conference call, ""Our goal with our type 1 diabetes program is to develop a functional cure for this disease, including for the more than 2.5 million people living with type 1 diabetes in the U.S.""
Unlike MercadoLibre and Teladoc, Vertex is performing well right now with shares up more than 10% year to date. The stock is still cheap based on one key valuation metric, though, with a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of only 0.35. I think Vertex could be a monster winner over the next decade and beyond.

2022-02-06 00:00:00+00:00,3 Reasons to Buy PayPal Stock,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-to-buy-paypal-stock-0,,,"After its management reported 2022 guidance for revenue, earnings, and net new accounts that disappointed Wall Street, PayPal's (NASDAQ: PYPL) stock tanked. The shares have tumbled more than 30% since the Feb. 1 announcement. And PayPal's stock has fallen a remarkable 60% from its all-time high in July 2021.
Amid all the negativity, though, there were some bright spots in PayPal's fourth-quarter financial release. Opportunistic investors should consider these data points and look past the near-term pessimism. After all, PayPal is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 30, the lowest it's ever been at since spinning off from eBay in 2015.
Here are three reasons you might want to buy this top fintech stock right now.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Total payment volume is astounding
For all of 2021, PayPal processed $1.25 trillion in total payment volume (TPV), marking the first time in the company's history that it eclipsed the 13-figure milestone. This was up 33% from the prior year, a clear indication of the strength of PayPal's network. For 2022, the leadership team forecasts TPV of $1.5 trillion. This is a gargantuan amount, and it underscores just how important the business has become in digital payments and e-commerce.
Venmo, the company's popular personal finance app, grew TPV 44% in 2021 to $230 billion. ""We are still at the beginning of our monetization journey with Amazon implementing the option to pay with Venmo later this year,"" Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said on the Q4 earnings call. Adding capabilities like buying and selling cryptocurrencies, check cashing, and business profiles to Venmo certainly also support growing TPV in the years ahead.
2. Engagement is rising
Another impressive metric from PayPal's latest financial release was that the average account conducted 45.4 transactions over the trailing-12-month period. The business now has 426 million active accounts, of which 34 million are merchants.
New features in the flagship PayPal app that were introduced last year, like bill payment, early direct deposit, and shopping rewards and deals, help the company make progress in becoming a complete financial services app for users.
But management will now ""focus on sustainable, high-quality growth to drive engagement and increased revenue per active account,"" I fully expect transactions per account to continue marching higher as the business lets its least-engaged customers roll off.
""We're seeing double the average revenue per active account when somebody uses our app versus just checkout,"" Schulman said. ""When somebody uses the app their propensity to churn is 25% less,"" he continued. So, the name of the game is to attract more valuable customers and get them using multiple services.
3. PayPal is a cash machine
With a stock that just crashed as much as PayPal did, it's easy to forget how outstanding the company's financial situation is. This is a capital-light business model that has proven to be a very lucrative cash machine.
PayPal generated $5.4 billion of free cash flow in 2021. Put another way, for every $1 in revenue the company brought in last year, a little more than $0.21 turned into cash. This financial flexibility gives PayPal the ability to continue pursuing strategic initiatives, like the $2.7 billion acquisition of Paidy, a Japanese buy now, pay later fintech. The company also has the wherewithal to introduce new features and updates to bolster its competitive position in the crowded digital-payments market.
What's more, management has the means to return capital to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks. In the most recent quarter, PayPal repurchased $1.5 billion worth of stock. As of Dec. 31, PayPal had $16.3 billion in cash compared with $8 billion of long-term debt. Many companies would love being in this position.
Current valuation
I briefly touched on PayPal's current valuation in the introduction. Clearly, the pessimism surrounding the stock right now couldn't be any higher.
If investors truly believe that the company's slowing growth is just temporary, particularly in this dynamic economy, then it shouldn't be hard to zoom out and focus on the long term.
For an investor with this mindset, PayPal's shares could be a screaming buy today.

2022-02-04 00:00:00+00:00,The Implied Analyst 12-Month Target For SPHQ,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-implied-analyst-12-month-target-for-sphq,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Invesco S&P 500— Quality ETF (Symbol: SPHQ), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $56.89 per unit.
With SPHQ trading at a recent price near $50.88 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.82% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SPHQ's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Generac Holdings Inc (Symbol: GNRC), eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY), and Target Corp (Symbol: TGT). Although GNRC has traded at a recent price of $278.01/share, the average analyst target is 69.21% higher at $470.41/share. Similarly, EBAY has 27.00% upside from the recent share price of $59.55 if the average analyst target price of $75.63/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting TGT to reach a target price of $267.00/share, which is 26.13% above the recent price of $211.69. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of GNRC, EBAY, and TGT:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
Invesco S&P 500— Quality ETF SPHQ $50.88 $56.89 11.82%
Generac Holdings Inc GNRC $278.01 $470.41 69.21%
eBay Inc. EBAY $59.55 $75.63 27.00%
Target Corp TGT $211.69 $267.00 26.13%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2022-02-04 00:00:00+00:00,4 Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-growth-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-forever-0,,,"Forever is a very long time. There's a good case to be made that you shouldn't hold your stocks forever. You may want to sell some in retirement, for example, to supplement your Social Security income. Selling is the right thing to do when a stock has lost your confidence, too.
Still, there are some terrific companies with corresponding stocks that have been great performers in the past and that seem poised to keep rewarding shareholders well for a long time. Such companies might stay in your portfolio for many decades -- and possibly even for the rest of your life. After all, if you don't need to liquidate your whole portfolio before you die, you can leave some valuable shares for your loved ones.
Image source: Getty Images.
Here then are four solid candidates for your long-term portfolio.
1. Veeva Systems
Veeva Systems (NYSE: VEEV) is only about 15 years old, but it has grown into a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company with a recent market value near $36 billion. It describes itself as ""a leading global provider of cloud-based software solutions for regulated industries such as consumer goods, chemical, cosmetics, and life sciences."" It helps companies make sense of the data they collect, offers customer relationship management services, and helps drug companies manage their many clinical trial processes -- among other things.
So how much of a growth stock is Veeva? Well, over the past decade, its stock has grown by 505%, as of the end of January. Annualized, that's 24%, versus just 14% for the S&P 500. (That 14% is very respectable, too.) Its last quarter featured results that underwhelmed some investors, but those results included revenue rising 26% year over year, while earnings advanced 9% on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis and 26% on a non-GAAP basis. (Investors would do well to learn more about GAAP to help them better understand financial statements.)
2. MercadoLibre
MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is often described as ""the eBay of Latin America,"" but there's a lot more to know about it than that. For example, it also encompasses a digital payment system, Mercado Pago -- somewhat similar to PayPal, which eBay spun off in 2015. Meanwhile, consider that Latin America is home to more than 635 million people -- roughly double the size of the U.S. -- which means there's a lot of growth potential.
And MercadoLibre is growing briskly, with third-quarter revenue up 73% year over year (on a currency-neutral basis) and gross merchandise popping 30%. The company's stock has surged some 1,100% over the past decade, averaging more than 28% annually. Better still, the shares seem somewhat undervalued, too, with their forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio recently at 120. While steep, it's well below the five-year average of 528.

3. Unity Software
Unity Software (NYSE: U) may be unfamiliar to most of us. But with a recent market value topping $30 billion, it's become, in its own words, ""the world's leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D (RT3D) content."" Consider these statistics:
71% of the top 1,000 mobile games use Unity's software.
50%-plus of mobile, PC, and console games use the company's tools and services.
Each month, some 2.5 billion users use content featuring Unity technology.
The company's stock has been trading only since late 2020, and its shares were recently up more than 50% since that time, averaging about 37% annually. In its third quarter, revenue popped 43% year over year, with net losses narrowing. Unity bulls like its recent acquisition of special effects company Weta Digital, and some wonder whether Unity's operating system will be the one to dominate the metaverse.
4. Universal Display
The ticker symbol of Universal Display (NASDAQ: OLED) may give you a hint about its business focus: displays for electronic devices such as smartphones, TVs, tablets, and smart watches. Its specialty is energy-efficient organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology, and its displays are found in Samsung's Galaxy series and LG's OLED televisions, among other product lines.
Over the past decade, Universal Display's stock has popped more than 230%, averaging about 13% annually. That actually lag's the S&P 500's return in the same time period, but remember -- when thinking about investing in various stocks, future performance counts more than past performance. In the company's third quarter, revenue grew by 23% year over year, with CFO Sidney Rosenblatt noting, ""As we look to the OLED industry, we believe that we are still in the early innings of a long-term secular growth market. As the next wave of OLED adoption for medium-and-large-area applications takes shape, we are fortifying our position as an OLED leader and innovator on multiple fronts.""
Universal Display's future looks promising, as TV makers upgrade their offerings, such as into 4K models, and more people buy models with very large screens, requiring more square feet of display. So far, OLED screens are only present in a small portion of TVs -- as they're costlier -- but it's likely that that portion will grow over time, presenting a tailwind for the company.
These four companies have very promising futures, so dig deeper into any that interest you -- and know that there are plenty of other growth stocks that look attractive, too. It's good to aim to hang on to your shares for many years or even decades, but never do so blindly. Be sure to keep up with your holdings, ideally at least quarterly, to make sure they're still on track and deserving of your confidence.

2022-02-03 00:00:00+00:00,7 Stocks to Buy as Panic Selling Hits Wall Street,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-to-buy-as-panic-selling-hits-wall-street,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The recent volatility in the markets appears to be easing a bit. That’s not to say the main driver of it, the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates, won’t continue to have an impact. But with stocks, electric vehicle (EV) and tech plays in particular knocked down so much, so fast? It may be time to decide which stocks to buy, as the dust temporarily settles.
For many of the names pushed lower by rate hike concerns, the sell-off was justified. That is, there was some semblance of sense to their sky-high valuations in a near-zero interest rate environment. As monetary policy starts to make its own “return to normal,” these valuations are unsustainable.
Yet in the case of some reasonably priced names? What played out last month may have been a bit of an overreaction. Pushed to prices that underestimate their respective long-term potential, investors focused on the long-term may want to scoop some of these up, while they remain at opportune entry points.
7 REITs With Major Upside Potential in 2022
So, what are some of the stocks to buy, as the sell-off ends, at least for now? These seven, a mix of growth and value plays, are solid plays for those who can look past near-term uncertainties:
eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)
Ford (NYSE:F)
Fisker (NYSE:FSR)
GAN (NASDAQ:GAN)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI)
AT&T (NYSE:T)
Stocks to Buy: eBay (EBAY)
Source: ShutterStockStudio / Shutterstock.com
While not one of the hardest hit by last month’s tech sell off, EBAY stock has experienced a moderate pullback since the start of January. This is atop the slide in price it experienced during November and December.
In all, at around $58.50 per share today, the online auction marketplace operator is down around 27% from its 52-week high.
Again, with rates rising, it makes sense that tech stocks with high valuations have come down in price. But eBay’s forward multiple is far from frothy. In fact, trading for around 15.4 times projected 2021 earnings, you can say it’s a value play. Sure, it makes sense that this more mature internet stock sports a lower price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple.
Even so, given the moderate level of earnings growth expected this year, and in 2023? Its clearly undervalued. Initiatives like managed payments, a product of it weaning off its former subsidiary PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), as well as stock buybacks, are helping the company deliver earnings per share (EPS) growth that exceeds its single-digit sales growth.
Going forward, eBay may not necessarily go on a hot run once sentiment for shares improves. Yet the ingredients are in place for it to deliver solid returns in the years ahead. You may want to buy it while it remains down from its extended pullback.
Ford (F)
Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com
Ford’s move into EVs has been the main driver for its stock price over the past year. It has also played the main role in this incumbent automaker’s big drop, as investors have made a big exit out of vehicle electrification plays.
Many EV stocks, like Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID), Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have moved up too far, too fast. Adoption of electric cars and trucks may be accelerating. Whether that justifies the rich valuations these three pure plays continue to command remains up for debate.
With F stock, however, valuation is less of a concern. It’s still priced more like an “old school” auto stock, at 11.2x earnings. You are getting exposure to the EV megatrend at a more than fair price. Not to mention, you are getting indirect exposure to RIVN stock as well. An early investor in Rivian, this company owns around 12% of it, a position worth around $7.5 billion.

Going forward? It’s still plugging along with bringing out electrified versions of its popular vehicle models. Ford is also rumored to be planning to spin off a small portion of its EV business. A move like this could unlock value for shareholders. At around $21 per share today, down slightly from its recent high, consider this one of the best stocks to buy after the market’s recent correction.
Stocks to Buy: Fisker (FSR)

Buying F stock appears to be one of the safer stocks to buy to add EV exposure to your portfolio. But what if you’re looking for something more of the high-risk, high-return variety? With other early stage electric vehicle plays, downside risk may exceed upside potential.
In the case of Fisker stock, though, risk/return appears favorable. It has a $3.5 billion market capitalization at today’s prices (around $12 per share). There’s a lot less potential growth already baked into its stock price. Now, that makes some sense, given the company isn’t targeting six figure delivery numbers within a few years, like Lucid and Rivian are.
Still, even if Fisker finds moderate success with its EV offering, an SUV known as the Ocean, there may be plenty of room to grow its valuation. By comparison, Lucid and Rivian need to hit their ambitious growth goals just to sustain their valuations.
With the market’s lukewarm feelings for FSR stock, and more muted enthusiasm for EV stocks overall, patience may be key. It may take some time for it to re-hit the highs reached during past waves of “EV mania.” There’s of course the risk too that the Ocean is a dud once it makes its debut later this year. Nevertheless, after its sharp drop during the January wave of panic selling, it may be at a price where the odds with this risky EV play are in your favor.
GAN (GAN)

The rate hike sell-off has hit growth stocks across the board. As I mentioned above, EV stocks and more general tech stocks have been hard hit. So too, have online gambling plays. With the big shift from overly bullish to overly bearish, many bargains can be found in this space. But one in particular that’s worth a look is GAN stock.
Not familiar with GAN? That’s understandable. This online gambling doesn’t operate a sportsbook, which explains its lack of name recognition. Instead, it’s a provider of back-end technology for the sportsbooks industry. In a way, with its SaaS business model, you can think of it as sort of like the sports betting industry’s equivalent to Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP).
When sports betting and i-gaming stocks were in vogue, this previously over-the-counter (OTC) listed stock took off, once it uplisted to the Nasdaq Capital Market. Over the past year, though, as investors have become more skeptical about projections of high growth for the industry, shares in this name have tanked.
7 REITs With Major Upside Potential in 2022
Following the latest gambling stock rout, this former $30 stock now trades in the high single-digits. Still operating in the red, it doesn’t pop out as a value play on a stock screener. Yet with management confident it can turn this business (currently generating between $125 million and $135 million annually) into a $500 million per year business by 2026, you may want to give it a closer look.
Stocks to Buy: Intel (INTC)
Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com
Despite its relatively low valuation, the recent tech sell off, driven by rate hikes, has put pressure on INTC stock. So too, has the chip maker’s latest guidance update. A mixed outlook was met with a negative reaction by investors. However, much like the other value names in tech, this may be another where the market has overreacted.
Why? For starters, while guidance fell below expectations, Intel’s earnings for the December quarter came in ahead of estimates. This may be the first sign that it’s turnaround, which CEO Pat Gelsinger has conceded could take as much as five years, is working. The company’s game plans, which includes it investing $100 billion into new plants, in order to become a major foundry for other chip makers, isn’t without risk.
Yet if it works out, it could enable the company to regain ground lost over the past few years. Along with getting its manufacturing house back in order, Intel’s plan to take its Mobileye unit public, while keeping a majority stake, could boost shares as well. With this unit alone worth $50 billion, it may be able to convey to investors that the company as a whole is worth more than its current $198.8 billion market capitalization.
Just announcing it’s raising its dividend as well, this 3% yielding stock also pays out while you wait for the Intel turnaround to complete. Put it all together, and this is another one of the best stocks to buy after last month’s meltdown.
SoFi Technologies (SOFI)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Before, I’ve recommended to wait and buy SoFi Technologies, if/when a rate hike sell-off sends it down to single-digit prices. A drop on the heels of rising interest rates did happen, yes. But with news of it obtaining a bank charter softening the blow, this fintech stock has managed to stay above $10 per share.
In light of the bank charter development, and the fact the prospect of higher rates has been factored into it? I’ve tweaked my prior take on SOFI stock a little bit. Now that the uncertainty as to whether this digital first financial services firm would become a licensed bank has cleared up, it may have already found its floor.
Sporting a high valuation due to projections of it continuing to grow at a fast clip, you may be surprised I’m bullish. After all, aren’t rising rates going to have further impact on stock market valuations? On one hand, this is true. On the other hand, rising rates may help SoFi more than they hurt it. As it morphs into more of a traditional financial institution, rising rates may be in its favor, as they help make banking more profitable.
7 Best Robinhood Stocks to Buy on the Dip
Stronger than expected results, plus a faster trip to overall profitability, may help outweigh the risk of multiple compression from rising rates. With this in mind, keep an eye on SoFi as it bounces back from its lows.
Stocks to Buy: AT&T (T)
Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com
Still perceived as a “widows and orphans” stock, recent market volatility has only done minimal damage to the price of AT&T shares. However, there has been a recent development that may dampen interest in it for now.
That would be its just-announced plans to spin-off rather than split-off the Warner Bros. Discovery shares it’ll receive, once it merges its WarnerMedia unit into Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA). Investors were hoping for the latter rather than the former. Why? A split-off of shares would’ve limited the extent of “Ma Bell’s” post-divestiture dividend cut.
Going the spin-off route, the T stock dividend is getting a severe haircut. Instead of paying out $2.08 per share in dividends annually, going forward its annual payout will be $1.11 per share. That translates into a drop in its yield from 8.52%, down to around 4.5%.
Income investors are not happy. That’s why shares, after their rebound from December through mid-January, are back below $25 per share. Yet as InvestorPlace’s Louis Navellier recently argued, the heavy amount of attention around its payout means the market is underappreciating its potential as a turnaround play. Both T stock and its spinoff could make comebacks down the road. Trading for just 7.8x earnings, investors buying it after its recent drop could see nice returns, albeit with a lower amount of dividends.

""The details of the ADP employment report indicate a large and likely temporary drag from omicron on January employment,"" say Goldman Sachs Economics Research strategists. ""We continue to expect a 250,000 decline in nonfarm payrolls in Friday's report.""
However, ""expectations for the January jobs data have ratcheted lower due to the recent omicron wave,"" says New York Stock Exchange Senior Market Strategist Michael Reinking, which could explain the market's lack of a reaction to the downbeat news.  Reinking adds that small businesses accounted for half of the overall job losses.

Match Group (MTCH, +5.3%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, +5.1%) also helped propel Wednesday's session with Street-beating results of their own.

It was a bruising session for PayPal Holdings (PYPL), which plunged 24.6% after earnings. While the digital payments company reported better-than-expected revenue in its fourth quarter ($6.92 billion actual vs. $6.87 billion expected), adjusted earnings per share of $1.11 fell short of the $1.12 per share anticipated. PYPL also projected current-quarter earnings of 87 cents per share, well below analysts' consensus estimate of $1.16 per share, and said revenue is likely to grow at a slower-than-expected pace in fiscal 2022. This soft forecast comes amid eBay's (EBAY, -3.2%) challenging migration to its own payments processor and other factors like inflation negatively impacting cross-border payments, according to PayPal CEO Dan Schulman. PYPL's really bad day spread to other fintech stocks, with Block (SQ, -10.6%) and Shopify (SHOP, -10.0%) also ending the day solidly in the red.
Under Armour (UAA) rose 2.7% today after Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger upgraded the athletic apparel and footwear maker to Overweight from Equalweight (the equivalents of Buy and Hold, respectively).

On Tuesday, UBS analyst Jay Sole reiterated his Buy rating on UAA, saying its ""turnaround story continues."" Sole expects Under Armour to turn in a solid earnings beat when it reports earnings the morning of Friday, Feb. 11, which he believes will ""boost sentiment"" on the stock.

2022-02-02 00:00:00+00:00,3 Undercover E-Commerce Stocks That Are Way Too Cheap,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-undercover-e-commerce-stocks-that-are-way-too-cheap,,,"When investors think of e-commerce stocks, they typically think of companies like Amazon, Etsy, or eBay, companies that started out as online retailers. But increasingly, brick-and-mortar retailers are grabbing larger shares of the e-commerce pie, reinventing themselves to serve online shoppers and leveraging their stores for fast shipping and easy pickups and returns.
Despite this trend, the market doesn't seem to be giving any credit -- in the form of higher valuations -- to brick-and-mortar retailers that have thriving e-commerce operations. Keep reading to see three bargain-priced stocks that the market is mispricing.

1. Williams-Sonoma
Williams-Sonoma (NYSE: WSM) may be best-known as a purveyor of upscale kitchen items and home goods, but the company also owns West Elm and Pottery Barn, making it one of the biggest pure-play home goods retailers in the country.
Williams-Sonoma has close to 600 stores across the country, but the company invested steadily in its omnichannel model and now sees itself as a digital-first business. The numbers back that up. In the third quarter, even as the economy had largely reopened, the company said that 67% of its revenue came from e-commerce. And unlike online-only rivals like Wayfair, Williams-Sonoma is also highly profitable. For 2021, the company estimates that it will report an adjusted operating margin of 17%.
With the tailwinds from remote work and higher housing prices, Williams-Sonoma should continue to benefit from increased spending on home furnishings -- and it competes at a price point where customers aren't very price-sensitive. That should help it deliver wide profit margins.
Despite those strengths, the stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 12, a dirt-cheap valuation for a well-reputed retailer doing two-thirds of its sales online and has a solid growth path ahead.

2. Children's Place
Children's Place (NASDAQ: PLCE) is the largest pure-play children's apparel retailer in the country -- and like Williams-Sonoma, the company is rebalancing its business to focus on e-commerce. It began a store rationalization program in 2013 and has steadily reduced its store count from around 1,200 to about 700 after accelerating store closures during the pandemic.
Despite that reduction in its store fleet, the company's sales have continued to grow, posting record results for every major category in its latest reporting period. In the third quarter, the company said 45% of sales came through its digital channel and that 71% of those digital sales came through a mobile device. Over the long term, it's targeting a digital penetration of 50%, which the company says is its most profitable channel.
Children's Place has also become highly profitable after further streamlining its business during the pandemic. In the third quarter, it posted an operating margin of 20%. Its most profitable quarters are typically in the second half of the year during the back-to-school and holiday seasons, so it may not be that profitable for the full year, but that's a good representation of how well the business is executing.
Even with strong growth in the e-commerce channel and high margins, the stock trades at a rock-bottom P/E ratio of 7. At that valuation, investors have a wide margin of safety even if profits moderate next year as it laps a banner performance in 2021.

3. American Eagle Outfitters
Teen apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE: AEO) has been a strong performer in a difficult sector. While its namesake brand has done well, the real star is Aerie, its intimates brand for teens and young women. Aerie has posted skyrocketing sales growth over the past few years, grabbing market share from Victoria's Secret.
In last year's third quarter, Aerie's revenue grew 28% year over year -- and that follows 34% growth in 2020's third quarter, meaning sales have jumped 72% in a two-year span. That's come while the apparel industry has faced headwinds from the pandemic. Sales at the American Eagle business have also rebounded in 2021 as stores have reopened. Meanwhile, the company posted strong profits with an operating margin of 16.5%, its best level since 2007.
While increased store traffic has been a part of its growth story this year, so has its success in the digital channel. Through the first three quarters of the year, digital penetration reached 35%, or $1.8 billion in revenue, and the company's digital profits are up from 2019, showing it's delivering strong results to the bottom line.
The company also seemed to have had a strong holiday season and has raised its outlook for 2023 operating profit from $550 million to $800 million and sees its operating margin increasing from 10% to 13.5% with the success of Aerie driving much of that growth.
Even with strong execution and the rapid growth of Aerie, American Eagle is valued at a P/E of just 12. That looks like a mistake.

Feb 2 (Reuters) - Nasdaq 100 futures jumped 1.5% on Wednesday, rising for the fourth straight session after a turbulent start to the year, as Google-parent Alphabet and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices' shares surged following strong fourth-quarter results.
Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O rose 10.4% in premarket trading after reporting record quarterly sales on Tuesday, and said it plans to undertake a 20-to-one stock split.
The stock split should make it more appealing to retail investors, said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, adding that Alphabet earnings will underpin a return in confidence in beaten down technology names.
""After all the tumult of January, solid earnings can be a catalyst for gains.""
Last month the tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC fell as much as 19% from its all-time high in November as investors dumped highly valued growth stocks on prospects of faster-than-expected rate hikes.
Traders are betting on five rate hikes this year after hawkish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve last month.
Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O climbed 11.1% after it forecast 2022 revenue above expectations on Tuesday, following strong quarterly demand for its semiconductors, despite global supply snags.
The chipmaker's strong outlook lifted shares of peers Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Micron Technology Inc MU.O between 2.8% and 5.2%.
At 7:01 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 37 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 33.5 points, or 0.74%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 218 points, or 1.45%.
Investors will be keeping an eye out for the ADP National Employment Report later in the day that is expected to show private payrolls added 207,000 jobs in January, after they jumped by 807,000 jobs in the previous month.
Megacaps Meta Platforms Inc FB.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O rose about 3% each ahead of their earnings this week.
Of the companies that have reported results so far during this earnings season, 78.8% of them have beaten analysts' earnings estimates, compared with an average of 84% over the past four quarters, according to Refinitiv data.
PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL.O slumped 16.8% after forecasting first-quarter revenue and profit well below expectations, as it prepares to take a hit from eBay Inc's EBAY.O ongoing move to ditch its payments services.
Starbucks Corp SBUX.O fell 2.6% as the coffee chain lowered its estimates for profits this year and said it will raise menu prices in 2022 and reduce some spending to offset soaring costs for labor and goods.

*Stock Advisor returns as of January 10, 2022
This video was recorded on Jan. 14, 2022.
Chris Hill: Earnings season kicks off. We've got a few companies we're looking forward to hearing from and our guest has a couple of stocks he thinks are looking good at their current price. If you are a long-term investor, you're in the right place. We've got all that and more coming up right now.
I'm Chris Hill, joined by senior analysts, Jason Moser and Maria Gallagher. Good to see both!
Maria Gallagher: Good to see you, too!
Chris Hill: We've got the latest headlines from Wall Street Financial Planner, Malcolm Ethridge is our guest this week. As always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar. But we begin with the start of earnings season three of Wall Street's biggest banks sharing fourth-quarter reports on Friday morning. Wells Fargo's (NYSE: WFC) profits in revenue came in much higher-than-expected. But Citigroup (NYSE: C) saw a rise in expenses cutting into their profits. JPMorgan Chase's results were overshadowed by lowered guidance for 2022. Jason, what's your headline for each one?
Jason Moser: Well, we talked about 2022 being a better year for the banks. I think it will be to an extent, but it's not like 2021 was a bad year. If you look at the numbers, JPMorgan's total return was just under 28 percent. Wells Fargo just right at 61 percent, both outpacing the market. What the bad year, I'm sure some of that has to do with the anticipatory market pulling forward some of those expectations for eventual higher interest rates. But this was, I think, a quarter that really help them set the table for 2022. Let's start. What's going to order of tangible book value from highest to lowest Chris because I think that really follows the market sentiment here overall. With JPMorgan, I think at a time when it was very fair to question whether they would be raising guidance as interest rates start to tick up, it's fascinating to me, they're actually lowering guidance. That is due in large part to inflationary pressures, higher costs, a tight labor market.
With that said, the business continues to perform very well. They beat on both counts for the quarter, consumers have been flushed. The consumer banking average deposits were up 20 percent for the quarter and loans down just a tick. Profitability continues to drag their due to low rates. Wealth management assets under management at $3.1 trillion, that was up 15 percent, thanks to market conditions and inflows. Generally speaking, good things for JPMorgan. Wells Fargo. I think honestly, this is a good story that just keeps getting better, and hats off to Matt Frankel, my colleague, their Industry Focus. We talked about this all last year. That was his bank stock for the year and really for his many problems as they were having, particularly with the culture, but really that bled into the business itself. Another quarter or Wells beat on both counts. They released another $875 million in reserves for those allowances for credit losses.
I think a very similar story to JPMorgan in a lot of ways. Home lending for Wells was down eight percent primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, which was driven by lower originations. Then you go to Citi. In Citi, there's just not a lot to really smile about right now. The headline here is ""Hit Refresh"" because that's really what they're doing. This is a bank in the middle. I don't want to call it a turnaround necessarily, but it is a refresh. They find themselves in a little bit of a different bode here. They continue to divest some laggards of the business, the big divestiture of their consumer banking business in Asia. That veiled what was modest earnings growth for the quarter. But I think when you look at the way the market is viewing these stocks today, with JPMorgan valued at 2.2 times tangible book, Wells Fargo valued well under two times tangible book, and then Citi valued well below tangible book. I think that really tells you what the market's thinking and what the market is expecting this coming year.
Chris Hill: For investors like me who don't own shares of any of the big banks, did you hear anything today that provides clues to the broader economy?
Jason Moser: Yeah. I think generally the message was positive. JPMorgan noted in the release and I quote, "" The economy continues to do quite well despite headwinds related to the Omicron variant, inflation and supply chain bottlenecks. Generally speaking, the consumers are at a pretty good place. But I think the caveat there, inflation is real. It's something these banks are dealing with. Costs are going up across the board. Consumers will not be immune to that, so it will be something to pay attention to this coming year.
Chris Hill: Let's move on to the deal of the week which arrived on Monday. Take-Two Interactive announced its buying Zynga in a cash and stock deal worth 12.7 billion. Take-Two gets a much bigger presence in mobile gaming and Zynga shareholders get a pretty nice premium for their shares, Maria.
Maria Gallagher: It's a really interesting deal. I think it's very logical, but I think it's important to look at the history of Zynga for a second. It was founded 15 years ago as a poker game for Facebook. Prior to its 2011 IPO, it was a huge deal. FarmVille was massive. I was working with Facebook, so it was really a darling when it IPO-ed. The stock debuted at $10. It was up to $14 a couple of times in 2012. But their growth really relied entirely on Facebook. Then Facebook limited their third-party developers from promoting their services that cut their revenue in half. Their stock was down 75 percent. It still to this day has never recovered. Even with that premium that Take-Two is paying, it's still below their IPO price.
That's really interesting to me if you look at the whole history of Zynga, who is known for games like FarmVille, Words With Friends, Harry Potter games, Star Wars games. I understand the rationale, it's really establishing leadership in this mobile area, which is the fastest-growing segment of the entertainment industry. It brings together your console and PC franchises. I think it's a really high price point. It's pretty high premium. But I think it'll be interesting to see how they integrate and then what they can ultimately grow into to get that consistent customer and consumer appetite for those games in those brands.
Chris Hill: Is that why you think shares of Take-Two took a little bit of a hit this week that some people think they're paying too much for Zynga?
Maria Gallagher: I think, yeah. I think a lot of times you see what these mobile games it's really the fad of the time. There was a time everyone was playing the Kim Kardashian game. There at the time everyone's playing FarmVille. It's about getting a company that can consistently keep those consumers interested. I think that maybe people aren't sure that Zynga can do that, and they're trying to see some clarity behind that.
Chris Hill: Rough week for Elastic shareholders, the search software company announced the co-founder and CEO, Shay Banon is stepping down to assume the role of Chief Technology Officer. Shares of Elastic, down 12 percent this week and hitting a 52-week low, Jason.
Jason Moser: It's always fascinating to me to see the market react so quickly to news like this. From a longer-term perspective, it actually seems like it could be good news. Ash Kulkarni moving into the CEO role. Shay Banon and co-founder and former CEO, he will move over to the CTO role and also remain on the Board. If you have a CEO and he doesn't really want to be CEO, Chris, do you want to be CEO? Because I don't. I want to get people where they want to be. I want to get the right people in the right places. Then it feels like that what this ultimately accomplishes. The tech is where Banon's passion is. This happens often. For a company to get to that next level, oftentimes, they need to make a pivot toward an operator to be able to do that. I would be cautiously optimistic with this, particularly when you look at the business itself that continues to do well.
Most recent quarter they announced total subscriptions of over 17,000. That was up from 12,900 a year ago. Large customers with an average contract or an annual contract value greater than $100,000, grew to 830 versus 650 a year ago. Then buried in that press release at the very bottom, I wonder how many people caught it, but management also announced that it now expects to exceed its guidance for revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP net loss per share provided for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. It looks like we've got some good results coming here shortly as well. All-in-all, I think this is a good business where the market's knee-jerk reaction could be opening up an opportunity for patient investors.
Chris Hill: Earnings season just getting started on Friday and with so many companies reporting in the coming weeks. Maria, before we go to break, what is a company that you are especially curious to hear from?
Maria Gallagher: A company I'm excited to hear about and hear from his Pinterest. What we saw from them last quarter was a slowdown in growth for some users, a decline in monthly active users in certain demographics. That wasn't surprising to me as life was more in-person, more active, traditionally, summer and fall aren't their strongest quarters anyway. But I think it's important to see that these companies that had a lot of pull-through and new customers during 2020 to see if there are monetizing those customers well to see if those customers are staying. Especially around the holidays with Pinterest specifically trying to get more shoppable to see if they saw an increase in that monetization effort and saw more engagement and users over this holiday season as they are trying to pivot to more of a shoppable app. I think that Pinterest specifically, but those types of social media in general, is something that I'm really excited to dig into a little bit more.
Chris Hill: Jason, I would put Amazon on this list just because of how big the company is. Obviously, there are a lot of companies we want to hear from in the retail space about how the holidays went for them. But when you throw in AWS, all the different things Amazon has going on, I'd put it on the list as well. What about you?
Jason Moser: Yeah, I like both of those and I'll add Etsy to the mixture as well it's stock has essentially been cut in half from its 52-week high, but the company to generate $600 million in free cash flow over the last 12 months, I put shares now around 35 times trailing free cash flow. Boy added, Chris, it's getting interesting, I think with that. It's the stock I own, you know I like it. But we saw the report here in regard to retail sales in December. It looks like those numbers, obviously you exclude autos, those sales fell 2.3 percent. Online spending took the biggest hit of that actually, and that's add it's bread and butter. But I look back to last quarter, some initiatives they've been putting into motion here particularly for the holiday season. They were focusing on fulfillment, being more communicative in regard to the arrival of those shipments. They have a store seller program that's really helping merchants up their game in rise to that next level for their customers. Then also the new gift finder feature. Listen, I sifted through that during the holiday. Chris, it was pretty clever, is very intuitive, and very helpful. All things considered, it really feels like this pullback in Etsy shares given the initiatives they've been focusing on, I'm very interested to hear how the holiday season went and how 2022 is shaping up.
Chris Hill: After the break, we've got the latest news from restaurants, relationships, and the business of outer space. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here, with Maria Gallagher and Jason Moser. Shares of Virgin Galactic down more than 20 percent this week. The space tourism company announced plans to raise up to $500 million in debt. Maria, when they went public in October 2019, they said they'd be flying customers in 2020. Now, Virgin Galactic is saying, ""It's really going to be the end of 2022.""
Maria Gallagher: Yeah, they've had multiple delays in their spacecraft testing and development. They've pushed back its commercial services to later this year, at the earliest. But they have sold seats ahead of the plant pace. Their ticket sales are at an updated price of $450,000 a seat, which is very reasonable, according to them. They were targeting 1,000 reservations; they've sold 700 out of 1,000. So they still have that customer appetite, but they just need more money. They need to fund it, they need to get ready. So I'm not surprised with that pushback, that they need more time before they can see consistent revenue generation. I'm curious to see what they end up using the money on, and also just, if the commercial flights start taking place as planned.
Chris Hill: We're not going to be surprised if they push it to 2023, are we?
Maria Gallagher: I wouldn't be, no.
Chris Hill: From space travel to the business of relationships; shares of Match Group down a bit this week, despite getting an upgrade from analysts at Goldman Sachs. But at least Match Group has one less competitor to worry about; Meta Platforms, the company formerly known as Facebook is shutting down Sparked, the video dating service the company apparently started last year. Jason, I got to be honest, I really forgot that Sparked was a thing that Facebook was trying.
Jason Moser: The tone of your voice, I find that hard to believe, Chris. Nevertheless, I'm with you; you could be forgiven if you didn't realize this actually existed. But I'm going to harken back to May 4th, 2018, Chris, where I tweeted in regard to this very specific issue. I said on that date, ""I'm not a March owner, but I have a hard time seeing Facebook impacting their business much at all on the long run. Zuck's got a long history of trying stuff like this to no avail, and he is very late to the game where online match making is concerned."" Fast-forward to today's news, you can understand, I too am not surprised.
Chris Hill: I will give Meta Platforms some credit because, apparently, when they were emailing people to tell them about this, and I'm quoting directly from the email, they wrote, ""Like many good ideas, some takeoff, and others, like Sparked, must come to an end."" That's a pretty harsh take on something you tried to launch, but I give them credit for it.
Jason Moser: Yeah.
Chris Hill: Earlier this week, Domino's Pizza was one of the companies presenting at the ICR Investment Conference. CEO, Richard Allison, said the company is making changes to its value offerings to deal with rising costs. Among the changes, Maria, moving some items to digital-only orders, and fewer chicken wings in orders. I feel like that second one is going to get more blowback from customers. But interesting to see a leader in the restaurant space being pretty direct about how they're planning to deal with inflation and rising costs.
Maria Gallagher: Right. So what they're saying is they're cutting the number of chicken wings in the offer from 10-8. Their $7.99 Carryout Deal is now, like you said, online only. So this new offer is a three-topping pizza, or wings, for $7.99. But what's really interesting about this is what we're seeing is something called shadow inflation, which is when the price of a good or a service stays the same, but the quality has gone down. We see this a lot in hotels and restaurants. Hotels, for example, it might cost the same, but you don't get the daily room service, or you don't get the buffet breakfast in the morning. Cleanliness is a huge one. Consumer sentiment on restaurant cleanliness fell 4 percent this year. So what we're seeing is this is a little bit harder to track. But you see, when you have inflation, you have all these different types that it impacts consumers in lots of different ways, but this is one that people are talking about and people are noticing as they're paying the same, but the quality of the services significantly decreased, or the amount of goods they're getting has decreased. So I'll be interested to see how other restaurants follow this news with their own.
Chris Hill: Although, when you think about the investments that Domino's has made in digital, and Allison being very clear about the fact that look, ""We're taking orders over the phone; that's more expensive for our business than when we're taking digital orders."" This could be a hidden win in some ways in the long run for Domino's. I wouldn't be surprised to see other restaurant chains doing the same thing because, ultimately, don't they want more people using their mobile app?
Maria Gallagher: Yeah, and online orders typically come with those higher average tickets than orders placed over the phone. So it's usually a better system for Domino's and for the restaurants. I think it will be interesting to see. Domino's has that technology infrastructure, they have those capabilities already built out, so I'd want to understand how that's going to impact some of those smaller restaurants that don't have those capabilities in the same way, and don't have the scale Domino's does to be able to pivot into this more profitable channel during inflationary times.
Chris Hill: Well, most restaurant chains could do far worse than just to follow Domino's blueprint with what they've done with mobile ordering. A quick thanks to a longtime listener, Aaron, in Virginia, who wanted us to weigh in on a new product offering from Crocs that's going to be available in March. Crocs has apparently teamed up with luxury fashion house, Balenciaga, I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly, to produce Stiletto heeled Crocs for just $625. Jason, let me say that again, $625 for 3-inch heel Crocs. What do you think?
Jason Moser: That's a lot of cabbage, Chris. We can make fun of this all we want. Long-time shareholders can tell us to stick it because Crocs just wins, baby. I mean, the stocks up better than 1600 percent over the last five years alone. These things may seem silly to us on the surface; they also do keep Crocs in the conversations. So I like the ideas. I like how they form partnerships. They came out with a KFC shoe at some point. But you know want to I want to see, Chris; right is this weather starts to warm up, I want to see some grill collaboration this year. Partner up with Weber, partner up with Traeger. What about big green egg Crocs, that are not only green, but shaped like eggs. The ideas are just out there, Chris. I'm presenting them for further deliberation. Just throwing it out there.
Chris Hill: Maria, you're in New York City, will you let us know if you spot anyone on the street wearing these?
Maria Gallagher: I will let you know. I recently saw people with the ugliest shoes I've ever seen in my life. Then I look them up, and they were $500 Yeezys. So clearly, I don't know what fashion is at this point.
Chris Hill: We'll see you later in the show. Up next, financial planner, Malcolm Ethridge, will analyze what the Fed Chief said on Capitol Hill this week, and what it means for investors. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money, I'm Chris Hill. Earlier this week Jay Powell testified before Congress, to help make sense of the Fed Chair. What he said is Malcolm Ethridge is a certified financial planner and an executive with CIC Wealth, and he joins me now from where else? His home. Good to see you, thanks for being here.
Malcolm Ethridge: It's good to be anywhere I can be virtually, I guess at this point like you said.
Chris Hill: There are a couple of things I want to get too, but let's start with Jay Powell. He testified before the Senate Banking Committee at his confirmation hearing. Look I know he's a smart qualified guy and I know it's an important job, but I just did not care enough to watch. Did he say anything that caught your attention, anything that you think matters to investors?
Malcolm Ethridge: I think the commentary about Jay Powell was more entertaining than the commentary from Jay Powell. Someone referred to him as Goldilocks in a suit. Which I thought was the most hilarious way to put it, and it was very apt too it was perfect. He made the case that inflation and its impact on us is going to be longer through the year, then he thinks people are thinking I guess is the way to say it. He made that very clear and he made the case that inflation at top 7 percent at the end of 2021. He sees that number as sticking around for longer than people probably realize. That was probably the most impactful thing of all of it. Because if that's what the Fed is predicting, than that means that that's what you, and I, and the folks who rely on us for information about the markets need to wrap their minds around.
For context, last year we got the cost of living adjustment out of the Fed related to social security benefits and it was a 5.9 percent. We will like, "" That's a whopping 5.9 percent cost of living adjustments. That's a pretty big deal. They must be being overly generous."" Which we now have found out no, they actually were somewhat on target. They undershot it by a little bit, but they were expecting this thing to be pretty significant, this thing being inflation. To be pretty significant and also to hang around for long enough, to give a full year's worth of additional benefit to people on a fixed income, Retirees on a fixed income. For context the year before I think it was 2.7, and the year before that it was like 2.3 was the cost of living adjustments incrementally. We're talking more than double for 2022 is what they gave as the adjustments. All that to say the government is taking inflation seriously, we as consumers need to also take inflation seriously.
Chris Hill: I know we're only two weeks into the new year, but 2022 is not off to a good start for the market in general, particularly the Nasdaq. I'm sure I'm not the only one looking at some of the Nasdaq stocks that I own that are down to 40 percent or more. What questions are you getting from your clients and what are you telling them?
Malcolm Ethridge: The two main questions I'm getting are, do I need to hurry up and do this refinance that you were telling me about for the last three years that have been putting off? Even though in a lot of cases I answer yes, they'll probably still continue to put it off. Because just inertia in human nature and we tend to wait for whatever reason. Then the other question is, why do I keep hearing so much about interest rates and why should care? The answer in short for anyone who, this is your first time taking this class. It's OK to invest in things like tech stocks that are going to take years upon years to actually show their real value, or it's actually create real value. When interest rates are super low and companies can borrow toward that growth for very cheap.
But in years when interest rates are a little bit higher into borrow as a corporation, it takes a little bit more money it's less cheap to borrow. Now, I need you to show growth sooner than you were anticipating, so that I can actually have some return for these dollars that I'm handing you. That's one way to look at it the other is as far as bonds are concerned. A lot of professional traders who trade corporate bonds are looking at the spreads on the yields from those bonds. They're saying if I can find an opportunity to earn about as much in the bond market as I can in the stock market for presumably less risk. Why wouldn't I not just buy those bonds? As the spreads become more attractive in corporate bonds, less reason to buy into the stock market chasing growth. You have people selling all stocks, buying bonds, and those two things happening at the same time create this perfect storm of January that you're referring to.
Chris Hill: I'm assuming that for someone with your job, 2021 was a year in which among other things, you've got a lot of questions from people about newly public companies. When do you think about the number of IPOs, the number of specs. Do you think particularly with respect to the specs on the way a lot of them played out and tepid start to the year. Is that going to come down in 2022, or are we going to see fewer public companies or companies coming public, particularly via SPAC?
Malcolm Ethridge: I think a good indication of that is going to be the number of companies who were public, and we see them now going private in 2022. For one reason or another, they just can't quite get off the ground. Rent the Runway is one that I'm paying a lot of attention to. It's a company that I looked at in 2021 and said this company has no business trying to get public, because they just don't have the financials to support it. Rent the Runway turning into once again a private company will be a great leading indicator. Another one is WeWork. They're trying their hardest to get WeWork public while the opportunity still exists, because people are interested in buying into IPO is really big splashy names. If WeWork can't make it public by the end of 2022, that'll be again a really great indicator that the party has ended. The folks who are still looking at the SPAC market, is there a way to really allocate their dollars and the stock market. That's the way that I'm looking at those leading indicators. Companies that IPO to recently and they turn around and half to go private again.
Chris Hill: I suppose the silver lining to the extent that there is one, is that there are some good and in some cases maybe even great businesses that are now available at a lower stock price. What are the one or two stocks, or just categories of stocks that you think are looking more attractive right now?
Malcolm Ethridge: I really love PayPal. Obviously not a super splashy name than anybody's unaware of. But to answer your question directly, I really love PayPal at the price it's at today. It's gotten whack quite a bit because it really hasn't shown improvement anything. One of the reasons that it's been considered disappointing, is because they didn't really do a lot in the buy now pay later movement that we saw come along with their firms as an example. A lot of folks the sentiment was PayPal is allowing our firm to take market share that it should be having. But we're seeing already the government making noise and saying things about their interest in the buy now pay later market and them wanting to come in and regulated a little bit more. Which means that there's not a lot of opportunity left there for folks who are looking at that as the space they want to be investing in.
Which means that PayPal didn't really miss out on a ton, they just were now vindicated in avoiding that. In the meantime, they said that they anticipate generating about $5 billion in free cash in 2022. Which has got to go somewhere, because PayPal has a history of aggressively growing inorganically. They're taking those dollars they have sitting on the sidelines and they're going on buying great businesses rather than starting up new business units internally. Because they already have a history of doing that and very aggressively, I see them as being a great company that's poised to do more of that in 2022 especially in Asia. Because they've got a really strong foothold in Japan in 2021, they've announced that they identified two key targets in Indonesia in 2022 that they might be interested in. Which tells me they're going to continue to push into Greater Asia for inorganic growth, so that's the one I've really got my eye on.
Chris Hill: Before I let you get away, what else?
Malcolm Ethridge: I also really love real estate and healthcare. Although the two sectors specifically that we as a firm are focused on, I as an individual and focused on. I've got a ton of it in my own portfolio, a name I will give you that isn't necessarily an underperformer that's undervalued and has a really attractive entry point but I think they've done a lot of room to go is UnitedHealthcare. UNH is selling above $300 a share it's a pretty hefty., but we're looking at UNH as there'll be the biggest beneficiary of the pent-up demand for health services that for the last two years hasn't really been achieved. You've got how many elective surgeries that people have been sitting on waiting to get done. You've got a lot of just general maintenance type healthcare that should have been done in 21, should have been done in 20 even for some people. That they will now be going to visit their doctors in 22 as COVID starts to dissipate in the spring and summer, and look like it's finally going to leave us alone at least in a significant way. We anticipate a lot of people going to the doctors, UNH is one of the biggest beneficiaries of that just because of the market share that they have of the health insurance markets.
Chris Hill: One last thing in addition to your day job, because apparently here not busy enough. You will also host the Tech Money Podcast, season one wrapped up in mid-December. When can we expect Season two to start?
Malcolm Ethridge: Glad you asked it's January 19th, we're right around the corner from season two launching I'm really excited about it. Because of the feedback we got in season one and the way folks really loved episodes that we did around equity compensation. There'll be a ton more of that now going forward in season two. A lot of experts on the Equity Space that's becoming a way more attractive way to pay employees, especially younger employees and millennials and Gen Z years. Season two kicks off with quite a few interviews with founders and quite a few interviews with folks in Equity Comp Space. But I will say really quickly taking that break in December allowed me to checkout other podcasts that I'm interested in. I learn something interesting about you that I didn't know before, as long as I've known you which is that you are a fellow runner. I too am actually planning to do the Richmond Marathon this year in November. I didn't get to go last year because of COVID but I anticipate doing it this year in November.
Chris Hill: Maybe we can plan to meet up down in the capital city. You can find the Tech Money Podcast wherever you get your podcasts about leverage. Thanks so much for being here.
Malcolm Ethridge: Thanks for having me.
Chris Hill: Coming up after the break, Maria Gallagher and Jason Moser return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and on the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. Don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Welcome back to Motley Fool my name is Chris Hill here, once again with Jason Moser and Maria Gallagher. If you are just starting out investing or you know someone who's looking to get started investing, we have a free investing starter kit. It covers everything from how to set up a brokerage account to 401(k) planning to buying your first stock, and it includes 15 stocks and five ETFs that were selected by our investing team. It's free, just go to fool.com/starterkit.fool.com/starterkit, all one word, will put the URL in the show notes for this episode. Check it out.
We got an email from Tyler Cheney, he writes, ''I'm 34-years-old and I'm in a place in my career where I can invest more than I could previously. I have 47 stocks, and four ETFs that cover growth, value, dividends, tech, and the broad market. How many stocks should I have overall? I really enjoyed stock analysis as a hobby outside of work. But at this rate, I feel like I will have 100s over the next 20-30 years. Should I just amass a huge quantity and see how it goes or should I stick to a certain number or range?'' Jason, let me go to you first. We can't give specific advice, I'd like to question, I'd love to see that level of interest that you're growing in anyone out there. Great to see, so kudos to Tyler. But I understand his concern, personally, I don't think I could follow-up how many stocks?
Jason Moser: I'm with you. I mean, we're always enjoying talking about this because there's so many different answers and there's not one set correct answer. It does depend on the individual. I mean myself I own 34 different companies in my portfolio now. That's enough for me at this point to not know what is happening to any given holding on any given day, I will say that. A stock could be selling off, and I'm like none the wiser because I'm well-diversified, I just take that longer view. I feel like from that perspective I have enough. It is to the point I think I start adding more, I'm not going to really deal with closely follow-up all of them either. I mean, it's just such a tricky answer because you can certainly do very well just amassing a big collection of hundreds and hundreds of stocks through the years. In the counterargument to that is that you become a little bit more like your own little version of a fund that could ultimately drag returns down with underperformers. I think it's just always a good idea to revisit your portfolio annually and check-in on those companies that aren't performing up to your expectations because that can help you pull some of those weeds while watering some other flowers along the way.
Chris Hill: Maria, part of it comes down to the sleep factor. Like if you're losing sleep at night because you're realizing I own too many stocks and I genuinely do want to be able to follow them, there's only so much time in the day.
Maria Gallagher: I think having more than 40-50 sounds very overwhelming to me personally. What I like to do is I know that they said that they own some ETFs and I think that if you see yourself naturally going toward a certain area, a certain sector, seeing, I actually already own 15 healthcare companies, let me look at some healthcare ETFs, and then you own the ETF, then for me that's less overwhelming and so you have some of the companies you really want to follow, the ones you really want to keep up-to-date on as your personal holdings. Then you have ETFs that will diversify you in other areas of interest that you can follow a little bit more passively. I like to have a nice little balance of active and passive, but that's me personally, if you want to go up to hundreds of stocks and you think you can sleep at night and you're excited about looking at them all the time, I would think for it, but for me, I like to have a nice little balance.
Chris Hill: Let's go to our man behind-the-glass, Dan Boyd. It's time for stocks on our radar, Dan's going to hit you with a question. Jason Moser, you're up first, what are you looking at this week?
Jason Moser: Sure thing. Checking out Nvidia, ticker, NVDA, certainly a name, I don't think many members and listeners know well. I do really like this pullback from recent hires are coming off of another impressive showing at CES 2022 where they displayed a lot of really fascinating technology. Cloud gaming, really starting to gain traction represents a growing opportunity in that $300 billion gaming market opportunity. They continue to invest in the autonomous vehicle opportunity with its drive Hyperion platform. The Datacenter opportunity of course still exist and we can't forget about the metaverse. I think while we hear a lot of talk about the metaverse and what exactly it is and how companies will approach it, NVIDIA, taking the approach with its Omniverse platform. It's real-time 3D design collaboration and virtual world platform. Ultimately what they call it is the metaverse for engineers. I think there's going to be a lot of potential there in the coming years as well. On the best of all, I mean, in this world of unprofitable high fliers, Nvidia makes cash and a lot of it, they chalked up $7.2 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months. I think this pullback really does look like an opportunity to add to this winter.
Chris Hill: Dan question about Nvidia?
Dan Boyd: Absolutely. Chris, and Jason, Nvidia sounds like it has a lot going on, but in my brain, when I think Nvidia, I still think chipmaker. There's great graphics cards a lot of people will have to put in their computers. How is the semiconductor shortage really affecting this company?
Jason Moser: I mean, it's affecting all companies in the space, but I do believe it's also a situation where we're seeing the strong gets stronger. This is a business that it's got it's handled in a lot of different cookie jar. To speak, pursuing a lot of different market opportunities there, which I think is ultimately to its benefits. Hopefully, we'll see some legislation here in 2022 that eases some of that supply chain crunch. But for now, Nvidia being one of the strongest players in the space is still weathering it nicely.
Chris Hill: Maria Gallagher, what are you looking at?
Maria Gallagher: I'm assuming my time looking at Adyen, which is an over-the-counter company with ticker symbol A-D-Y-E-Y. It's a one-size-fits-all payment platform, both online, in-person payments, other services like fraud-protection. They have customers like McDonald's at the eBay. Their revenue net income has tripled since 2018. Spending more time looking at the payment space and then this company in particular is what I'm interested in.
Chris Hill: Dan, question about Adyen.
Dan Boyd: This sounds suspiciously, Maria, like a war on cash stock. Did Jason feed you this company before the show because this is really the thing that usually write-up his alley.
Maria Gallagher: Jason doesn't have a monopoly on having a war on cash basket. I think he's interested.
Dan Boyd: I'm sorry.
Chris Hill: Dan, what do you want to add to your watch list?
Dan Boyd: I'm already in Nvidia shareholders. I'm going to go with Adyen because I don't know much about the company and its piqued my interest.
Jason Moser: That's great, you pick my idea.
Chris Hill: Jason Moser, and Maria Gallagher, thanks for being here.
Maria Gallagher: Thanks for having us.
Chris Hill: That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money radio show. Show's mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Chris Hill. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next time.

2022-01-26 00:00:00+00:00,4 Top Consumer Tech Stocks For February 2022,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-top-consumer-tech-stocks-for-february-2022,,,"4 Top Consumer Tech Stocks To Add To Your Watchlist Right Now
Consumer tech stocks have gotten off to a rough start this year. For instance, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is down more than 10% year to date. While buying these growth stocks in the stock market today could be a risky endeavor, the opportunists see sell-offs as a great opportunity to buy shares at discounts. And it seems that they are hard at work today seeing that major indexes are attempting a recovery.
Tech stocks in particular have been under pressure amid rising bond yields. There’s no question that tech stocks are suffering in the past few months. The good news is, this downturn won’t last forever. Due to the broad sell-off we’ve seen recently, one may be able to find bargains in the tech space. Of course, trying to time the market may not be easy. But buying companies with strong fundamentals could prove to be lucrative if you plan to hold them over the long term.   
Speaking of quality companies, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) certainly fits the bill. The company was in the news lately with its announcement that it will acquire Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) for $68.7 billion. Such a mega deal will undoubtedly help Microsoft expand on their gaming front. What’s more, the software company also reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings for the quarter after the closing bell on Tuesday. With all that in mind, would you be looking at these consumer tech stocks in the stock market right now?

Logitech International S.A (NASDAQ: LOGI)
American Express Company (NYSE: AXP)
eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY)
Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: FB)
Logitech 
Logitech makes computer peripherals such as mice, keyboards, webcams, and gamepads. The company sells its products through a network of distributors. Besides that, it sells through retailers under brand names including Logitech, ASTRO Gaming, Streamlabs, Ultimate Ears, and Jaybird. LOGI stock is rose up by over 6% in the pre-market trading and closed Wednesday up 2.42% at $79.66 a share. This comes following its fiscal Q3 earnings release yesterday. 
Getting into it, sales were $1.63 billion, down 2% from the prior year. However, this performance nearly sustains last year’s record Q3 earning which grew 85%. The company also reported strong growth in their Pointing Devices, Keyboards & Combos, and Gaming categories. Furthermore, it also raised its annual outlook to between 2% and 5% sales growth, and between $850 and $900 million in non-GAAP operating income. The company’s previous outlook was flat sales growth and $800 to $850 million in non-GAAP operating income. 
Overall, the results exceeded the company’s expectations. CEO Bracken Darrell said that the results may have been stronger without the ongoing supply chain challenges which caused the company to lose several points of growth. With Logitech going into 2022 with a positive outlook, would you be buying LOGI stock?

eBay
eBay is a global e-commerce company that provides an online auction and shopping website. For the most part, this helps people and businesses buy and sell a wide variety of goods and services worldwide. On top of that, its platform is accessible in more than 190 markets worldwide, connecting millions of buyers and sellers. Its platform is accessible through a computer or smartphone.
Just yesterday, eBay said it is expanding its services to include authenticating valuable trading cards. The service will now be available to authenticate cards worth at least $750 from collectible card games including sports and non-sports cards. It also plans to expand this to include graded, autograph, and patch cards by the middle of this year. All in all, this expansion will broaden eBay’s ability to guarantee the authenticity of high-value items. 
In late November, the company acquired Sneaker Con, a sneaker authentication business. In short, Sneaker Con vets and verifies sneakers bought on eBay to avoid the buying and selling of counterfeit goods. This would improve user experience by bringing a higher level of trust and confidence to every transaction. All things considered, will you be adding EBAY stock to your watchlist ahead of its quarterly earnings on February 1?

With the metaverse making headlines in recent months, one of the notable players would be Meta Platforms.

That builds on its existing portfolio of social media platforms used by billions around the world. These include the likes Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. It also owns Oculus, a virtual reality headset producer. 
On Monday, the company said that its research team has built a new artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer. The team thinks that this supercomputer will be the fastest in the world when it is completed in mid-2022. The supercomputer, named the AI Research SuperCluster, is the culmination of almost two years’ worth of work. Meta’s AI and infrastructure teams, as well researchers from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Penguin Computing, and Pure Storage (NYSE: PSTG) were involved in the project. 
According to the research team, the supercomputer is being used to train AI models in natural-language processing and computer vision for research. Notably, it aims to boost capabilities to train models with data sets as large as an exabyte, or roughly 36,000 years of high-quality video. Given Meta’s developments, is FB stock worth considering?

Asit Sharma: This is an article that our colleague, ProShopGuy, Mike McMahon, had tweeted out. It's called, why eBay's AI Chief is setting guardrails for use of low-code AI. eBay is stepping into the AI space in a big way. They've been working with machine-learning for years, Demitri, in trying to get their products placed better when you visit the site, so they're not alone in this endeavor. But eBay's push into AI even extends into having merchants on its platform use a little bit of AI in their systems. They're spending a lot of AI through their organization. They hired a new Chief AI Officer. I guess maybe that's CAIO, I wonder what the abbreviation is. [inaudible 05:16:17] that in the executive suite.
His name is Nitzan Mekel-Bobrov. It's a very interesting article. It's in a publication called Protocol. Mekel-Bobrov makes one important point that I really loved, had occurred to me as such. But he says, when you update software, you can plan to update it at some point in time when your needs change, when maybe a customer has a need or you're doing maintenance, you can take code, you can optimize it, replace it, but AI isn't like that. He sees a problem in that much of society is looking at AI, artificial intelligence, as just another piece of software code. The nugget or insight that I loved was that AI is something that reacts to the world. It watches what's going on in the world and it reacts to it. His code is with AI, the piece of software could be performing correctly, but you need to monitor it because the world changes and it's reacting to the world.
Not so with other types of software which are really updated at a time of your choosing, unless you have a bug or need to jump in before scheduled update. AI is always reacting to data. It's reacting to things that change. The same way we see this in larger systems. We see it already in the products we use. For example, my Spotify, if I start switching from my Turkey songs to my Brazilian songs, it wants to show me a lot of Brazilian music. If I switch to jazz music, suddenly I'm seeing a lot of Charlie Parker in my feed. Shout out to our producer Adam Lanphier, who happens to be a jazz saxophonist. Actually, he sent me some pictures of all of his horns, which I had to admire because it took me back to a time when tenor saxophoners used to play a lot of instruments.
They play the flute, they pick up the soprano horn, they pick up the base clarinet. I think Adam had most of these in some recorders, still have to ask him offline. Otherwise, I'll keep talking about that. But kudos to him. This is something that we need to pay attention to as a society. What eBay is doing is putting up some guardrails around low-code AI that they are allowing employees in their company to use. If their software team develops some helpful modules, I'm guessing this is an internal bought, you see this in a lot of companies.
They're putting some guardrails on how a department can request and use that AI, and they are being very careful about the distribution of that to merchants and users on their platform. I really like this. I think this is the thing we've been talking about and arguing about. I know we've argued so much because most of us seemed to have the same opinion that AI is very powerful, but it needs some healthy regulation. Thoughts on this, Demitri. I thought this is a great short article, the publication's called Protocol. I think more companies would do well to adopt some type of a posture like this as they're implementing AI and ML code throughout their organizations.
Demitri Kalogeropoulos: Yeah. I'm still mystified by how that works, the whole AI software idea. I think I'm like a lot of people, when I picture AI, I picture a robot or something like that or robotic expression of it. It's a little hard and I'd love to maybe just see that in action because I know so many companies are just using AI all throughout their ITs, their platforms, and their software.
But I thought that was interesting, that little part you talked about in the article. Plus a little bit later down there, this guy says that a mistake a lot of companies are making is just, like you said, installing and then treating it like software, just letting it go. He says, I don't want to say living, but you want to treat it more like a living thing. It's constantly changing and evolving, and it needs to be monitored. I think that's pretty amazing, but also scary to think about that idea. You get the software running all the way through your system that you can't trust to be completely the same. I mean, it's entire job is to change and learn, so it's going to be different, so you got to watch it.
Sharma: Brings some of those famous two words from, I think Frankenstein, ""It's alive.""

2022-01-25 00:00:00+00:00,eBay is Oversold,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-is-oversold,,,"The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.
But making eBay Inc. an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Tuesday, shares of EBAY entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $57.02 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of eBay Inc., the RSI reading has hit 25.1 — by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel currently has an average RSI of 39.5. A falling stock price — all else being equal — creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, EBAY's recent annualized dividend of 0.72/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 1.21% based upon the recent $59.66 share price.
A bullish investor could look at EBAY's 25.1 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on EBAY is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.
