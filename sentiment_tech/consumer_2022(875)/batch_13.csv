2022-06-23 00:00:00+00:00,"Bull of the Day: Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR)",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bull-of-the-day%3A-dollar-tree-inc.-dltr,,,"Consumer sentiment is tumbling as people stare at sky-high gas prices and grocery bills. Inflation remains at 40-year highs and many consumers are already cutting back on major expenses and looking for savings anywhere they can.
Discount retail standout Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR has grown during an array of economic environments and it’s poised to thrive as more Americans tighten their purse strings. Dollar Tree posted solid first quarter growth in late May and upped its guidance in the face of all of the broader economic headwinds.
DLTR Basics
Dollar Tree is a discount retailer that operates over 15,500 stores across much of the U.S. and Canada, including its namesake locations, Family Dollar, and newer combo stores. The retailer’s dollar-focused name until recently showed up exactly in its price points, with everything at Dollar Tree stores priced at $1.
Dollar Tree announced last November that it was raising its prices for the first time in company history. Dollar Tree slowly began to implement its new $1.25 price points. DLTR said in March that it completed its new price-point rollout at all U.S. Dollar Tree stores a full two months ahead of schedule.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Many on Wall Street initially speculated that Dollar Tree’s new higher prices were made in response to inflation. However, the company’s executive team said the move was made after roughly 35 years at the $1 price point in order to expand its offerings and sell a far wider range of merchandise to customers.
Meanwhile, its Family Dollar stores sell many items at the $1 price point, along with a broader array of offerings under $10. Dollar Tree also said in March that it saw strong performances in other newer areas, including the expansion of its “$3 and $5 Plus assortment in Dollar Tree stores, as well as our Combo Stores and H2 Renovations at Family Dollar.”
Dollar Tree operates smaller format stores compared to the likes of Target TGT and Walmart WMT and it has been aggressively expanding its brick-and-mortar footprint. DLTR opened 112 new stores during its first quarter ended on April 30, while also completing numerous renovations and rolling out its multi-price “Plus” offering into an additional 790 Dollar Tree stores.

Recent Growth and Outlook
Dollar Tree has grown its revenue rather steadily for decades and its sales soared after it purchased Family Dollar in 2015. DLTR’s sales climbed 3% last year and 8% in FY20, while its adjusted earnings popped 2.7% in fiscal 2021. Most recently, DLTR topped our Q1 FY22 EPS and sales estimates on May 26 and raised its guidance.
The company’s new higher prices appear to be showing up on both the bottom and top lines, with Dollar Tree’s adjusted Q1 EPS up 48% YoY. Meanwhile, its revenue climbed 6.5% to $6.9 billion, with same-store Dollar Tree sales up +11.2%.
Dollar Tree has now topped our quarterly EPS estimates by an average of 13% in the trailing four periods, and its FY22 consensus estimate is up 3% since its release, with FY23 5.5% higher. These positive bottom-line revisions came in the face of slowing overall consumer sentiment, rising inflation, and lower guidance from many companies across an array of industries.
Zacks estimates call for Dollar Tree’s revenue to climb 6.7% in 2022 and another 6% in 2023 to reach $29.76 billion. At the bottom end, its adjusted earnings are projected to surge 41% this year and 14.4% next year.

Bottom Line
Dollar Tree shares have soared 970% in the past 15 years to crush its discount retail industry’s 500% and blow away the broader retail-wholesale market’s 207%.
The company has also been a standout since last fall, with DLTR up 53% in the last 12 months vs. its sector’s 34% downturn. This run includes an 11% jump in 2022, which is rather impressive with the market down over 20%.
Investors should note that DLTR stock tumbled after Target’s brutal guidance in mid-May, only to skyrocket back after its own quarterly results and guidance showcased strength amid changing shopping patterns. Dollar Tree closed regular trading Wednesday at $155 per share or roughly 12% below its records.
In terms of valuation, Dollar Tree trades at a 16% discount to its industry at 18.2X forward 12-month earnings and 23% below its own highs over the past 10 years. Dollar Tree also boasts a solid balance sheet, and it’s committed to long-term expansion within a segment of the retail sector that’s never going out of style.
Dollar Tree’s strong earnings revisions activity helps it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. And investors might want to consider the firm for its ability to expand during an inflationary environment as people look to save money wherever they can. Plus, its new $1.25 price point is set to boost its earnings and revenue growth over the long haul.

Thanks to its value-creating initiatives, defensive product mix and real estate growth strategy, the company has the capability to gain market share. Its commitment to better pricing, private label offerings, effective inventory management and merchandise initiative should drive sales. The company’s everyday low-price model is attracting customers who have been seeking both value and convenience amid soaring inflation.
Customer-Oriented Efforts
Dollar General’s initiatives such as DG Fresh, Fast Track, non-consumables, digitization and private fleet should benefit the top line. The company has been sparing no effort to bolster omni-channel operations and ramp up delivery services to provide customers with a frictionless shopping experience. Its partnership with DoorDash continues to yield results with same-day delivery, now available at 11,000 stores at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2022.

Talking about the company’s transformational initiatives, DG Fresh is designed to enable self-distribution of fresh and frozen products, while Fast Track aims at increasing labor productivity in stores, enhancing customer convenience and improving on-shelf availability.

Under DG Fresh, the company has been expanding its cooler facilities to enhance the sale of perishable items. During the first quarter, the company installed more than 17,000 cooler doors across its store base and plans to install more than 65,000 cooler doors in fiscal 2022. The company completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain and is now delivering to more than 18,000 stores from 12 facilities.

With respect to Fast Track, the company has been expanding its self-checkout facility, which was available in more than 8,000 stores at the end of the first quarter. The company plans to expand this offering to a total of up to 11,000 stores by the end of the current fiscal year. Additionally, the non-consumable initiative offering was available in over 13,000 stores. The company plans to complete the rollout of the non-consumable initiative offering across the entire chain by the end of fiscal 2022.

Store Growth Plans
Dollar General has been making prudent investments relating to store infrastructure, store openings, expansions, remodels and relocations to drive revenues. The company opened 239 new stores, remodeled 532 stores, and relocated 32 stores in the first quarter.

The company anticipates carrying out 2,980 real estate projects, including 1,110 store openings, 1,750 remodels and 120 store relocations in fiscal 2022. This includes a plan to open up to 10 stores in Mexico by the end of fiscal 2022.

In the first quarter, the company opened 11 new pOpshelf locations, which took the total count to 66. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, the company had a total of 25 store-within-a-store concept, a smaller pOpshelf store in Dollar General’s larger format stores. Management reaffirmed its plan to nearly triple the pOpshelf store count and open up an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts, which would result in more than 150 stand-alone pOpshelf locations and a total of approximately 50 store-within-a-store concepts by the end of fiscal 2022. The company is targeting approximately 1,000 pOpshelf stores by the end of fiscal 2025.
Wrapping Up
Dollar General’s differentiated product range resonates well with customers’ spending habits. The company is making every effort to enhance guests’ experience via unique store concepts, affordable and convenient assortment, and other innovations.

Management anticipates net sales growth of about 10-10.5% — including an estimated benefit of approximately two percentage points from the 53rd week — for fiscal 2022. The company foresees same-store sales growth of approximately 3-3.5%. It envisions earnings per share growth to be 12-14%, including an estimated benefit of approximately four percentage points from the 53rd week.

The company has also been a standout since last fall, with DLTR up 53% in the last 12 months vs. its sector's 34% downturn. This run includes an 11% jump in 2022, which is rather impressive with the market down over 20%.
Investors should note that DLTR stock tumbled after Target's brutal guidance in mid-May, only to skyrocket back after its own quarterly results and guidance showcased strength amid changing shopping patterns. Dollar Tree closed regular trading Wednesday at $155 per share or roughly 12% below its records.
In terms of valuation, Dollar Tree trades at a 16% discount to its industry at 18.2X forward 12-month earnings and 23% below its own highs over the past 10 years. Dollar Tree also boasts a solid balance sheet, and it's committed to long-term expansion within a segment of the retail sector that's never going out of style.
Dollar Tree's strong earnings revisions activity helps it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. And investors might want to consider the firm for its ability to expand during an inflationary environment as people look to save money wherever they can. Plus, its new $1.25 price point is set to boost its earnings and revenue growth over the long haul.
Bear of the Day:
Best Buy Co., Inc. faces a quickly changing consumer spending environment and rising inflation. The broad-based economic tailwinds that helped Best Buy post back-to-back big years of impressive growth are coming to an end, as the housing market cools and people start spending less on big-ticket items. 
Pandemic-Style Shopping Slows
Best Buy sells smartphones, TVs, connected appliances, and nearly every other consumer electronics device under the sun. Best Buy has grown even though Target, Walmart and other giants sell similar products. The company, like everyone else, has spent years improving its digital commerce offerings.
Best Buy's core business and its e-commerce efforts helped it thrive when people began to work from home and spent big on items to fill new homes. Best Buy also benefited from stimulus checks and pandemic rebound shopping sprees. And its long-term outlook remains intact. But consumers are shifting their spending to services and other areas of retail, while also slowing big purchases amid soaring inflation and recession fears.
Best Buy's sales climbed over 8% during 2020 (its FY21), with FY22 revenue up 9.5%. But the firm's fourth quarter sales slipped over 3% and its first quarter FY23 revenue dipped 9% on the back changing spending habits and tough-to-compete against periods.
The electronics retailer fell short of Zacks Q1 estimates on May 24. Best Buy management lowered its guidance, with its FY23 and FY24 consensus EPS estimates down 3.3% and 3.9%, respectively.
Zacks estimates call for BBY's revenue to slip over 5% this year, with its adjusted earnings projected to fall 13%. ""Macro conditions worsened since we provided our guidance in early March... Those trends have continued into Q2 and, as a result, we are revising our sales and profitability expectations for the year,"" CEO Corie Barry said in prepared remarks.
Bottom Line
Best Buy's downward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. The company is also part of the Consumer Electronics industry which is in the bottom 3% of over 250 Zacks industries right now. BBY shares have tumbled 31% in 2022 to lag its industry and the broader retail market.
Best Buy stock is still up 26% in the past five years to roughly match the Zacks Retail-Wholesale Market. And the fall has made its dividend yield stronger. Still, it might be best to stay away from Best Buy stock with consumer sentiment at historic lows and shoppers focused on other areas of retail, as well as services.

Markets Marginally Lower After Powell Talk; KBH Beats on Q2
Market indices yesterday slid into the close, but practically hugged the zero-balance for most of the last half-hour of trading. In any case, we finished much more admirably than we began: the Dow was -48 points, -0.16% on the day, the Nasdaq was -0.15% and the S&P 500 -0.13%. The small-cap Russell 2000 took up the rear, but again, only marginally: -0.22%.
Is it good news? Fed Chair Jay Powell found himself accentuating the positives in the U.S. economy this morning before the Senate Banking Committee, in which he told the panel the U.S. banking industry is ""very strong,"" that the Fed understands the full extent of inflation challenges, and that it's not too late to bring inflation under control. These all proved to be a decent salve for market participants, at least for a short while.
Powell did not suggest the size of the next rate hike, but did tell senators to expect more raises in the near term. (The next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee [FOMC] is scheduled for July 26th and 27th.) The Fed Chair continued to speak about optimum inflation being 2%, and that the FOMC was committed to bringing inflation down to that level. Thus far, no moving the goalposts on ""optimum inflation.""
Economic data picks up next week and the week after that, and from there we'll dovetail into the heart of Q2 earnings season. This ought to give plenty of grist for the mill to the Fed to make informed choices. The next CPI report, for instance — that of the +8.6% ""inflation metric heard 'round the world"" last time around — comes three weeks from yesterday.
After yesterday's closing bell, we did see Q2 earnings for KB Home, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated homebuilder ahead of the numbers. Earnings and sales surprised to the upside in the quarter: $2.32 per share came in well ahead of the $1.97 in the Zacks consensus, on revenues of $1.72 billion compared to the $1.61 billion expected.
The median price of a newly built home in the quarter by KB Home grew +21% to $494,300, which is a reflection of the robust strength in Housing (at least before the Fed began raising interest rates more than a quarter-percent). The company does see its sales rate moderating going forward, but total sales expectations are higher for next quarter.
Shares were up +1.9% on the news in late trading. KB Home has only missed earnings estimates twice in the past five years (one of those times was the previous quarter), but its stock price is still nearly -19% in the past month alone; -39% year to date.

2022-06-22 00:00:00+00:00,4 Stocks to Buy as In-Store Retail Sales Gather Steam,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-stocks-to-buy-as-in-store-retail-sales-gather-steam,,,"U.S. e-commerce sales have slowed down substantially this year. A major reason behind this is people visiting brick-and-mortar stores, which have seen steady growth in in-store purchases over the past few months.
E-commerce had played a major role in saving the retail sector during the peak of the pandemic but people are a lot more confident now and have once again started going back to the traditional mode of shopping. Given this scenario, retail stocks with a strong offline presence like Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR, Canada Goose Holdings Inc. GOOS, Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. BOOT and J.Jill Inc. JILL are likely to benefit once again.
In-Store Sales Gather Pace
According to a new survey by 5WPR, 52% of the respondents said they would visit a physical store to find a product rather than searching and buying it online. Similarly, 72% of the people prefer eating out to ordering food online. This is one reason why despite the retail sales decline in May, sales at U.S. bars and restaurants jumped 0.7% month over month.
E-commerce had played a major role in saving the retail sector from a total collapse during the pandemic, with millions staying home and shopping online as physical stores remained closed. This saw online sales hit record highs throughout 2020 and 2021.
However, the love for brick-and-mortar stores started coming back as the economy started opening last year. Even then, many preferred shopping online as the Omicron and Delta variants of the coronavirus made them skeptical of visiting physical stores. 
This year, things seem to have changed again. Although e-commerce has been playing a key role in supporting the retail sector, online sales have been declining, while in-store sales have been on the rise.
Retailers Depend on In-Store Sales
Although online shopping gained popularity during the pandemic, customers still prefer shopping at brick-and-mortar stores. This has seen several retailers opening new stores as the economy continues to reopen.
According to a report from Forrester, brick-and-mortar stores are projected to account for 72% of total retail sales in 2024.
Several retailers like DICK’s House of Sport, a wing of DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS are also trying to innovate by introducing additional space within the store where customers can try out new equipment. 
Also, many retailers believe that online stores are an extension of brick-and-mortar stores and are introducing services like buy online, pick up in store or buy online, return to store. E-commerce is going to stay because people have finally realized its benefits but that is unlikely to hamper in-store sales.
This is the reason why traffic and sales at brick-and-mortar stores are once again growing. The Commerce Department said last month that online sales grew a meager 2.4% in the first quarter of 2022 after a great 2020.

2022-06-21 00:00:00+00:00,3 Dividend Stocks You Can Safely Hold for Decades,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dividend-stocks-you-can-safely-hold-for-decades-2,,,"When the market heads toward the bear, investors tend to look for safe stocks that they can set and forget. That's a good strategy, and you only need to take a look at how growth stocks have been faring over the past few months to see that play out in reality.
Dividend stocks are often some of the safest stocks you'll find. They're typically mature and established with demonstrated capabilities to grow. They also provide income. Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Realty Income (NYSE: O), and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) are three of the best dividend stocks to hold forever.
More dominant than ever and still growing
Coca-Cola has emerged from the pandemic as a more efficient, better-focused company, and it's stronger than ever. The pandemic exposed its vulnerable away-from-home category, and it met the challenge by strengthening its unparalleled distribution system and stepping up its at-home category. Now that the stay-at-home phase has mostly passed, the company is seeing volume increases across the board and rising sales despite inflation.
Perhaps the biggest change the company made during the pandemic was slashing its brand assortment from 400 to 200. Don't worry, you won't see the demise of your favorite drinks. Most of the 200 labels that got cut were small, local names that diverted resources from the core beverages that make up the vast majority of sales. They accounted for less than 2% of volume and even less of sales. That gives the company more leverage to innovate within its top brands and see higher returns on investments.
Within its new strategy, Coca-Cola has 1,500 initiatives set up for 2022, and it's ramping up its data collection and usage to identify top opportunities. For one thing, the soft-drink giant is expanding its digital program and direct-to-consumer platform, and says it has only a 6% share in developing markets, which account for 80% of the global population. As massive as Coke seems, it's not taking its dominant position for granted and sees huge ways to grow.
Coca-Cola is one of the safest dividend stocks on the market, having raised its dividend annually for 60 years, including when sales were declining at the beginning of the pandemic. Its dividend yields just under 3% at the current price, which is slightly below its average. That's because the stock price has gained as investors recognize the stock's resilience.
Steady monthly dividends
Realty Income isn't the highest-yielding real estate investment trust (REIT) you can buy, but it might be the safest. Its yield is far from shabby -- 4.6% at the current price -- and it's increased its dividend for 99 consecutive quarters. What's most unique about Realty Income is that it pays a dividend monthly, which translates into monthly income for shareholders.
The company is a retail REIT, which means it owns properties that it leases to retailers. In Realty Income's case, it's a super-secure investment because it leases to well-established essentials retailers and it has long-term leases with these companies. Its top-five tenants are Walgreens, 7-Eleven, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, and FedEx. Grocery stores make up more than 10% of its tenants, with convenience stores another 9%. Its occupancy rates have held near 100% for the past 30 years, and its leases have a weighted average of nearly nine years remaining.
Realty Income operates a triple net lease model, which means it's not responsible for daily operations on the property. Tenants get a better deal because they're responsible for more, but Realty Income benefits by freeing up its resources for core activities, and tenants typically sign long-term agreements (usually more than 10 years) for generous terms.
Realty Income is one of the largest REITs in the world with more than 11,000 properties -- and still growing. It's a no-brainer REIT to own for secure and high-yielding dividends.
Where America goes for home improvement
Home Depot remains the top destination for home improvement, and despite outsized growth in the early stages of the pandemic, it has continued to post increases in comparative-stores sales (or comps) every quarter since. So far, it's performing better than expected in 2022, and it raised its full-year guidance after the first quarter.
It's the largest U.S. home retailing chain by store count with more than 2,300 locations across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. First-quarter sales came in at a record $39 billion, a 3.8% year-over-year increase, and earnings per share were $4.09, a 6% increase over last year despite inflation and rising costs.
Part of its success has been due to its embrace of digital and its investments in its digital capabilities over the past few years. The company revamped its e-commerce program prior to the pandemic, which created short-term pressure and wasn't popular with investors. But that proved to be a prescient move which opened up the floodgates when customers stayed at home.
Over the past two years, it's also upped its distribution capabilities, better placing it to handle shipping and delivery even as the supply chain choked up. These are all reasons why the company is poised to keep the system flowing and manage customer demand in an environment that's still pressured.
Home Depot stock gained 73% over the past five years, outperforming the S&P 500. It also pays a dividend that yields 2.8%, and investors can expect more gains and dividend increases for years to come.

2022-06-21 00:00:00+00:00,"Costco's (COST) Business Model, Pricing Power Are Key Strengths",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/costcos-cost-business-model-pricing-power-are-key-strengths,,,"Costco Wholesale Corporation COST continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers based on the expanse and quality of merchandise offered. The company's distinctive membership business model and pricing power set it apart from the traditional players. Amid the surging inflation, low-to-middle income consumers have preferred discount stores over conventional retailers.

This Issaquah WA-based company, stands to benefit from its ability to draw traffic via strategic pricing, a robust membership model and increasing penetration of e-commerce business. Cumulatively, these factors have been aiding Costco in registering impressive sales numbers.

Net sales increased 16.9% to $18.23 billion for the retail month of May, the four-week period ended May 29, 2022, from $15.59 billion in the last year. This followed an increase of 13.9% in April and 18.7% in March. Impressively, comparable sales for the retail month of May jumped 15.5%. This followed increases of 12.6% and 17.2% in April and March, respectively.
 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Costco has been rapidly adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience. To drive its online sales, the company launched grocery delivery services in collaboration with Uber Technologies in July 2021. This allows members to get their on-demand groceries delivered within hours through Uber and Uber Eats mobile apps. Also, Costco’s acquisition of Innovel Solutions, a leading provider of third-party end-to-end logistics solutions — now called Costco Logistics, has boosted its e-commerce capabilities and enabled it to sell ""big and bulky"" items.

The company has been gradually expanding its e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. We note that comparable e-commerce sales rose 6.3% in May. This followed increases of 5.7% and 8.9% in April and March, respectively.
Wrapping Up
Costco is focused on ramping up investments in the wake of rising competition. We believe that its business model, as well as its commitment toward opening membership warehouses, and providing convenient and affordable ways to shop, will continue to drive traffic and, in turn, revenues. Shares of this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) player have appreciated 13.9% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 8.7%.
3 Stocks Looking Red Hot
We have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Dollar Tree DLTR, Sysco Corporation SYY and United Natural Foods UNFI.

Dollar Tree, which operates discount variety retail stores, carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. DLTR has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13.1%, on average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dollar Tree’s current financial-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 6.7% and 40.5%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers. DLTR has an expected EPS growth rate of 15.5% for three-five years.

Sysco Corporation, which is engaged in the marketing and distribution of various food and related products, sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.1%, on average.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sysco Corporation’s current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 32.6% and 124.3%, respectively, from the year-ago period. SYY has an expected EPS growth rate of 11% for three-five years.

United Natural Foods, one of the premier grocery wholesalers delivering the widest variety of fresh, branded, and owned brand products, carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. UNFI has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 29.9%, on average.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for United Natural Foods’s current financial-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 7.2% and 4.9%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Chicago, IL – June 21, 2022 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Baidu BIDU, Dollar Tree DLTR and Dell Technologies DELL.
Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:
Central Banks Will Still Drive Stocks: Global Week Ahead
The Global Week Ahead gets dominated by central banks, for a 2nd week in a row.
Forget S&P 500 earnings estimates for the time being. Financial market trading has been fully tied to fresh key macro data and macro-driven policy events these days.
On Monday, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) offers up an interest rate decision.
On Wednesday, Fed Chair Powell speaks to the Senate Banking Committee.
Next in importance, any details on the European Central Bank's (ECB) plan to prevent rate hikes from hurting weaker Euro Area economies. That will be of interest to traders.
In emerging markets, there's no let-up in rate-hike fever:
· - Expect central banks in Indonesia and Mexico to raise rates.
· - Egypt and the Czech Republic central banks are up to bat, too.
· - One major outlier here dismisses a need for tightening: Turkey. That central bank updates Thursday.

Of all the major developed countries' central banks which until recently dismissed consumer price inflation as transitory, one still stands out: the Bank of Japan.
But Reuters writes that it is increasingly being challenged by hedge funds, which are betting it can't hold the line on super-loose policy forever.
Next are Reuters' five world market themes, reordered for equity traders:
(1) Wednesday, Fed Chair Powell testifies before the Senate Banking Committee
Fresh off the Federal Reserve's biggest rate hike in nearly three decades, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be in the spotlight on Wednesday when he testifies before the Senate Banking Committee.
Blistering inflation forced the Fed to raise interest rates by 75 basis points on June 15 and flag a faster rate-rise path. But it also projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment, highlighting a tricky balancing act ahead.
The testimony will allow Powell to hammer home his determination to quell inflation.
But with the S&P 500 down -20% from January record highs and other asset prices also falling, he may be quizzed for details on how the Fed can tame inflation without causing too many ructions in the economy and markets.
(2) Last week, the European Central Bank promised added support. Of what type?
The ECB is promising additional support for the euro bloc's indebted southern rim, looking to calm the angst caused by its policy tightening plans.
So far, all we know is that the new scheme may attach some loose conditions. Investors, keen to find out what shape and form the tool might take, will be on the prowl for clues.
Bond markets reacted with relief to the ECB's plan. But investors are an impatient bunch and could soon test its resolve to contain bond market strains.
Having had to reverse course just six days after failing to reassure markets it would keep borrowing costs in check, ECB officials know the clock is ticking.
(3) Thursday, Turkey's central bank meets. A big southern Europe crisis brewing?
Policymakers at Turkey's central bank will meet on Thursday to debate where interest rates will go. The answer, though, is already known: nowhere. That means pressure on the lira will increase further.
Despite shrinking FX reserves and inflation above 70%, interest rates are stuck at 14%, due to President Tayyip Erdogan's push for lower rates.
Instead, a number of measures — widely seen as failing to address the core problem of soaring inflation — have been introduced to shield locals from the fallout of a currency that has lost some 90% of its value in the past decade.
But in other emerging markets, central banks are not dithering:
· - On Wednesday, Czech rates could rise 100 bps
· - Indonesia may kick off its tightening cycle on Thursday
· - Later that day, Mexico could raise rates by 75 bps while
· - Egypt may continue hiking after last month's 200 bps move

(4) Thursday, a number of advance June purchasing manager indices (PMIs) land
Advance readings of June purchasing managers' indexes (PMIs), due on Thursday, will make for interesting content, showing how businesses coped with this month's surge in the cost of capital and a souring in consumer sentiment.
So far this year, European and U.S. PMIs have held above the 50 mark, while Chinese zero-COVID policies dragged Asia into contraction.
Now, though, European and U.S. PMIs are going the other way, as higher borrowing costs bite. Economists polled by Reuters expect June PMIs to show further modest weakening.
PMI watchers might choose to train their sights on Asia, where readings nudged higher in May and may do so again this month, as swathes of China emerged from lockdowns and authorities stepped up investment.
And Chinese PMIs' return to expansionary territory would be a bonus for the global economy.
(5) Japan's macro data will inform the BoJ, FX and equity markets
The Bank of Japan has defied the direction of monetary policy globally, sticking with ultra-easy settings and a vow to buy 10-year bonds every day to anchor borrowing costs.
The result is a sliding yen, a yield curve that's being bent out of shape and a bond market almost buckling in the tussle between hedge funds and policymakers.
Meanwhile, Japanese living costs are rising and as July mid-term elections approach, the BOJ may face political pressure to tone down its efforts to raise inflation.
That could intensify if inflation data due on Friday shows above-target price growth for a second month in a row.
Top Zacks #1 Rank Stocks
Oil & Gas companies continue to dominate our #1 list. But I am bored with that.
Here is what else I found.
(1) Baidu: Yes. The big mainland China internet search name.
I see a $137 share price and a $47.5B market cap. The Zacks Value score is C, the Zacks Growth score is D and the Zacks Momentum score is C.
(2) Dollar Tree: Hmmm. A deep discount U.S. retail store made our #1 list.
I see a $151 share price and a market cap of $33.9B. The Zacks Value score is D, the Zacks Growth score is B and the Zacks Momentum score is D.
(3) Dell Technologies: The PC supplier made the #1 list too, though their narrative is now that they are an Info Tech solutions provider. The company's operating segment consists of Client Solutions, the Enterprise Solutions Group and the Dell Software Group.
I see a $46 share price and a $33.9M market cap. The Zacks Value score is A, the Zacks Growth score is B and the Zacks Momentum score is D.
I found this interesting: Tech sector stocks in the USA offer investors great value. Now.
The Nasdaq did lead us down.
Nasdaq's forward P/E got slashed -41% from its recent peak. That is similar to the tech stock drawdown seen during the Sept. 2008 meltdown.
Back then, the tech stock down draft did not end there. Nasdaq share values went down another -10%.
Is this time different?

2022-06-19 00:00:00+00:00,Some shoppers balk at retailers peddling new 'Juneteenth' merchandise,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/some-shoppers-balk-at-retailers-peddling-new-juneteenth-merchandise,,,"By Arriana McLymore
NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) - Clothing retailer Kohl's KSS.N is offering gray, green and red ""Juneteenth 1865"" tank tops and t-shirts for juniors and boys for $23.99. JCPenney.com hopes to lure shoppers with dozens of wall hangings featuring abstract graphic designs and silhouettes of Black women, priced at $60 to $160 apiece.
In the first big push to commercialize Juneteenth, commemorated by Black people for generations as the day in 1865 when a Union general informed a group of enslaved people in Texas that they were free, a handful of major retailers are rolling out merchandise.
But some of the goods, from cotton tank tops with red, yellow and green U.S. flags, to lawn accessories featuring slogans such as ""Freedom,"" are raising eyebrows among shoppers who accuse retailers of exploiting Juneteenth to cash in on President Joe Biden making June 19 a federal holiday in 2021.
In May, Walmart WMT.N began marketing pints of a new ""Celebrated Edition"" red velvet and cheesecake Juneteenth Ice Cream until complaints surfaced on Twitter, prompting Walmart to remove it.
""Just saw Pride and Juneteenth ice cream at Walmart I think we're in the bad place,"" one Twitter user posted on June 11.
Walmart said in a statement in May that the retailer had ""received feedback that a few items caused concern for some of our customers."" The retailer apologized and said it will remove items as appropriate.
Walmart.com also sells an array of children's books on the history of Juneteenth, as well as dozens of t-shirts.
Dollar Tree DLTR.O also drew criticism on social media for selling Juneteenth party decorations in non-traditional colors in May. The decorations are manufactured by vendors who aren't descendants of slaves themselves, according to the National Assembly of American Slavery Descendants, an advocacy group that supports reparations for Black American descendants of slavery. Dollar Tree did not immediately return an email seeking comment.
PROMOTE BLACK VENDORS
Connie Ross, vice president and chair of diversity, equity and inclusion at Empower consultancy, said Walmart and other brands should use the holiday to promote Black vendors.
""Juneteenth was not born out of a pretty story, but give it time, and people are going to find a way to associate it with something positive,"" Ross said.
Ross expects more companies to ""soften"" the meaning of Juneteenth by avoiding its connections to the history of slavery.
Liz Rogers, a Black founder of Creamalicious ice creams which are sold in Walmart, Target TGT.N and Kroger KR.N, said that none of her retail customers contacted her for Juneteenth partnerships or events and that she often has to pitch companies to get on their shelves.
JCPenney's Chief Merchandising Officer Michelle Wlazlo said the company is donating any net profits from the sales of its Juneteenth merchandise to Unity Unlimited, a non-profit that says it helps communities ""overcome racial and cultural division."" Wlazlo said JCPenney looks at customer feedback, traditional retail holidays and other factors to determine promotional events.
Brian Packer of public relations agency Golin said that brands looking to tap into Juneteenth should find ways to elevate products and services made by people in those communities. He said it is more complex than ""putting a Black Power Fist on something.""
Alternatively, there also can be drawbacks to messages that are too subtle. In the product questions area of JCPenney.com's $30 Masterpiece Art Gallery Juneteenth Framed Canvas Art, a series of orange shapes against a white background, one person asked: ""What does this have to do with Juneteenth?""
Target, whose headquarters are in Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed by police, first acknowledged Juneteenth in 2020 as an official annual company holiday after the spread of national protests against police brutality. The company has provided internal resources detailing the history of Juneteenth and a list of community events for employees to participate in. Workers also can take the day off or work for overtime pay, it said.

2022-06-18 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Dollar General vs. Dollar Tree,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-dollar-general-vs.-dollar-tree,,,"Dollar General (NYSE: DG) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR), the two largest dollar store chains in America, have been resilient stocks to own during recessions. Both retailers usually become popular destinations during economic downturns as cash-strapped shoppers hunt for bargains.
Both companies continued to expand their fleet of brick-and-mortar stores as the ""retail apocalypse"" crushed other retailers over the past decade. They also shored up their defenses against Amazon and Walmart by targeting lower-income neighborhoods.
As the U.S. teeters on the brink of a recession, Dollar General and Dollar Tree both look like solid defensive investments. But is one of these discount retailers a more compelling buy right now?
Image source: Getty Images.
The differences between these two stores
Dollar General isn't a true ""dollar"" store that sells everything for a dollar. Instead, it's a discount retailer that primarily targets rural areas that haven't been saturated by superstores.
Between the first quarters of fiscal 2017 and 2022, Dollar General expanded its total store count from 13,601 to 18,356 locations. Its annual revenue expanded at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.2% from fiscal 2016 to 2021, and it experienced accelerating sales throughout the pandemic as more shoppers stocked up on household products.
Dollar General's gross margin increased from 30.8% in fiscal 2016 to 31.6% in fiscal 2021, even as it endured higher tariffs on Chinese products during the Trump Administration, and its earnings per share (EPS) grew at a CAGR of 18.1% throughout those five years.
Dollar Tree acquired its rival Family Dollar in 2015, and it mainly serves urban and suburban areas. Dollar Tree's namesake banner initially sold all of its products for $1, but raised its prices for the first time to $1.25 last year.
Family Dollar sells most of its products for less than $10. But over the past few years, Family Dollar added Dollar Tree sections to some of its locations, while converting others to Family Dollar and Dollar Tree ""combo"" stores. Between the first quarters of fiscal 2017 and 2022, the company expanded its combined store count from 14,482 to 16,162 locations.
Between fiscal 2016 and 2021, Dollar Tree's annual revenue increased at a CAGR of 4.9% as its EPS grew at a CAGR of 8.9%. However, its gross margin declined from 37.3% in 2016 to 29.4% in 2021 as it grappled with higher tariffs and sluggish sales at Family Dollar, which struggled a lot more against its discount competitors than its Dollar Tree stores.
Family Dollar also temporarily closed about 400 of its stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to deal with product recalls related to a rodent infestation. Dollar General didn't suffer any comparable setbacks.
Investors are more bullish on Dollar General
Over the past five years, Dollar General's stock has rallied more than 230% as Dollar Tree's stock advanced nearly 120%. Dollar General attracted more bulls than Dollar Tree for four simple reasons: Its focus on rural areas exposed it to less competition, it was growing faster, its gross margins were expanding instead of contracting, and it wasn't burdened by a slow-growth banner like Family Dollar.
That trend could continue this year. For fiscal 2022, Dollar General expects its same-store sales to rise 3% to 3.5% and for its net sales to improve 10%-10.5% (including a two-percentage-point benefit from a 53rd week) as it opens 1,110 new stores. It expects its EPS to increase 12% to 14% (which also incudes a four-percentage-point benefit from the 53rd week).
Dollar Tree expects its same-store sales to rise by the mid-single digits in fiscal 2022, and for its net sales to grow 5.5%-7%. It didn't provide an exact target for its new store openings, but it expects its total selling square footage to increase by approximately 3.9% for the full year. It expects its EPS to grow 34% to 41% as it raises its prices and reins in its expenses.
The valuations and verdict
Dollar General trades at 20 times forward earnings and pays a forward dividend yield of nearly 1%. Dollar Tree trades at 19 times forward earnings and doesn't pay any dividends.
Dollar General and Dollar Tree should both be good stocks to own as inflation and rising rates rattle the markets. But if I had to choose one over the other, I'd still stick with Dollar General -- it clearly beats Dollar Tree across several key areas, trades at a comparable valuation, and pays a dividend.

Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.
What if you'd invested in Dollar Tree (DLTR) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to DLTR for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?
Dollar Tree's Business In-Depth
With that in mind, let's take a look at Dollar Tree's main business drivers.
Founded in 1986 and headquartered in Chesapeake, VA, Dollar Tree Inc. is an operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise and other assortments. Its stores successfully operate in major metropolitan areas, mid-sized cities and small towns. The company offers a wide range of quality everyday general merchandise in many categories, including housewares, seasonal goods, candy and food, toys, health and beauty care, gifts, party goods, stationery, books, personal accessories, and other consumer items. Its stores are supported by a nationwide logistics network and distribution centers.

Dollar Tree also owns an e-commerce platform – DollarTree.com – which sells its merchandise in bulk to individuals and small businesses as well as organizations. Through its online platform, the company advertises its in-store events and showcases its special and seasonal promotions for featured products. Further, it acquired Family Dollar Stores, Inc. on July 6, 2015.

The company operates in two reporting business segments: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.

Dollar Tree: Being the major operator of discount variety stores, this segment offers merchandise at the fixed price point of $1.00. The segment has nearly 7,652 stores operating under the Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree Canada banners, 12 distribution centers in the United States and two in Canada. Dollar Tree stores primarily range from 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet.

Family Dollar: This segment operates general merchandise discount retail stores with competitively-priced merchandise in the neighborhood stores. It has nearly 7,827 stores, which sell merchandise at prices ranging from $1.00 to $10.00. These stores primarily range from 6,000 - 8,000 selling square feet. The segment includes store operations under the Family Dollar brand and 11 distribution centers.   
As of Jan 29, 2022, the company operated 16,077 stores in 48 states and five Canada provinces.
Bottom Line
Anyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Dollar Tree a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.
According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in June 2012 would be worth $2,740.08, or a gain of 174.01%, as of June 17, 2022, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.
Compare this to the S&P 500's rally of 173.06% and gold's return of 9.41% over the same time frame.
Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for DLTR.
Shares of Dollar Tree have outpaced the industry in the past year on robust earnings surprise trend, which continued in first-quarter fiscal 2022. The company reported 10th startight quarter of earnings beat in the quarter. The also top line beat estimates and improved year over year. Results benefited from the completion of the $1.25 multi-price point initiative at the Dollar Tree stores, as well as robust margins, despite the increase in freight costs and SG&A expenses. Following the robust first-quarter fiscal 2022 performance, Dollar Tree raised its guidance for fiscal 2022 and provided a decent second quarter view. However, the company witnessed soft sales and comps, along with margin declines, for the Family Dollar banner in the fiscal first quarter. Higher freight and supply-chain disruptions are likely to persist in fiscal 2022.
Shares have gained 11.51% over the past four weeks and there have been 9 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.

2022-06-17 00:00:00+00:00,Chipotle (CMG) Spruces Up Menu With Mexican Cauliflower Rice,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chipotle-cmg-spruces-up-menu-with-mexican-cauliflower-rice,,,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG recently announced testing Mexican Cauliflower Rice at 60 restaurants in Arizona, Southern California and Wisconsin. The initiative is a testament to the company’s solid performance of Cilantro-Lime Cauliflower Rice and revolves around a new version of the recipe.

The new plant-based option comprises grilled cauliflower rice seasoned with savory spices, including garlic, cumin, salt and paprika. Designed for healthy eating, the item supports diet forms including Keto, Vegan, Vegetarian and Paleo. The company stated that the limited-time item would be made available in-restaurant and through the Chipotle app, Chipotle.com and third-party delivery partners.

Earlier, the company had launched Cilantro-Lime Cauliflower Rice across all U.S. and Canadian restaurants in January 2021. The item attracted new customers and resulted in incremental sales lift. The company noted that one in five Cilantro-Lime rice orders (in January 2021) was from guests trying Chipotle for the first time.

In relation to the latest menu addition, Nevielle Panthaky, vice president of Culinary, stated, ""After the success of our Cilantro-Lime Cauliflower Rice last year, we are eager to test a second plant-powered start for any go to order. Our guests crave real, plant-based options so we developed a new flavor-packed recipe that aligns with our Food with Integrity standards.""
Focus on Menu Innovation
Chipotle has been working on a new pipeline for its menu offerings to drive growth. During the first quarter of 2022, the company benefitted from the solid performance of Pollo Asado. It also unveiled new variations to its health-oriented Lifestyle Bowls that resonated well with consumers. Also, it is witnessing a strong recall for Plant-Based Chorizo (limited time offering). The company stated that it has several new products in the pipeline that are in the early stages of consumer testing. The introduction of new items and solid marketing activities that combine brand-building efforts and transaction-driving promotions and advertising are likely to lead to a steady inflow of new customers.
Price Performance

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
In the past year, shares of Chipotle have declined 12.9% compared with the industry’s fall of 22.9%. Chipotle benefits from its digital efforts, Chipotlane add-ons and marketing initiatives. Besides, strength in digital sales, rise in menu prices, new restaurant openings and a higher restaurant-level operating margin have been aiding the company for a while. Also, a solid financial position with no debt is encouraging.

Chipotle continues focusing on the stage-gate process and leveraging digital programs to expand access and convenience. Meanwhile, earnings estimates for 2022 have moved up in the past 60 days, thereby raising analyst optimism about the stock’s growth potential.

2022-06-17 00:00:00+00:00,4 Retail Stocks Worth Buying Despite Dismal Sales in May,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-retail-stocks-worth-buying-despite-dismal-sales-in-may,,,"Consumer spending activity, which is one of the pivotal factors driving the economy, has somewhat slowed down. This was clearly visible from retail sales data for the month of May, which marked the first month-over-month decline in spending for the current year. The Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in May fell 0.3% sequentially to $672.9 billion, following a downwardly revised reading of a 0.7% increase registered in April.

Industry experts see more pain ahead as Americans grapple with soaring commodity and record gasoline prices as well as rising interest rates. This also raises concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. We note that the consumer price index rose 1% month on month in May, following an increase of 0.3% in April. On a year-over-year basis, the metric rose 8.6% — the fastest pace since December 1981. This jump was led by higher gasoline and food grain prices, primarily due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Addressing shooting commodity prices is a top priority for the Federal Reserve, and it is treading the path of a rate hike to tame the same. In a bold move to battle inflation, the Fed recently announced a 75-basis point hike in the benchmark interest rate that will take the level to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. This was the biggest rate increase since 1994.
Category-Wise Sales
The Commerce Department’s report suggests that sales at motor vehicle & parts dealers and furniture & home furnishings stores decreased 3.5% and 0.9%, respectively, on a sequential basis. Sales at health & personal care stores declined 0.2%, while the same at electronics & appliance stores fell 1.3%. Sales at miscellaneous store retailers slid 1.1%. Again, sales at non-store retailers were down 1%.

The report indicates that sales at building material & supplies dealers rose 0.2%, while the same at clothing & clothing accessories outlets jumped 0.1%. Sales at food & beverage stores increased 1.2%, while at food services & drinking places it grew 0.7%.

At sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument, & book stores, sales advanced 0.4%. The metric climbed 0.1% at general merchandise stores. Meanwhile, receipts at gasoline stations were up 4%, driven by high gasoline prices.

2022-06-16 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why You Should Retain YUM! Brands (YUM) Stock Now,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-you-should-retain-yum-brands-yum-stock-now,,,"Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM is likely to benefit from unit expansion, strong performance of Taco Bell and digital initiatives. However, geopolitical tensions and commodity and wage inflation are a concern.

Let us discuss the factors highlighting why investors should hold on to the stock for the time being.
Factors Driving Growth
YUM! Brands continues to focus on expansion efforts to drive growth. Considering its existing footprint of more than 50,000 restaurants worldwide, YUM! Brands believes it can nearly triple its current global presence over the long term. During the first quarter of 2022, the company opened 997 gross units. The company reported solid developments in the KFC and Pizza Hut International divisions with gross unit openings of 587 and 283, respectively. The company reported solid developmental contributions from each of its brands in India, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Going forward, the company intends to focus on master franchise agreements in Brazil (Taco Bell) and Spain (Taco Bell) and an international growth alliance with Telepizza (to accelerate the development of Pizza Hut in key European markets) and consolidate franchisees in Latin America to drive growth.

Taco Bell continues to impress investors with robust same-store sales. The company’s comps climbed 21%, 5% and 9% during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively. The momentum continued in first-quarter 2022, with Taco Bell comps increasing 5%. Taco Bell recorded 63 gross new restaurant openings in first-quarter 2022. The company announced that it is focused on building momentum in markets like the U.K., Spain and India.
Yum! Brands implemented various digital features in mobile and online platforms across all brand segments to enhance the guest experience. The company has been working toward accelerating its delivery services and the results have been positive. During first-quarter 2022, the company reported digital sales of more than $6 billion, up 15% year over year. The company has been benefitting from the acquisition of Dragontail Systems. The initiative allows the company to tap the powers of artificial intelligence to streamline the end-to-end food preparation process and improve its delivery capabilities. Backed by positive results in certain markets, the company intends to expand this cutting-edge platform across its franchisees in the United States.

In the past year, shares of the company have declined 4.2% compared with the Retail - Restaurants industry’s fall of 20.5%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Concerns
The company’s operations are likely to be influenced by uncertainties related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The company had announced the suspension of all investments and restaurant development efforts in Russia and operations of company-owned KFC restaurants. The company has reached an agreement with its Pizza Hut master franchisee to suspend all restaurant operations in that brand. Also, it initiated transferring ownership to local operators. Going forward, the company intends to monitor developments in Russia, as chances of regional instability and heightened economic sanctions (from the U.S.) cannot be ruled out.

Moreover, the company has been continuously shouldering increased expenses, which have been detrimental to margins. During the first quarter of 2022, the company’s restaurant margin came in at 21.9%, down 220 basis points from 24.1% reported in the prior-year quarter. The downside was primarily driven by commodity and wage inflation and partially offset by same-store sales growth. Net costs and expenses during the quarter amounted to $1,038 million compared with $943 million reported in the prior-year quarter. We believe that costs associated with brand positioning in all key markets and ongoing investments in initiatives are likely to weigh on margins in the near term.
Zacks Rank & Key Picks
Yum! Brands currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector are Dollar Tree Inc. DLTR, BBQ Holdings, Inc. BBQ and Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. ARCO.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dollar Tree’s 2022 sales and earnings per share (EPS) suggests growth of 6.7% and 40.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s levels.

BBQ Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). BBQ Holdings has a long-term earnings growth of 14%. Shares of the company have decreased 19% in the past year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BBQ Holdings’ 2022 sales and EPS suggests growth of 46.1% and 67.6%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s levels.

It’s unclear what’s in store for stocks in the short-term. On one hand, it’s possible the market has already bottomed out. On the other hand, inflation and recession fears could mean more volatility ahead. So then, what’s the best move? Focus on adding more long-term stocks to your portfolio.
That is, stocks in companies with strong long-term prospects. They may not be the “hottest” names out there, but with a high chance of delivering steady growth over many years (or in some cases, decades), buying these names now, while they trade for favorable valuations, could look like a wise move in hindsight.
7 Unstoppable Stocks to Own in 2022
When it comes to long-term stocks, you have many options. The market downturn has resulted in many high-quality names becoming oversold.

Long-Term Stocks to Buy: C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW)
Source: Travel mania / Shutterstock.com
Based in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, C.H. Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW) is a third-party logistics provider. It plays a vital role in the supply chain, brokering truckload and intermodal freight transport. Along with this, it also helps connect shippers of goods with air and ocean freight service providers.
As seen from its latest financial results, the supply chain crisis has been a tailwind for the company. In the March quarter, revenue was up 41.9% year-over-year and net income was up 56%. Yet this revenue and earnings growth hasn’t resulted in blockbuster moves for CHRW stock. Shares are up just 7.8% in the past twelve months, and are down 1.1% year-to-date.
Why? Possibly, because investors are skeptical this strong performance will continue. However, the market may be overestimating how quickly the logistics market normalizes. Trading for just 14.7x this year’s estimated earnings, consider it a buy.
This stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Dollar Tree (DLTR)
Source: shutterstock.com/Jonathan Weiss
When you think of “long-term stocks,” Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) is definitely a name that should come to mind. So far, it’s managed to continue performing well operationally, despite inflationary pressures. This is in sharp contrast to big-box names, which due to elevated inflation have been dealing with squeezed margins and excess inventory.
The nature of its business (discount retailing) also makes DLTR stock appealing as a recession-resistant stock. But these more near-term factors aren’t the sole reason to own it. Even as today’s challenges clear up, this retailer has a strong chance of continuing to deliver steady revenue and earnings growth.
In turn, this will enable the stock, a strong performer in recent years, to carry on moving toward new highs. Pulling back, after making a recovery from its drop in mid-May due to the retail stock sell-off, today is a great time to start accumulating a long-term position.
7 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever
This stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Long-Term Stocks to Buy: Hershey Company (HSY)
Source: George Sheldon / Shutterstock.com
So far in 2022, investors have dived into Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) shares, due to its merits as a “safe harbor” stock. The famed confectionary and snack company has historically been recession-resistant. The company is also handling inflation well, as seen from its strong quarterly results, and subsequent guidance raise.
This has helped HSY stock stay in the green for the year. Don’t view this as a sign that it’s topped out though. Even as its strong prospects are highly reflected in its current valuation. Per sell-side analyst earnings forecasts, it’s expected to deliver consistent earnings growth over the next few years.
This points to it sustaining its current valuation, and moving gradually higher in line with increased earnings. Add in its 1.69% dividend, which has grown an average of 7.83% per year over the past five years, and solid returns likely lie ahead for shares.
This stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.
OGE Energy Corp. (OGE)

OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE:OGE) is an electric utilities company. As I’ve discussed before, it’s also involved in midstream natural gas. It may not be a household name outside the areas in which it serves (Oklahoma and Arkansas), but that shouldn’t be a reason to skip out on it.
Why? For starters, it’s a high-quality dividend stock. OGE stock has a forward dividend yield of 4.53% at today’s prices. This dividend has grown an average of 6.66% over the past five years. Earnings growth will likely enable it to raise its rate of payout at a moderate pace.
To top things off, the company has been investing heavily into clean energy, such as solar. This gives it exposure to an important long-term trend. With a lot that’s favorable, and little that is unfavorable, OGE is another great choice for long-term investors.

Long-Term Stocks to Buy: Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico SAB de CV (PAC)

Put simply, in the U.S., privately-operated airports aren’t a thing. There’s only one privately-operated commercial airport stateside. Yet outside the U.S., they are more common. For example, in Mexico, where Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico SAB de CV (NYSE:PAC) operates twelve of them in (as its name suggests) the western coast of Mexico.
As InvestorPlace’s Ian Bezek has argued, there are many advantages to investing in airports. Airports are a state-sanctioned monopoly, and an inflation hedge. These advantages have enabled this company to deliver strong results over many years. They’ve also made PAC stock a winning long-term investment.
This will likely continue. Perhaps not to the extent seen in prior years when this stock was more under-the-radar. Nevertheless, it’s still a reasonably-priced opportunity to add to your watchlist and possibly add to your portfolio. Valuation is favorable, with its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 24.2x.
This stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Pilgrim’s Pride (PPC)

Rising meat prices are bad news for consumers, but for Pilgrim’s Pride (NASDAQ:PPC), it’s been a boon for its sales and earnings results. Passing higher costs to customers, this poultry and pork products processor is expected to report $3.31 per share in earnings this year.
That’s a massive improvement from the earnings per share EPS reported in 2021 (13 cents per share) and in 2020 (39 cents per share). If you think this is fully factored into the PPC stock price, think again. Although shares have spiked since February, it’s still cheap. At today’s prices, it trades for just 12.8x earnings.
Yes, the meat business is cyclical. It’s already trading near what it traded for in 2017, when it last reported similarly-strong earnings. However, if you are bullish that elevated inflation will last longer than expected, PPC’s earnings could remain at elevated levels for years to come.

Long-Term Stocks to Buy: ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. (ZIM)
Source: ImagineStock / Shutterstock.com
ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. (NYSE:ZIM) is an Israel-based container ship operator. It’s taken a big dive since March, after paying out a special dividend. A pullback in shipping prices (which spiked due to the supply chain crisis) has also had a major negative impact on its recent performance.
Yet does this mean you’ve missed the boat with ZIM stock? Not so fast. As I discussed back in April, even as shipping prices move lower, it’s going to take time for them to normalize. A drop in earnings next year, compared to this year’s windfall, is more than reflected in its current valuation.
ZIM today trades for just 3.5x estimated 2023 earnings. 2023 earnings are expected to be 67% below expected earnings for this year. With this shipping giant continuing to grow its business, by expanding its fleet, long-term growth potential looks promising as well.
This stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.

2022-06-15 00:00:00+00:00,Chipotle (CMG) Boosts Digital Space With Loyalty Program Launch,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chipotle-cmg-boosts-digital-space-with-loyalty-program-launch,,,"To strengthen the brand’s presence in the Canadian region, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG recently announced the roll-out of its Chipotle Rewards loyalty program in Canada. Also, it stated plans for the expansion of its restaurants in the region.

With nearly 28 million members globally, the company’s loyalty program plays a supporting hand in its marketing strategies. With this initiative, the company intends to broaden its customer offerings, allowing them to earn and redeem points on purchases made through the restaurant, Chipotle app and website. Some perks include 10 points for every CAD $1 spent, free chips and guac.

Chipotle CMO Chris Brandt, stated, ""We're excited to engage with our Canadian guests in a brand new way with Chipotle Rewards. Our personalized loyalty program allows members to select how they redeem points, earn Extras by participating in challenges, and achieve badges for their achievements.""
Focus on Loyalty Offerings
To boost its guest engagement, the company relaunched its Guac Mode (an exclusive benefit for Chipotle Rewards members that unlocks access to surprise free guac rewards) during the first quarter of 2022. Following the relaunch, the company reported solid social engagement and a rise in loyalty enrolments. The company emphasized on personalization and using predictive modeling to trigger journeys that can influence guest behaviors and make their experience with Chipotle more relevant for them. This includes personalized messaging and watching their cumulative real food print based on their order history. Given the constant learnings, evolvement and model optimization, the initiatives will likely drive more frequency with rewards members in the upcoming periods.
Other Updates
Apart from the loyalty program, the company emphasizes on expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in Canada. Recently, the company opened its 10th restaurant in Toronto in the Liberty Village neighborhood. Also, it stated plans to open four additional locations in British Columbia and Ontario in the summer of 2022.

Backed by impressive unit economics and the success of small-town locations, the company anticipates opening between 235 and 250 new restaurants in 2022. CMG emphasized building a real estate pipeline with more than 80% of the restaurants having Chipotlane in it. The company anticipates an annual unit growth rate of 8-10%.

2022-06-15 00:00:00+00:00,4 Solid Stocks to Buy on Continued Growth in Retail Sales,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-solid-stocks-to-buy-on-continued-growth-in-retail-sales,,,"People have been spending cautiously on fuel, food and other necessities amid a surge in prices. However, with the back-to-school season around the corner, the retail sector has no such reason to worry.
After the initial struggle that stemmed from the pandemic, retailers have done fairly well for the past few months. According to the latest Mastercard SpendingPulse report, retail sales jumped once again in May. The projection is that sales will continue to surge over the coming months despite rising prices. Given this situation, stocks likeDollar Tree, Inc. DLTR, PC Connection, Inc. CNXN, Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. BOOT and Canada Goose Holdings Inc. GOOS are likely to benefit in the near term.
Retail Sales Jump in May
According to the latest Mastercard SpendingPulse report, retail sales grew a solid 10.5% year over year in May, after surging 7.2% in April. May’s gains are also 21.4% higher than the pre-pandemic May 2019 sales.
The report states that sales have once again started getting driven by in-store purchases. In-store sales in May were up 13.7% from the pre-pandemic levels. People depended largely on e-commerce during the peak of the pandemic. The trend picked up and online sales not only went on to become a key driver but also played a major role in saving the retail sector during the pandemic.
However, with brick-and-mortar stores once again open, in-store sales have gathered momentum over the past few months.
Also, people had cut down on spending on services and were spending more on goods during the pandemic. People are still spending on goods despite the reopening of shops. Overall, high demand is helping boost retail sales, which is a good sign.
The Mastercard SpendingPulse report comes just ahead of the all-important retail sales data to be released by the Commerce Department on Jun 15. Data from Commerce Department also showed a 0.9% jump in retail sales in April amid rising inflation.
Retail Sector Poised to Grow
Although soaring prices have been a cause of concern, higher demand for goods is driving sales, which is still helping the retail sector. The report also mentions that sales are likely to get a boost in the coming months due to the back-to-school season, which is good to witness higher sales.
According to the report, retail sales are projected to grow 7.5%, excluding automobiles, from 2021 ahead of the crucial mid-July through Labor Day back-to-school season. From the pre-pandemic levels, retail sales during the back-to-school period are expected to jump by 18.3%.
Department stores are once again likely to help drive sales by 8.2% year over year and 89.9% from the pre-pandemic levels.
As the economy reopens further, more social gatherings such as weddings and parties during this period are expected to boost both in-store and online sales by 8.7% year over year.
Despite rising prices, retail sales are expected to rise in the following days. This is due to a number of factors. Hiring is on the rise once again, while unemployment claims continue to fall. As a result, a greater number of people are returning to work. There will be an increase in personal income and spending as more people return to work.

During the fiscal first quarter, the company cited concerns about commodity cost inflation. During the quarter, the company’s cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, came in at 27.3% compared with 25.1% reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside was primarily driven by the rise in food costs, partially mitigated by menu price increases. For the upcoming quarter, the company anticipates commodity cost inflation to be in high single-digit.

2022-06-13 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why You Should Retain Red Robin (RRGB) Stock Now,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-you-should-retain-red-robin-rrgb-stock-now,,,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. RRGB will likely benefit from its off-premise business model, menu innovation and Donatos expansion. Also, focus on technological enhancements bodes well. However, pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are a concern.

Let’s discuss the factors highlighting why investors should retain the stock for the time being.
Catalysts Driving Growth
Red Robin continues to benefit from its robust off-premise sales. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company delivered the eighth consecutive quarter of off-premises sales dollars at more than double pre-pandemic levels. As a percentage of total off-premise sales, the company reported solid contributions from third-party delivery (55%) to-go (36.7%), catering (4.3%) and Red Robin Delivery (4%). Going forward, the company intends to maintain the momentum by focusing on modifications with respect to its processes, staffing, floor plans and technology. Moreover, it is initiating an expanded floor plan space to support its off-premises and catering orders without impacting the dine-in business. Notably, the initiatives pave a path for effective and accurate executions.

Red Robin’s efforts to improve sales and regain market share via efficient menu innovation, focus on increasing service speed and effective marketing strategy bode well. Despite of scaling down its menu (from pre-pandemic levels), it reported solid performance of Cheesy Bacon Fondue Burger and Scorpion Gourmet Burger. Also, it has been witnessing positive customer feedback related to its limited time offer (LTO) menu items. During the fiscal first quarter, the company reported solid performance with respect to its LTO’s comprising of cheese levers (featuring Cheesy Bacon Fondue Burger and Mozzarella Cheese Sticks) and the Whiskey River Backyard barbecue menu lineup (including Smokehouse Brisket Burger and Tequila Sunset Cocktail). The company intends to focus on creative recipes to drive higher checks and margins.

Red Robin still considers Donatos as a key growth driver. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company initiated Donatos at approximately 200 restaurants. During the quarter, Donatos generated sales worth $7 million. The company stated that for restaurants with Donatos, comparable restaurant revenue increased by more than 5% over restaurants that did not yet have Donatos. Also, guest checks that included Donatos Pizza were more than $10 (on average) compared with those that did not include pizza. The company anticipates rolling out Donatos to approximately 50 restaurants in 2022 and 150 restaurants in 2023. Red Robin is optimistic about the success of this partnership. It anticipates annual pizza sales to be more than $60 million and profitability to be above $25 million by 2024.

The company continues to focus on its digital platform to drive growth. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company emphasized on enhancements regarding integration and a seamless digital ecosystem. To this end, the company launched a new website experience with user-friendly enhancements to presentation, navigation and online ordering. It reported increased order conversion on account of the same. Backed by solid customer engagement, the company remains optimistic regarding its digital ecosystem and anticipates it to drive incremental frequency, traffic and guest checks. The company stated that enhancements related to geofencing (which will inform restaurants when the guest is near for pickup) and additional payment options (such as Apple Pay and Google Pay) are in the pipeline to support the same.
Concerns

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Shares of Red Robin have plunged 52.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 1.8% fall. The dismal performance was primarily caused by the coronavirus crisis. Notably, pandemic-induced staffing challenges and supply chain disruptions had taken an enormous toll on the company. Although most dining services are open, traffic is still low compared with pre-pandemic levels. Going forward, the company intends to monitor the situation regularly to gauge the impacts of COVID-19.

The company has been persistently shouldering increased expenses, which are denting margins. During the fiscal first quarter, the company cited concerns about restaurant labor cost inflation. During the quarter, labor costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased 130 basis points year over year to 36.3%. The increase was primarily driven by higher labor inflation and staffing costs, partially offset by sales leverage. In 2022, the company anticipates commodity and restaurant labor cost inflation to be in the mid-to-high single digit.

Inflation, interest rates, and recession fears have put pressure on stocks, but Nasdaq stocks in particular have been hardest hit. So far this year, the S&P 500 is down 18%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 13%.
The Nasdaq, as measured by the Nasdaq composite? It’s down by a wider margin, 25.8% year-to-date. That’s not surprising, given the index is made up largely of richly priced tech stocks. Such names are most sensitive to rising interest rates, and negative changes in economic conditions.
As these issues carry on in the near term, names that trade on the Nasdaq could continue to struggle. Still, that’s not to say you should avoid them completely. Some high-quality tech names commonly associated with the index are now at appealing entry points.

Along with this, there are scores of non-tech names listed on the exchange that are promising long-term buy-and-hold opportunities. That brings us to these seven Nasdaq stocks. Each one could provide long-term investors buying them today with solid returns.

Nasdaq Stocks: Dollar Tree (DLTR)
Source: shutterstock.com/Jonathan Weiss
It’s an understatement to say investing in Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) has been a roller-coaster ride for the past month. During May, shares in the discount retailer plunged, then fully bounced back, creating a profitable trade for investors who managed to buy the dip.
So, what happened with DLTR stock? Following bad earnings reports from Target (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), retailer stocks plunged across the board. Investors feared that other retailers would see their earnings materially affected by inflation’s impact on operating costs.
Yet in a matter of days, once it revealed its earnings report, showing operating margin improvement, and beating estimates, Dollar Tree zoomed back to prior levels. It’s well positioned to thrive in bad times, and it’s a solid performer during good times. This retailer will likely continue steadily increasing its revenues and earnings over time. Reasonably priced (earnings multiple of 19.8x), consider it a buy.
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)

As I argued late last month, I wouldn’t expect a quick turnaround for shares in  Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Market conditions, plus uncertainty over future growth, could continue to impact the performance of this trillion-dollar FAANG component.
Yet frustrating as it may be to hold this stock in the short-term, buying it today could be a shrewd move. Trading for just 20.9x earnings, GOOG stock has fallen to a relatively low valuation. This is due to rising concerns that its days of elevated growth are over.
But are they? Faster-growing segments like its cloud computing business could make up for slowing growth with its main search business. Alphabet also has potential to further monetize its YouTube platform. With a high chance of making a recovery, in the event growth gets back into high gear, you may want to start accumulating shares in this high-quality tech stock.
Icahn Enterprises (IEP)
Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com
Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP) is one of the more unique Nasdaq stocks. It’s an investment vehicle controlled by billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn. It’s also a master limited partnership (MLP). That means it’s a pass-through entity that pays out earnings in the form of distributions.
Even for an MLP, IEP stock pays out a big distribution. Its annual yield is a staggering 15.6%. There is a caveat. Its current distribution vastly exceeds its earnings. This is sustainable because Icahn (who owns 87% of it) takes his distributions in the form of new MLP units.
So, why own it? Icahn’s “permabear” attitude cost him (and IEP) billions during the 2010s. Yet Icahn’s investing style is coming back in vogue. His bearishness on growth stocks, and bullishness on sectors like energy, is no longer a contrarian position. IEP could deliver better returns, which could enable the stock to make a comeback.
Nasdaq Stocks: Monster Beverage (MNST)
Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com
After plunging from January through March, in recent months Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) has been on a tear. It’s soared from the low $70s per share, back up to around $91 per share. At first glance, shares in this energy drink maker may look pricey.
MNST stock today trades for around 35.9x earnings. Even so, it may be able to sustain this valuation, and continue to rise in price in line with its earnings. Morgan Stanley’s Dara Mohsenian recently called it a “top pick” in the beverage sector.
The analyst cited topline growth factors to back up the view. Favorable demographic trends, plus international expansion, could enable the beverage company to continue growing revenue and earnings at a double-digit pace. More value-minded investors may want to skip on it, or at least wait for weakness. Growth-focused investors, however, may want to consider buying this consumer staples growth stock.
O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Like Monster Beverage, O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) may also make for a great long-term growth play. The factors that have enabled the auto parts retailer to report strong results lately could continue. That is, motorists may continue to opt to repair existing vehicles, rather than buy another new or used vehicle.
As Louis Navellier discussed back in March, today’s cars, trucks, and SUVs last longer than the vehicles of yesteryear. This makes repairing them more economical than replacing them. Especially as vehicle prices remain up by double digits. In turn, this points to further growth, and higher prices, for ORLY stock.
Despite these prospects, the market may still be under the impression growth will screech to a halt. At least, that’s the takeaway from its current forward multiple (19.3x). Although growth in the coming years may come more gradually than in 2021, this is more than reflected in today’s valuation.
PepsiCo (PEP)
Source: FotograFFF / Shutterstock
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the few “old school” blue-chip Nasdaq stocks. Shares in the soft drink and snack foods giant are a great buy for investors looking to add steady, dividend-paying stocks to their portfolio.
Not only that, when it comes to owning Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock versus PEP stock, you may want to go with the latter. Both have similar valuations and dividend yields. Each one has a forward P/E of around 25%, and pays out a dividend around 2.75%.
Yet PepsiCo wins out in two areas. First, earnings growth. Sell-side estimates call for it to see around 8.6% earnings growth, versus 6.9% for Coke. Second, it has also delivered higher dividend growth (7.39% per year) over the past five years, versus KO (3.66%). In the cola stock wars, this may be the winner by a nose.
Nasdaq Stocks: Starbucks (SBUX)
Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com
The growth stock sell-off hit Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares particularly hard. It’s down around 35% year-to-date. Besides market conditions, other factors have hurt its performance.
As my InvestorPlace colleague Faizan Farooque recently discussed, SBUX stock has been impacted by several company-related developments. These include the latest pandemic slowdown in China and inflationary pressures. It’s also dealing with a unionization wave.
All this uncertainty may make you hesitant to buy in today. Yet this uncertainty may be what allows you to buy in at a favorable entry price. The stock currently trades for around 23x estimated earnings for fiscal year ending September 2023. It’s likely to recover once today’s troubles pass. In the meantime, you can get paid while you wait, with Starbucks’ 2.5% dividend yield. The coffee chain has raised an average of 15.1% per year over the past five years.

2022-06-13 00:00:00+00:00,Amazon (AMZN) Boosts Fashion Efforts With Latest Experience,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-amzn-boosts-fashion-efforts-with-latest-experience,,,"Amazon AMZN continues to make strong efforts to bolster its e-commerce business, which contributes maximum to its revenues.

Its deepening focus on expanding its offerings under various categories like electronics, books, grocery and especially fashion among others has been a key factor for a while behind growth of the online retail business.

Moreover, Amazon is leaving no stone unturned to bolster its fashion retail division Amazon Fashion on the back of its robust strategies and innovative technologies. This is evident from its latest introduction of an augmented reality (AR)-powered interactive mobile experience, namely ‘Virtual Try-On for Shoes’.

Notably, the new feature enables customers to check the look of a pair of shoes on them virtually from every angle just by tapping the “Virtual Try-On” button on the product detail page and then pointing the camera at their feet.

Further, they can check different colors of the same product by using the carousel. Also, they can take a picture of the virtual look of the chosen shoe and share it by using ‘Share’ option.

Virtual Try-On for Shoes is available for various brands like New Balance, adidas, Reebok, Puma, Superga, Lacoste, Asics and Saucony to name a few.

We note that the latest move is likely to offer an enhanced experience to the online shoe shoppers, which in turn, will expand the customer reach of various sellers on Amazon.

At present, the feature is available in the United States and Canada for customers using the Amazon shopping app on iOS.

Amazon Fashion Gaining Traction
Amazon continues to gain strong traction from the fashion retail on the back of its growing fashion shopping experiences.

Moreover, its solid Prime Momentum remains a major positive. AMZN’s strong focus toward enhancing Prime service with the help of exciting discounts and expanding ultrafast delivery services remains a major positive behind its growing trajectory in the fashion retail space.

Apart from the latest launch, Amazon offers a shopping experience called The Drop, which provides access to limited-edition street-style collections designed by fashion influencers.

AMZN also offers Prime Wardrobe — “try before you buy” facility, which enables customers to place the order online from a separate section of Prime Wardrobe on its site. Further, the shoppers of Prime Wardrobe get an option of a huge collection of clothes, shoes and accessories of numerous brands.

Amazon offers a service called Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe, which provides style inspiration and recommendations to deliver a better shopping experience.

We believe, the above-mentioned growing endeavors will help Amazon penetrate rapidly into the booming online retail market for fashion.

Per Statista’s recent data, the fashion e-commerce market in the United States is expected to generate revenues of $0.99 trillion in 2022. Further, it is anticipated to reach $1.36 trillion by 2025, seeing a CAGR of 11.2% between 2022 and 2025.

Apart from online efforts, Amazon recently opened its first clothing store Amazon Style, in Glendale near Los Angeles, CA, which was announced at the beginning of this year. The new store stocks clothing from a wide range of brands, including Levi’s, Tommy Hilfiger, Lacoste, Steve Madden and Champion to name a few.

It leverages the Machine Learning (ML) technology to offer customers an enhanced and smart shopping experience by helping them find the item they are looking for.
Wrapping Up
Amazon’s vast and efficient e-commerce platform remains its key driver in the retail industry. Its online retail segment is constantly intensifying the competition for the brick & mortar stores and traditional retailers.

However, a slowdown in online shopping activities compared to last two years as a result of normalization toward the pre-pandemic levels, is acting as a major headwind to AMZN, currently.

Notably, its online store sales dipped 3% from the prior-year quarter’s level to $51.1 billion in the first quarter of 2022.

Additionally, Amazon is bearing the brunt of inflationary pressures, elevated staffing costs and supply-chain disruptions.

All these are making investors grow bearish on the stock. Amazon has lost 34.3% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis.

2022-06-10 00:00:00+00:00,Amazon (AMZN) Boosts Grocery Retail Focus With New Store,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-amzn-boosts-grocery-retail-focus-with-new-store,,,"Amazon AMZN is firing on all cylinders to expand its footprint in the retail sector with its strengthening grocery business and growing physical presence.

The recent opening of the new Amazon Fresh grocery store is a testament to the company’s efforts to that end. The latest 40,000-square-foot store is located at 7201 W. 24th St., North Riverside, IL.

The new Amazon Fresh store is equipped with the company’s cashierless technology — ‘Just Walk Out’ — which enables customers to enter the store by scanning the QR code in their Amazon app or using Amazon One to scan their palm or inserting a credit or debit card linked to their Amazon account.

Further, the technology lets customers to walk out without waiting in a checkout queue.

We note that the latest establishment marks the eighth Amazon Fresh store in Illinois, joining the other Amazon Fresh stores in Chicagoland and Naperville.

We believe the latest move is likely to aid Amazon in capitalizing on the growing momentum in in-store grocery shopping in the current phase of the pandemic where the preference for offline shopping has increased, driven by solid vaccination drives.

Moreover, the incorporation of Just Walk Out technology will help the company deliver enhanced grocery shopping experiences to customers, which, in turn, is expected to bolster customer traffic in the store.

Growing Grocery Initiatives
The latest move of AMZN bodes well with its deepening focus on the grocery segment.

Apart from this, the e-commerce giant is gearing up to expand its service, namely Amazon Fresh Marketplace, in the United States and a majority of locations in Europe this year.

Further, the increasing number of Amazon Fresh stores, equipped with Just Walk Out technology across the United States and outside the country, remains a major positive.

Additionally, the company’s expansion of its Fresh infrastructure in India remains noteworthy.

We believe that all these endeavors are expected to boost the company’s prospects in the promising grocery retail market.
Wrapping Up
The opening of the new Amazon Fresh store is in sync with the company’s growing efforts toward expanding its physical presence.

Moreover, Amazon continues to witness growth in its sales from physical stores, which totaled $4.6 billion in the first quarter of 2022. The figure grew 17% from the year-ago quarter.

However, Amazon is currently suffering from rising transportation and fulfillment center costs. Further, the accelerating pandemic-related expenses remain risky for the company’s margin expansion in the near term. Further, the ongoing inflationary pressure and elevated staffing costs are other negatives.

These factors are making investors bearish on the stock. Amazon has dropped 30.4% year to date (“YTD”).

2022-06-10 00:00:00+00:00,Signet (SIG) Shares Rise 9% on Q1 Earnings & Sales Beat,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/signet-sig-shares-rise-9-on-q1-earnings-sales-beat,,,"Shares of Signet Jewelers Limited SIG rose 9.1% as the company posted solid first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines cruised past the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. The company’s impressive sales performance was backed by its healthy inventory status, data-driven marketing and connected commerce capacities. Customers’ favorable response to Signet’s assortments, especially high price point offerings, precious metals and diamonds, also drove results.

While the company encountered softening in lower price points stemming from increased inflation and the absence of a stimulus, it countered these through digital capacities, tailored assortments and better services to retain the increased average transaction value (“ATV”).
Quarterly Details
Signet reported adjusted earnings of $2.86 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.29. The bottom line rose 28.3% from the year-ago quarter figure of $2.23.
Signet Jewelers Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Signet Jewelers Limited price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Signet Jewelers Limited Quote
This jewelry retailer generated total sales of $1,838.3 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,809 million. The top line also increased 8.9% year over year. Same-store sales rose 2.5% year over year.
A Sneak Peek Into Margins
The adjusted gross profit in the reported quarter amounted to $728 million, up from $678.4 million in the year-ago fiscal’s comparable quarter.

SG&A expenses came in at $533.1 million, up from $512 million in the prior fiscal year’s comparable quarter. SIG reported an adjusted operating income of $194.6 million, up from the $168.9 million recorded in the year-ago fiscal quarter. As a rate of sales, the adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 10.6%.
Segment Discussion
Sales in the North America segment increased 5.4% year over year to $1.7 billion. Same-store sales fell 0.9% from the year-ago quarter’s levels due to lower number of transactions, partly compensated by a rise in ATVs. ATV rose more than 19% year over year.

Sales in the International segment surged 91.6% year over year to $110 million. Same-store sales in the segment increased 102.6% year over year, reflecting the impacts of increased ATVs and the number of transactions and operating restrictions in the year-ago period.

Financial Details
Signet ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $927.6 million, accounts receivable (net) of $17.1 million and inventories of $2,216.2 million. The long-term debt was $147.1 million at the end of the reported quarter. Total shareholders’ equity was $1,256.8 million at the end of the quarter.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Signet used net cash of $135.5 million from operating activities. It had adjusted free cash flow of a negative $156.3 million as of Apr 30, 2022.

As of Apr 30, 2022, the company bought back roughly 4.3 million shares for $318.2 million. Management also expanded its buyback authorization by $500 million. SIG has buybacks worth nearly $645 million left under the expanded authorization. The company’s board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 20 cents per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. This dividend is payable on Aug 26, 2022 to shareholders of record as of Jul 29.

We note that Signet had 2,854 stores as of Apr 30, 2022.
Guidance
Signet reiterated its guidance for fiscal 2023. It continues to expect total revenues in the band of $8.03-$8.25 billion, up from the $7.83 billion delivered in fiscal 2022. The adjusted operating income is still anticipated in the range of $921-$974 million, suggesting a rise from the $908.1 million recorded last fiscal.

Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are envisioned in the bracket of $12.72-$13.47 in fiscal 2023 compared with the $12.28 earned in fiscal 2022.

Capital expenditures for the fiscal are likely to be nearly $250 million.

For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, management expects revenues in the range of $1.79-$1.82 billion. The adjusted operating income is expected in the range of $188-$204 million.

Management’s guidance assumes some consumer pressure, which includes inflation and the stimulus impact similar to current levels. It expects a certain shift in consumer discretionary spending from the jewelry category, indicating the decelerating levels of consumer confidence and the pent-up demand for experience-oriented categories in the fiscal year. This company’s initiatives to lower supply-chain hurdles have been effective so far and management does not expect any considerable bottlenecks in the availability of inventory.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) player have declined 22.5% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 38.6%.

From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
