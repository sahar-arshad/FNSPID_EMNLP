2022-08-05 00:00:00+00:00,3 Great Stocks to Buy in August for Safety and Long-Term Growth,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-great-stocks-to-buy-in-august-for-safety-and-long-term-growth,,,"Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks tackles where the stock market and the economy stand to start August. The episode then focuses on three stocks—Humana, Merck, and Dollar Tree—that have proven they can climb during 2022’s falling market and operate businesses that are likely to withstand any economic downturn or possible recession.
The hot July jobs report that dropped Friday morning adds to the current economic uncertainty and striking divergence in data. U.S. GDP fell in back-to-back quarters to start the year, which can be common shorthand for a recession.
That said, it’s hard to be in a recession when the U.S. economy added 528,000 jobs in July to blow away projections and take payrolls back to their pre-pandemic levels. The impressive July jobs growth lowered the unemployment rate to 3.5%, and there are still millions of job openings in the U.S. These data points would seem to say that the U.S. is far from a recession.
On the other hand, formerly hot growth areas such as tech and housing are cooling rapidly. And even Walmart is laying off corporate workers as it faces slowing consumer spending. Many people are cutting back after an extended stretch of euphoric post lockdown spending, boosted by stimulus checks, a strong jobs market, and higher wages, all of which helped contribute to the current bout of 40-year high inflation.
There was a growing sense that the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes and their continued hawkish tone were doing their job, with the 10-year down to 2.67% on Thursday from its 3.5% peak in mid-June. The strong jobs print Friday sent 10-year yields back up to 2.85%. Some on Wall Street might be worried once again that the July jobs data will force Jay Powell and the Fed to continue raising rates at high clips.
Given all of the market and economic uncertainty, investors might want to focus on stocks that have been able to climb during 2022 and operate stable businesses built to withstand all types of economic environments. The first stock we look at today is health insurance giant Humana Inc. HUM.
Humana operates through three core segments: Retail, Group and Specialty, and Healthcare Services. The company topped our EPS estimates on July 27 and provided upbeat guidance to help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Zacks estimates call for it to post double-digit revenue and EPS growth both this year and next. Humana is also part of a highly-ranked industry and its shares climbed 15% in the last year and 5% in 2022.
Next up is the $220 billion market cap pharmaceutical power Merck & Co. MRK, which topped our Q2 estimates on July 28. Merck’s portfolio includes oncology, vaccines, infectious diseases, diabetes, and beyond. Plus, its Covid-19 antiviral pill continued to perform well in Q2.
MRK raised its guidance to help it capture a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. And Merck’s roughly 3% dividend yield is even more impressive considering its 14% climb in 2022.
Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR is a discount retailer focused on expansion. It also raised its prices for the first time in history from $1 to $1.25 to help it sell a wider range of merchandise. The higher prices also help fight back against inflation and improve margins, while maintaining some of the lowest prices in retail.
Dollar Tree steadily grew its revenue for decades and it’s poised to thrive as more Americans look to save money. DLTR has crushed the likes of Walmart and Target over the last 15 years and it’s up 65% in the past 12 months. Dollar Tree holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with it set to release its quarterly results on August 25.

From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.

Revenues of RMB 205.6 billion ($30.7 billion) declined 0.1% from the year-ago quarter. Further, the top-line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.5%.

Resurgence of COVID-19 in China remained a major headwind for the company during the reported quarter. Overall China Commerce segment delivered sluggish performance which was a negative.

Nevertheless, solid momentum across Alibaba’s China commerce and International commerce wholesale businesses was a positive.

Strength across the local consumer services, cloud computing business and Cainiao logistics services contributed well.

We note that disruptions led by coronavirus pandemic are likely to persist as concerns for Alibaba’s domestic businesses.

Revenues by Segments
China Commerce (69% of total revenues): The segment comprises marketplaces operating in the retail and wholesale commerce markets of China. Alibaba generated RMB 141.9 billion ($21.2 billion) of revenues from the segment, which fell 1% year over year.

China commerce retail (67% of total revenues): The business vertical’s revenues for the reported quarter were RMB 136.98 billion ($20.5 billion), reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 2%.

Positive contributions from direct sales businesses like Alibaba Health and Freshippo were tailwinds.

China commerce wholesale (2% of total revenues): The business generated revenues of RMB 4.96 billion ($740 million), up 26% from the year-ago quarter’s level. The increase in value-added services’ revenues generated from wholesale buyers and paying members contributed well.

International commerce retail (5% of total revenues): Revenues for the reported quarter were RMB 10.5 billion ($1.6 billion), down 3% year over year due to the decreasing AliExpress orders in Europe. The ongoing supply-chain and logistics disruptions due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict also remained a headwind.

Nevertheless, the well-performing Lazada contributed well to the international commerce retail revenues.  

International commerce wholesale (2% of total revenues): The business generated revenues of RMB 4.9 billion ($736 million), which increased 12% from the prior-year quarter’s level. Growth was attributed to a surge in revenues generated by cross-border-related value-added services.

Cainiao logistics services (6% of total revenues): The business generated revenues of RMB 12.1 billion ($1.8 billion), up 5% year over year. The upside was led by strong momentum across consumer logistics services.

This includes EmpowerMe, the personalized beauty and wellness strategy; expansion of affiliate-powered social commerce; further adoption of recently launched Vera and Stela apps, as well as the introduction of MyShop in China.

Ryan Napierski, president and CEO, said, “Given the current landscape, we are taking aggressive measures to re-align our capabilities and resources with a focus on delivering Nu Vision 2025, which will result in a restructuring event in the second half and reduced operating expenses going forward.”

Based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:
Value Score
Value investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.
Growth Score
Growth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.
Momentum Score
Momentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying ""the trend is your friend."" The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.
VGM Score
What if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank
A proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.
It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.
This totals more than 800 top-rated stocks, and it can be overwhelming to try and pick the best stocks for you and your portfolio.
That's where the Style Scores come in.
To maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.
Since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.
A stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.

2022-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,"Under Armour (UAA) Posts In-Line Q1 Earnings, Trims FY23 View",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/under-armour-uaa-posts-in-line-q1-earnings-trims-fy23-view,,,"Under Armour, Inc. UAA came up with first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top line came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the bottom line met the same. The impact of supply chain disruptions and higher than planned promotions was visible in the sportswear maker’s quarterly results, as gross margin contracted sharply. Also, the company’s Asia Pacific business remained sluggish. As a result, the company trimmed its fiscal 2023 earnings view.

This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has fallen 41% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 18%.
Revenues & Earnings Picture
Under Armour reported first-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings of 3 cents a share that matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the figure declined sharply from adjusted earnings of 24 cents a share reported in the year-ago period due to margin contraction.

Meanwhile, net revenues of $1,349.1 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,338 million but declined marginally by 0.2% on a year-over-year basis. However, the metric grew 2% on a currency-neutral basis.

While wholesale revenues increased 3.1% year over year to $791.7 million, direct-to-consumer revenues fell 7.1% to $520.8 million owing to an 8% decline in owned and operated store revenues. E-commerce revenues decreased 6% and represented 39% of the total direct-to-consumer business.
Let’s Take an Insight
By product category, Apparel revenues edged down 0.7% year over year to $868.4 million, while Footwear revenues increased 1.3% to $347.3 million. Revenues from the Accessories category declined 13.2% to $96.8 million. Meanwhile, Licensing revenues surged 21% to $28.1 million.

Net revenues from North America inched up 0.4% to $909.4 million. Revenues from international business declined 3.3% (or up 1.5% on a currency-neutral basis) to $431 million. Within international business, net revenues from EMEA decreased 1% to $205.2 million. We note that revenues from Asia-Pacific declined 8.2% to $176.7 million, while revenues from Latin America region grew 6.3% to $49.4 million.

The company’s gross margin shrunk 280 basis points to 46.7% from the prior-year period owing to elevated freight costs related to COVID-19 supply chain impacts, higher than planned promotions, and the adverse impact of changes in foreign currency. SG&A expenses jumped 9% to $595.7 million. Meanwhile, adjusted operating income of $44.5 million was significantly down from $124.2 million reported in the year-ago period.
Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
Under Armour, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Under Armour, Inc. Quote
Other Financial Details
Under Armour ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,049.4 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $672.8 million and total stockholders' equity of $1,729.1 million. Inventory was up 8% to $954.4 million. For fiscal 2023, management expects capital expenditures to be approximately $225 million.

During the quarter, the company repurchased shares worth $25 million, and had $175 million remaining under its share buyback program.
FY23 Outlook
Under Armour continued to expect 5-7% increase in fiscal 2023 revenues. Excluding roughly 200 basis points of anticipated foreign currency headwinds, the company guided 7-9% increase in revenues, on a currency-neutral basis.

Management now foresees gross margin contraction of 375 to 425 basis points compared to the baseline period's gross margin of 49.6%. The decline is mainly driven on expectations of higher promotional activities, channel mix, and additional negative impacts from anticipated changes in foreign currency. The company had earlier forecast 150 to 200 basis points decline in gross margin.

SG&A expenses are expected to be flat compared with the prior year. Under Armour guided operating income between $300 million and $325 million versus the comparable baseline period operating income of $333.4 million. The company had earlier projected operating income in the range of $375 to $400 million.

Excluding an expense related to ongoing litigation matters, the company forecast adjusted operating income in the band $310 million to $335 million for fiscal 2023 versus the comparable baseline period adjusted operating income of $424 million.

Under Armour now expects adjusted earnings in the band of 47-53 cents a share, down from its pervious call of 63-68 cents a share. The company had reported adjusted earnings of 68 cents a share for the comparable baseline period.

2022-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,"Starbucks (SBUX) Q3 Earnings Top, Revenues Miss, Shares Rise",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/starbucks-sbux-q3-earnings-top-revenues-miss-shares-rise,,,"Starbucks Corporation SBUX reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same. On a year-over-year basis, earnings declined but revenues improved, given higher U.S. comparable sales.
Following the results, this coffee chain’s shares gained 1.5% in the after-hours trading session on Aug 2. Investor sentiments were probably boosted by strong U.S. comparable sales despite higher inflationary pressures and a dismal performance in China. Although the overseas division suffered from increasing restrictions in China, its U.S. rebound was encouraging.
Nevertheless, Howard Schultz, the interim chief executive officer, stated, “We have clear line-of-sight on what we need to do to reinvent the company, elevate our partner and customer experiences and drive accelerated, profitable growth all around the world.”
Discussion on Earnings, Revenues & Comps
In the quarter under review, the company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 84 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents by 9.1%. However, the bottom line decreased 15.2% year over year from an adjusted EPS of 99 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.
Quarterly revenues of $8,150.1 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,227 million by 0.9%. However, the top line increased 9.7% on a year-over-year basis. The upside was primarily driven by solid revenue contributions from the U.S. and stellar performances across its diverse global portfolio. The solid performances of new U.S. company-operated stores (part of the North America Trade Area Transformation initiative) added to the positives.
Global comparable store sales increased 3% year over year. The upside was primarily driven by a 6% rise in average tickets, marginally overshadowed by a 3% decline in comparable transactions.
Starbucks opened 318 net new stores worldwide in the fiscal third quarter, bringing the total store count to 34,948.
Starbucks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
Starbucks Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Starbucks Corporation Quote
Overall Margin Falls in Q3
On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin during the fiscal third quarter came in at 16.9%, down from 20.4% reported in the prior-year quarter. The downside was primarily caused by inflationary pressures along with increased investments in store partner wages and benefits. Reduced traffic in China also added to the woes. However, this was partially offset by higher pricing in North America.
Segmental Details
Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: North America, International and Channel Development.
North America: This segment’s fiscal third-quarter net revenues came in at $6,058.4 million, up 13% year over year. The segment benefited from 9% growth in company-operated comparable store sales, new store growth and higher contribution from licensed store sales.
Operating margin in the North American segment came in at 22% compared with 24.3% reported in the prior-year quarter. The contraction was due to the rise in supply chain costs (on account of inflationary pressures and higher spending on new partner training) and investments in retail store partner wages. These were partly offset by pricing.
International: This segment’s fiscal third-quarter net revenues came in at $1,584.7 million, down 6% year over year. The downside can be primarily attributed to an 18% decline in comparable store sales owing to COVID-19-related restrictions in China. The decline was marginally overshadowed by net new store openings, higher product sales and royalty revenues. The conversion of the Korean market from a joint venture to a fully licensed market in the fourth quarter-fiscal 2021 added to the positives.
Operating margin in the segment contracted 1,090 basis points (bps) year over year to 8.5%. The downside can be attributed to sales deleverage owing to COVID-19 restrictions in China, investments in strategic initiatives, store partner wages and benefits as well as higher profit and distribution costs from a sales mix shift. However, this was partially offset by sales leverage across markets outside of China.
During the fiscal third quarter, comps in China declined 44% year over year. The downtick was caused by a 1% decline in average tickets and a 43% fall in transactions. China continues to battle COVID resurgences and navigate through prolonged lockdowns.
Channel Development: Net revenues in the segment increased 16% from the prior-year quarter’s figure to $479.7 million. The upside was primarily driven by growth in its ready-to-drink business and Global Coffee Alliance.
The segment’s operating margin, however, contracted 1,220 bps to 40%. The decline was mainly due to a fall in income from the North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, primarily on account of inflationary pressures and a business mix shift.
Financial Details
The company ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $3,177.5 million compared with $6,455.7 million as of Oct 3, 2021. As of Jul 3, 2022, long-term debt totaled $13,930.8 million compared with $13,616.9 million as of Oct 3, 2021.
Meanwhile, the company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 49 cents per share. The dividend is payable on Aug 26, 2022, to shareholders of record as of Aug 12, 2022.
Other Updates
Starbucks Rewards loyalty program’s 90-day active members in the United States increased to 27.4 million, reflecting an increase of 13% year over year.
Fiscal 2022 Guidance
Given the ongoing uncertainty around China, increasing inflation and the significant investments that the company has been planning, SBUX management has suspended guidance for Q4 for the time being. SBUX believes that the balance of the year will be under massive pressure.
The company intends to provide a comprehensive update on its business outlook for fiscal 2023 and beyond at its Investor Day in September.

2022-08-01 00:00:00+00:00,DLTR or BURL: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dltr-or-burl%3A-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-0,,,"Investors with an interest in Retail - Discount Stores stocks have likely encountered both Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Burlington Stores (BURL). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.
Right now, Dollar Tree is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Burlington Stores has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that DLTR likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than BURL has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.
DLTR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.29, while BURL has a forward P/E of 22.50. We also note that DLTR has a PEG ratio of 1.31. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. BURL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.62.
Another notable valuation metric for DLTR is its P/B ratio of 4.51. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, BURL has a P/B of 13.02.
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to DLTR's Value grade of B and BURL's Value grade of D.
DLTR stands above BURL thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that DLTR is the superior value option right now.

YUMC reported second-quarter 2022 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the metrics declined on a year-over-year basis.

During the quarter under discussion, the company's operations were affected by multiple COVID outbreaks in China. Tightened COVID curbs (including partial lockdowns and suspension of restaurant dine-in services) were implemented to counter the same. The measures paved a path for restricted mobility, reduced travel and soften consumer spending. Although the company initiated the reopening of stores (at reduced capacity), it expects restaurant traffic recovery to take time.
Earnings & Revenue Discussion
During second-quarter 2022, the company reported adjusted diluted earnings of 20 cents. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents. However, the bottom line declined 52% from 42 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.
Yum China Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
  Yum China price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Yum China Quote
 Quarterly revenues of $2,128 million surpassed the consensus mark of $2,115 million. However, the top line declined 13% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding foreign currency translation, the top line fell 11% year over year.

Total system sales in the reported quarter declined 16% year over year. System sales at KFC and Pizza Hut declined 15% and 14%, respectively. Same-store sales dropped 16% year over year, primarily due to a decline of 16% at KFC and 15% at Pizza Hut.
Operating Highlights
During second-quarter 2022, total costs and expenses totaled $2,047 million compared with $2,218 million reported in the prior-year quarter.

Restaurant margin in the quarter under review was 12.1%, down 370 basis points from the year-ago quarter's levels. The downside was caused by sales deleveraging, higher inflation in commodity, wage and utility costs and a rise in rider cost related to rising delivery volume.

During the quarter, adjusted operating profit totaled $82 million, down 65.4% from the year-ago quarter's levels. Adjusted net income amounted to $84 million compared with $185 million reported in the prior-year quarter.
Balance Sheet
As of Jun 30, 2022, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $1,147 million compared with $1,047 million as of Mar 31, 2022. Inventories during the first quarter were $353 million compared with $345 million reported in the previous quarter.

During the second quarter, the company repurchased $168 million worth of stock at an average price of $41.37. As of Jun 30, the company had approximately $1.2 billion available for the buyback program.

The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 12 cents per common share. The dividend will be payable on Sep 15, 2022, to shareholders of record as of Aug 25, 2022.
Unit Development and Other Updates
During second-quarter 2022, Yum China opened 246 gross new restaurants driven by the development of the KFC and Pizza Hut brands. As of Jun 30, the company's total restaurant count was 12,170, up 1,147 stores year over year.

During the quarter under review, the company's delivery accounted for nearly 38% of KFC and Pizza Hut's company sales, up nearly eight percentage points from the prior-year quarter's levels.

Digital orders during the quarter contributed 89% to KFC and Pizza Hut's company sales. During the second quarter, KFC and Pizza Hut loyalty programs increased to more than 385 million members.

The company emphasizes expanding its supply chain network to support store and portfolio growth and enhance intelligent supply chain operations. To this end, the company initiated the construction of its Jiading Supply Chain Management Center in Shanghai. The venue will serve as the company's supply chain operations headquarter. It expects to complete the project in 2024.
2022 Outlook
In 2022, Yum China anticipates opening approximately 1,000 to 1,200 new stores. The company expects solid expansion related to KFC and Pizza Hut stores. Capital expenditures in 2022 are forecast in the range of $800-$1000 million.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
