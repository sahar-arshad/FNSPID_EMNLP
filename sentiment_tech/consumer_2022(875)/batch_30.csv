May 4 (Reuters) - EBay Inc EBAY.O on Wednesday forecast second-quarter revenue below market estimates, a sign that declining consumer spending and intense competition from rivals like Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O would hit its business.
Shares of the company fell 6% in extended trading.
After bringing in billions of dollars in sales during the pandemic, e-commerce companies are now under pressure from rising inflation, a tight labor market and the ongoing supply chain crisis.
The economic reopening has also slowed the online shopping momentum seen last year as customers return to pre-pandemic habits.
EBay said it expected current-quarter revenue between $2.35 billion and $2.40 billion, compared with the analysts' average estimate of $2.54 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue for the first quarter came in at $2.48 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $2.46 billion.

2022-05-04 00:00:00+00:00,3 of the Best Growth Stocks to Buy in May,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-of-the-best-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-may,,,"Investing in growth stocks is a bit of a contrarian position these days. Investors are taking an overly conservative stance and shedding growth stocks as if they're about to go under. It's a far cry from last year, when you could pick a random ticker and make a good return amid the meme hype.
Stocks weren't worth the ridiculous premiums they were trading at a year ago; nor are they suddenly worthless now. The truth usually lies somewhere in the middle. For investors, that means sell-offs happening now could be creating some attractive buying opportunities.
Three of the best growth stocks to buy in May include Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), and PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL). They're all down more than 30% this year, but here's why they could all be profitable investments for your portfolio.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Intuitive Surgical
A 15% growth rate admittedly isn't going to get investors too excited about a business. That's how much Intuitive Surgical's sales rose by during the first three months of 2022, when sales came in at just under $1.5 billion. That, combined with a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of over 50, make it easy to see why investors may have been dumping the stock of late.
But Intuitive Surgical is in the robotic-assisted surgery market, which is still in its early growth stages. Even though the industry will be worth more than $22 billion by 2028 (that's more than three times its value in 2020) according to estimates from Verified Market Research, that's still fairly small -- healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson reported more revenue in just its latest quarter.
It's a long road ahead for Intuitive Surgical, and solely looking at one period or an earnings multiple can paint a misleading picture of the stock. And it doesn't help that COVID-19 has disrupted hospital operations and the number of procedures utilizing the company's da Vinci systems.
However, there are encouraging signs ahead. Management stated on its recent earnings call that it forecasts procedure growth this year to be between 12% and 16%, up from an earlier forecast of 11% to 15%. It's a modest change but a step in the right direction nonetheless.
Intuitive Surgical makes for a promising investment -- both long term and as the economy returns to normal this year.
2. Netflix
Streaming giant Netflix could also be an exciting growth investment to pick up today. Its shares are trading at 2017 prices even though the business is much bigger and more profitable than it was five years ago. Twice this year, the stock has fallen by at least 20% after releasing earnings because of either slowing growth (in January) or an outright loss of subscribers (April).
But while the headlines screaming that Netflix is losing subscribers are concerning, that shouldn't be enough of a reason to give up on the business. The company recently raised its prices, which will help drive up sales. Plus, it is cracking down on password sharing, which it estimates involves 100 million households that are not paying for its service -- that's steep, given that it reported 222 million subscribers as of the end of March. Getting some of those households to sign up (potentially through lower-priced and ad-based plans, which Netflix is looking into offering) could boost its subscriber numbers in an instant.
Overall, Netflix's business isn't in horrible shape by any stretch (certainly not enough to justify such a steep sell-off this year), as its operating income of $1.97 billion for the first three months of 2022 was slightly up from the $1.96 billion it reported a year earlier. The steep drop in price has put its valuation at a P/E multiple of less than 18, which is dirt cheap when you consider before the pandemic it wasn't uncommon to see it trade at more than 100 times earnings.
3. PayPal
Fintech company PayPal has lost more than half of its value this year. Net sales totaling $6.5 billion in the company's most recent period (first three months of the year) were only up 7% year over year. That, along with a troubling outlook for an economy that could be facing a recession this year, have made investors wary about loading up on stocks like PayPal that depend on consumer spending to be strong in order to perform well.
But investors also need to remember that PayPal's business looks different now that online marketplace eBay has shifted onto its own managed payment system and is no longer using PayPal's services. When excluding eBay from prior-year comparables, PayPal's revenue rose at a much higher rate of 15% last quarter.
PayPal's stock today trades back at where it was in March 2020, before the boost its business received from the pandemic and a surge in online shopping. And while it's true that softer numbers could be ahead in the near term if there's a recession, e-commerce over the long haul is going nowhere but up. According to estimates from Research and Markets, the global digital payment market will grow at a compound annual rate of 20.5% from now until 2030, when it will be worth more than $361 billion. And you can bet PayPal will be a big benefactor of all that growth.
At a P/E of 25, PayPal looks like a bargain buy, as prior to this year, its shares routinely traded at multiples of 50 times earnings and higher.

Many investors blame the Nasdaq's downfall on fast-rising bond yields which typically boost the appeal of 'risk-free' government bond returns while denting the attraction of growth stocks and their faraway future cash flows.
The outperformance of London's FTSE 100 index and its value-heavy (read cheap) miners and oil majors is quite telling.
So far in 2022, UK blue chips are up 2.4% while the Nasdaq lost close to 20%. Even if one takes out the currency impact of the rising greenback, the London index still hold the upper hand with a drop limited to 5.6% year-to-date.

Tech stocks just did something they haven’t since 2008. And it’s confirming that peak divergence is teeing things up for a historic breakout.
Source: Shutterstock
At the same time, the broader market will struggle and potentially crash.
Folks, I cannot emphasize this enough.
The evidence is becoming overwhelming — indisputable, even. And it just keeps piling up. Over the next few months, the stock market may crash. But we’ve identified a group of stocks that — according to historical analysis — can rise well above the wreckage.
In other words, the choice is clear. Buy these divergent stocks today — or risk getting crushed in a bear market onslaught.
Here’s the latest development…
A Huge Reversal in Tech Stocks Is an Ominous Warning Sign
On Monday, May 2, tech stocks did something they haven’t since 2008 and, before that, 2001.
It’s something tech stocks tend to do only during bear markets and recessions — a massive intraday reversal off a yearly low. You see, the Nasdaq-100 dropped more than 1% on Monday, hitting a new 52-week low. It then reversed course throughout that same day, closing more than 1% higher.
Ostensibly, that’s bullish. At first, it looked like tech stocks would collapse. Instead, they rebounded with vigor.
That seems great, but historically, it’s been an ominous warning sign for stocks.
The Nasdaq-100 has only posted such huge reversals off yearly lows during the early stages of a bear market. This happened four separate times in early 2001, preceding a crash over the next three, six and 12 months. Again, it happened multiple times in late 2008, just before stocks crashed into 2009.
In other words, bullish reversals like the one we saw two days ago are normally just “head fakes.” They are dead cat bounces that result in a deeper stock market correction.
But they are also indicative of a critical “flip” in markets. Certain stocks do start to make a big comeback while the broader markets keep pushing lower.
And those stocks are divergent stocks.
Tech Stock Reversals Normally Kickstart a Divergent Stock Breakout
As you know, we’ve been pounding the table for the past few months over a unique market phenomenon called “divergence.”
Divergence centers around certain high-quality growth stocks seeing their prices diverge from revenues and earnings during periods of market volatility. This once-a-decade phenomenon tends to produce enormous returns for folks who buy the right divergent stocks at the right time… And that’s true even if the markets crash.
Most importantly, this anomaly is emerging right now for the first time in 14 years. And the perfect time to buy has arrived.
So, just last night, we aired an emergency broadcast on the 2022 Divergence. And we delivered an exclusive report on the top stocks to buy now to capitalize on this incredible opportunity.
Immediately after that briefing, I got right back to work analyzing this phenomenon. And that’s when I connected the dots between divergence and the unique reversal pattern that occurred just two days ago.
The connection? While an ominous sign for the broader markets, that reversal tends to be the catalyst for divergent stocks to begin their breakout!
In early 2001, after a streak of these “head fake” reversals, the Nasdaq-100 plunged more than 50% into late 2002. But over that same stretch, certain high-quality divergent stocks like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) all rallied, paced by a 60% gain in AMZN.
The same thing happened in late 2008. Around that time, the Nasdaq-100 pulled off a series of unique intraday reversals off 52-week lows. Over the subsequent few months, the index dropped almost 20%. But certain high-quality divergent stocks like Amazon, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) popped between 20% and 55%!
What the Nasdaq did just two days ago is bearish for the market — but bullish for divergent stocks.
The implication, of course, is that you need to act on the divergence phenomenon today.
The longer you wait, the more at-risk you are of falling victim to a bear market onslaught. On the flipside, the quicker you act, the faster you’ll turn today’s market volatility into your personal opportunity.
The Final Word on a Tech Stock Breakout
Last night, in my Divergence 2022 emergency briefing, I delivered what I believe will go down as the most important message of investment career.
Then I discovered that what we’re seeing today is the perfect setup for divergent stocks to start a big breakout. It’s the same setup these stocks had in 2001 and 2008, leading them to soar while the broader market crashed.
You couldn’t even make this stuff up. All the stars are aligning in a way that I never even imagined was possible.
Divergence 2022 is here. It’s indisputable. It’s unarguable. And it’s the biggest money-making opportunity of the century.
The only question is: Will you capitalize on it? Or are you going to let a bear market onslaught crush your portfolio?

2022-05-03 00:00:00+00:00,Match Group (MTCH) Tops Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/match-group-mtch-tops-q1-earnings-and-revenue-estimates,,,"Match Group (MTCH) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.74 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.66 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.67 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 12.12%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this media and internet company would post earnings of $0.64 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.48, delivering a surprise of -175%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.
Match Group, which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $798.63 million for the quarter ended March 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.50%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $667.61 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Match Group shares have lost about 39% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -12.8%.
What's Next for Match Group?
While Match Group has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Match Group: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.73 on $833.99 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.08 on $3.5 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Commerce is currently in the bottom 32% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
One other stock from the same industry, eBay (EBAY), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2022. The results are expected to be released on May 4.
This e-commerce company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
eBay's revenues are expected to be $2.46 billion, down 18.5% from the year-ago quarter.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-05-03 00:00:00+00:00,There Are 323 Billion Reasons to Like PayPal Stock,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/there-are-323-billion-reasons-to-like-paypal-stock,,,"When PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) reported its first-quarter financial results on April 27, one important number stood out: The electronic-payments giant processed a whopping $323 billion in total payment volume (TPV) during the quarter, up 13% year over year.
While revenue and user growth for this top fintech company have slowed from the pandemic-fueled pace of the past few years, that TPV figure is still a gargantuan amount. And it underscores the increasing importance of PayPal in the world of e-commerce and digital payments.
Image source: Getty Images.
PayPal is the digital-payments trailblazer
Despite ongoing headwinds like inflation, the tough comparison to Q1 2021 (when people received government stimulus checks), the return of in-person shopping, and eBay's transition away from PayPal, the business was still able to process a large and growing amount of payments through its network. This is something anxious shareholders and bearish investors should keep in mind.
After posting TPV of $1.25 trillion in 2021, management estimates it will clear $1.4 trillion this year. That seems likely, given that PayPal now has 429 million active accounts, of which 35 million are merchants. And engagement, as measured by transactions per active account (over the trailing 12-month period), was up 11% year over year to 47.
If we take a step back, we have a clear picture of just how much PayPal has been thriving. From 2015 through 2021, the business increased the number of transactions on its platform from 5.1 billion to 19.3 billion. TPV surged from $288 billion to $1.25 trillion. Net revenue grew from $9.2 billion to $25.4 billion, and free cash flow tripled to $5.4 billion.
This track record makes it difficult to overstate the company's success. PayPal is accepted at 76% of the 1,500 largest online merchants in North America and Europe, easily making it the most ubiquitous digital wallet by a wide margin. The business possesses an incredibly powerful brand recognized for speed and security, which should benefit it for a long time.
PayPal stock looks like a buy
In addition to total payment volume, there's one more key reason to like PayPal stock right now. Because shares have fallen over 70% since reaching an all-time high last July, they now trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 26. That's the lowest multiple PayPal has sold for since the company's spin-off from eBay in July 2015. For a company leading the digital-payments revolution with a superb financial profile, massive user base, and strong brand, this looks like an attractive investment opportunity.
What's more, Wall Street seems to be optimistic as well. Consensus analyst estimates for diluted earnings per share call for compound annual growth of 17.9% from 2021 through 2026. If we assume the P/E multiple of 25 remains the same in five years' time, the projected return is likely to trounce the S&P 500.
Like most companies today, PayPal is battling an extremely uncertain economic environment. Its prospects, however, still look solid.

2022-05-02 00:00:00+00:00,eBay (EBAY) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-ebay-to-report-q1-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-offing,,,"eBay EBAY is scheduled to report first-quarter 2022 results on May 4.

For the first quarter, the company expects net revenues of $2.43-$2.48 billion. On a FX-neutral basis, the year-over-year decline in revenues is anticipated to be 5-7%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.46 billion, implying a decline of 18.5% from the year-ago reported figure.

The company anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.01 and $1.05.

The consensus mark for earnings has been unchanged at $1.03 per share over the past 30 days. This indicates growth of 5.5% from the year-ago reported figure.

The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, while meeting the same once, the average being 2.26%.

Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.
eBay Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  eBay Inc. price-eps-surprise | eBay Inc. Quote
Key Factors to Note
eBay’s strength across Promoted Listings is expected to have continued aiding its momentum across sellers on the back of data-driven recommendations in the first quarter. Also, it is likely to have contributed well to the performance of the company’s advertisement business.

The growing adoption of the company’s Managed Payments is expected to have continued benefiting it in the quarter to be reported. eBay’s deepening focus on scaling managed payments globally is likely to have been another tailwind.

eBay’s strong momentum across the Marketplace platform is expected to have contributed well to its top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.

The company is likely to have benefited from the increasing number of small businesses turning up to the Marketplace platform in order to expand their reach to customers. This is expected to have bolstered the active seller base on the platform.

Moreover, strength across the seller base is expected to have continued to attract customers to the platform, which, in turn, is expected to have aided growth in the active buyer base in the quarter under review.

Increased conversions on its platform and strengthening marketing initiatives are anticipated to have aided the first-quarter performance of the Marketplace platform.

The growing efforts toward the implementation of Artificial Intelligence through personalization, image search technology and customer support are expected to have enhanced the Marketplace platform.

However, the intensifying competition in the e-commerce market is expected to have continued posing challenges to eBay’s position.

The impacts of eBay’s leveraged balance sheet are expected to get reflected in its first-quarter results.

2022-05-01 00:00:00+00:00,3 Things to Watch in the Stock Market This Week,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-things-to-watch-in-the-stock-market-this-week-20,,,"Stocks fell hard last week, as both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) shed roughly 3%. Investors became more worried about issues like inflation and slowing economic growth, and they were disappointed by a few major earnings reports.
Earnings season continues at full speed in the coming days. Hundreds of companies will update investors on their 2022 outlooks in week ahead, and here we'll look at highlights from the long list of announcements on the way, from Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), and DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG).
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Shopify's outlook
Shopify stock has had a rough run since the e-commerce platform announced its last earnings results in February. Shares are down over 40% in the past three months and have slumped by nearly 70% so far in 2022.
Those trends set a low bar for Shopify's Thursday announcement, which is expected to weaker operating results than shareholders have seen in a while.
Management in February projected slow sales growth in Q1, in part because the e-commerce industry received such a huge bump a year ago from COVID-19 lockdowns and government stimulus payments. The lack of a repeat this year should mean unusually low growth in metrics like sales volumes, subscription services, and earnings.
The big question is whether Shopify still expects these trends to improve throughout 2022. While the company's spending is accelerating, investors aren't sure that they'll be a quick growth rebound ahead. That's why Wall Street is acting more cautious about the stock heading into Thursday's announcement.
2. eBay's buyer pool
Investors have some big questions heading into eBay's Wednesday afternoon announcement. The main one is whether the business has finally stabilized, given that its pool of active buyers has declined at an accelerating rate for three consecutive quarters. Sales volumes have been on a similarly poor trend as eBay deals with a growth hangover compared to earlier phases of the pandemic.
The good news is that the marketplace's new revenue streams, advertising and payments, have helped protect overall revenue growth. eBay is also collecting some of its biggest seller fees to date, which is pushing profitability higher. But the company needs to deliver value for those services, which mostly comes from attracting more buyers to the platform. Watch for management to detail their plans for achieving that goal in 2022.
3. DraftKings' losses
Online betting platform DraftKings steps up the earnings plate on Friday, and investors have low expectations about that report. Sure, the company is benefiting from an expanding market for sports betting and growing interest in the niche. These factors recently persuaded management to raise their sales and earnings outlooks.
But competition is rising, too. And DraftKings hasn't demonstrated a path to profitability yet. In fact, net losses expanded in 2021 compared to 2020.
Investors had been more accepting of these losses back when the appetite for growth-focused stocks was higher. But DraftKings may need to show progress toward paring down those losses if it wants to start getting back into Wall Street's good graces this week.

2022-04-30 00:00:00+00:00,Can eBay Turn Things Around in 2022?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-ebay-turn-things-around-in-2022,,,"Because of unusually strong e-commerce demand a year ago, eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is going through a major growth hangover that's likely to pressure the business at least through the first half of 2022. Sales volumes will likely be down significantly in its upcoming first-quarter earnings report, set for May 4. The e-commerce giant might struggle to achieve even flat revenue results for the full year.
Yet eBay has some advantages that help it stand out in the crowded e-commerce industry. It is boosting market share in attractive niches like collectibles, trading cards, and sneakers while adding new revenue lines including payments processing and advertising. And its asset-light operating model allows it to generate tons of cash from a relatively small revenue base.
Let's see whether these wins might help the stock return to a growth path this year.

The buyer pool
Expectations are low for the first-quarter sales metric, which might show a nearly 20% revenue drop year over year when eBay makes its announcement on Wednesday, May 4. The big number to watch is the change in its buyer pool.
Image source: eBay investor presentation.
eBay has shed buyers at an accelerating rate in each of the last three quarters, and that worsening trend might continue for another quarter or two. Last year's growth was phenomenal, after all, as nearly all commerce was happening online due to COVID-19 lockdowns.
Management has predicted that organic sales will decline by as much as 7% this quarter after jumping last year. Ideally, though, the pace of declines in its buyer pool will slow, indicating a stabilizing trend ahead in Q2 that lays the groundwork for a return to growth in the second half of the year. eBay's surest path toward that rebound involves building a bigger platform in pre-owned and collectible product niches like sneakers, trading cards, and luxury watches. Watch for executives to highlight some of these areas on Wednesday.
Price increases
eBay generates much of its profits from the flat transaction fees it charges sellers to use its platform. Sellers often pay a small listing fee, plus a percentage of the sales price. One of its main priorities is boosting the value of those seller services so it can increase those fees over time. New offerings like payments processing and marketplace advertising fit right into that strategy.
However, eBay's fees stalled at 12% of sales last quarter after expanding for over a year. Investors will be looking for evidence that this metric can keep expanding since it directly affects the company's overall profitability.
A new outlook
Management is calling for revenue to land roughly flat in 2022, with modest losses in the first half being offset by a return to growth later in the year. We'll get an important update on that outlook on Wednesday.
Looking further out, watch for CEO Jamie Iannone and his team to talk about the wider rebound picture, which currently sees marketplace volumes returning to growth in fiscal 2023 while accelerating in 2024. Margins should expand over that time, too, with help from those rising fees.
If the latest results keep eBay on that positive path, then investors might have more reasons to consider owning shares. But the stock might not start recovering until the beginning of its operating rebound, which may still be a few months away.

2022-04-29 00:00:00+00:00,3 NFT Stocks Worth Considering if You Like Safety,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-nft-stocks-worth-considering-if-you-like-safety,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Interested in NFTs, but don’t want to buy them directly? These three NFT stocks offer exposure to the market.
Coinbase (COIN): Being one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase is sure to capitalize on the NFT market.
eBay (EBAY): Its popularity can make the stock profitable in the long-term.
Funko (FNKO): An undervalued sleeper stock that is very likely to profit from the NFT market.
The non-fungible token (NFT) market is estimated to be more than $82 billion by 2026, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 40%.
However, investing in NFTs can be pretty risky if you buy them individually. There is no guarantee of their value, and reselling them for a profit can be troublesome if other investors deem these assets of less value.
7 Biggest Loser Stocks That Could Become Surprising Buys
Thus, it is better to invest in public stocks that will indirectly profit from the NFT market. Publicly traded stocks are strictly regulated and are easier to buy and sell for beginners. Here are three stocks that will profit from the growth of the NFT market.
COIN Coinbase $116.76
EBAY eBay $53.71
FNKO Funko $16.59
Coinbase (COIN)

Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, and it allows users to buy NFTs on its platform. Moreover, Coinbase is set to keep dominating the U.S. crypto market, considering its largest competitor Binance is banned in the U.S. Binance did release a U.S. version; however, that version has fewer features, and it is also banned in seven U.S. states.
I believe that Coinbase’s stronghold on the world’s largest economy makes it a good long-term investment. In addition, Coinbase seems to be bottoming out after a 64% decline since November.
The market capitalization of Coinbase stands at $32 billion with an annual revenue of $7.84 billion. However, considering the growth prospects of Coinbase, it is likely undervalued.
Nonetheless, I advise putting a small amount of capital for now. If you wish to buy a significant amount of COIN, I recommend doing so after May 10. The company will be disclosing its first-quarter results on that day, and any disappointing figures can make the stock decline.
eBay (EBAY)

eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) opened its platform for NFT investors last year. The platform currently has 147 million global buyers, which gives eBay a large customer base. Thus, when NFTs start gaining popularity, eBay will indirectly profit from all the sales due to its flat 5% fee.
The stock is down 30% from its all-time high in October last year. However, eBay has been relatively stable since February. eBay’s $31 billion market cap also seems fairly valued considering its quarterly revenue growth slowed to just 2.67% last year.
eBay’s annual revenue stood at $10.4 billion last year, and investors have low expectations for eBay this quarter. Theearnings callon May 4 is likely to break the current steady trajectory.
It is difficult to predict how eBay will be performing until it publishes the first-quarter results. If eBay performs better than expected as it did in the last quarter, it is still unlikely to give it a significant spike.
7 Dividend Stocks Paying Over 5% to Buy Now
Thus, I suggest prioritizing COIN and FNKO before buying eBay, as it will likely take quite some time before eBay can start performing better.
Funko (FNKO)
Source: Lutsenko_Oleksandr / Shutterstock.com
Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO) is a company known for its physical and digital collectibles. It got into the NFT market last year when it launched the Digital Pop. Funko’s collectibles are a $1 billion business, and the company is highly undervalued.
Funko’s $679 million market cap on the stock market is 34% less than its revenue. In addition, Funko’s revenue grew by 48% in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to 40% revenue growth in the third quarter. The revenue is likely even higher this quarter.
Moreover, the stock has been holding stable for nearly a year despite the high revenue growth. If NFTs and collectibles become even more popular, FNKO will be uniquely positioned to capitalize the most from it.
Therefore, FNKO is undoubtedly undervalued in its current state and is a buy.

2022-04-28 00:00:00+00:00,Amazon declines to describe search-algorithm data - Australian regulator,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-declines-to-describe-search-algorithm-data-australian-regulator,,,"By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY, April 28 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O has declined to describe its product-search system to an Australian competition regulator that has heard complaints of large marketplace platforms giving preference to in-house wares.
The company's withholding of the information sets the scene for a possible repeat of Australia's 2021 showdown with Facebook Inc FB.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, which resulted in those firms paying content royalties to the media.
The regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), mentioned Amazon's stance in a report issued on Thursday that was part of the same five-year review of big-tech regulation that involved Facebook and Google.
The ACCC said in the report that it had surveyed 80 online merchants and that nearly half believed large marketplace platforms skewed searches and website presentation to favour in-house products.
Amazon had told the regulator it did not give an advantage to its own products but ""the ACCC sought details about inputs of Amazon's algorithms, which were not provided,"" the report said.
As a result, ""the ACCC does not have information about how Amazon's algorithms produce search results,"" the report said.
An Amazon representative was not immediately available for comment.
Questionnaire results published with the report included several comments accusing Amazon of giving preference to its own products. One unnamed respondent wrote: ""Amazon products are always listed first and then second-hand products are available in small print at the bottom of the listing"".
The ACCC noted that, unlike other large online retail markets, such as those of the United States and Britain, Australia's was not dominated by Amazon. The company did not start operations in the country until 2017.
Its sales in the year to June 2021 were just a quarter of the A$5.3 billion ($3.8 billion) generated by eBay Inc EBAY.O, the ACCC said.
Still, the regulator said that allowing large platforms to give their own products preferential treatment might influence purchasing decisions and damage competition. The platforms should be made to disclose any activities which favoured their own products, it said in the report.
""Hybrid marketplaces, like other vertically-integrated digital platforms, face conflicts of interest and may act in ways that advantage their own products with potentially adverse effects,"" ACCC chairperson Gina Cass-Gottlieb said in a statement accompanying the report.
""We have concerns about particular examples of self-preferencing by hybrid marketplaces in Australia, which mirror similar concerns raised by overseas regulators.""

Many investors are pulling their money out of growth stocks and placing it in safe stocks and dividend stocks. That's a sensible strategy when there's confusion and prices of high-growth stocks are plummeting.
At the same time, low prices create an opportunity that won't necessarily be repeated. Consider that even many of the growth stocks that are losing high percentages of their value are still way above where they started before the crash in March 2020. Take, for example, digital freelance platform Fiverr International. Its stock is down 75% over the past year, but up 75% from its pre-crash price. Fintech company Block is down nearly 60% over the past year, but up 23% from March 2020.

There are many companies that have settled down from extraordinary pandemic performance, and their prices have come down along with that. But they're still great companies posting high growth with excellent long-term prospects. MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is down almost 40% over the past year, but up 60% from before the pandemic, and you might not get an opportunity to buy at this low a price again.
Taking the edge and running with it
MercadoLibre began operations in 1999, when even Amazon and eBay were still in their infancy, giving it a first-mover's edge in the Latin American market.
Based in Argentina, it now operates in 18 Latin American countries and is a leading e-commerce provider in all of them. Its largest markets are its home base of Argentina, as well as Brazil, the largest Latin American country by population, and Mexico. But its Latin American market of nearly 665 million people is about double the U.S. population, and about half of them -- nearly 300 million people -- are already buying online.
That number is expected to grow 20% by 2025, and Latin American e-commerce sales are expected to increase to $160 billion the same year, according to Statista. That's still slower than other emerging markets, giving MercadoLibre a long growth runway. According to payments company Ebanx, Brazil alone has a $156 billion market.
Although MercadoLibre started out focused on e-commerce, it has pivoted to offering a competitive fintech unit in Mercado Pago, its digital payments segment. Mercado Pago was a natural outgrowth of the platform, offering an integrated digital payments system for the network. And it has progressed to a stand-alone digital payments app similar to PayPal or Block's Cash App. Mercado Pago's total payment volume (TPV) increased 73% year over year in the 2021 fourth quarter, and off-platform TPV increased 96% (currency neutral).
The company's says its mission is now ""delivering a suite of technology solutions across the complete value chain of commerce."" Expanding its service line gives it more room to grow as well, and MercadoLibre has acquired many smaller, complementary companies over the years, improving its technology, growing its markets, and altogether making for a more competitive business.
It faces competition from Amazon, which has made tremendous strides internationally, as well as from new Latin American competitors in both e-commerce and fintech. Many other international companies are also ready to pounce on the massive opportunity, such as Sea Limited's Shopee app, which is popular in Brazil.
But MercadoLibre has maintained its No. 1 spot in its top markets.
The numbers are compelling
MercadoLibre absolutely exploded during the pandemic, benefiting from accelerated adoption of e-commerce and digital payments. It posted triple-digit growth for several consecutive quarters and made several new acquisitions to bolster its platform.
Thy hypergrowth is slowing down, but the company is still demonstrating phenomenal performance. Revenue increased 74% year over year (currency neutral) in the fourth quarter to $2.1 billion, and for the year, revenue increased 78% over 2020. Items per buyers increased 17% over 2020 in the fourth quarter, and gross merchandise volume increased 32% despite a challenging environment.
This might be as cheap as it gets
As a high-growth company, MercadoLibre stock typically trades at a high valuation. At the current price, shares trade at 7 times trailing-12-month sales. That's something of a premium compared to other e-commerce companies, but in line with many similar ones. And it's cheap compared to high-growth companies in general, and versus its own historical valuation.

At this price, and with its growth opportunities and track record, MecadoLibre is the stock I'd buy in 2022.

2022-04-25 00:00:00+00:00,Ex-eBay exec pleads guilty to harassing couple whose newsletter raised ire,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ex-ebay-exec-pleads-guilty-to-harassing-couple-whose-newsletter-raised-ire,,,"By Nate Raymond
April 25 (Reuters) - A former eBay Inc security executive pleaded guilty on Monday to harassing a Massachusetts couple who authored a newsletter by arranging anonymous messages on Twitter and home deliveries that included a bloody pig mask and live insects.
Jim Baugh, eBay's former senior director of safety and security, pleaded guilty in Boston federal court to nine counts including conspiracy, stalking through interstate travel and witness tampering.
Baugh is one of seven former eBay workers who were charged in 2020 with harassing the married couple in Natick, Massachusetts, behind the newsletter EcommerceBytes.
They did so after two top executives, including former Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig, expressed frustration with the newsletter, according to prosecutors and a lawsuit the couple, David and Ina Steiner, filed against eBay.
Wenig was not charged and has denied knowing about the scheme. An eBay spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the guilty plea.
Baugh had been set to go to trial on May 31 with another former eBay executive, David Harville, its former director of global resiliency.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Seth Kosto said Baugh, 47, faces 57 to 71 months in prison under federal sentencing guidelines. William Fick, Baugh's lawyer, said he would argue for less. Sentencing was scheduled for Sept. 29.
Prosecutors said the Steiners in August 2019 began receiving anonymous, harassing private messages on Twitter and what Kosto said were ""unwanted and disturbing"" deliveries to their home that also included a book on surviving the loss of a spouse.
Prosecutors said Baugh convened meetings to plan the messages and deliveries with workers who reported to him and traveled with some to Massachusetts to watch the couple and try unsuccessfully to install a GPS on their car.
After learning Natick police were investigating, Baugh and others deleted messages from their social media accounts, and denied to eBay investigators that its employees were involved, prosecutors said.

2022-04-23 00:00:00+00:00,The Market Is Treating PayPal Unfairly,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-market-is-treating-paypal-unfairly,,,"Some stocks have had it worse than others in the past few months. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), among all, has truly had to bear the brunt of the stock market's chaos of late. News of interest rate hikes to squelch rising inflation and geopolitical concerns involving Russia and Ukraine have sparked negative sentiment around growth stocks, particularly companies in the technology sector.
The market is behaving especially irrationally toward PayPal -- the fintech juggernaut saw its share price decline more than 8% in one trading day on April 20. Likewise, the company's stock is down more than 60% in the past six months, quite alarming given the S&P 500 has dropped just 3% over the same period. With the stock well below $100 per share, long-term investors should think twice before passing up PayPal today. It's time to ignore the noise and focus on the fundamentals.
Image source: Getty Images.
What's going on with PayPal?
In addition to battling macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical uncertainty, PayPal issued a subpar forecast on itsearnings conference callto wrap up 2021. Management expects revenue to only grow 6% year over year in the first quarter of 2022, to $6.4 billion. It is also forecasting a 29% decline in earnings from the same quarter a year ago, equal to an earning per share of $0.87. For full-year 2022, management is projecting challenges related to its replacement on eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), costing it as much as $600 million in revenue. eBay, which spun off PayPal in 2015, is transitioning to its own payment platform.
But let's not overreact
There's no doubt management's projections are less than ideal, but investors shouldn't panic. Management is still forecasting its top-line to grow 15% to 17% in 2022, and total payment volume (TPV) is projected to expand more than 20% to about $1.5 trillion. Given PayPal's monstrous size, investors should be very pleased with this level of growth.
It also appears the eBay hardships won't last for much longer -- Dan Schulman, PayPal's chief executive officer, said the company plans to stop adjusting for eBay in the second half of 2022. Investors should be overjoyed with this news, as ex-eBay revenue growth has been consistently above 20%. It's easy to presume that PayPal's fundamentals are underwater considering the company's stock has recently lost over half of its value. But when you read between the lines, you'll notice that PayPal is indeed still in good condition, especially over the long run.
Let's not lose sight of PayPal's balance sheet and cash flow generation, either. The company's $16.3 billion in cash and investments grants it flexibility for future stock buybacks and business-enhancing acquisitions. PayPal also has a debt-to-equity ratio of only 45%, with the lack of leverage indicating PayPal is prepared for any economic situation. Cash is king, right? Well, PayPal is dominating in that domain as well -- the company grew free cash flow and cash from operations by 38% and 31% year over year in the fourth quarter, up to $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.
I'll gladly pay the price for this stock
PayPal is trading at a bargain today. The company has a price-to-earnings multiple of 24, less than half its five-year average multiple of 54. PayPal is also trading at a steep markdown to industry peers Visa and Mastercard, which carry price-to-earnings multiples of 35 and 41 at the moment, respectively.
PYPL PE Ratio data by YCharts
Analysts are forecasting 2023 EPS of $5.76 , meaning shares of the fintech behemoth are trading at just 16 times consensus earnings that year. The correction has gone too far with PayPal -- this stock is cheap, and it's hard to argue otherwise.
Sit back and watch this company recover
Canny investors should view the negative sentiment currently surrounding PayPal's stock as a buying signal. As the abandonment of cash gathers momentum, the demand for PayPal's wide array of payment services will likely increase. The company's long-term fundamental outlook remains largely unaltered despite what the recent plunge in its share price may suggest. And now PayPal's valuation looks more appealing than ever. It's time to add this fintech stock to your portfolio and watch your money grow in the years ahead.

2022-04-21 00:00:00+00:00,Why Amazon Stock Dropped Today,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amazon-stock-dropped-today-0,,,"What happened
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) shareholders lost ground to the market on Thursday as the stock fell 3% by 3:30 p.m. ET, compared to a 1% drop in the S&P 500. The drop pushed the e-commerce giant below the market's return so far in 2022, down 11% since early January.
It came as investors brace for a potentially downbeat earnings report ahead in the next week.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Amazon made a few announcements before the market opened today, including news that it is expanding its Prime shopping service to third-party retailers. The move might help the company attract more sellers as competition heats up with rivals like eBay, Walmart, and Shopify.
Yet the main factor likely driving the stock lower is worries about its upcoming earnings report. Amazon is set to announce first-quarter results on April 28. The company has announced three consecutive quarters of slowing sales gains, and most investors are expecting another slowdown for the early 2022 period.
That slowdown, coupled with increased spending on its distribution network and cloud infrastructure, might spell weaker earnings results ahead through at least this year.
Now what
Some investors see a bright future ahead for the tech giant, though, as it boosts earnings on the cloud-services business and generates higher profits from a rising Prime subscription membership price. Yet those positive factors might not be obvious in Amazon's earnings report next Thursday.
In any case, the stock will likely remain volatile as investors digest the flood of fresh data as earnings season ramps up over the next week or so. And since the pandemic accelerated its growth so much in 2020 and 2021, it should be no surprise to investors if the business faces a period of relatively weaker earnings as it invests in building up its infrastructure.

Shares of semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have been trading in the green for the past couple of days. Reports suggest the ongoing supply chain bottlenecks in graphics processing units (GPUs) will be easing up, potentially kick-starting a rally in NVDA stock.
In January, leading tech publications such as Tom’s Hardware reported a drop in GPU prices. Moreover, prices have gone down an average of 30% in the past three months. Hence, it appears GPU shortages may finally be coming to an end.
Several of Nvidia’s high-end processors are returning to shelves at popular retailers. Moreover, the additional markup users were paying for GPUs is coming down significantly on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and other sites.
The development is a major relief for Nvidia stockholders, which had seen more than a 15% drop in share prices. Nevertheless, the global chip shortage is evolving, especially with new coronavirus cases in China and other macroeconomic headwinds.

Its year-over-year revenue growth in 2021 was a whopping 61%, which is more than 30% higher than its five-year average.  Similarly, its free cash flow has also grown aggressively over the past year with a double-digit increase in its FCF margin.
Considering the enterprise’s leadership in the provision of software and processors, it’s in for another strong showing this year. Most of its users have yet to upgrade to its latest processors, which points to a healthy upside ahead. Therefore, NVDA stock should continue on its positive trajectory in the long run, despite the transitory market turbulence.

2022-04-20 00:00:00+00:00,Why PayPal Plunged Today,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-paypal-plunged-today,,,"What happened
PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) investors have had a rough go of it lately, and Wednesday wasn't any better, with the stock down 6.7% as of 1:43 p.m. ET. The stock is now down nearly 70% from its 52-week highs.
There wasn't much in the way of ""new"" news on Wednesday, but a financial analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities kept his ""underweight"" rating on the stock and lowered his price target. That added to recent negativity brought on by fears over a potential recession as well as by Walmart's poaching of PayPal's chief financial officer last week.
So what
On Wednesday, a SMBC Nikko analyst lowered his price target on PayPal to $105 from $125. That's still a bit higher than Paypal's $97 price as of this afternoon, but investors never like to see the dreaded ""underperform"" rating or the directional action of a lowered price target. Given that PayPal had already fallen so far, one would have hoped for some relief even from former bears. But not today.
This analyst is interesting as he initiated PayPal with an ""underperform"" rating back in November when the stock had a $200 price target. What shareholders wouldn't give for that price again! However, high inflation, geopolitical conflict, and a couple of disappointing earnings reports later, and the analyst keeps moving down his target as the market has soured on fintech stocks in a big way.

Now what
On its last earnings report, PayPal guided for between $4.60 and $4.75 in adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share (EPS) for 2022, which puts the stock at roughly 20.5 times that figure. However, keep in mind that those projections were given before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In addition, investors should prepare for an ugly-looking first quarter as revenue is only projected to grow 6% before accelerating in the back of the year.
That's because PayPal is still running down its eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) business as PayPal's former parent is in the final stages of switching its processing service over to another provider. However, PayPal will still be an option for buyers on eBay's platform. Without the eBay effect, revenue is projected to grow 14%. Management expects the rundown of eBay revenue to finish by mid-year, which is why revenue should accelerate in the back half.
Still, this could be a choppy year for PayPal as there are several moving pieces under the hood. The stock looks like a solid value here if it can hit its guidance for the year and accelerate revenue in the back half. However, given higher interest rates, the war in Ukraine, and mixed signals coming from the U.S. consumer, visibility is low and uncertainty is high.

2022-04-20 00:00:00+00:00,2 Companies That Could Be Worth $1 Trillion by 2030,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-companies-that-could-be-worth-%241-trillion-by-2030,,,"Not long ago, $1 trillion seemed like a near-impossible milestone for a publicly traded company.
As recently as 2018, there were no American companies worth $1 trillion. Today, there are five -- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla -- with the iPhone-maker leading the pack at a market cap of $2.8 trillion. Not long ago, there was a sixth trillion-dollar company, but Facebook-parent Meta Platforms' recent collapse has shaved its market value down to less than $600 billion.
There's no doubt that there will be more $1 trillion companies in the future, and some like Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway are already knocking on the door. Keep reading to see why Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) and Paypal (NASDAQ: PYPL) could also hit the 13-digit mark by the end of the decade.

1. Airbnb
Airbnb has disrupted the travel industry, making everyone's home into a potential hotel. The concept might have once seemed edgy, but it's gone mainstream in only a few years.
While Airbnb has competitors that also offer home-sharing like VRBO, the company's brand is synonymous with the business, and it's also different from many of its competitors because its accommodations are largely from individual hosts rather than professional short-term rental companies.
In order to reach a $1 trillion market cap, a company needs a large addressable market, and there's no question Airbnb has that. In its prospectus ahead of its IPO, the company estimated a $3.4 trillion addressable market between accommodations and experiences. Airbnb isn't going to kill the hotel industry, but market share in lodging is shifting steadily from traditional to apartments and home-sharing accommodations. The pandemic also added to Airbnb's advantage over hotels, as it can offer places to stay anywhere in the world, while traditional hotels tend to be clustered in downtowns, tourist areas, and airports, all of which have struggled over the last two years. Meanwhile, the rise of remote work should help fuel Airbnb's growth as well.
Airbnb is currently trading at a lofty valuation, but the company could grow its revenue by 20% annually over the next decade. That would give it $37 billion in revenue in a decade. That alone won't be enough to get the company to a $1 trillion valuation, but its margins are also ramping up quickly as its business model is scalable. Airbnb's EBITDA margin in 2021 was 26.7%. If that improves to 40% in ten years, the company would have $15 billion in EBITDA, meaning a $1 trillion valuation would price it at 67 times EBITDA. That's well within the company's reach if it executes on its vision for transforming the travel industry. Currently, Airbnb is worth roughly $100 billion.
2. Paypal
Paypal (NASDAQ: PYPL) pioneered online payments, and remains the leader of the industry. The company currently has a market cap of slightly more than $100 billion, but Paypal stock has fallen sharply in recent months amid the broader sell-off in growth stocks, down more than two thirds from its peak last summer.
Indeed, the company's growth rate is taking a breather after a pandemic-driven boom, but Paypal's long-term growth still makes it appealing. The company is forecasting 15%-17% revenue growth this year, or 19%-21% excluding EBay, which said last year it would stop using Paypal to pay its sellers.
Despite the loss of EBay, Paypal still has a number of tailwinds in its favor, including the growth of e-commerce, the movement of payments to digital channels, recent acquisitions like Venmo, and expanding its customer base. It recently became a payment option on DoorDash, for example, through both Paypal and Venmo, and is now used by DoorDash for some of its direct credit card processing.
The best reason though to bet on Paypal right now may be its valuation. Based on its adjusted earnings per share of $4.60 last year, the stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.7, which is cheaper than the S&P 500's P/E multiple at 22.2. With 20% annual EPS growth over the next decade and modest multiple expansion, Paypal could hit the $1 trillion mark in the by 2030.
