2022-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,Is PayPal Stock a Buy After Solid Results and $2 Billion Investment by Elliott Management?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-paypal-stock-a-buy-after-solid-results-and-%242-billion-investment-by-elliott-management,,,"It's been a tough year for PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) investors. The stock peaked late last year after riding the wave of pandemic-related digital payments adoption, but since then, it has slumped by 69%. As the tailwinds from the past couple of years died down, PayPal's management was forced to change gears, spooking investors and driving the stock downward.
Yet there was a slew of surprises and plenty to like in PayPal's second-quarter financial report released on Tuesday after the market closed. Which raises the question: Is PayPal stock a buy? Here's what investors need to know.
A sigh of relief
PayPal's second-quarter financial results weren't as bad as many feared, sparking something of a relief rally. Net revenue of $6.8 billion grew 9% year over year and was up 10%, excluding foreign currency headwinds. Excluding the ongoing transition away from eBay, revenue climbed 14%. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.93, down from $1.15 in the prior-year quarter.
To give those numbers context, analysts' consensus estimates called for revenue of $6.8 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.87, so investors were pleased with the results.
Other metrics pointed to the continued strength of PayPal's underlying business. Total payment volume (TPV) rose 9% year over year, or 13%, excluding foreign currency headwinds, and total payment transactions climbed to 5.5 billion, up 16%. Finally, PayPal added roughly 400,000 net new active accounts (NNA), up 16% year over year, while the number of transactions per account during the trailing-12-month period increased to 48.7, up 12%.
This all shows that while PayPal's growth has shifted into a lower gear, it's still growing.
A startling revelation
After weeks of rumors and innuendo, PayPal confirmed that activist investor Elliott Investment Management had taken a sizable $2 billion stake in the company. In its financial release, PayPal included a statement from Elliott Investment's managing partner Jesse Cohn:
As one of PayPal's largest investors, with an approximately $2 billion investment, Elliott strongly believes in the value proposition at PayPal. PayPal has an unmatched and industry-leading footprint across its payments businesses and a right to win over the near- and long-term.
PayPal also said it had entered into ""an information-sharing agreement"" with Elliott. The tone of the statement signaled that PayPal and the activist investor were making nice -- at least for now.
Reining in spending
That's not all. PayPal revealed that it had undertaken a ""comprehensive operational review"" to lower expenses and make the company more efficient. As a result, management identified roughly $900 million in cost savings for the current fiscal year. Perhaps more importantly, those savings balloon to at least $1.3 billion in 2023. PayPal said it would reinvest a portion of the proceeds in ""high-conviction growth opportunities"" while expanding its operating margin.
PayPal also revealed that the board of directors had authorized a robust capital return program, including a new $15 billion share repurchase plan. PayPal has already completed $2.25 billion in buybacks so far this year, representing roughly 95% of the company's free cash flow, and expects repurchases to reach about $4 billion by the end of the year.
Is PayPal stock a buy?
This all leads us back to the original question: Is PayPal stock a buy?
There's no denying that e-commerce purchases have slipped as in-store shopping returned. Furthermore, the onset of the bear market made it clear that PayPal users -- particularly those at the lower end of the income spectrum -- were feeling the pinch of inflation, causing spending to fall and ultimately hurting its bottom line.
PayPal has already taken a number of steps to streamline its business, reignite growth, and ramp up cost-cutting. The company reacted to the current environment by focusing on increasing the engagement of its existing users, making them more valuable rather than chasing new, lower-yielding users. PayPal has also slowed hiring and reduced existing staffing levels.
Management appears to have taken many of the steps necessary to achieve these goals, and its efforts appear to be bearing fruit. PayPal raised its full-year outlook and is now guiding for adjusted EPS in a range of $3.87 and $3.97, up from its previous guidance of between $3.81 and $3.93.
Additionally, PayPal is currently trading at a historically low valuation, selling for less than four times forward sales -- near its all-time low.
If you believe, as I do, that digital payments will continue to gain ground, PayPal is well positioned to benefit from the trend and is the clear choice as the original -- and still dominant -- fintech platform. That, and its bargain basement price, makes PayPal stock a buy.

Factors to Consider
eBayâs second-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from strong momentum across the Marketplace platform.
EBAY is gaining traction among small business owners who are leveraging the Marketplace to expand their reach to customers. This is expected to have remained positive in the underlined quarter.
Also, the increasing number of small businesses is expected to have attracted more customers to the platform. This is likely to have aided growth in the active buyer base during the quarter under review.
Continuous efforts to strengthen the Authenticity Guarantee service for acquiring loyalty of customers are expected to have driven top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.
Also, EBAYâs recent initiative to let buyers shop from sellers across a wide range of refurbished inventory, backed by its moneyback guarantee and warranties, might have remained another positive.
EBAY is expected to have gained momentum among collectible enthusiasts on the back of its robust tools. This is likely to have benefited its trading card business in the quarter to be reported.
During the second quarter, eBay introduced eBay vault, a digital marketplace for single and top-graded trading cards. The vault is equipped with the Price Guide and Collections tool, which helps vault users track the real-time valuation of their trading card portfolios and list cards directly from their collection. This is likely to have been a tailwind.
The growing adoption of new products and increased optimization are likely to have benefited eBayâs advertising business in the second quarter. Strength in Promoted Listings is expected to have helped eBay gain momentum among sellers. Also, solid promoted listings momentum might have continued driving eBayâs advertising revenues.
However, rising competitive pressure from e-commerce giants like Amazon is likely to have continued posing a challenge to eBayâs market position.
Uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic, impacts of the Russian-Ukraine war, supply-chain constraints and inflationary pressures are likely to get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.

2022-08-02 00:00:00+00:00,Buy the Dip on This Fintech Stock During the Nasdaq Bear Market?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-the-dip-on-this-fintech-stock-during-the-nasdaq-bear-market,,,"The war on cash, a phrase that refers to the shift from physical currency to digital payments, is in full motion. By 2030, the mobile payment market is forecast to reach $588 billion, equal to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35.3% from 2022, according to Grand View Research. Understanding that secular trend, prudent investors should be very intrigued after having watched the Nasdaq Composite tumble 21% since the start of the year.
With many financial technology (fintech) stocks now trading at record lows, long-term investors have many promising buying opportunities. One company in particular, PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), has grabbed my attention of late. The fintech giant is not only highly profitable and cash-flow positive, but it also reigns over 50.3% of the online payment processing environment. And despite its top-end positioning in a massive secular growth market, the company has shed 53% of its value year to date.
Let's dive into PayPal's situation and determine whether it's a smart investment right now.
Image source: Getty Images.
What's new for PayPal?
On July 27, PayPal's's shares rallied more than 10% after news surfaced that an activist investor, Elliott Management, has been steadily accumulating the stock. It's suspected that the investment firm plans to take a large stake in the company so that it can expedite PayPal's cost-cutting measures. While this could be interpreted as positive news for the mobile payment firm, I'd rather focus on the underlying fundamentals of its business.
Per its first-quarter earnings report, the company's total sales grew 7.5% year over year to $6.5 billion, and its diluted earnings per share contracted 27.9% to conclude at $0.88. Typical of many fintech companies today, management cited a host of reasons why growth is slowing, most notably softness in e-commerce, eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) continued transition to its own payment platform, and runaway inflation that is damping consumer spending.
Regarding other key metrics, PayPal's total payment volume (TPV) rose 13.1% to $323.0 billion, and it added 2.4 million new accounts during the quarter to bring its total to 429 million.
Investors should anticipate a bumpy ride for the remainder of 2022 -- Wall Street analysts estimate the company's total revenue will climb 11.1% year over year, up to $28.2 billion, and its earnings per share to decline 16.3% to $3.85. The narrative should improve next year, however, with analysts forecasting top- and bottom-line growth of 16% and 23.1%, respectively. PayPal is set to disclose its second-quarter earnings report today.
Do I recommend buying PayPal today?
For several reasons, I urge investors to consider buying PayPal stock right now. First, unlike much of its competition, the company has proven to be extremely profitable and cash-flow positive, generating $1.1 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in its first quarter alone. Second, PayPal is a dominant force in a rapidly growing market, and the company continues to diversify its business with offerings like peer-to-peer payment platform Venmo and a buy now, pay later option. Lastly, the stock has a price-to-earnings multiple of about 29 at the moment, a hefty discount to its five-year average of more than 57.
It's clear that many investors have temporarily fallen out of love with this fintech juggernaut, but that doesn't mean wise investors should shy away today.

2022-08-01 00:00:00+00:00,Pinterest shares surge after Elliott discloses it is the largest shareholder,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pinterest-shares-surge-after-elliott-discloses-it-is-the-largest-shareholder,,,"By Yuvraj Malik
Aug 1 (Reuters) - Activist investor Elliott Investment Management disclosed on Monday it had become the largest shareholder in Pinterest Inc PINS.N, backing the management of the digital pin-board firm and sending the company's shares up 21%.
Pinterest has ""significant potential for growth"", which led Elliott to become its largest shareholder, Elliott managing partner Jesse Cohn and senior portfolio manager Marc Steinberg said in a statement.
Elliott did not disclose its stake in Pinterest. However, the Wall Street Journal reported in July that the investment firm had amassed a more than 9% stake. (https://reut.rs/3zp1smr)
The firm on Monday backed Pinterest Chief Executive Bill Ready, who took over on June 29, and also commended co-founder Ben Silbermann for the leadership transition.
Elliott and the Pinterest management had ""a very collaborative and engaged dialogue"" recently, Ready said on a post-earnings conference call.
""As a visual search engine, Pinterest offers a distinct way for businesses to market. I think Elliott may be on to something here,"" said Michael Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital.
Elliott has also been building up stake in PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL.O, Bloomberg News has reported (https://reut.rs/3QcHXnL), and has previously bought stakes in companies including eBay inc EBAY.O, Twitter Inc TWTR.N and AT&T Inc T.N.
Pinterest's shares were up at $24.36 after the bell on Monday, still way off their record high of $89.90 hit in February 2021, when people, cooped up at home during the pandemic, thronged the company for inspiration for projects.
The statement from Elliott came as Pinterest reported a lower-than-expected profit due to higher costs and users spending less time on its platform.
Like its peers, Pinterest has suffered from advertisers cutting back on budgets in response to increasing costs and recession fears.
The company saw weakness from advertisers in the consumer packaged goods category, big-box retailers and mid-market advertisers, finance chief Todd Morgenfeld said, adding that the digital advertising environment will continue to be challenging.
The company said it expected revenue growth of mid single-digit percentage in the current quarter, crimped by the impact of a stronger dollar.

2022-07-31 00:00:00+00:00,3 Things to Watch in the Stock Market This Week,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-things-to-watch-in-the-stock-market-this-week-33,,,"Stocks jumped last week, despite news that the U.S. economy has now contracted for two consecutive quarters. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) gained over 3% on hopes that corporate earnings will see a soft landing in the second half of 2022 after soaring for most of the past two years.
Hundreds of companies will update investors on their 2022 outlooks in week ahead, and collectively these announcements will answer many questions investors have about consumer spending and broader economic growth trends. Let's take a closer look at three of these reports, from Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA), Molson Coors (NYSE: TAP), and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY).
1. EA's audience size
Investors have some big questions heading into the fiscal first-quarter earnings report from Electronic Arts on Tuesday. The video game giant's last update contained lots of good news. Net bookings grew at an 18% rate, or about as fast as they had grown in earlier phases of the pandemic. EA's steady drumbeat of new content releases in hit franchises like Apex Legends and EA Sports helped keep audience size growing through early 2022.
That success has investors feeling playful heading into Tuesday's report, with revenue projected to fall by about 1% compared to booming results a year earlier. The big question is whether the company can quickly return to growth following a slight pullback in demand for digital content, just as Netflix projected in mid-July.
In any case, EA is becoming financially stronger, with margins rising and cash flow improving to over $2 billion per year. Assuming no major content delays, those gains should support solid investor returns from here.
2. Molson Coors' market share
Look for volatility around Molson Coors' earnings update on Tuesday morning. The alcoholic beverage giant's stock has trounced the market this year, up over 20% even as the S&P 500 fell by over 15%. That gap will be tested this week.
The owner of the Coors and Miller Light beer brands announced in early May that sales volumes jumped 10%, allowing it to win market share against peers such as Anheuser-Busch, Constellation Brands, and Boston Beer. Demand is tilting toward many of its core beer products, but the company is also succeeding in the premium niche that includes brands like Topo Chico, Simply Spiked, and Molson Ultra.
Investors will want to see more wins in these arenas on Tuesday. Molson ideally will also maintain its bright earnings outlook, which calls for a modest profitability increase despite soaring costs. If executives continue to project higher margins this week, the stock will likely attract more attention from investors seeking a recession-proof business with solid pricing power.
3. eBay's buyer pool
There has been a dramatic shift in sentiment around eBay's business that can be traced directly to its growth hangover. After soaring in earlier phases of the pandemic, organic growth turned negative in recent quarters, and investors aren't happy about it.
Look for further declines in Wednesday's earnings update. eBay executives projected organic sales would fall by as much as 9% this quarter, with losses moderating for the rest of fiscal 2022.
Watch the buyer pool for signs of an impending rebound. eBay shed 13% last quarter and 9% in the previous one. The stock's trajectory will likely depend on how well the marketplace platform can succeed at slowing and then reversing those losses over the next few quarters.

2022-07-28 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting EBAY Put And Call Options For September 9th,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-ebay-put-and-call-options-for-september-9th,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options become available today, for the September 9th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new September 9th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $47.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.12. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $47.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $44.88 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $47.34/share today.
Because the $47.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.51% return on the cash commitment, or 38.29% annualized â at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $47.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $48.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.95. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $47.34/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $48.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.51% if the stock gets called away at the September 9th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $48.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $48.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.12% boost of extra return to the investor, or 34.96% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $47.34) to be 37%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-07-28 00:00:00+00:00,Is eBay Stock a Buy Right Now?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-ebay-stock-a-buy-right-now,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is one of the pioneers of e-commerce. It's easy to forget that for several years eBay controlled a more significant share of the online sales market than Amazon. Of course, everyone knows Amazon has exploded since then, but eBay has been a formidable force for nearly two decades.
The company is mature enough that it even started paying a dividend in 2019. eBay is in certain ways a lower-risk stock that exposes investors to the growth of the e-commerce industry. Let's look at its performance, weigh that against its valuation, and answer if investors should buy eBay's stock right now.
eBay has room to expand profits
The primary reason why investing in eBay is less risky than Amazon is because eBay runs an asset-light business model. Amazon has spent billions of dollars building its fulfillment centers and logistics infrastructure. Further, Amazon owns many of the products sold on its platform. As Amazon grows more prominent, it requires more significant capital investment to enable its expansion.
In stark contrast, eBay does not own any of the inventory on its platform. Moreover, it leaves shipping and handling to settle between buyers and sellers. That way, eBay relieves itself from the massive capital investments in fulfillment centers. Instead, eBay invests in its platform, where it brings buyers and sellers together to transact. eBay takes a percentage of those transactions as revenue. That has undoubtedly helped eBay grow earnings per share (EPS) at a compound annual rate of 23.6% in the last decade.
EBAY Inventories (Quarterly) data by YCharts.
eBay participated in the boom of online shopping during the pandemic. Its revenue grew by 19.7% in 2020 and 17.2% in 2021. The company will, likewise, experience the headwinds from economies reopening, giving consumers more options on where to spend their money. Still, many shoppers who joined eBay during the pandemic will stick around long term.
Moreover, eBay made a few changes to the business, enhancing its monetization of transactions. eBay's take rate, which measures the percentage of gross merchandise sales it takes as revenue, increased from 10% to 12.1% from the fourth quarter of 2020 to Q1 2022. That means eBay will capture a more significant percentage of sales on its platform.
There is reason to believe that eBay's increase in take rate will not repel buyers and sellers. Rival Etsy, which runs a similar business model, has a take rate of 17.8%. Etsy's rate suggests eBay may have room to expand its take rate over time.
eBay's valuation makes it less risky than rivals
EBAY PS Ratio data by YCharts.
Another element that makes eBay less risky than its e-commerce rivals is its more favorable valuation. eBay ranks lowest overall when measured by a combination of the price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, and price-to-free-cash-flow metrics (see chart above).
eBay is an excellent business that has proven itself over decades and now sells at a favorable valuation. For these reasons, it can be a wonderful time to buy eBay stock.

2022-07-26 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: eBay or Etsy?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-ebay-or-etsy,,,"E-commerce stocks thrived at the pandemic's onset. Hundreds of millions of folks were looking to avoid shopping in person and flocked online to find the things they wanted and needed. eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) and Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) were beneficiaries as sales surged.
That said, now that economies are reopening, the tailwind is turning into a headwind. Given that backdrop, let's consider which is the better stock to buy: eBay or Etsy.
eBay
Importantly, and this is also true for Etsy, eBay does not own the inventory listed on its platform. Instead, it acts as a middleman, bringing buyers and sellers together to transact. eBay takes a percentage of these transactions as revenue.
It's been a challenging decade for eBay. Its revenue has actually contracted over the past 10 years, declining at a compound annual rate of 1.1%. However, this is primarily due to divestitures. For instance, in Q2 2021, eBay sold 80% of its Korean marketplace business to Emart for $3 billion.
More impressively, eBay has expanded earnings per share at a compound annual rate of 23.6% in that time. Given its asset-light business model, when revenue exploded in 2020 and 2021 in response to the pandemic, the bulk of it flowed to the bottom line.
Admittedly, the economic reopening is a troubling headwind, causing revenue in its most recent quarter, which ended on March 31, to fall by 5%. There is no telling how far this will decrease as folks have more options for spending their money as the pandemic eases. Still, eBay's business has proven resilient through several economic cycles, so investors can expect it to overcome these headwinds relatively unscathed.
Moreover, compared to Etsy, eBay's stock is a relative bargain at a price-to-sales ratio of 2.9 versus Etsy's 6.1.
EBAY PS Ratio data by YCharts
Etsy
Etsy is a younger version of eBay in many ways. It, too, runs an asset-light business model that brings buyers and sellers to the platform to transact. Etsy bills itself as a destination for folks looking to buy unique, hand-crafted items. For instance, Etsy's sales exploded at the pandemic's onset as people flocked to the site to purchase hand-crafted face masks.
EBAY Revenue (Annual YoY Growth) data by YCharts
Of course, younger, smaller companies often grow faster than their counterparts, and Etsy has not been the exception. Its revenue has exploded from $75 million in 2012 to $2.3 billion in 2021. Impressively, Etsy turned profitable in 2017, earning $0.68 per share, which increased to $3.40 in 2021.
Etsy faces the same economic reopening headwinds as eBay, but revenue growth is decelerating rather than turning negative like its rival. Customers are diverting spending away from e-commerce sites toward away-from-home experiences like restaurants, travel, and movie theaters.
eBay is the better stock to buy now
While both are excellent asset-light businesses, delivering robust earnings per share, if you had to pick only one stock to buy, it should be eBay. It comes down to valuation. eBay is selling at less than half the price-to-sales ratio as Etsy, and having already achieved scale in customers and sellers, it's a more resilient business.

However, at its current price of $46, the stock is trading 25% below its fair value of $61 â Trefisâ estimate for eBayâs valuation. 
The company operates an online marketplace âeBay.com,â where third-party buyers and sellers can transact in a variety of products. While it surpassed the consensus estimates in the first quarter of 2022, the net revenues of $2.5 billion were still 6% lower than the year-ago figure. This was mainly due to the easing of Covid-19-related restrictions, and the re-opening of retail stores, leading to a decline in online sales on a year-on-year basis. Notably, eBayâs gross merchandise value (GMV) decreased 20% y-o-y in Q1. Further, the company presented a lower-than-expected growth outlook for the second quarter, which failed to impress the investors. This has made investors somewhat cautious about the stock, resulting in a 15% decline since the Q1 results. 
Online sales numbers have normalized in 2022. Further, the tough macroeconomic outlook due to high inflation figures, aggressive interest rate hikes, and the Russia-Ukraine crisis is likely to hurt the consumer discretionary spending levels. Overall, we expect the net sales to see a year-on-year decrease in the second quarter. Notably, consensus estimates for Q2 revenues and earnings are around $2.37 billion and $0.89 respectively. 
The firm posted strong results in 2021, with net sales increasing by 17% y-o-y to $10.4 billion. Moving forward, we expect the revenues to remain under pressure for the subsequent quarters. Altogether, eBayâs revenues are estimated to touch $10.2 billion in FY2022. Further, its net income from continuing operations is likely to remain around $2.3 billion. This coupled with an annual EPS of $3.77 and a P/E multiple of just above 16x will lead to the valuation of $61.
Here youâll find our previous coverage of eBay stock, where you can track our view over time.
With inflation rising and the Fed raising interest rates, eBay has fallen 31% this year. Can it drop more? See how low can eBay stock go by comparing its decline in previous market crashes. Here is a performance summary of all stocks in previous market crashes.

2022-07-24 00:00:00+00:00,Here's How Inflation Could Take a Major Toll on PayPal's Business,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-how-inflation-could-take-a-major-toll-on-paypals-business,,,"Shares of major fintech companies have taken a beating in the past several months. Businesses like Adyen, Block, and Upstart Holdings have gotten crushed as higher interest rates and the expectation of slower economic growth squeeze valuation multiples and damp the previously rosy outlooks for these enterprises.
PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), perhaps the leader in the fintech industry, hasn't been spared. Since hitting an all-time high of more than $310 about a year ago, its stock has fallen more than 70% for many of the same reasons hurting the rest of the industry. Plus, with inflation still soaring according to June's consumer price index number, I'm worried that PayPal's business will continue to be negatively impacted.
Let's take a closer look.
PayPal leans on discretionary purchases
""At the same time that is happening, there is the effect of a weaker economy and more inflation putting pressure on disposable income for consumers,"" then-Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said on the Q1earnings call ""One of the things that we've seen on our platform during the pandemic is certainly a shift to more discretionary items versus non-discretionary,"" he continued. ""And again, the non-discretionary items, think of things like gas, food, energy, those are not necessarily where all of our strengths are.""
With the price of seemingly everything going up substantially over the past several months, it's obvious that households that are forced to stretch their budgets would prioritize staples over nice-to-have discretionary goods. And this situation doesn't bode well for PayPal's business. Consumers will tighten their spending in anticipation of difficult economic times. The result is less payment volume and revenue for PayPal.
Last year, PayPal processed $1.25 trillion in total payment volume (TPV) and generated revenue of $25.4 billion. Management, led by Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman, had originally forecast 2022 TPV and revenue to come in at $1.5 trillion and over $29 billion, respectively. But these estimates have since come down. Thanks to the inflationary environment, the fading impact of government stimulus, and the return of in-person shopping, PayPal is now expected to post TPV of $1.4 trillion this year on sales of $28.4 billion (at the midpoint). Throw in the threat of a looming recession and the outlook can turn negative quickly.
As of Dec. 31, PayPal's payment checkout option was available at 76% of the top 1,500 online merchants in North America and Europe, easily making it the most accepted digital wallet. What's more, Venmo, PayPal's consumer-facing personal-finance mobile app, counted 70 million annual active users in 2021. The company's huge size, exemplified by the 429 million accounts it had as of March 31, is a key competitive advantage for the business. But there's no doubt that raging inflation and a possible economic slowdown would meaningfully hinder activity on PayPal's platform.
PayPal is a quality business
Despite the near-term headwind of inflation, PayPal is still a superb business from a financial perspective. In 2021, the company posted a gross margin of 47% and an operating margin of 17%. Additionally, because capital expenditures usually represent just 4% of revenue, PayPal was able to produce $5.4 billion of free cash flow last year. That's outstanding any way you look at it.
Wall Street is bullish on the company's prospects. Consensus analyst estimates call for revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 13.5% between 2021 and 2026, while also forecasting earnings per share to increase 15.1% per year during the same time. PayPal's current price-to-earnings ratio of 25 is the lowest it's been since the company's spin-off from eBay in 2015. Therefore, based on these assumptions, it's not unreasonable for investors to expect that shares can double over the next five years.
Inflation is impacting every business today, and PayPal is no exception. Luckily, its massive user base, history of growth, and stellar financials place the odds of long-term success in its favor.

2022-07-22 00:00:00+00:00,What To Expect From Amazon Stock?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-amazon-stock,,,"Amazonâs stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) has lost roughly 29% YTD as compared to the 17% drop in the S&P500 index over the same period. However, at its current price of $118, the stock is trading 36% below its fair value of $183 â Trefisâ estimate for Amazonâs valuation. 
Amazon derives revenues from online & physical stores, third-party seller services, subscription services, advertising services, and amazon web services (AWS). It posted weak results in the first quarter of 2022, with earnings missing the mark but revenues being just in-line. While the net sales improved 7% y-o-y to $116.4 billion, the growth was quite low as compared to the 44% jump seen in Q1 2021. Further, the firm reported a loss of -$3.8 billion in the quarter. It was partly due to higher expenses as a % of revenues and partly due to a $7.6 billion loss from equity securities of Rivian Automotive. In addition to this, the company presented lower than expected guidance numbers for the second quarter. This has made investors cautious about the stock, resulting in an 18% decline since the Q1 results. 
Growth in net sales has slowed down as compared to the previous year, due to the easing of the Covid-19-related restrictions, the high rate of Covid-19 vaccination, and the re-opening of offline retail stores. Further, operating expenses increased due to high inflation, labor shortages, and geopolitical crisis. We expect the same trend to continue in the second quarter. Notably, consensus estimates for Q2 revenues and earnings are around $119.43 billion (up 4% y-o-y) and $0.16, respectively. 
The company posted strong results in 2021. Its net sales increased 22% y-o-y to $469.8 billion and the net income improved 56% to $33.4 billion. Moving forward, we expect the operating income to remain under pressure for the subsequent quarters due to an unfavorable increase in expenses and a slow revenue growth rate. Overall, Amazonâs revenues are estimated to touch $529 billion in FY2022. Further, its net income is likely to remain around $13.7 billion. This coupled with an annual EPS of $1.34 and a P/E multiple of 136x will lead to the valuation of $183.

LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - Searches for air conditioning units and fans have quadrupled and tripled respectively in Britain over the last week, eBay Inc told Reuters on Tuesday, as the country recorded its highest ever temperature of 40C (104F).

2022-07-19 00:00:00+00:00,This Billionaire Investor Is Buying Pinterest Stock. Should You?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-billionaire-investor-is-buying-pinterest-stock.-should-you,,,"Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) investors got a rare piece of good news on Thursday evening when The Wall Street Journal reported that activist investor Elliott Management has accumulated a 9% stake in the social media company.
Shares of Pinterest jumped 16% on the news on Friday, showing investors are hungry for a positive catalyst after the stock fell roughly 75% from its peak last year. Helmed by billionaire Paul Singer, Elliott is known for its aggressive tactics in its tech investments. For example, it pushed for Jack Dorsey's resignation as CEO of Twitter and successfully urged eBay to spin off its Stubhub and Classified businesses.
Pinterest just named a new CEO with co-Founder Ben Silbermann moving to the Executive Chairman. The company is bringing in Bill Ready as CEO, who previously led Alphabet's e-commerce and payments business.
That move shows Pinterest doubling down on a strategy it's already talked about repeatedly on earnings calls: building an e-commerce business to complement its core advertising model.
Elliott has held discussions with Pinterest over the last several weeks as it's built its stake in the company, though it's unclear what the two parties have discussed.
Pinterest, which serves as an image-discovery engine allowing users to post or search images to help with projects like children's activities, wedding planning, or home improvement, is a unique property in social media. With nearly 500 million monthly active users, the business would appear to have significant potential.
However, investors have soured on the company as its user base declined last year as the pandemic boom faded and some of its new users returned to real-world activities. At the same time, the company's once sky-high revenue growth has returned to earth, with the top line growing 18% to $575 million in the first quarter. Second-quarter guidance called for just an 11% revenue increase.
With its stake in Pinterest now worth more than $1 billion, Elliott clearly sees an opportunity in Pinterest. Should you follow the activist investor into the struggling social media stock?
The good news
While the market may have bailed on the image-sharing site, there are a number of reasons to like Pinterest stock right now, especially at the current price.
First, the user decline is over, though year-over-year figures are still falling. In the first quarter, the company recorded 433 million MAUs, which was down 9% from Q1 2021 but a slight improvement from the 431 million MAUs it had in Q4 2021. That's a sign that the hangover from the pandemic boom is fading and the company's user base should return to steady growth.
Unlike a number of tech sector growth stocks, Pinterest is also profitable. It finished 2021 with $814.3 million in adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), or a 32% margin. Even on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, the company brought in $318 million in net income, or $0.46 per share. Profit margins are expected to shrink this year as top-line growth slows and the company invests in areas like native content, Pinner experience, and shopping, but that's no cause for alarm.
As Pinterest and its peers have demonstrated time and time again, digital advertising is a high-margin business at scale.
The risks
The pandemic was something of a white elephant for Pinterest and other tech stocks. Performance boomed during the social distancing period, but now that that surge has disappeared, the market's perception of the business is broken, and it's unclear whether Pinterest can deliver strong organic growth again or if the company was just the beneficiary of a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic.
While being a unique business has its advantages, it also means Pinterest's business model is unproven, and there is some evidence that the company struggles to convert new users into frequent users. Unlike sites like Facebook or Snapchat, users don't come to Pinterest to connect with friends, so the impetus to visit the site regularly is based strictly on need or a specific use case rather than a social connection. Compared to its social media peers, that appears to be a weakness.
Should you buy Pinterest?
On balance, the pros seem to outweigh the cons here. In particular, Pinterest looks oversold as the sell-off is primarily due to temporary conditions. For example, the decline in users has since ended, consumer behavior is shifting back to real-world activities, there is a slowdown in advertising due to Apple's privacy changes, and fears of a recession weigh on business investments.
The stock is down because of those temporary conditions, but the core value proposition of Pinterest is still clear. It attracts more than 400 million users at least once a month, and it delivers an experience they can't get anywhere else. The platform is also especially valuable to advertisers because, unlike other social media sites, users want to see ads. Often, they come to the site with a purchase intent, something that doesn't happen with Facebook or Instagram.
That quality is what gives Pinterest so much potential to an investor like Elliott and why it makes so much sense for the company to invest in e-commerce. Selling directly on the site seems like a no-brainer, and if the company can make it work, the stock should be in a much better place five years from now.
At the current price, the downside to owning Pinterest seems limited. And with a market cap of just $13 billion and the explosive potential of e-commerce, the upside could easily lead to long-term gains of 5x or even 10x.

2022-07-16 00:00:00+00:00,MercadoLibre Stock: Bull vs. Bear,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mercadolibre-stock%3A-bull-vs.-bear,,,"For a company demonstrating powerful growth and harnessing incredible opportunity, you don't need to look further than MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI). The Latin American e-commerce giant posted triple-digit growth over four consecutive quarters at the beginning of the pandemic.
But that's decelerating as macroeconomic trends take a hit on retail and the economy at large, and MercadoLibre profits are suffering as well. The company is also facing strengthening competition from the likes of Amazon and Sea Limited.
MercadoLibre's stock is now down more than 50% this year. Does that make this a great opportunity to buy shares, or should buyers beware?
Demonstrated success with a huge market opportunity
Jennifer Saibil: Many companies that demonstrated dizzying growth during the pandemic are now slowing down, and MercadoLibre is as well. There are several important differences, though. Paramount is that it's still posting exceptional progress. 2022 first-quarter sales rose 67% year over year, which puts it squarely in high-growth mode. Total payment volume (TPV) increased 81%, and gross merchandise volume was up 32%. This is a company with momentum.
And it's easy to see why. MercadoLibre is a force in Latin America, bringing many countries into the digital age. It provides e-commerce services similar to companies like Amazon or eBay, but it also offers digital payment services, not unlike when PayPal was a part of eBay. Its current dominance in the region -- it operates the largest e-commerce and digital business in its region and is a market leader in all 18 countries in which it operates -- combined with its strong venture culture gives it an edge in this vast emerging market.
According to Lazard, the top-five global emerging markets include Mexico and Brazil, which are two out of three of MercadoLibre's biggest markets (the third is its headquarters of Argentina). These five countries started 2020 with the same e-commerce penetration rates that the five highest-developed countries had in 2014. There were 300 million digital buyers in Latin America in the second half of 2021, according to Statista, and that number is expected to grow 20% by 2025. Consider that in 2021, the U.S. saw $85 billion in e-commerce sales, while Latin America had only $64 billion, and yet the Latin American population is almost exactly double the U.S. number.
The company is facing some pressures on its bottom line as it invests in growth, but this is a top growth company that has already posted profits. That should give wary investors some more confidence as well.
Short-term headwinds could become long-term issues
Jamie Louko: The biggest concern for MercadoLibre investors lies in the possibility of a decline in activity over the coming year or two, which could result in long-term damage. Like the United States, Latin America is seeing high inflation rates. In some of MercadoLibre's biggest markets like Brazil and Mexico, inflation has surpassed 5%. Some projections even peg Latin America's inflation rate above 10% in 2023.
Similar to what is happening in the U.S., high inflation on need-to-have goods will likely suppress demand for discretionary goods sold on MercadoLibre's e-commerce platform. Additionally, rising costs could make it more expensive for MercadoLibre's logistics service, Mercado Envios, to deliver goods.
Over the short term, MercadoLibre could see a higher cost of goods and lower revenue, resulting in poor profitability. The company's net income margin is already just 2.3%, but this uncertain short term could send it even lower.
These short-term issues could affect the long-term prospects of MercadoLibre, too. The company had a free cash flow burn of $370 million in the first quarter, which would likely worsen if profitability were to drop.
If MercadoLibre became an unprofitable, cash-burning business, it might struggle to choose between staying operational and capturing market share. If it picked self-preservation, that could allow rivals like Sea Limited to gain share in the e-commerce space. Currently, Sea Limited's Shopee is the second-largest e-commerce business in Brazil in terms of monthly active users, but that could change and leave MercadoLibre falling behind.
With a population of 650 million in Latin America, MercadoLibre has just scratched the surface of its opportunity, considering it had 81 million active users in Q1. However, to fully capture all the region's benefits, it should be the leader. The short-term issues the company is currently facing could hurt those prospects, making MercadoLibre a risky investment today.
Should you buy MercadoLibre stock?
MercadoLibre stock is now 65% off its high last year. At this price, shares are trading at about 4.5 times trailing 12-month sales, which is quite cheap for a company posting high double-digit growth.
The opportunity here looks very compelling. However, the short-term pressure certainly adds in an element of risk. For those who can stomach that risk, MercadoLibre looks like an excellent long-term buy.

2022-07-16 00:00:00+00:00,3 Passive Income Generators Down Between 29% and 36% to Buy On the Dip,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-passive-income-generators-down-between-29-and-36-to-buy-on-the-dip,,,"While high-yield stocks may seem more alluring to investors looking to create passive income, looking for smaller, easily funded dividends is frequently the more prudent long-term strategy.
Though the dividend payments may be lighter up front, these lower-yielding stocks often come with smaller payout ratios -- thereby giving them more significant dividend potential over the long term if bought and held.
Today, three Motley Fool contributors will explain why the recent price declines for Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), Lowe's (NYSE: LOW), and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) could be a perfect opportunity to generate passive income over the long haul.
The returning CEO bought shares; should you?
Bradley Guichard (Starbucks): You'd think that Starbucks is in dire straits by the share price's 33% decline this year. The company does have its share of challenges. (Doesn't everyone in 2022?) However, rumors of its demise are greatly exaggerated.
Meaningful growth for Starbucks has been difficult recently as the U.S. market is highly saturated. China and other overseas markets offer tremendous, but challenging, opportunities. Inflation has brought rising labor and supply costs, and a union push has some investors concerned. The company needs a strong leader right now, and the return of Howard Schultz as CEO could be just the spark the company needs.
Schultz bought Starbucks in 1987 when it had a whopping 11 stores. There are over 34,000 locations now, and Schultz's hand is all over it. Schultz gave up the reins in 2017, but has returned as interim CEO this year. He recently purchased around $15 million in Starbucks stock as a show of confidence.
The fundamentals aren't bad either. Year-over-year sales for the first two quarters of the current fiscal year are up 17%, while operating income is up 12%. Diluted earnings per share have risen 18.5% over the same period.
The company has raised the dividend annually since it began paying one in 2010. But here's the kicker. The dividend yield is nearly at its highest point ever, as shown below.
SBUX Dividend Yield data by YCharts
This yield suggests a couple of things. First, investors recognize that Starbucks is in a challenging situation. But it also could mean that the pessimism has overshot the mark. It's not practical to time a market bottom, so remember that risk-mitigation strategies like dollar-cost averaging are essential.
This is a terrific time for long-term passive income investors to take a long look at Starbucks stock.
Emphasis on professional contractors is paying off
Jeff Santoro (Lowe's): Home improvement retailer Lowe's has been a market-beating investment over the long term. Including dividends, Lowe's beat the return of the S&P 500 by 46% over the past three years, and by 90% over the past five years. However, year to date, Lowe's is down 29% and is trailing the market by 9.4%.
When Lowe's reported its Q1 2022 earnings in April, the results were mixed, but growth in the Pro category was strong. Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue was down 3% and comparable store sales decreased 4%. This was in line with what the company was expecting, but management noted that an unusually cold start to spring also had a negative effect on results.
Even with this year-over-year decrease, growth in the Pro category remained strong, increasing 20%, on top of 36% in the year-ago quarter. Helping to drive this growth is a newly launched loyalty program that saw better-than-expected adoption rates during the quarter. The company is also expanding its fulfillment capabilities for items that Pros need in higher quantities for their specific type of work.
There were a few other bright spots in the Q1 report. Earnings per share (EPS) increased 9% to $3.51, and gross margin and operating margin improved 74 basis points and 67 basis points, respectively. Management attributed these results to their ongoing productivity improvement efforts, which are clearly paying off.
Lowe's has long been profitable and cash flow positive and has used its excess capital to reward shareholders. Over the past five years, Lowe's has reduced its shares outstanding by 24% and increased its dividend 156%. The dividend yield is currently 1.8%, slightly higher than the market average of 1.7%.
With a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.3, Lowe's is trading slightly above its average valuation, and for a discount to where it was at the beginning of the year. For investors looking for passive income, Lowe's is a compelling pick considering the friendly shareholder moves the company makes and its position as one of two major players in the home improvement space.
eBay's capital returns are its x-factor for investors
Josh Kohn-Lindquist (eBay): While e-commerce juggernaut eBay doesn't seem to be as captivating an investment as its faster-growing peers, its unique niche and 18 million ""enthusiast"" buyers give it an unconventional moat.
Falling between Amazon's more commoditized goods and Etsy's handcrafted items, eBay's focus on collectibles, parts (for cars or computers, for example), and certified refurbished items give it a distinctive niche of online sales.
One example of this specialization is the company's plan to roll out its Vault business, allowing card collectors to buy, sell, and even hold trading cards within eBay's Vault. Similarly, the company's sales of collectible sneakers bring in many niche customers, leading to a tidy spillover effect into some of its more common items.
After growing sales by 42% year over year in the first quarter of 2021, eBay saw revenue dip 6% in Q1 2022 as it tried to lap these incredibly tough comps. But, more importantly, its earnings per share only slid 2% over the same time, highlighting the power of its robust share buyback program.
EBAY Shares Outstanding data by YCharts
In just the last five years alone, eBay has nearly halved its total shares outstanding, helping lead to EPS growth of 153% over the same time.
To highlight just how powerful this reduction in share count has been, consider that despite raising its dividend by more than 50% since 2019, eBay made the same amount of dividend payments in 2019 as it did over the last year -- thanks to this lower share count.
On top of these buybacks, eBay pays a 1.9% dividend that pairs with a meager payout ratio of 19% -- allowing for plenty of room for future increases.
Trading at just 11 times earnings, the company's price-to-earnings is 33% below its five-year average.
This cheap valuation and its 36% drop in share price year to date should put eBay on passive income investors' radars, especially considering its 26% free cash flow margin and incredible capital returns to shareholders.

2022-07-13 00:00:00+00:00,"1 Green Flag for eBay, and 1 Red Flag",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-green-flag-for-ebay-and-1-red-flag,,,"Investors have mixed feelings about eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY). The e-commerce website and platform thrived at the pandemic's onset when hundreds of millions wanted to avoid shopping in person. As a result, sales and customer signups surged. The economic reopening has had the opposite effect. After being cooped up at home for over a year, people want to get out of the house.
However, it's not all bad news for eBay from now on. The company is implementing a strategy to boost revenue, even as customer spending is falling. Let's take a closer look at eBay's green and red flags below.
Green flag: Increasing the take rate
Notably, eBay does not own any inventory for sale on its platform. Instead, it encourages buyers and sellers to meet on its website to make transactions. eBay makes money by taking a percentage of each sale (its ""take rate"").
Similarly, eBay leaves shipping and handling to buyers and sellers. That way, it doesn't need to own or operate fulfillment centers. It's an asset-light business model that works to deliver higher profit margins than if eBay were to participate in owning inventory or fulfillment centers.
Indeed, eBay's operating profit margin in the past decade has increased from 20.5% to 29.6%. Meanwhile, rival Amazon, which famously owns its fulfillment network, generated a measly operating profit margin during the same period.
EBAY Operating Margin (Annual) data by YCharts.
The good news for eBay investors is that the company has been increasing its take rate in recent quarters. Between the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2022, eBay's take rate rose from 10% to 12.1%. Furthermore, considering that Etsy, a competitor with a similar business model, has sustained and increased its take rate in its previous five quarters at over 17%, suggests that eBay has room to expand its take rate further.
eBay's rising transaction take rate has prevented revenue from falling as consumers return to shopping in person. The potential for more increases on this front is surely a green flag.
Red flag: Declining customer spending
As mentioned earlier, people want to leave their homes and shop more in person. That means less money is available to spend at online stores like eBay. As a result, eBay's gross merchandise value (GMV), a metric that measures overall customer spending on its site, has declined for four consecutive quarters, starting with Q2 2021.
GMV fell from $24.1 billion in Q1 2021 to $19.4 billion in Q1 2022. The dramatic fall is not entirely due to economic reopening. The first quarter of 2021 held a major fiscal stimulus package, which boosted consumer spending in the U.S.
Still, the economic reopening is a significant headwind for eBay. Folks have more options on what to do with their time and money, and they're choosing to take dollars away from eBay and allocate them elsewhere. There's no telling how far or how long this transition will be, adding an element of risk to the situation.
This red flag can primarily explain why eBay's stock is off 47% from its highs. While the risk should not be ignored, it's no reason for shareholders to sell eBay stock. The majority of the bad news is arguably priced into the stock, while the potential to continue increasing the take rate could boost revenue, even as customer spending falls.

2022-07-13 00:00:00+00:00,"eBay Could Be a Market-Beating Moneymaker, But It Needs to Stay Focused",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-could-be-a-market-beating-moneymaker-but-it-needs-to-stay-focused,,,"On June 22, online marketplace eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) acquired a specialty marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) called KnownOrigin. The press release said KnownOrigin was a ""leading"" NFT marketplace. As a cash-rich company, eBay is fully capable of funding this acquisition.
However, with limited growth opportunities, the company needs to be careful to not lose focus on shareholder returns. And buying KnownOrigin is a step in the wrong direction for this reason, in my opinion.
Why eBay stock could be a fantastic investment
In my opinion, there are three main phases of a public company's lifecycle: needing capital, self-funding, and returning capital to shareholders. In phase one, unprofitable companies secure funding from banks and shareholders to build the business in hopes of achieving scale. In phase two, companies have achieved enough scale to be cash flow positive but they continue plowing all available resources into growing the business. By phase three, growth opportunities are limited and, therefore, cash flows should be used to reward shareholders.
These phases exist on a spectrum and the lines aren't set in stone. For example, a company can return some capital to shareholders and still invest in growth. But the takeaway point here is that investors need to know where a company is in its lifecycle to evaluate the opportunity. Stocks in each phase can be good investments if management uses cash wisely.
For eBay, it's in phase three because growth opportunities are limited. Consider that in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company generated $2.7 billion in revenue. In the fourth quarter of 2021, it generated just $2.6 billion. In short, quarterly revenue was down almost 4% over this time period.
However, eBay's revenue per share was up a whopping 62% over this time period because management has repurchased billions of dollars worth of its own shares.
EBAY Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.
Even though eBay isn't growing anymore, it's still a cash flow machine. As a marketplace, it doesn't carry inventory, which keeps costs low. It's merely connecting buyers and sellers and collecting a fee. This is why the company was able to have a free cash flow (FCF) margin of 25% in 2021 -- few businesses have higher margins.
Through stock repurchases, shares are taken out of circulation and remaining shares become more valuable -- thus rewarding eBay shareholders. The company also pays a fast-growing dividend -- up 58% over the past five years -- which contributes to overall returns. This is great use of cash by eBay's management.
As of the first quarter of 2022, eBay has $4.7 billion left on its share repurchase authorization plan. Considering its current market capitalization is just $24 billion, this plan is significant. But the company has ample resources to pull it off. It has over $5 billion in cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet, generates over $500 million in quarterly FCF, and even has $5.3 billion in long-term investments in other e-commerce and financial-technology companies.
What's so great about NFTs?
Hopefully you're salivating over eBay's potential to return capital to shareholders in coming years. It can be a path to market-beating returns. However, it assumes management doesn't get too distracted.
By acquiring KnownOrigin, I fear it might be taking its eyes off the prize. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but I assume it paid a price that was well within its means. However, even if it's affordable, I doubt the NFT marketplace space is a path to growth. This is why I don't like the acquisition. Moreover, according to DappRadar, KnownOrigin only ranks 41st in NFT marketplaces by volume -- at least, in the past 30 days.
We don't have time to go down the NFT rabbit hole here. But suffice it to say that NFTs can be more than just collectibles. They can be used for record keeping, live-event ticketing, reservations, and more. But it doesn't appear that eBay is interested in this potentially innovative side of the NFT market.
Ebay is interested in NFT collectibles and has experimented in the space since May 2021. But according to data from NonFungible, NFT sales volume (in dollars) has plummeted 90% over the past year. And unique buyers have also decreased 42%.
Management's desire to stay relevant is understandable. But unless eBay finds viable growth opportunities, it should focus on shareholder returns. Given current trends, NFT collectibles aren't going to be what management hoped. And so jumping into this cooling space could distract management from its best use of cash right now.

The Nasdaq Composite, down 26% year to date, has gotten off to its worst start to a year in the index's history. It's not very difficult to understand why -- inflation recently surged to a 40-year high, the Federal Reserve is sharply raising interest rates in response, and a wide array of adverse impacts from the Russian-Ukrainian War have shattered investor sentiment around the globe. Volatile times bring terrific investment opportunities for long-term investors, however.
As short-term noise continues to tower above the fundamentals of so many great businesses, prudent investors should aim to exploit the ongoing tech correction. Financial technology (fintech) stocks, which belong to tech companies that strive to disrupt the traditional financial services industry, are in the same boat as the rest. But as the war on cash continues to heat up, a lot of these companies appear well positioned to bounce back in the long run.
Here's one leading fintech stock that investors shouldn't hesitate to pounce on right now.

PayPal is a world leader in the fintech arena
Mobile payments giant PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) has plunged more than 60% year to date. After posting an unimpressive earnings report to cap off 2021, the fintech leader pulled through by delivering an in-line first-quarter performance to kick off 2022. Total sales climbed 7.5% year over year to $6.5 billion, and adjusted earnings per share retreated 27.9% to end at $0.88. The company's adjusted non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting priciples) operating margin also declined 700 basis points to 20.7%.
The weaker-than-expected growth for PayPal can be attributed to an assortment of challenges. Not only is the company dealing with strong comparable metrics from a year ago and less-than-ideal macro conditions, but it's also experiencing top-line pressure from eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) transition to its own payments platform. Management expects to stop adjusting for eBay by the end of this year, which should be interpreted as positive news by investors.
For the full fiscal year 2022, Wall Street analysts project the company's total sales to increase 11.5% year over year to $28.3 billion, and its adjusted earnings per share to contract 15.9% to $3.87. Next year, which is when comparable metrics will normalize and eBay-related challenges should ease, analysts expect its revenue and earnings per share to expand 16.2% and 24%, respectively.
A long-term mindset is key to investing in PayPal; the company's 429 million active accounts and total payment volume north of $1 trillion in 2021 make it the most-accepted digital wallet across North America and Europe. Likewise, it continues to diversify its business with new segments like Venmo, a peer-to-peer payments platform, and Pay in 4, a service that allows consumers to pay for items in four equal installments over a specified period of time.
The company is evolving into a cash-generating machine, producing $4.9 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in the past 12 months. Today, the stock is trading at about 24.2 times earnings, representing a steep discount to its five-year mean of 57.2. PayPal's historically low valuation, combined with the paradigm shift toward a cashless economy, grants investors a healthy margin of safety at the moment.
PayPal will rebound in the long run
Unlike many fintech companies today, PayPal is a highly profitable business that has been generating free cash flow at a rapid clip. Short-term headwinds have the mobile payments giant trading at record lows, suggesting that now is an optimal buying moment for shrewd investors. The war on cash is in full motion, and PayPal sits at the epicenter of the industry.
Between its first-class core business and newly emerging segments, the company appears well equipped to cash in on this secular trend. In my opinion, patient investors who buy this stock today could be greatly rewarded down the road.

July 8 (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Friday announced the arrest of a Florida man accused of importing counterfeit Cisco networking equipment that if authentic would be worth more than $1 billion, and reselling the fake products on Amazon.com, eBay and elsewhere.
Onur Aksoy, 38, of Miami, allegedly worked with suppliers in China and Hong Kong from 2013 to 2022 to import tens of thousands of fake devices through at least 19 entities in New Jersey and Florida dubbed the Pro Network.
The U.S. Attorney's office in New Jersey, which announced the arrest, said Aksoy then resold the devices to unwitting customers, with the devices' origins having been disguised with fake Cisco labels, packaging and documentation.
According to the indictment, the scheme netted about $100 million of revenue and several million dollars of illegal profit for Aksoy, who allegedly bought the fake devices for as much as 99% less than Cisco's recommended retail prices.
Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O sent at least seven cease-and-desist letters to Aksoy, who in response had his lawyer at the time provide forged invoices at least twice, the indictment said.
Amazon AMZN.O and eBay EBAY.O, meanwhile, blocked numerous storefronts after receiving counterfeiting complaints from customers and Cisco, the indictment added.
A lawyer representing Aksoy in the criminal case did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Cisco, based in San Jose, California, did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Aksoy was charged with 11 criminal counts including mail fraud, wire fraud, trafficking in counterfeit goods, and conspiracy. Each count carries a maximum prison term of between five and 20 years.
The case is U.S. v. Aksoy, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 22-mj-09260.

Gene Editing Prescriptions By 2023?
âThe first CRISPR gene-editing drug is comingâpossibly as soon as next year,â an article in Fast Company announced last week. âSoon we could see regulators approve the very first treatment using this gene-editing technology in an effort to combat rare inherited blood disorders that affect millions across the globe.â
Biotech industry watchers have known for years that it was only a matter of time before gene editing drugs hit the market. MITâs NEWDIGS drug development program predicts that more than 60 gene and cell therapies could be available to consumers by 2030.
But news that Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) could have the first gene-editing drug on the market as early as next Christmas still surprises many. Vertex shares have added $10 billion to its market capitalization since mid-June.
And itâs a game-changing technology. Rather than rely on small molecules or biologics, gene-editing drugs change the literal genome of bacteria, cancer cells, or their human hosts. Genetic disorders may soon be literally âedited outâ of a person.
As companies finally secure approval for their gene therapy drugs, headlines like this will continue to snowball. Those investors willing to jump in early are those who stand to gain the most as CRISPR-led firms upend the $10 trillion healthcare market.

The 7 Gene-Editing Companies Upending the $10 Trillion Healthcare Market
Nearly three decades ago, a retiring investment professional gave me some advice.
âTom â there are going to be three tech revolutions in your lifetime,â he said. âFirst itâs info techâ¦ then biotechâ¦ then nanotech. Be sure to remember that.â
Not only was that my first brush with long-term thematic investingâ¦
â¦ his words were surprisingly prescient.
In the decade that followed, the development of the internet and faster processors unleashed untold power from the first wave: info tech.
Seemingly sentient chatbotsâ¦ supercomputers the size of kit-kat barsâ¦ even an AI that can draw pictures of the Kool-Aid Man in ancient hieroglyphics.

Investors have also profited handsomely. $10,000 invested in Apple three decades ago would now be worth more than $5 million today. And venture capitalists have made outsized wagers to find the next Amazon/Netflix/Tesla ever since.
The Rise of Biotech
Over the past decade, another industry has also quietly taken off:
Biotech.
The invention of gene-editing CRISPR technologies has created an entirely new class of drugs curing patients by using gene âscissorsâ to cut out certain genes.
In other words, once incurable cell disorders, from cancer to sickle-cell anemia, could soon be âedited outâ of your genome. Itâs a healthcare revolution waiting to happen.
But investors have a problem. Much like the early years of internet competition, CRISPR drug dominance is still anyoneâs game to win.
For the drugmakers themselves, early leaders like Vertex Pharmaceuticals can quickly fall behind if other platforms prove more effective. Investors would be wise to remember it was Ebay (NASDAQ:EBAY), not Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that once led the world in ecommerce profits.
And âpicks-and-shovelsâ plays arenât necessarily winners either, as tech giant Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) learned the hard way when upstart Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) took the No. 1 spot in the lucrative firewall market.
Today, biotech support firms like Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) are routinely panned online as âa mess,â as one employee put it.
âProduct got you here, but current practices wonât keep you on top,â grumbled another.
But as the first round of CRISPR drugs progress toward FDA approval, there are some clues on which companies will emerge on top.
Speed to Market. Early movers still enjoy a significant advantage, even if it canât guarantee dominance. Today, no fewer than seven firms have CRISPR therapies for sickle cell anemia in their pipeline; the approval of Vertex Pharmaceuticalâs CTX001 therapy could give the firm a meaningful market share years before rivals get out the door.
CRISPR Platform. Not all gene-editing techniques are created equally. CRISPR-Cas9 has emerged as the favored technology, with leading firms like Crispr Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) at the forefront. Meanwhile, upstarts Beam Therapeutics (NASDAQ:BEAM) and Editas Medicine (NASDAQ:EDIT) are testing alternate techniques known as base editors and SLEEK â advanced techniques that could eventually prove superior to CRISPR-Cas9.
Drug Market Size. The U.S. operates without regulatory oversight on drug pricing, meaning that prices are set by what insurers and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) are willing to pay. Drugs targeting âexpensiveâ chronic ailments like Alzheimerâs are more likely to become billion-dollar blockbusters than those treating rare diseases or those that cost less. Companies like Intellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NTLA) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) are currently exploring candidates that could potentially solve protein-folding disorders such as Alzheimerâs, Parkinsonâs and Huntingtonâs.
Funding. And finally, the top biotech companies all need money. Lots of it. The average gene therapy drug will cost $5 billion, according to the Innovative Genomics Institute, roughly five times more than the cost of developing traditional drugs. Well-funded firms like Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) are far more likely to weather the Fed-induced belt-tightening that threatens smaller firms.
How Gene-Editing Companies Score
Unsurprisingly, many biotech companies score poorly on traditional quantitative scores. Their lack of profits â plus weak cash flow generation and strained finances â make them look more like failing companies than high-potential startups.
But the quantitative Profit & Protection doesnât necessarily select for quality. Instead, the system considers whatâs worked in the past. And as big investment winners have shown, sometimes buying âuglyâ companies is the best path to success.

And donât forget to join me on Thursday, when we take a closer look at which gene-editing companies investors absolutely must buy from this top-tier list.
The Downsides to Gene Editing Companies
If youâre wary about biotech firms, I donât blame you.
In November, I recommended investors buy shares of Longeveron (NASDAQ:LGVN), a company I named âmy top small-cap biotech Moonshot.â
âWith insiders buying in between the $3.30 and $3.80 range, regular investors might want to scoop up a couple of shares too before official phase-1 results are announced; LGVN executives are acting as if they know something that we donât.â
Shares have doubled since thenâ¦ But not before embarking on a wild 1,400% rise to $45 before making a round trip back to $6.
Stable investments, these are not.
Moralists could also take issue with many biotech practices.
In 2021, Nature Magazine dryly noted that âgene therapy products for sickle cell disease will probably cost US$1 million for a one-time dose.â And much like Tylenol and other common drugs, CRISPR-Cas9 can use embryonic stem cells to develop and test therapies. And in-vivo treatments that change genetic code is arguably the closest that medicine has come to âplaying God.â
But biotech and gene editing can also change lives for the better. Experts estimate that 300,000 babies are born every year with sickle cell anemia. A cure for the inherited disease could lengthen their lives by a quarter-century. Imagine a world where cancers are a thing of the past.
Much like the IT revolution, biotech will have bumps along the way. But in the grand scheme of investing, my old family friend was right. Biotech will become a driving force of innovation in our lifetimes.
