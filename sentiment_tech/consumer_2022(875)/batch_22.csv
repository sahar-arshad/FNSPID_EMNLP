With the growth of online retail, I can understand the attraction retail investors have to ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH). However, WISH stock is down about 90% from its 52-week high. And the chart hasn’t given bulls much to be encouraged about since early summer.

That was when I first wrote about WISH stock. And I’ll admit to being intrigued by a company that looked like it might be an under-the-radar growth stock.
One reason for my optimism was that ContextLogic is going after the discount buyer. Brick-and-mortar discount chains like Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) have done well as consumers look for value in an inflationary economy. So it stood to reason that a company that was embracing value in a digital-first model might have appeal.  
But I didn’t foresee the effect the supply chain disruption would have on its business. And with the problem of lower monthly active users and declining revenues, investing in WISH stock seems like it’s based on hope. And hope is not a strategy.  
7 Entertainment Stocks You’ll Want on Your Shortlist
However, ContextLogic is in the process of finding a new CEO; an announcement is due before Feb. 1, 2022. That could give investors a vision into the company’s plans. And it may also keep some of the current WISH shareholders holding their shares.  
If you’re one of those investors, here are some issues I would consider when the company reports earnings in March.  
Can They Generate Positive Free Cash Flow? 
One bullish argument for WISH stock is that the company has over $1 billion of cash on hand. But when you account for liabilities, that number drops to $779 million. That wouldn’t be bad. However, Mark Hake recently gave an account of the state of the company’s free cash flow (FCF).  
As Hake points out, the company’s FCF was negative in the third quarter to the tune of $344 million. This was over 93% of the company’s $368 million in quarterly revenue (which was down from $656 million in the prior quarter). At that rate, Context Logic would have annualized cash burn rate of $1.376 billion. That leads to nowhere good.  
However, on the company’s most recentearnings call management said there are no plans for a share buyback. And, in fact, the company said it plans to be FCF neutral before investing in growth later this year.  
What Cost Will Growth Have? 
ContextLogic explained the 39% year-over-year (YOY) revenue drop as primarily a function of pulling back on its digital ad spend. The company’s sales and marketing spend was 40% of revenue down from 64% in the same quarter the prior year.  
The decline in digital ad spend also affected the company’s total monthly active users which were down by 40% on a YOY basis. In turn, this affected the company’s revenue for each of its verticals.  
This might be easier to accept except for the fact that on theearnings call management was quick to tell investors that they should expect revenue to decline in the next quarter which will include the holiday season.  
This leaves ContextLogic in an unenviable position in which it’s unclear that it can simply spend money to make money. In fact, right now, the opposite appears to be true.  
Can ContextLogic Retain What Made it Unique? 
I can appreciate ContextLogic making a move to ensure a better customer experience. However, in doing so it seems to be moving away from its roots as a company that was offering a “treasure hunt” experience to becoming a more traditional online retailer.  
That may be the only move the company can make but it may turn out to be a case of being penny wise and pound foolish. At the present time, the company sources most of their merchandise from countries like China. As I wrote in October, this has left them particularly vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.  
And the fundamental problem that the company faces is that expanding its logistics business will put even more pressure on the company’s margins and cash flow.  
Bottom Line
I know better than to discount the commitment of the retail investors who are holding WISH stock. However, even if you’re inclined to give this a “it can’t get any worse” roll of the dice, I’d encourage you to wait until the company starts delivering on the vision it’s laying out.

2022-01-18 00:00:00+00:00,How The Parts Add Up: RSPE Targets $28,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-the-parts-add-up%3A-rspe-targets-%2428,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Invesco ESG S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (Symbol: RSPE), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $27.61 per unit.
With RSPE trading at a recent price near $25.09 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.03% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of RSPE's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR), Air Products & Chemicals Inc (Symbol: APD), and Linde plc (Symbol: LIN). Although DLTR has traded at a recent price of $130.81/share, the average analyst target is 10.56% higher at $144.62/share. Similarly, APD has 10.43% upside from the recent share price of $291.35 if the average analyst target price of $321.75/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting LIN to reach a target price of $362.58/share, which is 10.33% above the recent price of $328.63. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of DLTR, APD, and LIN:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
Invesco ESG S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF RSPE $25.09 $27.61 10.03%
Dollar Tree Inc DLTR $130.81 $144.62 10.56%
Air Products & Chemicals Inc APD $291.35 $321.75 10.43%
Linde plc LIN $328.63 $362.58 10.33%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 76% over five years, which is below the market return. Some buyers are laughing, though, with an increase of 22% in the last year.
Although Dollar Tree has shed US$2.0b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
Over half a decade, Dollar Tree managed to grow its earnings per share at 12% a year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 12% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
NasdaqGS:DLTR Earnings Per Share Growth January 14th 2022
We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..
A Different Perspective
It's nice to see that Dollar Tree shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 22% over the last year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 12% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Dollar Tree better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for Dollar Tree that you should be aware of.

2022-01-09 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Federal Realty Investment Trust vs. Realty Income,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-federal-realty-investment-trust-vs.-realty-income,,,"Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE: FRT) and Realty Income (NYSE: O) have a lot in common that commends them to investors as long-term buy and holds.
They're both real estate investment trusts (REITs), which requires that pay at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. They generate that income from their commercial real estate portfolios, counting on their tenants to provide real estate investors with a steady flow of cash and share price appreciation over a period of years.
Notice I said years. What makes Federal Realty and Realty Income such compelling choices is their venerability matched by performance. Both are Dividend Aristocrats, which means they're among the 65 members of the Standard & Poor's 500 that have raised dividends for 25 straight years or more. Federal Realty goes a step further. It's one of the 31 companies meriting the title of Dividend King bestowed for 50 straight years of payout increases.
Below, we'll look a bit deeper at each of their portfolios and performance.
Image source: Getty Images.
Realty Income is an 11,000-pound giant among retail REITs
Realty Income, with a market value of about $40 billion, is by far the larger of the two, with about 11,000 properties under long-term, net-lease contracts with 650 different clients in all 50 states, the U.K., and Spain. Net-lease contracts require tenants to pay most of a property's operating costs.
Dollar General and Dollar Tree-Family Dollar account for 1,462 of those leases and 7.5% of the REIT's rental revenue. 7-Eleven (592 leases) and Walgreen's (246 leases), meanwhile, individually account for 5.7% and 5% of rent revenue, respectively. Then there's FedEx, with only 42 leases but 3.4% of total rent.
As for performance, Realty Income has posted annualized dividend growth of 4.5% since joining the NYSE in 1994. Its record actually goes back to 1969, when it was created to provide monthly dividends to shareholders long before it went public.
Realty Income calls itself the ""Monthly Dividend Company,"" and right now that payout is $0.246 a share every month, good for a yield of about 4.1% based on its recent share price of about $71.
Federal Realty is smaller but also mighty
Federal Realty has a market cap of about $10.7 billion, one fourth that of Realty Income, and a much smaller footprint. Instead of casting such a wide net, Federal Realty focuses on what it calls ""award-winning retail environments and mixed-use neighborhoods in the nation's most desirable markets.""
It has 106 properties with about 3,100 commercial real estate (CRE) tenants and about 3,200 residential units concentrated in coastal markets such as Washington, D.C., Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and Phoenix.
Federal Realty, which pays its dividend four times a year, raised its quarterly payout by a penny to $1.07 a share last summer, continuing a string of 54 annual increases, the longest in the REIT industry. That's good for a yield of about 3.15% based on the recent share price of about $135.

Realty Income has the total return lead, and gets the nod here
As an income-focused investor I like to look at total return, taking into account dividends and share price growth. Realty Income is the clear winner here, as $10,000 invested in its stock 10 years ago would now be worth about $32,000, compared with about $21,000 for Federal Realty.https://ycharts.com/charts/fund_chart_creator/fool/#/?annotations=&annualizedReturns=false&calcs=i[…]=&title=&units=false&useEstimates=false&zoom=10
Realty Income and Federal Realty are both widely held, widely respected members of the real estate sector and for good reason. They both have long records of reliable paybacks and decent returns, making them ideal candidates for a retiree's portfolio.
As for looking ahead, Federal Realty has increased its 2022 forecast for funds from operations (FFO) per diluted share from an estimated $5.45-$5.50 for 2021 to $5.65-$5.85 for 2022 Realty Income, meanwhile, says it has invested in $1.61 billion in 308 properties and properties under development or expansion, including $532.5 million in Europe.
Those are just two of the metrics that point to continued solid returns from these two dividend stalwarts. Stocks like these are often viewed by individual investors as an alternative to low-yielding bonds, cash, and certificates of deposit. Either of these two will do that just fine.
A big choice is whether you prefer the payout monthly or quarterly, of course, but there's more. Realty Income's higher yield and stronger returns and its significant investment in revenue growth gives it an edge over its worthy competitor.

[music]
I'm Chris Hill. Joining me is Motley Fool Senior Analyst Jim Gillies. Good to see you. Thanks for being here.
Jim Gillies: Thanks for inviting me, Chris.
Chris Hill: Our email address is podcasts@fool.com.
We've got a great question from Donna, who writes, ""I'm new to investing outside of my 401(k) and I'm planning on keeping my investments long term. What is the downside to following Berkshire Hathaway's 13-F filings, investing in similar percentages, and rebalancing the investments once Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly reports are released?
""Warren Buffett is a long-term investor and the Class A shares are so expensive. I'm thinking if I invest similar percentages in Berkshire's top 20 investments and rebalance quarterly, I could come out better than investing the same amount of money in a Berkshire Hathaway Class A share -- fractional, of course, I don't see a downside, but I know there is one. Otherwise, everyone would do this, right? What am I missing? Thanks.""
First of all, Jim, shout out to Donna, because I love the way Donna is thinking, and I love the way Donna's investing. She's got the 401(k), love that. Starting to invest outside that, that's great. Very much focused on the long term. Love it.
Jim Gillies: There is an easier way I think we're going to...
Chris Hill: I mean, one of my thoughts, what I read this was, God, this sounds tiring. But that's me.
Jim Gillies: Was more of a lot of work that you might not follow through on for too long.
Chris Hill: I'm lazy as an investor by nature. But this is a question that has come up from time to time. It's certainly an idea that's come up. I believe there have been people who have asked some version of this question to Buffett and Munger at the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting. Buffett himself is usually the first to say, ""Don't follow me blindly.""
Jim Gillies: Please don't do this. Please.
Chris Hill: Please don't do this. In terms of the math, though. I mean, directionally, this makes sense, but it just seems like with Class B shares, which are far less expensive on a dollar basis than Class A shares... Let me put it this way: When I went to buy shares of Berkshire Hathaway, I bought the B shares.
Jim Gillies: You and me both, Chris. I have B shares that are older than my children, and I have a kid in university, so that should tell you all you want to know there. The B shares, which are approximately 1/1,500 of value of the A shares, they are functionally equivalent just with that size differential.
Donna, I would suggest you buy, rather than buying the A-class shares or be worried about buying a Class A share, I would just go with the B shares, which are ticker BRK.B on the New York Stock Exchange. The reason I would do that rather than your proposal here -- and I agree with Chris: It's an interesting idea, but it's a lot of work. You're going to have to pull the 13-Fs and see what's changed quarter to quarter and add, deduct, what needs to be done. It's a lot of work.
The thing is that is not what Berkshire Hathaway actually is. It's part of what Berkshire Hathaway is. You get Buffett, his investing acumen. More commonly nowadays, especially with the smaller positions, it's not Buffett at all. It's Todd or Ted, as they say. The investing lieutenants who will be there once Buffett hangs it up.
But Berkshire is more than simply the publicly traded equities. I mean, let's be roughly 50/50. It's half the equities, but also there's this whole realm of business on the side that you don't get if you're just emulating the 13-F and the holdings. But you do get it if you buy Berkshire B-class shares.
Chris Hill: There certainly have been times when you look at the overall performance of Berkshire Hathaway. There have certainly been times when the investment portfolio has carried the day. There are plenty of times when it's the operational businesses underneath that you just referred to.
Jim Gillies: Correct. Yes. That's kind of what you want. So if you buy the shares, you're getting a piece of Geico, for example. You're getting a piece of Kraft Heinz, I thought that's an investment, that's not. You're getting a piece of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the railroad, you're getting a piece of MidAmerican Energy. You're getting a piece of Flight Safety of Duracell, of Marmon Holdings, Lubrizol, the ISCAR, I think it used to be called. They've changed the name, which is the metal-tooling, metalworking business they bought 15 years ago or whatever it was. You're going to get a piece of Dairy Queen and a bunch of exciting things like Acme Brick.
I laugh, but no, I mean, you're getting all of these operating businesses that, as you say, Chris, have, from time to time, carried the day. And if Donna is looking to Berkshire as a bedrock position in her non-401(k) investments -- which I think, by the way, is an excellent idea -- you can just buy B shares and get everything.
The other aspect of this is with the portfolio. Buffett himself will tell you he has made multiple errors over the years. We all make errors. I'm looking forward to making some later today that I don't know about yet. But he invested heavily in IBM, for example, I believe, back in 2012. Didn't go terribly well. Had, I think, 10% positions in the big four U.S. airlines pretty much bottom-ticked it during the pandemic.
Now, was he selling because he was scared or was he selling to get out of the way? Because it wouldn't look good for the U.S. government to bail out Warren Buffett-backed airline? Was he taking one for the team? I think you could make a case that's what he was doing. But there's other things that he's famously... like Wells Fargo at one point was the greatest thing ever. Now I think he's completely out of it, so...
Chris Hill: One other thing when Donna asks, what am I missing? One other thing, and it's not that she's missing it, is that anyone would miss it is we don't know exactly what the price is. You can look at Berkshire Hathaway in a filing. Berkshire Hathaway bought x number of shares of this company and y number of shares of that company. We don't know, was that all in one chunk? What is the price point along the way? And invariably, you're not kind of get the same price. You can do exactly what Donna has laid out here. You might do OK for yourself. You're not getting the same price. You're not getting exactly the same price that Berkshire Hathaway is.
Jim Gillies: Well, because you know about it at best, what, 45 days after quarter-end? If he made the move and say, like the most recent 13-F is as of what's showing the holdings, the filing that they are required to show. That was filed on, I believe, November 15 for a quarter that ended September 30th. Maybe the move was made in the middle of August. Like your trailing, whereas you get whatever perceived benefit there is, you get it from buying and holding the shares, Berkshire shares, that is.
Like I said, again, it might be a point to brag that ""I own an A share."" -- I do not own an A share, by the way. -- But it might be a point to brag about, well, ""I own A shares."" That's nice. The B shares are fine. If you buy 1,500 B shares, I think you can convert it to an A or sell it to convert yourself.
But no. To me, owning Berkshire, the B-shares or the A shares regardless, owning Berkshire is a core bedrock position, i think appropriate for pretty much every portfolio. Kudos to Donna for recognizing that. But I think what you're missing is you're missing the operating businesses if you don't own the shares. You'll get the benefit of all the portfolio moves in real time, in theory, in real time, just by owning the shares. That's the longest-winded answer to say ""Buy Berkshire.""
Chris Hill: Keep the email questions coming, podcasts@fool.com. Jim Gillies, Thanks so much for being here.
Jim Gillies: Thank you.
Chris Hill: If you're done with your holiday shopping, there's a chance you visited Etsy, the e-commerce marketplace focused on handmade and vintage goods, and like a lot of businesses, the stock has had a rough 2022. Can Etsy rebound from its post-pandemic slog. Dylan Lewis and Ricky Mulvey duke it out in today's Bull versus Bear.
It's time for Bull versus Bear. We pick a company, dragoon two colleagues into doing some research, flip a coin, and then see which side they get to take. The company up for debate is Etsy, the e-commerce platform whose shares are down 40% year to date.
Making the bull case will be Dylan Lewis. Dylan, thanks for being here.
Dylan Lewis: Happy to be dragooned with Ricky Mulvey.
Chris Hill: Making the bear case for Etsy is the guy who normally hosts this segment. It's Ricky Mulvey.
Rick Mulvey: Hey, thanks for having me.
Chris Hill: You didn't have a choice. Dylan, you've got five minutes to make the bull case for Etsy. Go for it.
Dylan Lewis: Well, we could not be having this conversation at a better time for me to make my bull argument, because it is the holiday season. Really, this is the time where Etsy's value absolutely shines. This is the place for craft and personalized gifts.
Now, say you have a Cincinnati Bengals fan on your wish list who's also a coffee drinker. There is an Etsy seller with an Ickey Shuffle coffee mug for sale right now. You can buy it, that's right, Ricky. Really, Etsy is the home for craft, personalized, and independent items. If you are doing your holiday shopping or getting a gift for someone's birthday, it almost feels like a cheat code. If you go to their homepage right now, you're met with a widget to help you find gifts for whoever you may be shopping for different categories of relationships you have in your life.
Now, this is a company that had a massive growth and adoption cycle during the pandemic, and as Chris mentioned, we're seeing a little bit of a come down from that in 2022. They're off the peak of the pandemic, when money is a little bit more plentiful, consumer spending was little bit higher and growth stocks were being rewarded. But I think during the period of the pandemic, when they saw that adoption, they were able to bring a lot of customers on board and will set them up for good long-term success.
The company's revenue base, basically 3xed since 2019, and they've been able to bring a lot of shoppers over with that activity. They now account 88 million people who have bought an item on the site in the last 12 months, and we are seeing good repeat purchase behavior. Repeat buyers up 49% from 41% in 2019, and habitual buyers are up 7.6 million from 2 million in 2019. We're also seeing the average ticket increase over the past few years. Average annual spend per user is up 30% since 2019.
We have more people onsite, more people making repeat purchases, and the overall size of those purchases increasing over time. Those are all growth levers working together that can help meaningfully grow revenue, especially as we get into a more favorable economic period, and Etsy's take rate has also improved. They're taking more from every transaction that happens on the platform.
I do think the company has some other good growth drivers ahead of it. They're continuing to build out tools and resources for shoppers. You'll notice if you favorite or watch an item on Etsy, they offer a coupon code to help stir some activity from some sellers. They're going to see more innovation in that zone, and I think we're also going to see them continue to build out their ads business and see what other monetization opportunities there might be.
I think a good mid-case for Etsy would be to become something the scope of eBay, which does $10 billion in revenue. Etsy is currently a quarter of that. I mentioned 7.6 million habitual buyers; eBay has 17 million enthusiast buyers. I see upside in customers and activity for Etsy, and I think they make it easier for merchants to build a true storefront, which may steal some activity from eBay. The two businesses get at something similar -- odd items, crafts, collectibles -- but Etsy does it without the unpredictability of the auction marketplace and allows sellers to build more consistent businesses and online presence.
I think the next year or two might be a little bit bumpy for this company, but we are seeing this business at a much more reasonable valuation, around $15 billion, and the business has a proven track record of profitability. I have a small position. I'm a shareholder. And even if you weren't compelled to buy the stock after my pitch, check it out as you're doing your holiday shopping. It can save you a lot of time.
Chris Hill: I've also done some shopping, and Ricky, don't let this bias you, but I'm also a shareholder. Your rebuttal.
Rick Mulvey: Well, a popular product doesn't always make a good stock. I'm glad both of you are doing some shopping there, and I think that's the case for Etsy. The platform can be great for buyers. I have some go-to gifts from the website. But it's become more like a digital flea market. It's not just personalized cutting boards and handmade jewelry. Now it's products from multilevel marketing companies, patio furniture, and Pokémon cards. Don't Google ""thick charts art"" on there.
Yes, Etsy has more than tripled its number of sellers over the pandemic, and that's led to a platform that could have used some curation and smarter growth.
Etsy is nothing without its sellers, and the platform can be a difficult place to do business. Listings are taken down without a reason, leaving sellers to figure out what rules they broke through a web of customer-support confusion.
Sellers have also complained that Etsy's Star Seller program has serious flaws. Just one small example is that a seller complained to the website EcommerceBytes, that they had a buyer who sent three rapid-fire messages quickly to them. They responded to the last message, and they were penalized for not responding to all three. Remember, Etsy's mission is to keep human connection at the heart of commerce.
Additionally, the platform does not offer any order-fulfillment services such as inventory storage, order picking, and packing. Yes, this makes for a prettier balance sheet, but it also makes switching costs lower if sellers want to move to Amazon Handmade or Shopify or a competitor we don't know about yet. The business is automating relationships with sellers and throwing its hands up for shipping support. It leaves the door open to competitors who are going to do that heavy lifting.
This brings us to a bigger problem, which is that the management team has not proven to allocate capital well. Etsy bought two other online retailers in 2021, Depop for $1.5 billion and Elo7 for $212 million. Depop is a resale platform. Elo7 is like a Brazilian version of Etsy. And in Etsy's latest quarter, the company wrote down these acquisitions by $1 billion. Chief Financial Officer Rachel Glasser, blamed this write-down on the Fed hiking interest rates, reopening headwinds, inflationary factors, consumer discretionary spending trends.
Oh, by the way, Poshmark just went private for less than half of its IPO value, so the problem could be worse.
CEO Josh Silverman simply said, ""Our timing on those acquisitions certainly could have been better.""
Resales are notoriously expensive business, no matter your market climate. You've got to authenticate products, and that can be expensive.
If you're a long-term shareholder, you've got to be concerned about management taking a $1 billion charge with little to no self-reflection. To quote basketball great Charles Barkley, ''Quit crying about getting hacked or how your shoes hurt, or how you can't shoot outdoors, just shut up and jam.""
These expensive acquisitions mean that Etsy's shareholder equity is worth negative 600 million bucks. Negative shareholder equity is when a company owes more money to investors than its assets can cover. This company hasn't been through a major recession, and sales growth may slow even further if we enter one. Etsy doesn't have those gale-force tailwinds at its back from the pandemic.
On devaluation: Right now, Etsy is down by 40% year to date, but that's not cheap. The platform is trading at a 6.5 price-to sales-ratio.
Hey, how about eBay at a 2.4 price-to-sales, plus they'll pay you a small dividend? I hear that can make management a little bit smarter about how they spend your money.
Etsy's also spent more than $166 million in stock-based comp through the first nine months of 2022. That's up 85% last year. Yes, Etsy offset dilution with buybacks, and it's because the company grew headcount, but in its latest quarter, Etsy spent more on stock-based comp than marketing or product development, and that does not signal that Etsy is investing in the business is prudently as it could. While the company is bazooka blasting its exec team with stock, insiders have made exactly zero open-market buys over the past 12 months. Ouch!
My bottom line: Etsy is still an expensive pandemic play with a management team that refuses to learn capital allocation lessons and learn from its mistakes.

2022-12-29 00:00:00+00:00,February 2023 Options Now Available For eBay,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/february-2023-options-now-available-for-ebay,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options become available today, for the February 2023 expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new February 2023 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $41.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.72. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $41.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $39.28 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $41.24/share today.
Because the $41.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.20% return on the cash commitment, or 35.61% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $41.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $42.00 strike price has a current bid of 68 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $41.24/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $42.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.49% if the stock gets called away at the February 2023 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $42.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $42.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.65% boost of extra return to the investor, or 14.00% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $41.24) to be 38%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-12-26 00:00:00+00:00,Which Is the Better Fintech Stock to Buy for 2023 -- PayPal or Block?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/which-is-the-better-fintech-stock-to-buy-for-2023-paypal-or-block,,,"According to Adroit Market Research, the financial technology (fintech) market is expected to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 20% through 2030, reaching $700 billion compared with $100 billion now. Multiple third-party research groups similarly project high growth for fintech in coming years, which is good reason for investors to consider PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Block (NYSE: SQ).
Let's look at which one is the better stock for 2023 and beyond. My answer might surprise you.
1. PayPal stock has never been this cheap
PayPal is a pioneer in the fintech space. And with 432 million active accounts, it's also one of the biggest players.
Over the last four quarters, PayPal has generated nearly $5.7 billion in free cash flow (FCF), which is one way to measure profitability. Trading with a current market capitalization of $78 billion, this means it trades at just 14 times trailing FCF -- the cheapest it's been since it was spun out from eBay in 2015. But more context unlocks the truly impressive value proposition for PayPal investors today.
PYPL Price to Free Cash Flow data by YCharts
In recent years, PayPal management has focused on expanding its business into ancillary financial-technology services, with limited success. And unfortunately, this has held back FCF a bit lately, as the chart below shows. However, with a renewed focus on its core strengths, PayPal is starting to live up to its full potential for FCF generation, and I expect it to continue to improve and for its valuation to look all the more attractive.
PYPL Free Cash Flow Per Share data by YCharts
Shareholders have already been told about PayPal's game plan for 2023. In the conference call to discuss financial results for the third quarter of 2022, PayPal Chief Financial Officer Gabrielle Rabinovitch said, ""Returning capital to our shareholders continues to be our single biggest priority from a capital allocation standpoint and I think it will continue to be.""
So far in 2022, PayPal has spent nearly $1 billion per quarter on share repurchases and expects to maintain a comparable pace in 2023. This equates to more than 1% of shares outstanding per quarter.
PayPal isn't a high-growth opportunity like it once was -- it's only forecasting 7% year-over-year revenue growth in the current quarter. And it's only grown year-to-date revenue by 9% from the comparable period of 2021. However, with consistent share buybacks, it's possible for PayPal to increase revenue per share by a double-digit percentage, which should be enough to beat the market in 2023 and beyond.
2. Block stock is inexpensive as well, with a catch
In contrast to PayPal, Block is still a higher-growth opportunity mostly thanks to its Cash App ecosystem. With Cash App, users can invest, transfer money to other Cash App users, and more. They can also do more traditional banking things like direct deposit their paychecks and get a debit card.
The Cash App Card is important fuel on Block's fire. In the third quarter of 2022, cardholders reached 18 million and accounted for half of all cash inflows into the business. This is important. Once money is in the system, it's highly likely users will stay and use the money inside of the ecosystem.
Block's management focuses on gross profit. It's not a perfect valuation metric. But let's look at it from this perspective for the sake of argument, since this is management's emphasis.
Block has $5.5 billion in trailing-12-month gross profit and has a market cap of $36.2 billion. This valuation of a little less than 7 times its gross profit is historically a cheap valuation for this company. And its gross profit is still growing fast, up roughly 34% through the first three quarters of 2022 compared to the comparable period of 2021. Steady growth in the Cash App ecosystem is fueling these gains.
As mentioned, Block is higher-growth than PayPal and I believe Cash App has plenty more room from here. Moreover, from certain perspectives Block looks like a cheap stock. However, Block does have more uncertainty than PayPal -- in 2023, it will keep funneling money into projects like music platform Tidal and cryptocurrency, which both have uncertain payoffs.
Here's another problem: After acquiring buy now, pay later company Afterpay, Block has an astounding $11.6 billion of goodwill on its balance sheet. Considering Block acquired Afterpay at a time when valuations were running hot, it's very likely it will need to write off some of this goodwill in 2023, resulting in a big hit to profitability. It'll be a noncash charge, but the market is sure not to like it.
For everything discussed here, I would say that PayPal stock and Block stock are both great opportunities for 2023 and beyond, but for different sets of investors. If you're an investor who wants respectable upside with limited downside risk, I'd suggest buying PayPal. However, if you're willing to take on more uncertainty for a stock with more upside potential, Block might be the stock for you.
You may not have expected an answer like this. But this is often true of investing: The better investing opportunity sometimes comes down to your personal situation, as is the case with PayPal and Block, in my opinion.

This video was recorded on Dec. 11, 2022.
Mauro Porcini: Multiple people, the executives of these companies were asking me, what is the ROI of design? How do you quantify the value that you create for the company? So I was still at 3M, we started to work on defining this ROI. Obviously, the most powerful form of ROI is if you grow the business, it's impact on top line, bottom line, market share. But you can't quantify that just on a project.
Chris Hill: I'm Chris Hill and that's Mauro Porcini. He's the Chief Design Officer at Pepsi and author of the book, The Human Side of Innovation. Ricky Mulvey caught up with Porcini to talk about how top-tier design can lead to return on investment, why more companies are offering products with limited edition releases, and one designer's vision of the future with tattoos that read your health patterns and 3D printed cookies.
Ricky Mulvey: You say that a lot of companies have stepped toward design. Why do you think you see that let's say, distance between talk and action?
Mauro Porcini: Well, because forget even the word design and this is one of the key points of the book. It's not even about design, but to change culture, to change approach, to do something different than what you're used to, you're familiar with, something that worked for you for a long time. All of this is risky by definition. So in this specific case of design, to embrace it in the right way, if you're not doing it already, if it's not part of your culture, if it's not part of your way of working and thinking, then by definition, it's a risk and to take that kind of risk, you need to have the right people within the organization comfortable with taking that risk.
So a culture of innovation and risk-taking. Then you need to have the right know-how, the right knowledge. It's not something that you buy from the next design agency that you can hire to help you, but it's something that you need to build within the DNA, the genetic code of the company over time. This is true for design, it's true for anything else. Any radical transformation requires an evolution of the genetic code of the company especially the ones like in the case of design, they require some form of higher perceived risk. By the way, I call it perceived risk because actually not changing is eventually the bigger risk that companies take often in these kind of situations.
Ricky Mulvey: It's also interesting, you've brought this up in other interviews, which it's essentially when you need to convince investment people to invest in high-quality design and you've brought up this study from McKinsey, it's called the McKinsey Design Index. One of the things I noticed in the study is the asymmetric returns in it. I think it goes back to your point of; you need to be fully committed to a design culture. What these researchers at McKinsey found are consultants, or people who put together the interview or the paper, excuse me, is there's asymmetric returns. So if you're in the top quartile of design for pretty much any industry, there's a measure of out performance you gain from that. However, there's no difference between the second quartile in the bottom quartile so if you're in the top 50 percent or the bottom 25 percent, there's not a huge difference. Why do you think design carries that kind of asymmetric return for those companies were only the top winners are rewarded?
Mauro Porcini: Because you need to do it right and you need to do it holistically across the entire portfolio that you have, the entire operations of the company, the entire culture of the organization. Let me make a very, very practical, simple example. I'm just picking a company, I may take any company, but let's say Apple was deciding years ago, they had an average portfolio products. Let's assume that we're not leveraging design and design thinking. They decide all of a sudden to design the iPhone. They will design the iPhone exactly as they did design the iPhone. But they wouldn't touch the packaging, they wouldn't touch experience in retail, they wouldn't touch the service. Let's say that everything else would be average like the rest of the industry, but they will just design an amazing product.
That operation would have failed. It wouldn't be the Apple that we all know, obviously. You can't invest in design and be like, well, I can't change the company from night to day, so I need to start from somewhere. Let's start with the specific product, the specific brand. Let's do one project, let's see how it goes. Tell me what is the return on investment on that project. I'll design help changing the product. When you do that, you're not understanding what design with the capital can really do for your company. You may be lucky and just redesigning the aesthetic, not even the functionality, the aesthetic of a product, you can increase the sales of the product. It happened to me 20 years ago when I entered 3M, the tech company from Minnesota, and we redesigned a line or multimedia projectors, the very first project that we did and just by redesigning the aesthetic and the little bit of the ergonomic of the product, we doubled the sales of that product line.
So it can happen here and there, but the truth is that for sustainable business growth and to really build sustainable financial value for the company, you need to impact every single touchpoint of the business. Therefore, many years ago, even before I got in PepsiCo, so when I was at 3M and then in PepsiCo, multiple people, executives of these companies were asking me, what is the ROI of design? How do you quantify the value that you create for the company? So I was still at 3M, and we started to work on defining this ROI. Obviously the most powerful form of ROI is if you grow the business, it's the impact on top line, bottom line, market share. But you can't quantify that just on a project. Let me give you an example, if I work on Pepsi, and they do a series of operations on the pack, on experiences that don't generate a real relevant return for a brand of that size, for a brand that is multi-billion-dollar worth.
But the impact with its effect, your overall brand and therefore increase sales and a law for the brand. In the core product they eventually didn't touch yet, that's still ROI of what I'm doing with design. But if your approach to that ROI is very myopic and you're just calculating the return of investment on that specific project, you go nowhere. Obviously, once again, it needs to be an holistic approach where you touch all the different dimensions of the brand. So, the result of the work, that I did many years ago, define a series of areas of value creation that you can identify when you do design in their ROI in the company. The first one is the impact you have in your customer relation, not the consumers, the customer being for a company like PepsiCo, the hotel chains, the restaurants, the retailers, the distribution essentially.
By changing the conversation with them, by offering them the ability to envision how you can leverage your technologies, your brands, your products, to increase their business, to help their relation with their guests or the people that they serve, you change completely the relationship and the partnership therefore you build a partnership with these customers. Is not anymore, I'm coming to you to sell you stuff, I'm coming to you to co-create the future together. It's the impact on the consumer a word that I don't like to match but let's go the consumer, so everybody understands what we're talking about. Again, you can measure it, but it's easy to see it, especially today in the world of social media, is the way they talk about your brands online, in their conversations. This is obvious to everybody.
When you go in your LinkedIn, you're going Instagram and you are an employee of the company, whatever position you have, the CEO or an entry-level employee and everything in-between, you observe the way the people talk about your brands, the excitement. If you think about the content that we create as design organization of PepsiCo, we have 100 percent positive sentiment. This is unique, 100 percent positive sentiment. When we post outdoor PepsiCo design Instagram account or when I post out on my social media content related to PepsiCo design, the sentiment is positive because people understand. The people out there feel, they were driven by really creating value, by really, that human centricity, you see that they're sincere, that these bunch of designers and this design driven approach is human-centered for real.
We're not here to just generate profit for the company and financial value for the company, eventually not caring about the quality of what we're offering you. People feel that what excites us as designers and human center organization is to deliver value. Then yes, of course, we know how to build business value as well through that human value. This is the second dimension, I could go on and on, but very quickly it's impact on your innovation pace and the ability to generate innovative ideas that you can quantify multiple ways patterns, for instance, trademarks and many other things. It's the impact on corporate reputation, it's the impact on cost of the product, it's the impact on cost of the process and so on, so forth.
Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, 100 percent positive sentiment. Boy, does that sound like a lot? One thing I think is a part of this conversation is not just having businesses that understand the importance of design, but rather the designers understand business realities. You touched on this in your book when you were designing a Pepsi Perfect bottle to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Back to the Future 2 and the only reason it was possible for you to come up with this, I would say not the only reason, but one of the key reasons it was possible for that product to happen, which is now a collectible that sells for 200 bucks on eBay, is because there was a gap in the schedule, promotional schedules. If you didn't have that gap then you may have not been able to have that product go to market.
Mauro Porcini: Yeah. Look, it was something that happened at the beginning of a journey of culture creation. As I describe in the book, it was the beginning of my PepsiCo journey. We knew that, Back to the Future, the anniversary was about to arrive. There was somebody in my team, his name is Martin Broen, he was a big fan of that movie. He came to me one day and was like, ""We need to do the Pepsi perfect bottle that you see in the movie, and we need to be ready for the anniversary, that is in 2015."" We're talking about the end of 2012 when we started this conversation. We started to create it and prototype it, then we started to put these prototypes on the desks of people. We tried to convince people, and there was a general excitement about that idea. But for a variety of different reasons, it was not part of the marketing agenda. What are the reasons? Well, they are the typical one that you find in a company.
First of all, those marketing agendas are decided by marketing, not by designers. They own those agendas, and they follow specific deadlines, specific moments in the season, there is a Halloween, there is back-to-school, there is super bowl, there are a variety of different things. You used to work in a certain way, there was not initially the gap. There is also if you want, this is very human, they had not invented your syndrome. It is not my idea, it is your idea. It is interesting, but I'm not really interested. Long story short, and this is what I mentioned in the book and I think is very important, what changed the game was not just the gap in the agenda of the year, was the fact that the person, a marketer, a human being with a name and the last name, decided to find that gap and leverage the gap because you could have had the gap and not do anything anyway with us. It's always about people. It was the collision between myself, people in my team with a passion that were resilience, didn't give up and kept pushing.
Then the kindness, division, the empathy, the ability to open his mind and listen to people different than him. Off this marketing leader, they decided to embrace that idea. We made it happen, and we launched Pepsi Perfect in the middle of the night, I think it was 4:00 AM something like. In 21st of October of 2015 was exactly the time Marty McFly went to his future and landed in the future. We drop it in amazon.com and in Walmart.com, and we sold out in seconds. We sold a lot of licensing, the caps and shirts, record sales of licensing just in one week, and there was a ha-ha moment for the company. The company realized that in this kind of operations there was value. It was the first of many that we did in a variety of different ways over the years. These operations had being very powerful because they've been generating very authentic content for us, transforming people, embracing these ideas in the best ambassadors for our brands, our products, the moment they take that idea, that experience, and they share it with the rest of the world.
Ricky Mulvey: It also creates scarcity around a product that is not scarce at all. I can go to the 7-Eleven a block away from me and grab a Pepsi bottle. However, if it's in this different packaging that I remember from watching Back to the Future 2, then there's different levels of connection with it.
Mauro Porcini: Yeah, then look it's not easy to do, there is a full strategy because you go from when we do limited edition packaging or limited edition products in general, you go from the ones that are almost impossible to find, they go just to influencers and in some cases, we don't even sell them, to the ones that are sold in limited quantities like Pepsi Perfect. All the way to the ones that you can find in any Walmarts in the United States, in any Target, in any Kroger, in any store. Each of them has a different design and characteristic because it's important when you are in every shelf of the united states or the world because we designed for the entire world, that you have easy navigation. For instance, of flavors, that the brand and the product is recognizable.
You want the excitement, you want people to go crazy about the beauty of the pack, but you also want people to find it on shelf easily. These are problems that eventually you don't have when the number of products that you create is very-very limited. It's very interesting, not just with packaging, the same with any kind of licensing, the collaborations we do in the world of fashion, with the [Block's] Square, with Puma, with Nike, and many other brands Zara, H&M. From supper high end all the way to mass fashion depending on the channel, depending on the kind of operation, the design change completely. Even though, we're still talking about Pepsi, Cheetos, Lay's the same brand with the same identity.
It's fascinating and it has been a journey also for all of us to understand the nuances of what works and what doesn't, and why we do it, why we do all of this, it makes sense today, eventually, didn't make sense too much 30 years ago. All of these activations across every touch point of the brands, excite people, build a new bond between these people and the brand. Transcending eventually the product itself, the color, the potato chips, and really creating that connection with the brand. Then once again, when you build a connection, people feel the pride, feel the desire of the instinct to share that experience with others. Then become, once again, the best possible ambassadors for these brands. Because it's not a brand anymore bragging about itself but it's your consumer or the people buying your products that are promoting the wonderful experience that they had with your brands and the products.
Ricky Mulvey: I really enjoyed learning about great designers in your book and your brushes with them, especially these people who have shaped our worlds in ways we may not expect. One of those is Stefano Marzano, who I know you've had interactions with, but he's in some ways help design touchscreens and virtual reality headsets in the cloud. Hoping you can tell us a little bit about him and how he shaped our world in ways we may not expect or may not know.
Mauro Porcini: Well, Stefano Marzano used to be the Head of Design of Philips in the '90s. For anybody that started the industrial design in those years around the world, especially in Europe, Stefano was a little bit of an icon to meet somebody that every young designer wanted to meet and know. Stefano, what he did in Philips, he literally shaped my approach to design. In the '90s, they were working on understanding ho society will look like 20 years later, 30 years later. Essentially, if you think about the '90s, they were thinking about how our society will look like today, in the age we're living today. What they were doing well, they were connecting designer, sociologists, marketers, people of business, together to envision first of all how society will change. How we will move, we will walk, we will play, we will take care of our health and how technologies will play a role in that society.
The theory of Philips was that technologies will be embedded, hidden inside our way of leaving. But aesthetically, our society will look really similar to the one of today, is just that the product surrounding us would be smarter. Your eyewear would be smarter and will help you enter in virtual reality, what we call today the metaverse. I remember working on vision of the future. The picture of these people playing ping pong in virtual reality in front of a physical digital table, but with somebody in one place and somebody else in another place. The idea of Cloud was already there, even though they were not calling it Cloud. Your collection of CDs was in the Cloud. You didn't have a physical device anymore. We're talking about the '90s where we still add CDs. We're talking about an age where Bluetooth didn't exist, Wi-Fi didn't exist, just to give you an idea and so that was fascinating.
This is what they've been trying to do since then. Think about PepsiCo today. A company like PepsiCo, you're like, well, you are the Chief Business Officer of PepsiCo, what do you do? You design pretty packaging of the products of the company, the brands of the company. While we do also that, we try to build financial value through that, but we also try to imagine where the world is going. We know that in the future, people will wake up in the morning and they will have some form of device on their skin. It could be an Apple Watch or it could be one of those patches that we launched almost two years ago with the Gatorade brand, the Gatorade Gx Patch, that monitor your skin, your sweating, the composition of your sweat. Let's say that you're going to have a smarter version of that patch, or you're going to have an Apple Watch or maybe or as we were imagining the word of Philips, you're going to have a tattoo.
You're going to have something on your skin that will monitor the way you sleep in this specific case. I wake up in the morning and Alexa or Google Home will tell me, Mauro, I know you didn't sleep very well. I would be like, what are you talking about, Alexa, l thought I slept so well? No, I analyzed your sleeping patterns and they were not really good, and check this and that part. Then Alexa obviously knows my healthy history. Alexa knows also my agenda of the day. I'm going to have a very busy day, and so Alexa is going to tell the machine that I have in the kitchen to customize a drink exactly on the base of what I love. They know that I love a lemon flavor and a hot drink in the morning, but adding a series of ingredients, vitamins, magnesium, turmeric, whatever is right for me that day, on the base of what I need exactly in that moment. What Mauro needs in that moment.
An analysis real-time on my body, and then an analysis of my full life and health history. Now, in the future on top of the drink, we will have the possibility also to 3D print a snack, or maybe a cookie. Then I still want to go to the restaurant and to have a good farm-to-table salad or a pasta with lobster or whatever I love, but I will have a series of snacks and drinks that will help me integrating the way I feed myself during the day in the most ideal possible way. Now, if you do this in your company, imagine your company, whatever is the industry of company, you need to do this. You need to leverage design thinkers together with your scientists, engineers, business leaders altogether, sociologists, the human scientist. With designers, envision what is the future, design it, create it, make prototypes.
Then the strategy should inform your acquisition strategy, your new venture strategy and partnerships you do with companies today. What we do in PepsiCo, your quick cycle innovation strategy, so the products that you want to launch quickly, market, eventually leveraging the digital channel to test ideas, to make prototypes of products, business models, surpass different ideas of communication and branding, and then learn out of it, and then feed with those insights, the breakthrough projects that you're going to drive from within. Then the first stream of work is the real breakthrough projects, that they have some form of technological advantage. That's the ideal breakthrough projects because it's defendable in time and is sustainable in time, and is something worth investing years and resources, and taking the risk as well, because those projects obviously have a higher level of risk.
Ricky Mulvey: Well, and I also imagine building trust is huge with that. I looked at the Gx Sweat Patch, which it's a one-time essentially. I don't want to call it a sticker, but a patch that looks at your sweat and then tells you what optimal blend of Gatorade you should drink to recover. I saw that and I thought like, well, I would feel a little distrustful using that because maybe this would tell me I need to drink Gatorade when the actual answer is water or a cup of coffee, that thing. I imagine that's got to be a huge hurdle, that trust barrier for designers at companies to build that vision of the wearable future that you're talking about, in addition to battery and privacy issues.
Mauro Porcini: Well, look, the reality is that we'll have a series of technologies that our platform, and they will enable us having a better life. Then there are pioneers, companies, and brands that are starting to experiment with those technologies before order products and brands. Obviously, there is always the business goal of these products and brands and companies, but also the idea of advancing society and advancing the way people interact with products categories in entire industries, so the more a company, because you need companies. You can't have this technological platform just grow like mushrooms like these in society, so you need the companies to drive it. The more they do something that is relevant to people and the people start to use, the more you will build an ecosystem where other companies will arrive.
They will start to compete, they will apply their technology to other fields, and the technology will start to be used in a variety of different ways, in the most possible democratic way, but to accelerate all of these, to build value for people in society, to push technology to the next frontier, you need companies that embrace that culture of innovation, that embrace the cultural love for people, that embrace the idea that you're not there just to generate profit for yourself, for your shareholders, but you're there to generate value for society, for the world, for the planet first, that's your role as a company together in line with generating business value and financial value for your shareholders and for your company a. Again, while these 20-30 years ago may have sound like a little bit naive to some, the reality is that today the world is so different. The competitive landscape is so different, is so extreme, that either you build the culture in your company of excellence, you build the culture of innovation, you build a culture of love for the people you serve, and the culture is going to drive productivity, efficiency, effectiveness and quality, or somebody else will do it on your behalf in your industry, because that is what is going to happen.

2022-12-23 00:00:00+00:00,Is Amazon Stock a Buy Now?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-amazon-stock-a-buy-now-2,,,"It would be an understatement to say that 2022 has not been kind to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) investors, who have watched the e-commerce giant's stock lose almost 50% of its value.
In fact, after its big run-up during the onset of the pandemic, Amazon stock has been a bit of a bummer to own, first going nowhere in 2021 and then collapsing this year. As a result, it has become the first company ever to lose $1 trillion in market valuation.
So does that signal a buying opportunity for investors, or do they face even more pain in the future? Here's what investors need to know about this undoubtedly unique situation.
Image source: Amazon.
The primary pressure point
As one of the world's largest and most influential companies, it's obvious Amazon's e-commerce business has been the major driver of its growth. But the signs have also been clear that its sales strength is flagging.
One reason for the slowdown has been the rise of surprisingly effective competition in the e-commerce space. Amazon is no longer the only game in town; Walmart, Target, and even eBay have proved tougher than expected, making it difficult for Amazon to maintain its growth rates and market share.
Although Amazon naturally dominates the e-commerce space with a 39% share of the market, or more than the next 10 biggest competitors combined, Walmart owns the grocery space with a 25% share compared to just 1% for Amazon, according to Euromonitor data. While that includes both online and physical stores, it's arguably one of the most important segments of the market. And though Walmart badly trails on the general merchandise front, it has shown resilience and enjoyed 16% e-commerce sales growth in the third quarter, or nearly double its overall growth rate of 8.7%.
The high cost of doing business
Amazon, for its part, has also had a lot of catching up to do. For example, whereas Walmart had long had a vast retail footprint to serve as a distribution network when it decided to go all-in on e-commerce, Amazon had to launch into hurry-up mode to build out a physical logistics network to compete.
Over the past few years, the company has expanded its operations to include a vast network of warehouses, fulfillment centers, and delivery vehicles. While this has allowed Amazon to offer even faster, more convenient shipping to customers, once again upending the retail industry, the process has also come with significant costs. These infrastructure costs continue to weigh on its full profit potential.
Amazon admits it regularly experiences increases in its net shipping costs due to complimentary upgrades, split-order shipments, and ensuring timely delivery, particularly during the holiday season. Year to date, fulfillment costs exceed $61.2 billion, up 16% from the same point last year, and now represent 16.8% of sales, a 100 basis point increase from the year-ago period.
The real profit center
Historically high inflation is also taking a toll on consumer spending. And though high prices have eased somewhat, it continues to apply pressure on Amazon's sales and stock price.
Despite these challenges, Amazon has other businesses to fall back on that are performing well, most notably Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company's cloud computing platform has long been the primary source of profitability for Amazon. It is also expected to continue to be a growth driver in the future.
AWS's revenue continues to chug along, jumping 27% in the third quarter and standing 32% higher over the year's first nine months. Year-to-date operating profits of $17.3 billion are 33% higher year over year and comprise all of Amazon's operating income so far.

Potentially bigger opportunities to come
Finally, it's worth considering the potential of Amazon's digital advertising business. The company has made significant investments in this area, and it has the potential to be a major growth driver. The digital advertising space is highly competitive, but Amazon is proving it can further differentiate itself from other players and potentially capture a significant share of the market.
Amazon is the place where almost everyone begins their search for a product, even more so than Alphabet's Google, and while most online sites saw third-quarter sales slump, Amazon's advertising revenue surged 25% to $9.5 billion.
Amazon also recently broadened its suite of advertising options for marketers to include things like more video as well as its Amazon Marketing Cloud, which lets clients connect their data to that which Amazon collects on its customers. It could be a powerful combination that will attract companies looking to reach customers reluctant to spend.
So is it a buy?
Amazon's stock doesn't look cheap at 80 times trailing earnings and 60 times next year's estimates. But at less than twice its sales, the e-commerce giant is trading at a sales-oriented valuation not seen since 2015.
Despite the negative headlines about its slowing retail business, Amazon remains the go-to place on the internet, while its diverse ancillary businesses give it a diverse portfolio of opportunities that provides a solid foundation for future growth.

This video was recorded on Dec. 03, 2022.
David Rubenstein: What Ryan would say is, when you hold onto assets, you give the entrepreneur, the CEO, some real-time to make improvements and really grow the company. But you also have two other great advantages. One, you can avoid taxes because if you're not selling, you don't have a taxable income. Secondly, you can compound a bigger amount of money. If you're not selling you are therefore don't paying taxes, you're compounding on a bigger corpus.
Chris Hill: I'm Chris Hill, and that's David Rubenstein. He's the co-founder and co-chairman of the Carlyle Group, a global investment firm that happens to run one of the biggest private equity funds out there. He is also the author of How to Invest: Masters on the Craft. It's a book about what the most successful investors have in common. Motley Fool Senior Analyst John Rotonti caught up with Rubenstein to talk about what makes a realistic rate of return and the common themes among great investors like Larry Fink, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Warren Buffett.
John Rotonti: I want to jump into the interviews you conducted for the book, but first I have a few questions about your own investing in a business career. Carlyle has generated 26 percent annualized returns in its private equity funds over a more than 30-year period. That's truly incredible. What are Carlyle's investment criteria and what are the secrets to your firm's investing success?
David Rubenstein: Well, that's not easy to answer though so succinctly, but essentially in private equity, we do many different things other than private equity. But in private equity, we generally tend to be not at the cutting edge of the most novel thing. We tend not to be a venture capital investor, we tend not to be an early stage investor. We tend to do more classic buyouts or significant stakes in companies even though we might not be a classic buyout. We generally are big believers in debt pay-down and making certain that we don't pay EBITDA multiples that are hard to sustain. We basically are not likely to get a lot of 100 times our money deals, but we generally avoid a lot of zero times our money deals. Classic bread-and-butter buyouts that are well-financed in industries that are understandable and that have pretty good CEOs.
John Rotonti: I love that the first rule of investing is don't lose money. In the book, you say that successful investing is ultimately about predicting the future. In fact, you say that Warren Buffett is the best long-term investor of all time and so he could also be considered the best long-term predictor of the future. But as investors, we are constantly hearing that the future is impossible to predict on a consistent basis. Which one is it? Is predicting the future futile, or is it the essence of long-term successful investing?
David Rubenstein: Well as I tried to say in the book, all of life is really about predicting the future. Should you marry this person, should you go to this school, is it going to work out? You don't really know where things are going to go, but you're trying to make your best guess about the future. We don't have perfect ways of measuring how successful you are in predicting the future. But in business and investing, we do have a perfect way. That's profit and loss, internal rates of return, multiples and invested capital and so forth. Warren Buffett has been, but maybe the greatest investor of all time in the sense that he has averaged about a 20 percent return a year for 60 years. That's pretty long time. He's pretty good at predicting the future. I would say not perfect, nobody is, I would say nobody is perfectly going to be able to predict where the world's going two years from now, five years from now. But generally, good investors have a pretty good nose for where the world is going to go. They generally would reasonably work for, and they would really take some risks, but nobody is perfect of course.
John Rotonti: You write that, ""The investment guys do not reward those who hope good luck will provide superior investment returns on a regular basis. As with casino gambling, good luck at the outset of an investor process or career can actually be bad luck. One will think that genius rather than good luck was involved and will repeat itself so a doubling down on the next investment will probably occur, typically result in losses greater than the initial gains."" Do you think there are a lot of investors in the market today that had some good luck in the markets in 2020 and 2021 that see themselves as geniuses today?
David Rubenstein: Well, there's no doubt that some people that did very well in the run-up of tech multiples a couple of years ago and growth capital multiples a couple of years ago, and crypto technology for awhile and so forth. Tech people though, hey, I really am smarter than people thought I was. I really am smarter than all those people that got better grades than me in college and law school or business school. I am pretty smart. I have a knack for this that nobody really recognized before. There's no doubt there's some of that hubris, and some of that, I would say self-deception. But generally, the most grounded investors recognize that there's luck involved. They don't just say, because I did well in one year or two years, I'm really a genius. I think the really good investors are always nervous about the world falling apart and always worried about protecting their downside. That's one of the reasons why I tried to point out in the book. The really good investors have a certain amount of humility because they know the markets can go against them and they're not really going to be able to do anything about it. Therefore a really good investor say, when the markets are moving against me, I'm going to get out. I'm not going to say the tape is wrong, the markets are wrong. Everybody else has an idiot, I'm smart. They tend to make a willingness to get out of bad decisions and go onto the next thing.
John Rotonti: You also say that overpaying for an asset or company rarely has a pleasant outcome for the buyer. What are your thoughts on current valuations, either in public stock market or in private market buyouts?
David Rubenstein: Well, there's no doubt that the stock market has adjusted and probably appropriately so. I'd say a correction is considered to be a 20 percent decline from more or less the peak. I suspect in the stock market averages, we're now probably down a little bit more than 20 percent from the peak over a couple of years ago. Private market valuations have not come down as much. That is something that some people wonder about. Are the private market valuations really meeting the test of the market? Or they really are some self-deception by the people who are doing these markets? Because in public markets as you know, the public is, everybody in the world is really in fact making that decision about where the market is or the value is of the stock or the other asset. In private markets, you tend to be having an outside consultant. You might have your accounting firm and you have your own professionals, and whether the market is as tough on the value of the asset as possible, some people question. But I do think the private markets have not come down quite as much as public markets. Some people think there will be a further diminution in some private markets. I think the private markets are probably reasonably accurate. Private companies are generally better companies than public companies in many ways. I don't think the markets are going to go down appreciably from where they are now.
John Rotonti: In the book, you say investors with realistic expectations of rates of return tend to be more successful. Investors who are chasing rates of return that are unrealistic based on historic norms, will generally be disappointed. What do you think is a reasonable expectation for required rate of return for a good stock market investor, let's say over the next five years?
David Rubenstein: Over the last 100 years or so, public market stock averages above average shown roughly six percent a year so the stock market goes up on average about six percent a year. Obviously some years higher, some years lower. If you're a stock market investor, you should probably be looking net of inflation. I'm not talking about taking into account inflation. Assume inflation zero for a moment, six percent or so. If it's inflation is one or two percent then that's obviously lower than that by four or five percent is what you're talking about net of inflation. If you go into the stock market thinking you're going to do much better than that on average over a long period of time, you're probably fooling yourself, unless you're Warren Buffett or you have some unusual talent. That's why for most people I think it's probably a good idea to take Index Fund. If you're a doctor or a dentist, well, they're very good professions, you're probably busy doing something other than looking at stock markets and assessing companies. Probably get somebody who's a professional to do that for you and probably meeting the market averages is probably what you should expect.
Now if you're in fixed income, you're obsessed with not taking this stock market risk, you just want steady income, then you're probably looking at a lower rate of return. As we know historically, fixed income returns probably you're averaging two or three percent on average. Now because the Fed interest rate is on higher now, you can probably get three and four percent rates of return on fixed-income instruments for some period of time. I would say on your private markets, you're looking for double-digit rates of return. It depends on whether your infrastructure, your real estate, core real estate, opportunistic real estate, venture capital, growth capital buyouts. But on the whole, all of these so-called alternative assets, I think people are looking for double-digit multiples. Sometimes maybe 10 or 11 percent in infrastructure, maybe 15 percent in some opportunistic real estate and private equity, maybe 16, 17, 18 percent net internal rates of return. If you have realistic expectations, you won't be disappointed. If you think you're going to get 25 percent net internal rates of return on a consistent basis, you're going to be fooling yourself.
John Rotonti: One of the things I love about the alternative asset manager model is you got infrastructure where you're expecting 10-12 percent, you've got some other things where you're going 12-14 percent and in private equity above that. You're investing across that growth spectrum. You'll like that some of the wealthiest individuals you've ever met are not really happy people. It's not necessary to be a world-class investor to have a world-class life. What do you think brings happiness?
David Rubenstein: That's the most elusive thing in life and I think from the dawn of civilization, people have been trying to achieve happiness and some people get it and some people don't. What I said in the book is that some of the wealthiest people I know are some of the unhappiest people in the world that I know. That's because they have higher expectations. They want people to say they're great, they want to get more satisfaction from their children or their spouse, and they don't get it, or they don't think that people recognize how talented they are, or they don't find the pleasure in buying the art and the houses and the yachts that they thought they were going get. I think the greatest way to get happiness is to be grounded and have realistic expectations of what you can achieve in life, and then you get the greatest pleasure in my view from helping other people. That's not a novel comment, but I think people that help other people in philanthropy or other ways feel more fulfilled in life than people that don't. Generally, some people that are not wealthy, but have a modest expectation of what they want out of life and do help other people are among the happiest people I know.
John Rotonti: Larry Fink, founder of BlackRock, is known for having an extremely thoughtful and comprehensive view of the macro factors driving markets and economies. He says that he built up this ability by traveling the world and talking to government leaders, and clients, and then using those conversations and lessons to build his view of the investing landscape. He says, ""It's all additive. It's like sedimentary rock, a layer here, a layer there, and soon enough you'll have some substance."" David, how important do you think it is for great investors to be very macro-aware, similar to, but obviously not to the same extent as Larry think?
David Rubenstein: I saw Larry about a week or so ago. He took his entire board of BlackRock throughout the Middle East and introduced them to many people there and so they get a sense of what's going on in the Middle East. Larry obviously was getting a pretty good set of information himself from that trip. I do think it's important to be as aware if you can of what's going on around the world, and the more information you have about what's going on around the world, I think there'll be a better investor. I think it's one of the reasons Larry has been so successful. He's been willing to travel the world, get to meet people all over the world and hear what they say. Then obviously take his own perspectives and blend that with what he's learned. I do think it's important to travel or to get information from many different sources. The best investors absorb enormous amounts of information before they make a decision.
John Rotonti: Larry Fink says that investors may be making a mistake right now, thinking that we're going to return to the Go-Go years of benign inflation, very low-interest rates, and QE, and massive liquidity injections anytime soon. What do you think about this?
David Rubenstein: I agree with him. I think that we're not likely to see two percent inflation for quite some time again. I think that the Go-Go era that we went through in terms of technology and so forth, I think it's probably in abeyance for awhile. I think we're going to have to suffer through probably some negative quarters and recession type of environment for maybe a couple of quarters next year. Not a deep recession, but some modest recession. I think for a while, people are going to be nervous about where the markets are going and whether the valuations we saw years ago for technology companies, whether that can be seen again in the next 10 years or so, I'm skeptical.
John Rotonti: Ron Baron's partner fund has generated low to mid-teen returns since inception. Since 1992, it's the best performing mutual fund out of more than 2,000 funds that it's measured against. His firm has generated over $50 billion in profits for its clients. What do you think are the keys to Ron Baron success as a public stock market picker and portfolio manager?
David Rubenstein: Ron would say that he has two things that he does that make him very successful. One, he does a lot of due diligence very carefully and he does it himself. I remember when Carlyle was going public, we went to meet with Ron Baron's firm and he showed up and he was taking a lot of notes and he was very thoughtful. He asked very good questions. He does a lot of due diligence, he does a lot of work, and he knows what he's talking about. Secondly, he does intend to sale. He intends to like to buy in the companies where the entrepreneurs still owns a big stake in it on the theory that they're going to make sure it's going to work if they own a big stake in it. He intends to hold for long periods of time. He was an early advocate for Elon Musk and made a fair amount of money in Tesla and SpaceX by holding onto assets. What Ron would say is, when you'll hold onto assets, you give the entrepreneur, the CEO some real time to make improvements and really grow the company. But you also have two other great advantages. One, you can avoid taxes because if you're not selling, you don't have a taxable income. Secondly, you can compound a bigger amount of money so if you're not selling you therefore not paying taxes, you're compounding on a bigger corpus and so by not selling which he doesn't really sell that much that frequently. He tends to ride his winners quite a long way. He's a very smart person and while he came from a background as I did as a lawyer, like me, he wasn't really happy with the law.
John Rotonti: Jon Gray, president of Blackstone, I believe he's in line to one day become the CEO of Blackstone which is largest alternative asset management company in the world. He built Blackstone into the largest real estate company in the world and he helped orchestrate a $14 billion profit for Blackstone on Blackstone's investment in Hilton Hotels, which is the most profitable buyout in history. What do you think makes Jon Gray such an incredible real estate investor?
David Rubenstein: John is very smart. He got a good IQ, he's very hard-working, that's useful too, but he's got an engaging personality. There are a lot of very smart people that are hard-working, but John has an engaging personality, which makes people want to do business with them. You can't buy something if people don't want to do business with you, and you can't sell something to somebody if people don't want to buy from you, but John as an engaging personality is likable, he's modest on assuming not a big ego, and I think people just enjoy doing business with him. That's been a big plus as well. He's also been able to motivate a team of people around the world to build a really great real estate business. He built the largest opportunistic real estate business in the world by far and done some of the most successful deal. I think it's a combination of intelligence, hard work, and an engaging personality.
John Rotonti: In the book, he says that his best advice is to ""Be a high-conviction investor."" He goes on to say ""When you dabble and just put a bunch of money on things you don't know or understand, it tends to work out badly."" You have also built one of the most successful alternative investment firms in the world. What do you think of that advice, to be a high-conviction investor and not to dabble and things you don't understand?
David Rubenstein: Well, I agree with him because if you try to do a little bit of everything, you'll probably do nothing very well. What he means by high conviction is make sure you really know what you're doing. Spent a lot of time and energy in making certain you have all the facts, and then if you're convinced that you're doing right, then go in and basically make a significant investment. That's what George Soros has always said. When you have a great idea, dabble down and don't just think it's a great idea and put a modest amount in it, put a great amount of money behind the ideas you have high convictions in, and that's what I think Jon Gray's done. When he's done an analysis or his team has done an analysis as they did in the EOP transaction, which was the biggest real estate deal of all time, they really knew what they were doing, but they also knew that they should pre-sell some of the assets because the market could go down so they pre-sold, in that case, three-quarters of the assets and what they were left with turn out to be extremely successful for them.
John Rotonti: Yeah. This next question, I'm combining the advice from four or five people in your book because they all gave almost the exact same advice. John Rogers, founder of Ariel Investments, says ""The best way to be a successful investor was to be contrarian, to not follow the crowd."" Dawn Fitzpatrick, the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Soros Fund Management says ""In this industry, you make money by having a view that's not the consensus, and over time becomes the consensus view. You have to have the confidence to have opinions and be an independent thinker and then be willing to bet on them."" Ray Dalio, the founder of the largest hedge fund in the world, says the most important thing is ""The ability to be an independent thinker. You can never go with the consensus, the consensus is built into the price."" Seth Klarman, who's done 15 percent annualized over nearly 40 years and has had only four down years in those 40, says that value investing is ""The marriage of the calculator and a contrarian streak."" He also says ""Not drawn to hot areas or to what other people are doing."" He has no interest in chasing things just because they're going up. David, do you think contrarian is a prerequisite for long-term out-performance, and how important was contrarianism to the success of the Carlyle Group?
David Rubenstein: Well, first I do agree with that view and I say that that is what all the great investors have in common. They defy conventional wisdom. The conventional wisdom says, the stock market is going down and you shouldn't invest. They tend to go in and buy things at discounts, but they have to have some independent judgment and they have to do their own research. But yes, if you basically go along with the pack, you will be the pack or whatever the market averages, that's what you'll do. Obviously, you have to do something different than what the average person is doing, and typically, people are doing something that's quite contrary, and many times people laugh at them when they're doing it, but they often turn out to be right, at least the very good ones too. Starting Carlyle was contrary, no one thought you're going to build a private equity firm in Washington DC, and then secondly, we tended to focus in industries initially that people didn't think you could make money in. We did a lot in the aerospace defense industry. Initially, we had Frank Carlucci, former Secretary of Defense in our firm, and we had some expertise of other people as well. We invested in some industries that people didn't think you could do. One of the biggest contrarian things we did where the two were contrarian at the time now they seem like common things. But in the early days of private equity, you are either a buyout firm or a venture firm or a growth capital firm or whatever, but nobody did everything. We decided we would have multiple funds and like T Rowe Price or Fidelity or Vanguard have multiple funds and try to sell the brand name of that. We did that and that hadn't been done before. Then secondly, we globalize the business by having a dedicated team in Europe, Asia, Japan, Latin America, Africa, and so forth. We had our own dedicated teams elsewhere around the world. Historically you didn't invest outside the country you were based in or you didn't have dedicated teams there, so we did those things that were contrarian at the time now they're not seen as that contrarian. We did things that were contrary and that helped us grow the firm.
John Rotonti: Yeah. In the book, you try to summarize these qualities that these investors share, but you write ""No other characteristic of a great investor is as important to their success as their willingness to ignore conventional wisdom."" That seems to be like the one that's common across all investors.
David Rubenstein: I think it's the most significant. There are other characteristics that are in the book, but that's the most significant one for sure.
John Rotonti: Yeah. Seth Klarman says the margin of safety concept is critical. Do you invest with a margin of safety?
David Rubenstein: Well, we hope to. Margin of safety is the title of course, of his legendary book, which is not in print and I think goes for a very expensive price on eBay, and he hasn't done a second edition. He took that title, I think from one of the chapters and another book that's very famous on security analysis. You always want something that gives you some margin of safety, so you don't want to think, well, if everything works out here, we're going to be great and we're going to get a three percent rate of return. You want to have a much higher rate of return because you need a margin of safety if something goes wrong, and so you don't want to be doing things just right at the edge where you think if everything works out, you're going to be OK, but you want to have a big enough margin so if everything doesn't work out, you might be better than just OK, but you want to have a big enough margin of safety so that if the world goes against you, you are not going to be in trouble.
John Rotonti: One of my favorite quotes in the book comes from Seth Klarman. He says ""Risk aversion is crucial. The margin of safety concept along with a disciplined approach to buying and selling. A lot of people forget to sell, and it's important when securities or investments reached full value that you move on. Then there's the criticality of independent and sometimes contrary thinking."" How important is having a sell discipline and knowing when to sell as an alternative asset manager?
David Rubenstein: Well, I think it's important. I know sometimes in our own firm, we have people that think that the deal was supposed to get a 25 percent net internal rate of return, it's now marked at 20 percent. They said, well, no it's going to be there in a couple of more years, let's wait. We often have to push people to say look, 20 percent net is OK, don't be piggish. As the old saying is, pigs get fed and hogs get slaughtered. I think there's another famous saying by a great investor from the 1920s Bernard Baruch. Who said, nobody ever got fired for taking a profit. If you can make a really good profit of good profit by anybody's measure, take it. Sometimes at Carlyle, we think that a company is going to make six times its money and we now market at four times his money and we are sometimes reluctant to sell. I think we should probably do a better job in that. I do agree with Seth. It's a good idea to remember that there's an advantage and selling when you're making a profit.

2022-12-09 00:00:00+00:00,Buy These 2 Popular Internet Software Stocks,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-these-2-popular-internet-software-stocks,,,"There is always an abundance of stocks to choose from but investing is often more fruitful and rewarding when investors understand the company’s business model and believe in the company themselves.
Here are two well-known companies from the Internet-Software Industry that investors may be feeling optimistic about as we head into the new year. The Internet-Software Industry is currently in the top 24% of over 250 Zacks Industries.  
Chegg CHGG
Chegg (CHGG) is a meaningful investment on most fronts. Many investors are putting money aside for their children/grandchildren's future education or even trying to finish up a higher level of schooling themselves and are familiar with Chegg’s social education platform.
Chegg is a popular option for students and learners to study and understand their course material. The company rents and sells textbooks, and provides eTextbooks in addition to homework help and college admissions and scholarship services.  
CHGG currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with earnings estimates on the rise for FY22 and FY23.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
CHGG earnings are now expected to decline -1% in 2022 to $1.28 per share but this is up 14% from $1.12 a share 90 days ago. FiY23 earnings are projected to climb 7% to $1.38 per share with earnings estimates also going up over the last quarter.
Sales are forecasted to be down -1% this year but rise 7% in FY23 to $816.84 million. FY23 sales are on pace to grow an impressive 199% over the last five years.
Chegg stock is down -9% YTD Vs. The S&P 500’s -18%. This has also outperformed the Nasdaq’s -29%. Since going public almost, a decade ago, CHGG is up +205% to also beat the broader indexes.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Trading around $27 per share, Chegg shares trade at 21.9X forward earnings. This is nicely below the Internet-Software industry average of 45.4X. Even better, this is well below its decade high of 501X and a 79% discount from its decade median of 106.2X.
PayPal PYPL  
Another popular Internet-Software stock that looks attractive at current levels is PayPal (PYPL). PayPal has become one of the largest online payment solutions providers following its independent spinoff from eBay EBAY in 2015.
PayPal is responsible for making payment solutions much easier for consumers during the rise of the internet as the frequent use of the checkbook became outdated and incompatible with online purchases.
PayPal’s stock may have reached oversold territory. Wall Street questioned the premium paid for PYPL earlier in the year amid rising inflation but the stock looks attractive at current levels. PYPL currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
Trading around $73 per share and roughly 62% from its 52-week highs PYPL has a P/E of 23.7X. This is well below the Internet-Software industry average of 45.4X. PYPL trades 170% beneath its five-year high of 87.8X and at a 50% discount to the median of 48.1X.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
In addition to this, earnings estimates have gone higher. Earnings are now projected to decline -11% to $4.08 per share in 2022 but this is up from EPS estimates of $3.93 a share 90 days ago. Fiscal 2023 EPS is expected to rebound and pop 17% to $4.78 a share. This is also up from estimates of $4.70 a share last quarter.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
On the top line, sales are forecasted to rise 8% this year and another 8% in FY23 to $29.88 billion. Fiscal 2023 sales would represent 68% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $17.77 billion.
With solid growth still expected, this year’s drop in the stock is looking more and more like a buying opportunity. PYPL is down -60% YTD to underperform the benchmark and the Nasdaq.
However, since its spinoff from eBay eight years ago, PYPL is still up +100% to beat the benchmark and slightly trail the Nasdaq.

Bottom Line
Trading attractively relative to their past, Chegg and PayPal could see their stocks rise as we head into 2023. These popular tech companies have businesses that are well-known, beneficial, and helpful to consumers. The rising earnings estimate revisions and top line growth indicate this should continue.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Top Analyst Reports for Home Depot, Diageo and Enbridge
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Home Depot, Inc., Diageo plc and Enbridge Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>
Shares of Home Depot have modestly lagged rival Lowe's (LOW) and the broader market this year (-22.9% vs. -20% for LOW and -18.7% for the S&P 500 index). The company reported soft gross margin in the fiscal third quarter driven by higher supply chain investments. Higher inventory levels and interest expense also remain concerning.

However, Home Depot reported its 10th straight quarter of earnings and sales beat in the fiscal third quarter. Results also outpaced our estimate in Q3. It continues to gain from strong demand for home-improvement projects, robust housing market trends and ongoing investments.
It also witnessed continued strength in both Pro and DIY categories, and digital momentum. Its interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have helped consistently boost web traffic for the past few quarters, aiding digital sales.

(You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>>)
Shares of Diageo have underperformed the Zacks Beverages - Alcohol industry over the past year (-9.4% vs. -1.5%). The company is facing continued inflationary pressures and currency headwinds that are concerning. However, recovery in the on-trade channel, strong consumer demand in the off-trade and market share gains aided Diageo’s fiscal 2022 results.
It witnessed sales, operating margin and earnings growth driven by organic sales growth across all regions. Price/mix gained from a positive mix due to the robust growth in super-premium-plus brands, particularly scotch, tequila and Chinese white spirits.

DEO’s margin trends were favorable in fiscal 2022, thanks to its premiumization efforts, recovery in markets, pricing actions and supply productivity savings, which mostly offset the cost inflation. It provided a decent view for fiscal 2023, with net sales growth expected across North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.
(You can read the full research report on Diageo here >>>)
Enbridge shares have gained +3.9% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry’s gain of +11.1%. The company has the longest and most sophisticated oil and liquids pipeline system in the world, which spreads across 17,809 miles. Hence, a significant portion of the midstream operator’s earnings is generated from transportation operations, driven by a string of long-term contracts.

Enbridge announced the increase of its annualized common share dividend to C$3.55 per share, thereby marking a dividend increase for 28 straight years. The company expects to put more than C$10 billion of growth projects into service in 2024 and beyond. This is expected to generate significant EBITDA growth in the coming years.

However, ENB has significant debt exposure since there has been a weakness in its operations. Also, Enbridge has mostly been yielding lower dividends than the industry over the past year.  As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.

2022-12-08 00:00:00+00:00,3 Dividend Stocks That Are Dirt Cheap Right Now,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dividend-stocks-that-are-dirt-cheap-right-now-4,,,"One quick (and maybe overly simple) way to shop for bargains among steady dividend growth stocks is to look for a dividend yield trading above its three-year average. This is the case for the three dividend growth stocks we will examine today.
EBAY dividend yield; data by YCharts.
However, that's not the only reason to like eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), Pool (NASDAQ: POOL), and Thor Industries (NYSE: THO). All three are attractively valued and have excellent operations. This combination of dirt-cheap valuation, recently higher dividend yields, and steady growth make these three businesses fantastic decades-long holdings. Let's dive in.
1. eBay
With a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.6, e-commerce site eBay and its asset-light operations can now be purchased at a valuation it only saw briefly in 2015 and 2019.
EBAY PS ratio; data by YCharts.
Hit by year-over-year revenue declines of 5%, 6%, and 2% (excluding foreign exchange impacts) over the first three quarters of 2022, eBay's stock has declined 33% year to date.
Similarly, its trailing-12-month free cash flow (FCF) also tumbled as the company continued to lap formidable pandemic-aided comparable figures from 2021.
Despite this decline, eBay still trades at 18 times FCF, way below the S&P 500 index's median figure of 41. Along with this cheap-looking valuation, eBay has two key operational drivers that could propel its stock price upward.
EBAY free cash flow; data by YCharts.
First, its ""focus categories"" -- such as trading cards, refurbished goods, and auto parts and accessories -- delivered gross merchandise volume (GMV) growth 7 percentage points higher than the rest of the company's platform. Trading card GMV has more than doubled since 2019, while the rest of the focus categories grew by roughly 20% over the same time.
Second, eBay's advertising business delivered 27% growth (minus currency effects) in the third quarter compared to last year despite GMV declining 5% over the same time. Already accounting for 12% of eBay's revenue in the third quarter of 2022, these ads only have a GMV penetration rate of 1.6%, implying there is plenty of runway remaining for these high-margin sales.
On top of these growth drivers and a dirt-cheap valuation, eBay pays a 2% dividend that only uses roughly one-third of the company's FCF, and it has lowered its shares outstanding by 47% over the last five years. Thanks to this amalgamation of factors, eBay looks like a tremendous dirt-cheap investment to hold for the next decade.
2. Pool
Anyone who owns a pool also needs to maintain it. That's where Pool Corporation comes in. It is the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies. And with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16, its shares today are trading at a cheap valuation not seen in over a decade.
POOL PE ratio; data by YCharts.
Despite growing sales and earnings per share (EPS) in all three quarters so far in 2022 compared to last year -- capped by 14% revenue growth in the third quarter -- Pool's stock has slid roughly 40% year to date as the market expects a slowdown.
Thanks to this freshly lower price and a once-in-a-decade valuation, Pool's operations deserve a look from dividend investors despite a potential deceleration in growth. With roughly 80% of the company's sales coming from maintenance, refurbishments, and repairs, most of the revenue is in the form of recurring sources.
The average swimming pool in North America is 25 years old, and Pool stands to benefit through the maintenance, refurbishment, or replacement of these aging pools.
Impressively, the company has grown EPS and FCF per share by 985% and 158%, respectively over the last decade -- and that's despite spending over $500 million in cash to build its inventory as it expands.
POOL shares outstanding; data by YCharts.
Most importantly for investors, Pool has shown a commitment to returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Its dividend has increased for 12 straight years and currently sports a yield of 1.2%. And with a payout ratio of just 18%, the dividend has a long runway for future growth.
Powered by the twin engines of strong returns to shareholders and the company's large percentage of non-discretionary recurring revenue, Pool's historically cheap valuation shouldn't be ignored at today's prices.
3. Thor Industries
If you're looking to hit the road in a motor home, chances are you may turn to Thor Industries. The Indiana-based company is the world largest maker of recreational vehicles. But what may most interest investors is the stock's P/S ratio of just 0.29, which is near an all-time low valuation.
THO PS ratio; data by YCharts.
Despite recording new all-time highs in sales and operating cash flow at $16.3 billion and $990 million, respectively, Thor's stock has dropped 11% so far in 2022.
With a leading market share for every category of towable and motorized RVs, Thor still has an $8.8 billion backlog of orders despite its incredible sales in 2022. Thanks to figures like these, the company has managed continuous profitability since 1980, an astonishing feat for a company operating in what is generally considered a highly cyclical industry.
The stock today offers a 1.9% dividend, and Thor uses just 8% of its net income to fund that payout, suggesting that its 11-year streak of dividend increases is only just beginning.
Best yet for investors, while the company might be forced to lap record-setting sales figures, 98% of its new RV owners said they intend to buy again, according to a Thor-conducted study. Existing RV owners say they plan to repurchase within the next five years, and 31% of those surveyed who don't own an RV said they plan to buy one at some point.
With Thor's dirt-cheap P/S ratio, steady profitability, growing cash flows, and large backlog, its shares look like an attractive opportunity for investors today.

2022-12-07 00:00:00+00:00,Why Chewy Was a Dog of a Stock on Wednesday,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-chewy-was-a-dog-of-a-stock-on-wednesday,,,"What happened
Many investors weren't eager to chew on shares of Chewy (NYSE: CHWY) Wednesday. Following an uninspiring new analyst note, they traded out of the pet products specialist, sending its share price down by more than 1%, against the 0.2% slump of the S&P 500 index.
So what
That note, an update on leading e-commerce stocks, was written by Wolfe Research analyst Deepak Mathivanan. In his research, Mathivanan generally lowered his expectations for e-commerce titles due to the latest consumer trends.
The analyst cited major factors behind his reasoning. First, he believes that due to high penetration that exceeds 20% in numerous Western markets, growth will start to slow. Second, in his view, revenue growth for e-commerce companies in 2022 was due in part to inflation, and current consensus estimates for such operators are unrealistically high.
Despite his gloomier view, Mathivanan remained bullish on some of the sector's top names. Chewy, however, wasn't one of them. Of that stock and e-commerce facilitator Shopify, he wrote that the recent ""relief rally"" in these companies ""pushed me toward stepping to the sidelines"" with that pair of titles.
Now what
Mathivanan might not be so hot on Chewy, but he continues to believe that other titles in the space still offer value. He reiterated his outperform (buy) recommendations on sector leaders Amazon and MercadoLibre, on the back of relatively strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. He's also maintaining his outperform recommendation on eBay, which in his mind still trades at a ""highly discounted valuation.""

2022-12-07 00:00:00+00:00,Groupon (GRPN) Down 14.6% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/groupon-grpn-down-14.6-since-last-earnings-report%3A-can-it-rebound,,,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Groupon (GRPN). Shares have lost about 14.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Groupon due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.
Groupon Q3 Loss Wider Than Expected, Revenues Down Y/Y
Groupon reported a third-quarter 2022 non-GAAP loss of 68 cents per share, which was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 56 cents.
The company had reported non-GAAP earnings of 38 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.
Revenues of $144.39 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.30%. The figure declined 33% on a year-over-year basis (down 30% excluding the foreign exchange effect).
Region-wise, North America revenues slumped 25% year over year to $107.9 million. International revenues fell 49% (down 41% excluding the foreign exchange effect) to $36.5 million.

Local revenues of $127.9 million declined 27% year over year (down 24% excluding the foreign exchange effect). North America Local revenues decreased 24% while International Local revenues fell 35% year over year.
Consolidated Travel revenues decreased 30.8% year over year to $6.02 million. North America Travel revenues declined 10.2% year over year.

On a consolidated basis, Goods revenues declined 65.5% year over year to $10.437 million. North America Goods revenues declined 34.9% while International Goods revenues fell 78.8%, excluding the foreign exchange effect, on a year-over-year basis.

Groupon reported a free cash outflow of $51.840 million compared with $39.3 million of free cash flow reported in the previous quarter.
Guidance

For full-year 2023, Groupon expects a free cash flow of $100 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15-20%.
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?
Analysts were quiet during the last two month period as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.
VGM Scores
Currently, Groupon has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a C. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.
Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.
Outlook
Groupon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.
Performance of an Industry Player
Groupon is part of the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry. Over the past month, eBay (EBAY), a stock from the same industry, has gained 4.2%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2022 more than a month ago.
eBay reported revenues of $2.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.8%. EPS of $1 for the same period compares with $0.90 a year ago.
eBay is expected to post earnings of $1.06 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.
eBay has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions. Additionally, the stock has a VGM Score of B.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-12-01 00:00:00+00:00,EBAY January 2023 Options Begin Trading,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-january-2023-options-begin-trading,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options begin trading today, for the January 2023 expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new January 2023 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.69. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $43.31 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $45.23/share today.
Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.76% return on the cash commitment, or 31.88% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $45.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $46.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.62. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $45.23/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $46.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.28% if the stock gets called away at the January 2023 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $46.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $46.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.58% boost of extra return to the investor, or 30.40% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $45.23) to be 38%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-12-01 00:00:00+00:00,Should Investors Buy the Dip on Etsy Stock?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-investors-buy-the-dip-on-etsy-stock,,,"As the holidays near, the amount of Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) ads you'll experience will likely ramp up. This time of year is huge for Etsy's sellers, as handmade and customized gifts are extremely popular. If it goes well, Etsy sellers should see a sales boost -- benefiting the company and sellers.
That would be a welcome change to the end of 2022 for Etsy, as the company has struggled to grow sales throughout the year. As a result, the stock is down about 45% year to date. Is now the time to buy Etsy stock? Or should investors wait until after the holiday season? Let's find out.
Etsy's sales and customers growth are trending in the wrong direction
As mentioned above, Etsy's gross merchandise sales (GMS) haven't experienced any growth this year.
QUARTER GMS GROWTH YOY
Q1 3%
Q2 0%
Q3 (3%)
Source: Etsy. YOY-year-over-year.
If Etsy hadn't raised its seller fee from 5% to 6.5% in April, Etsy's revenue would have likely trended in the same direction. However, revenue has grown by about 10% throughout most of 2023.
ETSY Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts
Q4 and 2023's Q1 will be the last quarters without the overlap of quarters affected by the rate hike, so Etsy will need to show GMS growth soon or investors may begin dumping the stock in preparation for flat to negative revenue growth.
To do this, Etsy will need to engage its buyers, something it hasn't managed to do throughout 2022.
METRIC Q3 2021 COUNT Q3 2022 COUNT YOY GROWTH
Active Buyers 89.4 88.3 (1.2%)
Habitual Buyers 8.0 7.6 (5%)
Source: Etsy. Note: Active buyers have made a purchase within the last 12 months, and habitual buyers have spent at least $200 and purchased on six separate days in a 12-month period.
Etsy will need its core group of buyers to return if it is to have a successful 2023, and with discretionary funds drying up thanks to inflation, this may be wishful thinking. However, if Etsy's sellers can capitalize on the ads the company is placing on their behalf, it may turn it around.
Still, I'm not convinced that this holiday season will be what Etsy needs. Etsy also isn't doing itself any favors on the financial front either.
A significant loss for Etsy
Looking at Etsy's most recent quarterly report, you may notice a glaring $963 million loss compared to $594 million in revenue. That's because Etsy wrote down its Depop and Elo7 investment through an impairment charge. This means the premium Etsy paid for these two businesses last year isn't worth it this year, so Etsy took a one-time charge to reduce the value of the acquisitions on its books.
This doesn't bode well for the investments, but after subtracting it out, it reveals something positive about operating expenses.
In Q3, operating expenses rose 11.8% YOY. While this is slightly faster than Etsy's 9.1% Q3 revenue growth, it's a much more reasonable rate than those of many other companies that have overhired. This shows management has been responsible with its hiring, giving me confidence in that side of the business.
As for the stock, it's trading at the lower end of its usual range, although Etsy's price-to-sales valuation has been tumultuous in its life as a public company.
ETSY PS Ratio data by YCharts
A similar business, eBay, has traded for about four times sales over the past decade. So if you use that company as a comparison, Etsy has some way to fall before it reaches a comparable valuation.
That's a lot of check marks against Etsy; unfortunately, I don't think it will get any better. While I'm an Etsy shareholder, I don't think now is a great time to add to or establish an Etsy position. Q4 could be a huge turning point for Etsy, whether good or bad. It will also have long-term ramifications, as Etsy may have reached its peak audience. If the company can show meaningful GMS growth, then I will consider adding more to the stock. Until I see that, I'm being cautious.
I'm not sure where Etsy's stock will go from here, but there are just too many question marks to purchase Etsy stock right now.

2022-11-29 00:00:00+00:00,EBAY Crosses Above 2% Yield Territory,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-crosses-above-2-yield-territory,,,"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, in trading on Tuesday, shares of eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) were yielding above the 2% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $0.88), with the stock changing hands as low as $43.62 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) back on 12/31/1999 — you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 2% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.
In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of eBay Inc., looking at the history chart for EBAY below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annual yield.

(Symbol: EBAY), Qualcomm Inc (Symbol: QCOM), and SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (Symbol: SSNC) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. eBay Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.22 on 12/16/22, Qualcomm Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.75 on 12/15/22, and SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.20 on 12/15/22. As a percentage of EBAY's recent stock price of $45.31, this dividend works out to approximately 0.49%, so look for shares of eBay Inc. to trade 0.49% lower — all else being equal — when EBAY shares open for trading on 11/30/22. Similarly, investors should look for QCOM to open 0.61% lower in price and for SSNC to open 0.38% lower, all else being equal.
Below are dividend history charts for EBAY, QCOM, and SSNC, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.
eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY):

In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 1.94% for eBay Inc., 2.45% for Qualcomm Inc, and 1.54% for SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc.
In Monday trading, eBay Inc. shares are currently up about 0.6%, Qualcomm Inc shares are off about 0.8%, and SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc shares are off about 0.7% on the day.

2022-11-17 00:00:00+00:00,2 Value Stocks You Can Buy Right Now With Less Than $100,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-value-stocks-you-can-buy-right-now-with-less-than-%24100-0,,,"Since you came here looking for value stocks, I'll try not to waste your time with merely borderline value investing opportunities. To the contrary, I believe online marketplace eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) and furniture company Lovesac (NASDAQ: LOVE) are downright cheap right now, and the numbers back this up.
I also considered furniture store RH, automotive retailer Advance Auto Parts, and OLED technology company Universal Display Corporation for this article. However, while I do believe those offer good value as well, eBay and Lovesac both trade under $100 per share, whereas the others don't.
Here's why eBay and Lovesac are good value buys with those Benjamins.
1. eBay: $46.60 per share
eBay isn't a one-stop online shop for everything, and it likely never will be. But it's still a very relevant platform, excelling in a number of key categories. Management calls them ""focus"" categories. For perspective regarding its relevance, eBay has over $76 billion in trailing-12-month gross merchandise volume (GMV) -- the sales value of the products sold on the platform.
eBay's management intends to maintain its relevance by doubling down on what its buyers want. For example, eBay is quite the car-parts retailer, and lately it's been elevating its presence in this market by sponsoring related events and shows. It also acquired a company called myFitment to improve listings on the eBay platform, ensuring vehicle-parts information is uploaded correctly.
Another example of an eBay focus category is collectibles. This category includes trading cards. And trading card sales volume has more than doubled for eBay since 2019. The company is improving its offerings with the launch of eBay Vault -- a service for high-value collectibles that makes it easier to store, authenticate, and trade these items. It's also recently acquired trading-card marketplace TCGplayer.
I believe eBay will remain a solid player within its core categories for the foreseeable future. And by facilitating these transactions for third parties, the company enjoys high profit margins -- its gross margin is almost 73% year to date.
A quick note on value stocks -- a cheap valuation is often indicative of market pessimism. In eBay's case, its active buyers fell 11% year over year in the third quarter of 2022 to 135 million, and GMV also fell 11% to $17.7 billion. This leads some to believe eBay's business is dying. But as already pointed out, it remains strong in core categories, and I expect that to continue.
eBay has earned about $2.5 billion in income from operations over the past 12 months -- its market capitalization is only 10 times larger than this, which is inexpensive.
Management is repurchasing shares and quickly scaling up its dividend, as the chart below shows -- two priorities going forward that can drive market-beating shareholder returns. Therefore, it doesn't need to grow revenue to return more capital to shareholders, it just needs to hold its ground. And I believe that will be a likely outcome for eBay.

2. Lovesac: $27.69 per share
As already mentioned, value stocks typically bake in pessimism. That's the case with Lovesac stock, and for good reason. The company sells high-quality but high-priced beanbag chairs and sectional couches. And this business doesn't provide the company with recurring revenue.
To be fair, eBay's revenue isn't recurring either. But its users are far more likely to make multiple purchases in a year than Lovesac's customers. After all, you can only buy so many couches for your home.
To its credit, Lovesac's revenue growth is incredible. In fiscal 2022 (ended on Jan. 30), its revenue jumped 55% from fiscal 2021. And through the first two quarters of fiscal 2023, the company has generated $278 million in net sales, up 50% from the comparable period of fiscal 2022. The growth is impressive -- but therein lies the risk.
Investors question whether Lovesac's sensational growth is sustainable. Management appears to question it too. In its most recent conference call, management said that ""We are not providing formal guidance"" because it sees a wide ""range of potential outcomes."" It's hard to predict how sales for premium-priced furniture will fare during a slowing economy with high inflation.
Lovesac stock has already jumped 38% from its recent low, but it's still dirt cheap. The company has earned $44.4 million in trailing-12-month net income and has a market cap of $419 million. This means its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is less than 10.
For comparison, the P/E average for the S&P 500 is currently about 20 -- Lovesac's valuation is, therefore, roughly half that of the market's average.

The good news for Lovesac is that it estimates it's only achieved 2% market share, at most. Therefore, it could double sales and still have a small piece of the market, which makes the possibility look achievable.
Moreover, management has roughly doubled its available inventory over the past year in anticipation of future demand. But Lovesac's merchandise doesn't change much year to year. Therefore, even if sales slow in the near term, it can patiently hold merchandise and sell later at full price when demand rebounds.
For these reasons, I see Lovesac as a low-risk opportunity even if sales weaken in coming quarters.
Of these two stocks, eBay is the one I'd buy today. Investing -- even value investing -- is still about thinking long-term. I have nothing against Lovesac and would even consider buying it at some point. But I'm far less confident at this moment about Lovesac's staying power.
By contrast, since it's been around for over 20 years, I strongly believe eBay has done enough to stay alive at least throughout this decade, generating robust cash flow and rewarding shareholders along the way.
