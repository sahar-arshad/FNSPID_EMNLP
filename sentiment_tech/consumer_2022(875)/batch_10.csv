2022-07-28 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting DLTR Put And Call Options For September 9th,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-dltr-put-and-call-options-for-september-9th,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options begin trading today, for the September 9th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new September 9th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $160.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.15. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $160.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $151.85 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $161.97/share today.
Because the $160.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.09% return on the cash commitment, or 43.24% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $160.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $165.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $161.97/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $165.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.87% if the stock gets called away at the September 9th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $165.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $165.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.00% boost of extra return to the investor, or 42.45% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $161.97) to be 45%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

However, the top and the bottom lines increased on a year-over-year basis.

Q2 Earnings & Revenue Discussion
During second-quarter 2022, adjusted earnings of $9.30 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.03 by 1.2%. The bottom line improved 24.7% from $7.46 reported in the year-ago quarter.

Quarterly revenues of $2,213.3 million missed the consensus mark of $2,244 million. The top line increased 17% on a year-over-year basis. The upside can primarily be attributed to robust comparable restaurant sales and new restaurant openings. In the quarter under review, Chipotle opened 42 new restaurants, taking the total restaurant count to 3,052.

Digital sales contributed 39% to sales during the quarter. During the second quarter, comparable restaurant sales increased 10.1% year over year, following growth of 9% (in first-quarter 2022), 15.2% (in fourth-quarter 2021), 15.1% (third-quarter 2021), 31.2% (second-quarter 2021), 17.2% (first-quarter 2021) and 5.7% (fourth-quarter 2020).

Chicago, IL – July 27, 2022 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR, Dollar General Corp. DG, TreeHouse Foods, Inc. THS and General Mills, Inc. GIS.

4 Grocery Stocks to Buy Despite Inflationary Challenges
People are spending cautiously in the face of rising prices. They are cutting down on luxuries and spending on necessities like food and gasoline. However, food is one area where cost cannot be compromised much. This has seen a steady growth in sales of groceries, which is helping retailers during this challenging time.
The retail sector hasn't yet succumbed to inflationary pressures as demand continues to surge. The grocery segment is mainly behind this strength. Given this scenario, grocery stocks like Dollar Tree, Inc., Dollar General Corp., TreeHouse Foods, Inc. and General Mills, Inc. are likely to do well in the near term.  
Grocery Sales Increase in June
According to the latest report from the Commerce Department, U.S. grocery sales rose 0.6% in June. This came as retail sales grew 1% month over month in June. The retail sector has been going through a tough time as rising costs have made people spend cautiously.
An increasing number of people are cutting down on luxury purchases but that cannot be done with necessities. Groceries is one such area. At the same time, demand is high. The uptick in sales indicates that demand is holding up despite the Fed's aggressive rate-hike policy that is pushing up the prices of commodities.
Food and fuel prices were among the leading contributors to June's consumer price index. While people can't compromise on necessities, they are being compelled to pay higher prices.
Thus, higher demand, coupled with higher prices of goods is driving grocery sales. However, in the end, sales are getting a push, which is a positive sign.
Grocery Market Poised to Grow
A separate Mastercard SpendingPulse report shows that grocery sales jumped 14% year over year in June, recording a double-digit increase for the third straight month. The report is a lot similar to the one from the Commerce Department, which shows that grocery is one of the two categories that recorded higher sales in June despite inflation hitting a 41-year high.
Interestingly, grocery sales are growing both in-store and online, although e-commerce still leads the race. According to a report from Consumer Trends Tracker, 45% of consumers who shop grocery online are omnichannel buyers. On average, online grocery shoppers have a higher spend of $594 compared to $388 for in-store shoppers every month.
Higher inflation has been worrying consumers, but at the same time, they cannot cut down on necessities like groceries.
In order to retain their profit margins, food companies typically pass on increases in raw material costs to customers. Consumer basics and food businesses are non-cyclical industries, thus, even the necessity of purchasing staples cannot dissuade customers. The industry ought to perform well even in an inflationary setting.

Top 5 Low-Beta Stocks to Stay Safe from Near-Term Volatility
July is turning out to be the best month for Wall Street so far in 2022. U.S. stock markets have been suffering from severe volatility since the beginning of this year after witnessing an astonishing rally in the last-two coronavirus-ridden years.
Year to date, all the major stock indexes have suffered to a great extent. On a positive note, situations have changed in July. However, volatility may reappear in the last week of this month, which market participants have termed as the most vital week of this summer.

2022-07-26 00:00:00+00:00,"Walmart (WMT) Cuts EPS View Amid High Inflation, Stock Down",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/walmart-wmt-cuts-eps-view-amid-high-inflation-stock-down,,,"Shares of Walmart Inc. WMT tumbled almost 10% during yesterday’s after-hours trading as management slashed second-quarter and fiscal 2023 bottom-line view. This is due to WMT’s pricing actions to improve inventory levels at Walmart and Sam’s Club in the United States as well as mix of sales. WMT highlighted that rising levels of food and fuel inflation are affecting customers’ spending.
Inflation Hurts Profit Outlook
Management now expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to decline 8-9%. The metric was earlier anticipated in the range of flat to a slight increase. For fiscal 2023, adjusted EPS is now projected to decrease 11-13%. Excluding divestitures, fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS is expected to decline 10-12%. Earlier, management envisioned the bottom line to decline nearly 1% in fiscal 2023 and match the year-ago reported figure, excluding divestitures.

The operating income for the fiscal second quarter is now expected to decline 13-14%. The metric was earlier anticipated in the range of flat to a slight increase. For fiscal 2023, operating income is now projected to decrease 11-13%. Excluding divestitures, fiscal 2023 operating income is expected to decline 10-12%. Earlier, management expected the metric to decline around 1% at cc and be flat, excluding divestitures.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Management noted that food inflation is in double digits, above the levels at the end of the fiscal first quarter. Escalated food inflation is hurting consumers’ spending capacity on general merchandise categories, thus demanding increased markdowns to move through the inventory, especially for apparel. The company is expecting increased pressure on general merchandise in the back half of the year. That said, Walmart made headways to reduce inventory, manage prices and reduce storage costs during the quarter.
Raised Top-Line View
Given the escalated level of inflation and trends in the fiscal second quarter, management raised its fiscal 2023 top-line view. Net sales view reflects a currency headwind of nearly $1 billion in the fiscal second quarter and $1.8 billion in the back half of the year.

Consolidated net sales growth for fiscal 2023 is expected to be about 4.5%. Excluding divestitures, consolidated net sales growth is likely to be nearly 5.5% in fiscal 2023. Management had earlier expected consolidated net sales growth of about 4% at cc. Excluding divestitures, the metric was likely to grow 4.5-5%. WMT expects Walmart U.S. comp sales growth (excluding fuel) of approximately 3% in the back half of fiscal 2023.

For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Walmart now expects consolidated net sales growth of 7.5%, up from the previous view of more than 5% growth. Management now expects comp sales growth for Walmart U.S., excluding fuel, to be nearly 6% for the fiscal second quarter. Earlier, comp sales growth at Walmart U.S. (excluding fuel) was anticipated to increase 4-5%. The raised view implies a greater mix of food and consumables, albeit adversely impacting the gross margin rate.

Walmart currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). WMT’s stock has dipped 2.8% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 1.9% decline.

The latest rate hike from the Federal Reserve is due out tomorrow, with the market pricing in a 75 basis-point (a basis point is one-one hundredth of a percentage point) increase. However, ""the Fed has indicated nothing's off the table for this Wednesday's meeting and that will sway markets one way or another,"" says Jeff Klingelhofer, co-head of investments at Thornburg Investment Management. The central bank has to nail this, he adds. ""Too high of a hike will send markets spiraling and too low will keep inflation burning hot."" 
For investors, the uncertainty can be unnerving, but Klingelhofer says the best thing they can do in today's market is to get defensive via high-quality fixed-income plays and dividend-paying stocks. Another way for investors to prioritize defense is with low-volatility stocks, which can provide stability to portfolios amid the market's twists and turns.

2022-07-26 00:00:00+00:00,4 Grocery Stocks to Buy Despite Inflationary Challenges,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-grocery-stocks-to-buy-despite-inflationary-challenges,,,"People are spending cautiously in the face of rising prices. They are cutting down on luxuries and spending on necessities like food and gasoline. However, food is one area where cost cannot be compromised much. This has seen a steady growth in sales of groceries, which is helping retailers during this challenging time.
The retail sector hasn’t yet succumbed to inflationary pressures as demand continues to surge. The grocery segment is mainly behind this strength. Given this scenario, grocery stocks like Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR, Dollar General Corporation DG, TreeHouse Foods, Inc. THS and General Mills, Inc. GIS are likely to do well in the near term.  
Grocery Sales Increase in June
According to the latest report from the Commerce Department, U.S. grocery sales rose 0.6% in June. This came as retail sales grew 1% month over month in June. The retail sector has been going through a tough time as rising costs have made people spend cautiously.
An increasing number of people are cutting down on luxury purchases but that cannot the done with necessities. Groceries is one such area. At the same time, demand is high. The uptick in sales indicates that demand is holding up despite the Fed’s aggressive rate-hike policy that is pushing up the prices of commodities.
Food and fuel prices were among the leading contributors to June’s consumer price index. While people can’t compromise on necessities, they are being compelled to pay higher prices.
Thus, higher demand, coupled with higher prices of goods is driving grocery sales. However, in the end, sales are getting a push, which is a positive sign.
Grocery Market Poised to Grow
A separate Mastercard SpendingPulse report shows that grocery sales jumped 14% year over year in June, recording a double-digit increase for the third straight month. The report is a lot similar to the one from the Commerce Department, which shows that grocery is one of the two categories that recorded higher sales in June despite inflation hitting a 41-year high.
Interestingly, grocery sales are growing both in-store and online, although e-commerce still leads the race. According to a report from Consumer Trends Tracker, 45% of consumers who shop grocery online are omnichannel buyers. On average, online grocery shoppers have a higher spend of $594 compared to $388 for in-store shoppers every month.
Higher inflation has been worrying consumers, but at the same time, they cannot cut down on necessities like groceries.
In order to retain their profit margins, food companies typically pass on increases in raw material costs to customers. Consumer basics and food businesses are non-cyclical industries, thus, even the necessity of purchasing staples cannot dissuade customers. The industry ought to perform well even in an inflationary setting.

2022-07-25 00:00:00+00:00,U.S. retailers tumble after Walmart cuts profit forecast,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-retailers-tumble-after-walmart-cuts-profit-forecast,,,"July 25 (Reuters) - A profit warning by Walmart WMT.N ignited a sell-off in shares of major U.S. retailers late on Monday, quickly evaporating over $100 billion in stock market value in extended trade.
Sounding an alarm that inflation is hurting its shoppers and forcing them to change what they spend on, Walmart cut its forecast for full-year profit, saying it expects its adjusted earnings per share to drop as much as 13%.
Inflation is leading customers to spend more on food and less on higher-margin merchandise, Walmart said in a filing. That change in consumer spending has forced Walmart to cut prices on items like apparel in order to reduce its inventory.
Walmart's stock tumbled over 9% in extended trade, and other big retailers also sold off. Target TGT.N fell over 5% and Amazon AMZN.O was down about 4%. Meanwhile Costco Wholesale Corp COST.O, Best Buy BBY.N, Dollar General DG.N and Dollar Tree DLTR.O each declined more than 3%. Home Depot HD.N fell almost 2%.
Together, U.S. retailers were down more than $100 billion in stock market value, based on the after-hours declines in their share prices, with Amazon and Walmart accounting for the vast majority of that decline.
Monday's after-hours slide in retailers' shares adds to a 24% drop in the S&P 500 retailing index .SPXRT so far in 2022.

Retail stocks are a type of investment that can provide investors with exposure to the retail sector within the stock market. Retail stocks can be purchased through a variety of different channels, including online stockbrokers, retail mutual funds, and retail ETFs. While retail stocks can provide investors with the potential for growth, they also come with risks, such as the risk of retail bankruptcy. As such, retail stocks are not suitable for all investors. Before investing in retail stocks, it is important to research the sector and individual companies in order to understand the risks involved.
Retail stocks would be in an interesting position in the stock market today. Overall, as investors await the latest Federal Reserve rate hike decision on Wednesday, retail stocks could be in focus. Though some would debate that the gains in stocks now are because of market volatility, investors may not want to count retail stocks out just yet. Why? Well, first off, the industry continues to cater to consumers all around. All in all, there seems to be no shortage of excitement in the retail sector right now. With that, check out these three top retail stocks in the stock market today.
Retail Stocks To Watch Right Now
Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT)
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR)
Target (NYSE: TGT)
Walmart (NYSE: WMT)
To kick this list off, we have retail giant Walmart (WMT). The company aims to help people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – in retail stores, online, and through their mobile devices. In fact, weekly, approximately 230 million customers and members visit more than 10,500 stores. Despite being one of the largest brick-and-mortar retailers in the world, the company is also one of the fastest-growing and most dynamic e-commerce companies. Notably, its main website, Walmart.com gets up to 100 million unique visitors each month.
WMT stock is in the headlines after hours on Monday as shares slid over 9%. This comes after the company released an update late Monday afternoon, revising its outlook for profit for the second-quarter and full-year. The company cut guidance among lagging inflation and inventory concerns. The Arkansas-based retail behemoth now estimates operating income for the second quarter and full year to fall 13 to 14% and 11 to 13%, respectively. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share are now anticipated to drop to 8 to 9% and 11 to 13%, over the same time period. All while, Walmart had its estimated EPS to be “flat to up slightly” for Q2 and to fall just 1% when it reported back in May.
“The increasing levels of food and fuel inflation are affecting how customers spend, and while we’ve made good progress clearing hardline categories, apparel in Walmart U.S. is requiring more markdown dollars. We’re now anticipating more pressure on general merchandise in the back half; however, we’re encouraged by the start we’re seeing on school supplies in Walmart U.S.” said Doug McMillon, Walmart Inc. president and chief executive officer. All in all, is now a good opportunity to buy shares of WMT stock at a discount?

(NASDAQ:DLTR) insider lowered their holding by 10.0% earlier this year",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-dollar-tree-inc.-nasdaq%3Adltr-insider-lowered-their-holding-by-10.0-earlier-this-year,,,"From what we can see, insiders were net sellers in Dollar Tree, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:DLTR ) during the past 12 months. That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.
While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.
The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Dollar Tree
In the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, David Jacobs, sold US$305k worth of shares at a price of US$163 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$172, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 10.0% of David Jacobs's holding. The only individual insider seller over the last year was David Jacobs.
Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 525.00 shares worth US$80k. But insiders sold 1.89k shares worth US$305k. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!

If you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).
Does Dollar Tree Boast High Insider Ownership?
Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Dollar Tree insiders own about US$493m worth of shares (which is 1.3% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.
So What Does This Data Suggest About Dollar Tree Insiders?
It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Dollar Tree shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Dollar Tree insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. Of course, the future is what matters most. So if you are interested in Dollar Tree, you should check out this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.

Dollar Tree's Business In-Depth
With that in mind, let's take a look at Dollar Tree's main business drivers.
Founded in 1986 and headquartered in Chesapeake, VA, Dollar Tree Inc. is an operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise and other assortments. Its stores successfully operate in major metropolitan areas, mid-sized cities and small towns. The company offers a wide range of quality everyday general merchandise in many categories, including housewares, seasonal goods, candy and food, toys, health and beauty care, gifts, party goods, stationery, books, personal accessories, and other consumer items. Its stores are supported by a nationwide logistics network and distribution centers.

Dollar Tree also owns an e-commerce platform – DollarTree.com – which sells its merchandise in bulk to individuals and small businesses as well as organizations. Through its online platform, the company advertises its in-store events and showcases its special and seasonal promotions for featured products. Further, it acquired Family Dollar Stores, Inc. on July 6, 2015.

The company operates in two reporting business segments: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.

Dollar Tree: Being the major operator of discount variety stores, this segment offers merchandise at the fixed price point of $1.00. The segment has nearly 7,652 stores operating under the Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree Canada banners, 12 distribution centers in the United States and two in Canada. Dollar Tree stores primarily range from 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet.

Family Dollar: This segment operates general merchandise discount retail stores with competitively-priced merchandise in the neighborhood stores. It has nearly 7,827 stores, which sell merchandise at prices ranging from $1.00 to $10.00. These stores primarily range from 6,000 - 8,000 selling square feet. The segment includes store operations under the Family Dollar brand and 11 distribution centers.   
As of Jan 29, 2022, the company operated 16,077 stores in 48 states and five Canada provinces.
Bottom Line
Anyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Dollar Tree ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.
A $1000 investment made in July 2012 would be worth $3,347.80, or a gain of 234.78%, as of July 25, 2022, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.
The S&P 500 rose 190.73% and the price of gold increased 3.21% over the same time frame in comparison.
Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for DLTR.
Shares of Dollar Tree have outpaced the industry in the past year on robust earnings surprise trend, which continued in first-quarter fiscal 2022. The company reported 10th startight quarter of earnings beat in the quarter. The also top line beat estimates and improved year over year. Results benefited from the completion of the $1.25 multi-price point initiative at the Dollar Tree stores, as well as robust margins, despite the increase in freight costs and SG&A expenses. Following the robust first-quarter fiscal 2022 performance, Dollar Tree raised its guidance for fiscal 2022 and provided a decent second quarter view. However, the company witnessed soft sales and comps, along with margin declines, for the Family Dollar banner in the fiscal first quarter. Higher freight and supply-chain disruptions are likely to persist in fiscal 2022.
The stock is up 9.41% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 9 higher, for fiscal 2022. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.

2022-07-25 00:00:00+00:00,"ANALYSIS-Colgate, Tide maker P&G rejig price tactics to keep cash-strapped shoppers",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-colgate-tide-maker-pg-rejig-price-tactics-to-keep-cash-strapped-shoppers,,,"By Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - The makers of everyday staples such as Colgate toothpaste and Charmin toilet paper are readying new strategies to keep cash-strapped consumers buying pricier products as the threat of recession looms, executives have told investors.
Manufacturers of household staples are also now spending more on discounts and promotions on goods including sodas and paper towels to keep shoppers in higher-end stores and buying brand name products, according to data prepared for Reuters from research firm IRI.
The moves come as U.S. consumers - who so far have continued to buy higher-priced goods, from diapers to shampoo - show signs of buckling under new rounds of price increases.
Some hikes are hitting shelves this month, including from cleaning company Clorox Co CLX.N and Church & Dwight Co Inc CHD.N, the maker of Arm & Hammer products.
Church & Dwight increased prices for the second time on laundry detergents and cat litters July 1, while Clorox said its ""broadest and deepest"" hikes went into effect this month.
The growing risk of consumer cutbacks is forcing manufacturers to reconsider their pricing playbooks by targeting shoppers during certain periods and offering more discounts.
Oral care company Colgate-Palmolive Co CL.N will work with retailers to see if shoppers spend more when paychecks clear, generally in the first and third weeks of the month, head of investor relations John Faucher said.
That suggests consumers face more financial stress and living paycheck to paycheck.
""You want to make sure that your merchandising strategy is aligned (with) those weeks when consumers are a little more strapped,"" Faucher told a retail conference last month.
Colgate would prioritize premium products, such as its $10 Optic White Pro Series toothpaste, in the beginning of the month when paychecks clear, and then focus on budget items later in the month as shoppers' cash runs low, he said.
Colgate may also increase prices on a few but not all of its cheapest products so that some remain within reach for consumers who are ""struggling a little bit more,"" which prevents those buyers from seeking budget options elsewhere, Faucher said.
Consumer products companies are strategizing as foot traffic at U.S. dollar stores, which sell off-brand home and grocery items, outpaces competitors. Dollar Tree Inc's DLTR.O Family Dollar saw foot traffic climb 16% in the second quarter, according to Placer.ai, which provides data on consumer movements.
""Manufacturers are beginning to promote more at the request of retailers,"" said Krishnakumar Davey, president of client engagement at market research firm IRI.
""They don't want to lose business to value channels,"" such as dollar stores or other discounters, he said.
According to IRI data, 47% of breakfast meats like bacon were bought using a coupon or other discount in the four weeks ended July 10, the highest in six months. Half of crackers were bought with promotions, according to IRI data.
In the four weeks ended July 10, 39% of toilet paper and paper towels were bought with discounts, the highest since the beginning of the year. Toilet paper and paper towels face steep competition from store brands.
PREMIUM FOCUS
Household goods and food producers are also looking at pricing tactics used during the 2008-2009 financial crisis.
Some beer brewers then increased prices more on economy brands than they did mainstream offerings, according to a research note from Evercore ISI, to prevent consumers from trading out a more costly Budweiser for Natural Ice.
Makers of household staples, including in packaged food and candy, have also reduced portion sizes, keeping prices the same or higher. L5N2XG2B4
""It's more likely that we and others will resort to pack size changes,"" said Church & Dwight chief executive Matthew Farrell at Deutsche Bank dbAccess Global Consumer Conference last month.
The Xtra detergent maker has already slimmed down its laundry detergent by 10% by removing water, said Michael Read, an executive vice president with the company, at the conference. The dosing for wash loads is the same, he said.
National brands are for now trying to convince shoppers they are getting more bang for their buck with premium products like Dawn dish soap and Clorox wipes - rather than cheaper store brand alternatives.
Procter & Gamble Co PG.N executives said last month in a conference they anticipate more price hikes as the Tide manufacturer doubles down on its ""superiority"" strategy - offering detergents, diapers and razors that promise to work better in higher-quality packaging.
The maker of Bounty paper towels has also built out a price tier for customers who care about ""cash outlay"" alone over the last five to six years, its chief executive Jon Moeller said in the conference. Only about 15% of P&G's customers are lower income, finance chief Andre Schulten said.

It also opened a new restaurant in Framingham, Massachusetts. The company reported solid opening performances. The company plans to open five new restaurants in the second half of the year.

The company made solid progress with respect to its two pilot remodels concerning dining room capacity expansion and new design elements. With positive customer feedback and increased sales levels generated from the remodeled locations, the company remains optimistic and expects to proceed with this initiative in the upcoming periods.
Balance Sheet
As of Jun 28, 2022, cash and cash equivalents totaled $37.8 million compared with $27.2 million on Mar 29, 2022. Total debt as of Jun 28, 2022, amounted to $50 million, in line with the previous quarter’s estimates.

2022-07-21 00:00:00+00:00,"Domino's (DPZ) Q2 Earnings & Revenues Lag Estimates, Stock Down",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dominos-dpz-q2-earnings-revenues-lag-estimates-stock-down,,,"Domino's Pizza, Inc. DPZ reported second-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with earnings and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line missed the consensus mark for the third consecutive quarter, while the top line lagged for the fourth straight quarter. Following the results, shares of DPZ dropped 2.9% in the pre-market trading session.

Russell Weiner, Domino's Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""Our results for the quarter faced challenges consistent to those I outlined back in April. We continued to navigate a difficult labor market, especially for delivery drivers, in addition to inflationary pressures combined with COVID and stimulus-fueled sales comps from the prior two years in the U.S.""
Earnings & Revenue Discussion
Domino's reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.82, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.88. Also, the figure declined 9.6% from $3.12 reported in the prior-year quarter. DPZ’s earnings were hurt by a lower net income (on a year-over-year basis), partially offset by a lower weighted average share count owing to share repurchase.
Domino's Pizza Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
  Domino's Pizza Inc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Domino's Pizza Inc Quote
 Revenues of $1,065.2 million lagged the consensus mark of $1,066 million. However, the top line improved 3.2% on a year-over-year basis. The upside was mainly driven by higher supply-chain revenues owing to a rise in market basket pricing. However, this was partially offset by lower supply chain volumes.

In second-quarter fiscal 2022, Domino's opened 233 stores, comprising 22 net new U.S. stores and 211 net new international stores.
Comps
Global retail sales (including total franchise and company-owned units) declined 3% on a year-over-year basis in the fiscal second quarter. The downside can primarily be attributed to lower international store sales (down 5.4% year over year). Sales at domestic stores declined 0.6% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding the foreign currency impact, global retail sales increased 1.5% from the prior-year quarter’s level.

For the fiscal second quarter, comps at Domino’s domestic stores (including company-owned and franchise stores) declined 2.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reading.

At domestic company-owned stores, Domino’s comps declined 9.2% year over year compared with a decline of 2.6% reported in the year-ago period. Domestic franchise store comps declined 2.5% year over year against an improvement of 3.9% reported in the prior-year quarter.

Comps at international stores, excluding foreign currency translation, were down 2.2% year over year. This was lower than the 13.9% improvement reported in the year-ago quarter.
Margins
During the fiscal second quarter, Domino’s’ gross margin contracted 320 basis points (bps) year over year to 36.3%. Net income margin for the quarter came in at 9.6%, down 170 bps from the prior-year level.
Balance Sheet
As of Jun 19, 2022, cash and cash equivalents totaled $114.4 million compared with $165 million as of Mar 27, 2022. At the end of second-quarter fiscal 2022, Domino’s had $155.8 million of available borrowing capacity under its 2021 variable funding notes, net of letters of credit issued of $44.2 million.

Long-term debt (less current portion) at the end of the fiscal second quarter came in at $4,989.6 million compared with $5,002.1 million reported in the previous quarter. Inventory amounted to $70.2 million compared with $77.7 million at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2022.
Capital expenditures during the quarter came in at $32.7 million compared with $12.5 million reported in the previous quarter.

For the fiscal second quarter, DPZ bought back and retired 148,248 shares of its common stock under the share repurchase program. Domino’s stated the availability of $606.4 million under its buyback program. Also, DPZ declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.10 per share, payable Sep 30, 2022, to its shareholders of record as of Sep 15, 2022.

2022-07-21 00:00:00+00:00,DLTR September 2nd Options Begin Trading,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dltr-september-2nd-options-begin-trading,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options become available today, for the September 2nd expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new September 2nd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $165.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.65. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $165.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $157.35 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $168.96/share today.
Because the $165.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.64% return on the cash commitment, or 39.36% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $165.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $170.00 strike price has a current bid of $9.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $168.96/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $170.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.00% if the stock gets called away at the September 2nd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $170.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $170.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.39% boost of extra return to the investor, or 45.72% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $168.96) to be 45%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Chicago, IL – July 21, 2022 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR.
This Leading Retailer Signals the Consumer Is Still Strong
There aren't many stocks that are widely outperforming the market this year. While we are seeing some strength back into growth and technology names in the short-term, the outlook for the remainder of the year (in terms of tech sales and earnings growth) is murky. One area in which we're still seeing earnings estimates on the rise is discount retail.
Discount retailers primarily sell low-margin consumables such as food, household staples, and seasonal goods. It becomes more challenging for most companies to hold costs low when their own costs are skyrocketing. That's why it's very important – particularly in this type of highly inflationary market environment – to identify businesses that are able to pass on these increased costs to consumers without any negative effects.
One of the more defensive businesses, discount retailers are consumer staples that are fairly resilient. The leaders in this space exhibit high pricing power. They can pass on rising costs without losing much volume at all. These defensive companies tend to fare better during inflationary periods and market downturns.
Let's take a deeper look at a leading discount retailer that is outpacing the market this year.
Dollar Tree, Inc.
Dollar Tree operates discount variety retail stores. The company is the largest single-price-point retailer in North America. DLTR provides consumable products such as food and personal care items, household paper and chemicals, health and beauty items, as well as clothing and other fashion accessories. The company acquired Family Dollar back in 2015 to expand its retail reach; it now operates over 16,000 stores in 48 states and five Canadian provinces.
During the first quarter, sales increased 6.5% to $6.9 billion. The company has seen revenues grow steadily over the past several years as shown below. Estimates for the second quarter call for growth of 6.8% year-over-year to $6.77 billion. On an annual basis, the growth outlook remains stable with a 6.69% expected bump in sales to $28.08 billion.
A Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, DLTR has been on a hot streak in terms of earnings surprises, exceeding estimates in each of the past ten quarters. The retailer chain most recently posted Q1 EPS back in May of $2.37/share, a 19.7% surprise over the $1.98 consensus. DLTR has posted a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 13.12%, helping shares advance 74.6% in the past year. The stock is up roughly 23% this year while most stocks have been in bear market territory.
Analysts covering DLTR have upped their full-year EPS estimates by +3.82% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $8.15/share, translating to potential growth of 40.52% relative to last year.
Make sure to keep an eye on this leading discount retailer that is bucking the overall downtrend of the market.

2022-07-20 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Dollar Tree (DLTR) is a Great Momentum Stock to Buy,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-dollar-tree-dltr-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy,,,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.
Below, we take a look at Dollar Tree (DLTR), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.
It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Dollar Tree currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.
You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>
Set to Beat the Market?
Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for DLTR that show why this discount retailer shows promise as a solid momentum pick.
Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.
For DLTR, shares are up 0.36% over the past week while the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry is down 0.45% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 8.84% compares favorably with the industry's 6.46% performance as well.
While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Dollar Tree have increased 1.17% over the past quarter, and have gained 71.91% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved -11.49% and -6.21%, respectively.
Investors should also take note of DLTR's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, DLTR is averaging 1,836,812 shares for the last 20 days.
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with DLTR.
Over the past two months, 9 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost DLTR's consensus estimate, increasing from $7.85 to $8.15 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 10 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that DLTR is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Dollar Tree on your short list.

Chicago, IL – July 20, 2022 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR, Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA, Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. BOOT and The Kroger Co. KR.
Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:
4 Must-Buy Stocks as Retail Sales Rise Amid Higher Inflation
Consumer spending activity, which is one of the pivotal factors driving the economy, held up last month, as Americans spent more on goods amid heightened inflation. This was clearly evident from retail sales data for the month of June that bounced back after a decline in May. The Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in June rose 1% sequentially to $680.6 billion, following an upwardly revised reading of 0.1% decline registered in May.
A robust job market and decent household finances, thanks to the stimulus checks received in the peak pandemic period, have allowed consumers to shield themselves from inflationary pressure to an extent. But the question industry experts are asking is how long will this last as soaring commodity and gasoline prices as well as rising interest rates have already started pinching consumers' pockets. These also raise concerns about the health of the U.S. economy.
We note that the consumer price index rose 1.3% month on month in June, following an increase of 1% in May. On a year-over-year basis, the metric rose 9.1% — the fastest pace since November 1981. This jump was led by higher gasoline and food grain prices, primarily due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This is enough for the Federal Reserve to take a more aggressive stance.
Category-Wise Sales
The Commerce Department's report suggests that sales at motor vehicle & parts dealers and furniture & home furnishings stores increased 0.8% and 1.4%, respectively, on a sequential basis. Sales at electronics & appliance stores rose 0.4%, while the same at miscellaneous store retailers increased 1.4%. Again, sales at non-store retailers were up 2.2%.
Sales at food & beverage stores increased 0.4%, while at food services & drinking places it grew 1%. At sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument, & book stores, sales advanced 0.8%. Meanwhile, receipts at gasoline stations were up 3.6%, driven by high gasoline prices.
The report also indicates that sales at building material & supplies dealers declined 0.9%, while the same at clothing & clothing accessories outlets fell 0.4%. Sales at health & personal care stores declined 0.1%, while the same at general merchandise stores fell 0.2%.
4 Prominent Picks
Investors can count on Dollar Tree, Inc. This Chesapeake, VA-based company's strategic initiatives, including the expansion of $3 and $5 Plus assortment in Dollar Tree stores, as well as Combo Stores and H2 Renovations at Family Dollar, provide tremendous opportunities to drive sales and traffic.
Impressively, Dollar Tree has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13.1%, on average. This operator of discount variety stores has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 15.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dollar Tree's current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 6.7% and 40.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Another stock worth considering is Ulta Beauty, Inc. The company has been strengthening its omni-channel business and exploring the potential of both physical and digital facets. It has been implementing various tools to enhance guests' experience, like offering a virtual try-on tool and in-store education, and reimagining fixtures, among others. Ulta Beauty focuses on offering customers a curated and exclusive range of beauty products through innovation.
Impressively, this beauty retailer and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics, fragrance, skincare products, hair care products and salon services has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 49.8%, on average. We note that this Zacks Rank #1 company has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 10.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ulta Beauty's current financial year sales suggests growth of 10.3% from the year-ago period.
You may invest in Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. This lifestyle retailer of western and work-related footwear, apparel and accessories has been successfully navigating through the challenging environment, courtesy of merchandising strategies, omni-channel capabilities and better expense management as well as marketing. This, combined with the expansion of the store base, has helped Boot Barn Holdings gain market share and strengthen its position in the industry.
This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 20%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boot Barn Holdings' current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 17% and 4.4%, respectively, from the year-ago period.
The Kroger Co. is another potential pick. The company, which operates in the thin-margin grocery industry, has been undergoing a complete makeover not only with respect to products but also in terms of the way consumers prefer grocery shopping.
The company has been adding new products as well as eyeing technological expansion to enhance its omnichannel reach. Kroger has been making significant investments to enhance product freshness and quality, and expand digital capabilities. Impressively, the company has been introducing new items under its ""Our Brands"" portfolio.
Kroger has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 20.3%, on average. The company has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 11.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kroger's current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 6.7% and 6.3%, respectively, from the year-ago period. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2.

2022-07-19 00:00:00+00:00,Costco (COST) Stock Presents Enough Reasons to Stay Invested,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/costco-cost-stock-presents-enough-reasons-to-stay-invested,,,"There is not much clue, as of now, as to how the stock market is going to behave in the second half of 2022. Risk appetite has almost dried up as investors are walking a tight rope. The Russia-Ukraine conflict, supply chain bottlenecks and soaring inflation are all to blame. Amid such a scenario, you need to stay invested in stocks that may fetch higher returns. We present you with one such stock, Costco Wholesale Corporation COST that looks well-poised, given its sound fundamentals and growth efforts.
Marching Ahead of Industry
Costco, an “all-weather” stock, has withstood multiple market gyrations and delivered returns to investors. A resilient business model enables it to gain market share and generate profits. This operator of membership warehouses has exhibited a decent run on the bourses and has outpaced the industry in the past year. In the said period, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have appreciated about 24.1% against the industry’s decline of 3%.

With a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.2% and a VGM Score of A, Costco has ample scope to attain new highs. Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Costco’s current financial-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 14.8% and 17.9%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.
Striking Right Chord With Consumers
Costco continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers based on the expanse and quality of merchandise offered. A customer-centric approach, strategic pricing, merchandise initiatives and emphasis on memberships have helped Costco to post consistent sales growth.

Net sales increased 20.4% to $22.78 billion for the retail month of June from $18.92 billion last year. This followed an increase of 16.9% in May and 13.9% in April. Comparable sales for the month of June jumped 18.1%, following increases of 15.5% and 12.6% in May and April, respectively.

Clearly, Costco has emerged as a viable option for bargain hunters looking for essentials and other discretionary purchases amid soaring inflation. We believe a growing customer base and high renewal rates should fuel sales.

Steadily Adopting the Omni-Channel Mantra
Costco is gradually adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience. To drive its online sales, the company launched grocery delivery services in collaboration with Uber Technologies in July 2021. This allows members to get their on-demand groceries delivered within hours through Uber and Uber Eats mobile apps.

Also, Costco’s acquisition of Innovel Solutions, a leading provider of third-party end-to-end logistics solutions — now called Costco Logistics, has boosted its e-commerce capabilities and enabled it to sell ""big and bulky"" items.

The company has been gradually expanding its e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. We note that comparable e-commerce sales rose 7% in June. This followed increases of 6.3% and 5.7% in May and April, respectively.
Enhancing Footprint
Costco’s expansion strategy looks pretty impressive. The company remains committed to opening new clubs in the domestic and international markets. In our view, the company’s diversification strategy is a natural hedge against risks that may arise in specific markets. After opening 13 and 20 net new warehouses in fiscal 2020 and 2021, respectively, the company plans to open 24 net new units in fiscal 2022.

We foresee improvement in membership fees as new warehouse openings ramp up. Membership fees had increased 9.2% to $984 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
Enough Liquidity
Costco’s sturdy balance sheet equips it to deal with cyclical downturns and tap growth opportunities. Solid cash flow generation allows it to raise dividends consistently. The company’s cash & cash equivalents (including short-term investments of $638 million) were $11,831 million at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2022.

Costco has always been a favorite pick for investors who are seeking both steady income and growth. This Issaquah, WA-based company, with a strong history of dividend payments as well as sound fundamentals, provides a hedge against any odd swings in the stock market.

2022-07-19 00:00:00+00:00,4 Must-Buy Stocks as Retail Sales Rise in June Amid Inflation,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-must-buy-stocks-as-retail-sales-rise-in-june-amid-inflation,,,"Consumer spending activity, which is one of the pivotal factors driving the economy, held up last month, as Americans spent more on goods amid heightened inflation. This was clearly evident from retail sales data for the month of June that bounced back after a decline in May. The Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in June rose 1% sequentially to $680.6 billion, following an upwardly revised reading of 0.1% decline registered in May.

A robust job market and decent household finances, thanks to the stimulus checks received in the peak pandemic period, have allowed consumers to shield themselves from inflationary pressure to an extent. But the question industry experts are asking is how long will this last as soaring commodity and gasoline prices as well as rising interest rates have already started pinching consumers’ pockets. These also raise concerns about the health of the U.S. economy.

We note that the consumer price index rose 1.3% month on month in June, following an increase of 1% in May. On a year-over-year basis, the metric rose 9.1% — the fastest pace since November 1981. This jump was led by higher gasoline and food grain prices, primarily due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This is enough for the Federal Reserve to take a more aggressive stance.
Category-Wise Sales
The Commerce Department’s report suggests that sales at motor vehicle & parts dealers and furniture & home furnishings stores increased 0.8% and 1.4%, respectively, on a sequential basis. Sales at electronics & appliance stores rose 0.4%, while the same at miscellaneous store retailers increased 1.4%. Again, sales at non-store retailers were up 2.2%.

Sales at food & beverage stores increased 0.4%, while at food services & drinking places it grew 1%. At sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument, & book stores, sales advanced 0.8%. Meanwhile, receipts at gasoline stations were up 3.6%, driven by high gasoline prices.

The report also indicates that sales at building material & supplies dealers declined 0.9%, while the same at clothing & clothing accessories outlets fell 0.4%. Sales at health & personal care stores declined 0.1%, while the same at general merchandise stores fell 0.2%.
