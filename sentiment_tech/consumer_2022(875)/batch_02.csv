2022-11-22 00:00:00+00:00,"Dollar Tree (DLTR) Q3 Earnings & Sales Beat, High Costs Hurt",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-dltr-q3-earnings-sales-beat-high-costs-hurt,,,"Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR has reported third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein sales and earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate. The top and bottom lines also improved year over year. The results have benefited from the continued demand for the company’s products, offset by inflationary pressures and an unfavorable product mix due to the demand shift toward low-margin consumable goods.

The company remains optimistic about its fiscal 2022 top-line performance. Hence, it has raised the fiscal 2022 sales view. Despite the strong sales trends across both banners, the company expects the increased demand for consumables and inflationary costs to affect margins and the bottom line in the near term. Consequently, it has provided a bleak earnings view for fiscal 2022.

Shares of DLTR declined 1.9% in the pre-market trading session on Nov 22 despite top and bottom-line growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The company likely witnessed soft performance due to ongoing cost pressures and a soft earnings view for fiscal 2022. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 17.6% year to date against the industry's decline of 7.8%.

 Quarter in Detail
Dollar Tree’s earnings improved 25% year over year to $1.20 per share and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17 and our estimate of $1.14. Bottom-line growth can be attributed to robust top-line growth, as well as improved margins.

Consolidated net sales advanced 8.1% year over year to $6,939.9 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,839 million ad our estimate of $6,833.7 million. Enterprise same-store sales (comps) improved 6.5% year over year. For the Dollar Tree banner, comps were up 8.6%, while the same for the Family Dollar banner improved 4.1%. After adjusting for the impacts of currency fluctuations, comps for the Dollar Tree banner rose 8.5%.

Comps at Dollar Tree benefited from a double-digit increase in average ticket, partly negated by a decline in traffic. Comps at Family Dollar were aided by increases in both ticket and traffic.

The gross profit increased 17.5% year over year to $2,071.5 million, while the gross margin expanded 240 bps to 29.9%. Gains from improved initial mark-on, and leverage on distribution and occupancy costs aided the gross margin. This was partly negated by higher markdowns and shrink, inflationary cost pressures, and unfavorable product mix related to a shift toward lower-margin consumable products. The gross margin expanded 520 bps to 35.4% at the Dollar Tree banner and contracted 100 bps to 23.4% at the Family Dollar segment.
Dollar Tree, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
  Dollar Tree, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Dollar Tree, Inc. Quote
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 170 bps to 24.4%. The increase resulted from elevated professional fees, increased store payroll and stock compensation expenses, and inflationary pressures across many expense categories like utilities and higher repairs and maintenance costs.

While the operating income rose 22.8% to $381.3 million, the operating margin expanded 70 bps to 5.5%, driven by robust gross margin expansion and sales growth. Segment-wise, the operating margin expanded 480 bps to 13.3% for Dollar Tree. Meanwhile, the Family Dollar segment reported an operating loss of $18.4 million compared with an operating income of $88.6 million in the year-ago quarter.
Balance Sheet
Dollar Tree ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $439 million. Net merchandise inventories increased 31.1% year over year to $5,657.7 million. It had net long-term debt (excluding current maturities) of $3,420.4 million and shareholders’ equity of $8,275.3 million as of Oct 29, 2022.

The company bought back 2,859,200 shares for $397.5 million in third-quarter fiscal 2022, reflecting an average price of $139.04 per share. As of Oct 29, 2022, Dollar Tree had $1.85 billion remaining under its existing authorization.

The company anticipates spending $1.2 billion toward capital expenditure in fiscal 2022.
Store Update
In third-quarter fiscal 2022, Dollar Tree opened 102 stores, expanded or relocated 20 outlets, and shuttered 41 stores. The company completed the renovation of 309 Family Dollar stores to the H2 or Combo Store formats. Additionally, it expanded the multi-price plus offerings to another 199 Dollar Tree stores in the quarter. As of Oct 29, 2022, the company operated 16,293 stores in 48 states and five Canada provinces.
Guidance
Dollar Tree has raised its sales view for fiscal 2022 as its efforts to evolve the assortment to drive consumables’ performance at Dollar Tree and the initiatives to improve the value proposition at Family Dollar remain on track.

The company expects consolidated net sales of $28.14-$28.28 billion compared with the $27.85-$28.10 billion mentioned earlier. It anticipates enterprise comps growth in the mid-single digits for fiscal 2022, including a high-single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and low-single-digit growth in the Family Dollar segment. It expects selling square footage to increase 2.8% compared with 3.5% growth mentioned earlier.

The company expects depreciation to be $770 million for fiscal 2022. Interest expenses are anticipated to be $127 million, while the effective tax rate is likely to be 23.7%.

Management envisions earnings in the lower half of the previously mentioned $7.10-$7.40 per share. The company has noted that sales trends are strong across both banners. However, the increased demand for consumables is likely to affect margins in the near term. This, along with the ongoing inflationary cost pressures, has resulted in a soft earnings view for fiscal 2022.

For fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Dollar Tree expects consolidated net sales of $7.54-$7.68 billion, with enterprise same-store sales growth of mid to the high-single digits. This will comprise a mid-to-high single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and low-to-mid single-digit growth in the Family Dollar segment.

The company expects net interest expenses of $30 million for the fiscal fourth quarter, with an effective tax rate of 24.3%.

Rick Dreiling -- Executive Chairman
Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. In my short time here, I have been incredibly impressed with the team's overall enthusiasm and willingness to accept and embrace much-needed change. As I stated last quarter, we are making change happen to create long-term shareholder value and enable the next waves of profitable growth for Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. The company is moving at a rapid pace.
We have done a remarkable job of rebuilding our executive team and with retail thought leaders that are subject matter experts and eager to be part of this transformational journey that we have embarked on. In a short period of time, all of our C-suite positions have been filled, as well as new leadership roles dedicated to a number of key areas, including diversity, sustainability, compliance, and communication. Last quarter, we shared news of the material price investments made at Family Dollar. These actions got on price parity with key competitors and widen our spread to grocery and drugstores.
Customers are recognizing this commitment to value, which contributed to a 4% comp sales increase and the segment's first quarterly traffic increase in three years. The teams are focused on improving store standards. They are committed to clean them up, straighten them up, and fill them up. Improving sales productivity is a vital component of the Family Dollar turnaround, and we are extremely focused on driving sales per square foot, unit sales growth, and transaction count growth.
We are a company with more than 16,200 stores. But the way I prefer to look at this is that we are really two growth companies with 8,100-plus stores each. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are unique businesses with two different go-to-market strategies. Having two distinct large segments provides us flexibility like none other in value retail.
And both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar have extraordinary opportunity for growth and improvement over time. We are prioritizing our areas of growth, and we are moving with urgency. The new management team is in-house. We've taken aggressive action on price.
The advertising and marketing cadence has been enhanced. We are in the midst of a cultural transformation throughout the organization designed to enhance our associate and customer experience. Store standards are improving. Years of sales productivity opportunities are ahead of us, and work on supply chain and technology initiatives will enhance us to achieve our ultimate goals.
I know many are eager to learn more about all of our plans, including the timing, the magnitude, and the expected returns. These details will be shared at our Spring Investor Day in a more structured format as our new leadership team has assembled more time to gather. We are entirely committed on taking the right steps to transform this organization for the long term. On behalf of our directors, I want to thank each of our associates for their commitment, dedication, and effort, especially for their willingness to embrace much-needed change.
This is a journey that I am thrilled to be part of. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As you have seen in recent months, we have announced a number of executives have joined Dollar Tree. I am excited about the caliber and quality of the leadership team we now have in place.
This team will lead our company through the next evolution of growth. We are committed to transforming our culture, meeting our shoppers' and associates' needs, improving store productivity and efficiencies, and delivering improved long-term operating results. I am pleased with the team's efforts to deliver solid results for the quarter. Our third quarter sales performance reflects the timely execution of merchandising initiatives to drive our consumables business in this uncertain and inflationary environment.
Same-store sales for both segments improved from the prior quarter and delivered sequential monthly improvement throughout the quarter. Shoppers are responding to our new value proposition at Family Dollar and Dollar Tree as we focus on driving both traffic and store productivity. With the exception of Q1 and Q2 of 2020, at the initial onset of the pandemic, our 6.5% enterprise comp represents our best quarter since the Family Dollar acquisition. By segment, the comp was comprised of an 8.6% increase for Dollar Tree and a 4.1% increase for Family Dollar.
In recent quarters, we refined our strategies at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar to focus on the traffic-driving consumable side of the business. Our transition to the $1.25 price point has enabled our merchants to greatly enhance value for our shoppers. For the second consecutive quarter, our consumables comp outpaced the discretionary comp at Dollar Tree. The team delivered a 9.3% comp on consumables, with key contributors being in food and beverage, snack and cookies, and candy.
Family Dollar consumables increased 4.7% on a comp basis despite the ticket headwinds related to our price actions in Q2. Shoppers are clearly recognizing the greater value and are responding to our enhanced advertising initiatives. Importantly, at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, we saw an acceleration in comp performance throughout the quarter, with October being our strongest month. We have a number of key sales-driving initiatives to drive productivity.
For Dollar Tree stores, we are continuing to exceed the customer's expectation for value. Our merchants do a tremendous job of effectively managing the ever-changing assortment that wows our shoppers. Expanding our $3 and $5 offering into more stores, we ended the quarter with our Plus assortment in nearly 30% of our Dollar Tree stores, and we'll continue to aggressively expand this initiative in the years ahead. We are currently refining our $3 and $5 assortment as our team operates in an environment of continuous improvement based on learnings.
We are developing our frozen assortment to meet our shoppers' family needs as they are looking to save money by dining at home. We are aggressively expanding our offerings of protein, pizza, breakfast items, and family sizes at price points that meet their budgets. We will continue to focus on winning the season. Dollar Tree is a destination for shoppers looking to celebrate holidays, events, and seasons.
Our offering will be better than last year, but not as good as next year as we continue to improve our assortments. Family Dollar, from a pricing perspective, is in the best position in more than a decade. Now that we have taken action to reestablish price parity, we are committed to maintaining our competitiveness. Other Family Dollar initiatives designed to improve sales per square foot, unit sales, and transaction count include improving our store layouts through improved adjacency flow, adding linear square footage, expanding immediate consumption DSD categories, and optimizing the beverage and frozen food offering.
Developing private brands, we are in the process of growing and improving our private brand performance by providing shoppers more choices and a broader offering of quality products at a greater value. Over time, we believe this will enhance customer loyalty, as well as our margin profile. We are refining our marketing effectiveness to provide customers with convenience, value, variety, and an improved shopping experience. We have evolved our print advertising calendar and format to be more relevant to our customers to drive their visit frequency.
We are also in the process of relaunching our Smart Coupon program, designed to improve quality, availability, clip rate, and redemptions. In this changing and dynamic environment, we feel we are implementing the right plans to drive sales productivity, enhance margins, and improve efficiencies to enhance the long-term benefits to each of our stakeholders. In October, Jeff Davis joined Dollar Tree as our new CFO. Jeff brings more than 30 years of financial leadership to the organization, with much of his experience coming from large retailers, including Walmart, JCPenney, and Darden.
Jeff is very much focused on value creation through strategic growth and strategic decision support, as well as value preservation through governance and efficiency in operations. Jeff has been in the company for nearly two months, but he is making a difference already. I'll now hand the call over to Jeff to provide more color on Q3 and what's ahead of us.
Jeff Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I am delighted to join the Dollar Tree team at such a pivotal time. I've been in my seat for almost eight weeks, and I have experienced tremendous energy and excitement across the entire organization as the team is embracing change. While the company has been around for decades, I believe we are in the early phase of significantly improving our long-term operating performance.
In October, I had an opportunity to meet several of you at store visits, and I look forward to connecting with a larger group in the near future. More details to come. Since Mike and Rick already covered our third quarter sales results, I will now move directly to the discussion of operating income. Unless otherwise stated, all third quarter comparisons are against the same period last year.
To supplement my comments, we are introducing a quarterly presentation on our website at corporate.dollartree.com/investors, which outlines several key operating metrics. We hope you will find this additional information helpful to better understand our business. Operating income increased 22.8% to $381.3 million, or 5.5% of total revenue, a 70-basis-point improvement in operating income margin. This was led by a 240-basis-point improvement in gross profit margin, partially offset by a 170-basis-point increase in our SG&A expense rate.
Gross profit increased 17.5%. In the Dollar Tree segment, gross margin improved 520 basis points, primarily from higher initial mark-on related to the move to $1.25 price point, lower freight costs, and sales leverage, partially offset by greater penetration of lower-margin consumable merchandise and product cost inflation. Family Dollar's gross margin declined 100 basis points, largely due to a product mix shift and product cost inflation. We expect to see continued pressure across both segments related to the inflationary cost environment and merchandise mix as our consumable sales are expected to continue outpacing discretionary.
SG&A as a percentage of total revenue increased 170 basis points to 24.4%. The increase is principally related to elevated repairs and maintenance as part of our commitment to improve store standards, investments in store hourly wages, and higher inflationary costs across a number of expense categories, including utilities. Corporate support and other expenses increased 30 basis points to 1.4%, primarily from increased stock compensation expense, higher incentive comp, and professional fees. From a bottom-line basis, net income improved 23.1% to $266.9 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in comparison to $0.96 per diluted share last year.
Moving through the balance sheet. My comments reflect balance comparisons to the end of Q3 2022 versus Q3 2021. Combined cash and cash equivalents totaled $439 million, compared to $701 million. The reduction in cash is largely attributed to the repurchase of approximately 2.86 million shares for $397.5 million in Q3 of this year.
Inventory increased 31.1%, primarily from inflationary product and freight costs, expansion of $1.25 and multipriced Plus inventory, and store growth. Also, recall last year, shoppers pulled forward purchases well ahead of the holiday season, concerned about product availability, while we were chasing trans-Pacific deliveries of discretionary products as our inventory levels dipped well below normal operating levels. This year, shoppers' purchasing behavior appears to be more closely timed to holiday dates. Finally, unit counts are at similar levels to October 2019.
Our inventory is fresh. We have limited dated inventory well within manageable levels. Capital expenditures were $391.2 million in the third quarter, versus 295.6 million last year. For fiscal 2022, we now expect capital expenditures to total approximately $1.2 billion.
As we look to Q4, we see the following affecting our business. We will anniversary a significant number of Dollar Tree stores, approximately 2,500 in December and 3,000 in January, the transition to the $1.25 price point a year ago. We previously experienced an outsize benefit to comps and margins associated to the transition. The economy continues to pressure middle- and low-household-income customers, resulting in needs-based purchasing.
We expect consumables to outperform discretionary, which negatively impacts gross margin. We are cycling advance child tax credit payments, which were distributed mid-month from July to December in 2021. On a year-over-year basis, we are facing higher costs from suppliers related to this inflationary environment. While at Family Dollar, we do have the flexibility to adjust price; at Dollar Tree, where we are at a fixed price point, it takes us time to adjust quantities and pack sizes for cost changes, which can lead to near-term pressure to margins.
We will continue to invest in store and DC standards and expect to have higher year-over-year expenses in repairs and maintenance. In addition to being right on price, we will be right on wage as it continues to be a competitive market for talent. We are raising our sales outlook for the year. Consolidated net sales for the year are now expected to range from $28.14 billion to $28.28 billion, compared to our previous outlook range of $27.85 billion to $28.10 billion.
We expect to deliver mid-single-digit comp sales increase for the year comprised of a high single-digit increase at Dollar Tree stores and a low single-digit increase in Family Dollar. Selling square footage is expected to grow by approximately 2.8% as we are experiencing supply chain delays related to procuring equipment and fixtures for store openings. For Q4, we estimate consolidated net sales will range from $7.54 billion to $7.68 billion based on a mid-to-high single-digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise. At the end of Q2, we expected fiscal 2022 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.10 to $7.40.
Due to several factors, including, but not limited to, an acceleration of consumable product mix shift and elevated product cost pressure, we expect to be in the lower half of the previous outlook range. Other considerations for our updated 2022 outlook include the following. We expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $770 million. Net interest expense is expected to be $30 million in Q4 and $127 million for the year.
Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 24.3% for the fourth quarter and 23.7% for fiscal 2022. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 222.3 million shares for Q4 and 224.2 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. As of October 29th, we had $1.85 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.
I'll now turn the call back to Mike.
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Jeff. I am proud of our team's efforts. During a period of material organizational change, a disruptive hurricane through the Southeast, and macro uncertainty contributing to the highest inflation in 40 years, we delivered increases of 8.1% in sales, 17.5% in gross profit, 22.8% in operating profit, and an increase of 25% in EPS. Our results continue to reinforce the relevance of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar to millions of households across North America.
As you know, in late June, we announced that a number of executive positions would be changed. I am proud to share that by mid-November, all seats are filled, and we are very confident in the outstanding team we have built. All additions have been successful leaders throughout their careers and bring new, fresh perspectives and will enhance our progress. In addition to the executive changes, last week, we announced new leaders for several key areas of the business, including diversity, sustainability, compliance, and communications.
I'm very confident in the team we have developed and that it will enable us to accelerate progress on our transformational journey. In the months ahead, we will be refining and prioritizing our plans to ultimately deliver improved operating performance across both segments. At our Spring Investor Day, we will provide you with a more transparent and comprehensive view into the opportunity ahead of us and the path to get there. Before we transition to Q&A, I want to sincerely share my gratitude to our associates, especially in Florida and the Carolinas, for their efforts during Hurricane Ian at the end of September.
Their efforts through the preparation for and the recovery from this devastating storm was critical to countless families and communities we serve. In many cases, our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores were among the first to reopen to assist customers with the products they needed most. Thank you to each of you. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] We will take the first question from the line of Matthew Boss from J.P. Morgan. The line is open now.
Please go ahead.
Matt Boss -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Great. Thanks. So, maybe, first question, at Family Dollar, could you elaborate on the drivers of sequential improvement as the quarter progressed? How much do you think more so of this is tied to the macro or the value trade-down behavior versus what inning do you think that your company's specific initiatives are in today at Family Dollar?
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thanks for the question. I think it's a combination of everything that you're seeing going on, the pressure on the customer, and then our merchandising team invest -- the investment we made in getting our prices right to be at parity in the marketplace, and then as well as writing more impactful ads and more frequency of our ads. So, I think stronger promotion, stronger base pricing, and then the work on the assortment in our H25, I think is leading to the overall macro impact that the customers are seeing on the pressure that they have to try and meet the budget each and every day. I think that, you know, on the customer, we're seeing -- you know, we're seeing continued pressure.
We're -- you know, as I've shared, we're seeing more customers come into our segment. And once they're in our segment, these are -- the majority of the customers are at 80,000 and higher household income. But even once they're inside the store, we're seeing shifts in their behavior where they're very consumable and needs-based focused to try and make that budget work and stretch it over the month. We're seeing private brands now for 39 weeks in a row have outpaced national brands.
Thirty-nine weeks in a row. We have not seen that prior five to seven years where private brands were outpacing national brands. But it's now been 39 years in a row -- or 39 weeks in a row. I'm sorry.
And then we're seeing first in a month business is getting stronger. We're seeing our SNAP and food stamp business is growing. And we continue to see credit is outpacing debit. So, we do see that shift in the customer coming into our segment.
And then when they're in our store, they are shifting into the consumables and needs-based to make their budget happen. And I think the work that our merchants are doing are absolutely aligned and helping drive meeting their needs when they're in our store.
Matt Boss -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Right. And then just at the Dollar Tree banner, what's your overall assessment to date on breaking the box overall? Can you -- and can you speak to sequential trends with traffic to the banner that you're seeing? Or what's been the reception to Dollar Tree Plus or the rollout of the $3 and the $5 SKUs across the assortment?
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll start with $1.25. I think, overall, our traffic has been very stable, and we saw a slight improvement in Q3 in traffic. But what was more important is throughout 2020 and 2021, our consumable sales continued to decline quarter after quarter because of the product availability and the assortment, we just couldn't provide for the customer at that dollar price point.
Once we moved to the $1.25, throughout this year, our merchant teams have worked hard at bringing in that new assortment, and we have absolutely changed that trend. Instead of declining business in consumables, it's now accelerating and leading the growth. And I believe, over time, that will continue to drive traffic into our stores at Dollar Tree. So, what I'm really excited about is for the second quarter in a row, consumables have outpaced our discretionary business and it was 9.3%, 9.4% comp sales, but discretionary is still doing well at over 8%.
So, we like the business and the reaction we're seeing from the customers based on us being able to have a better assortment at greater values on products they need. And I think as we continue to provide that, that will help stabilize our traffic in the long term going forward. On the $3 and $5, we're seeing a great response from our customers, especially on the seasonal side of the product, and that's where we think we can continue to refine and grow that business. And then as well, you've also heard us, on the frozen food part, at the $1.25, with the cost pressures, it's even hard for us to get a great value assortment at the $1.25.
So, we've moved to multipriced products in our frozen food set. It's easier to communicate to our customers and our associates because it's door by door. And our -- and that assortment, as I've shared, the customers are responding greatly. And again, this is our frozen business, for the last 18 months was in a decline because of the same pressures we were seeing on the consumables.
And now, we've completely reversed that where we have introduced the multipriced $3 and $5 items. Customers are responding well, and we see strong growth in our sales there. So, I think between the two of those things, the consumable side and then the frozen side, over time, we will continue to drive traffic doing that. And then on the discretionary side, proven by our continued growth on an 8% comp, the customers still see the value in our seasonal, hardy, toys, crafting, and that continues to be strong.
So, I like the trends we're seeing overall.
Matt Boss -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst

Operator
Thank you. We will take the next question from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from Truist. The line is open now. Please go ahead.
Scot Ciccarelli -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So, can you talk about the consumable versus the discretionary mix of both banners? It seems like there's a concerted effort to focus more on consumables. Obviously, that helps with traffic but is margin dilutive.
So, I guess the question is how do you guys expect to manage that balance? Number one. And then number two, when would you expect the mix pressures to start to ease? Is there like, I guess, a certain target you're kind of shooting for?
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, and you're right. Right now, we're meeting the needs where the customer is taking us, and we are improving that assortment. And I'll speak to Family Dollar. Larry Gatta and the merchants have done a wonderful job at really improving that assortment and that pricing for that customer where they need us.
And it's all in that consumable and DSD-related products. And we've done that not only in our base pricing but our promotion pricing and then also in the linear footage dedicated to it, our resets and our 2.5. So, you're right, I think our biggest goal to drive improvement on the Family Dollar side is to get more sales per square foot in our boxes. And the first thing is, is driving it with consumables and being right on that.
But the team is also, at the same time, really working on discretionary to be right on seasonal and home to meet their needs. But really, it's the consumable driving that trade over more than our effort and the work that we're doing on the merchandising side. And then on the Dollar Tree side, just as I have shared, I like what I've seen the last two quarters, where one is up 9.5%, the other one is 8%. That's a great balance.
And I think as we continue to provide that value on the consumable side, I think, over time, we like when both are 50-50, 50%, say, discretionary, 50% consumables. And then as they grow over time, I think -- like Dollar Tree historically is always growing low single-digit comps with a combination of traffic and units in the basket. And I think once we settle and cycle through that, providing that effort on the consumable side, we will get back to that normal cadence that we've seen in the past.
Scot Ciccarelli -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
So, just from an earnings algorithm perspective, I'm not asking specific guidance for next year, is it fair to assume kind of lower gross margins, but maybe more SG&A leverage on kind of a go-forward basis maybe than what we've seen historically just given the mix shift?
Jeff Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. This is Jeff. Absolutely, from a standpoint of -- given the mix shift and some of the other cost pressures. You know, margin is much more under pressure.
But given this increase in revenue, the opportunity to leverage our SG&A is definitely there.
Scot Ciccarelli -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Got it. Thanks.
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
And I would just say, too. The other thing is, as Family Dollar continues to prove their execution and drive market share in these products and DSD and national brands, and then even in our private brands, vendor rebates and allowances will follow that because we're executing better. And Larry's team is really working hard on trying to drive that. So, it's really even the mix within the mix.
As consumables grow, there is levers that we can pull with allowances and rebates and then mix in the private brands as that consumer shifts, too. That should help with some of the margin pressure, too.
Scot Ciccarelli -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll take the next question from the line of Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. The line is open now. Please go ahead.
Joe Feldman -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst
Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask you just to go a little deeper, on the private brands, where do you see the most opportunity? Like what maybe categories and where that you're focused on and where do you think you can drive incremental improvement quickly?
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
I believe across the board. In Larry's team, we have staffed up. We've brought in additional experts in this area on the private brand for Family Dollar. On the OTC and health, over-the-counter drug and health is where we're going to be focused and leaning in first.
And of course, on the paper side of it, we think there is opportunity. And then just on the everyday food side. So, those would be the three big areas. And I think Larry's team, we're organizing around it.
We're looking at the brands and driving penetration by category, comparing to the rest of the market. And we've partnered with a third-party broker to really help accelerate that. So, those would be the three big areas, and it's a huge focus for Larry and his team.
Joe Feldman -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst
That's great. Thank you. If I could follow up with maybe a bigger picture question. I think Rick had said in his prepared remarks that, you know, he views the company as kind of two really strong growth companies under one roof.
And which I guess is not too different from the past, but it does imply that there's, you know, two different go-to-market strategies, which we know, and ways of doing business. So, I'm wondering, how do you guys leverage the scale of the overall company and the operations? And like has anything changed with that strategy to have these, you know, combined fulfillment centers and, you know, purchasing power being stronger? Maybe you can just give a little more color on that.
Rick Dreiling -- Executive Chairman
Hey, Mike. I think I'll lead with that if that's OK. Hey, what I would say is the things that how we go to market, how we face the customer between the two banners are totally different. One is basic consumable retailing, the Family Dollar side.
One is consistent everyday low price, one price point. The leverage, the beauty of the combination is all of the back side things that the consumer doesn't experience: the accounting, the HR, the legal. And that's where all of those synergies exist. Even on the supply chain, how we deliver to the stores, how [Technical difficulty].
So, all of those synergies are still there. But what we're doing a much different -- what I would think not only different but better job is with how we're facing the consumer, realizing that one is more emotional driven. And then again, one is more concerned with everyday excitement value. Michael, I'll turn it over to you on that.
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
No, I think you stated it right. Well, the customer facing side is where we're leveraging. But on the backside, we'll be leveraging all the opportunities we can as one organization.
Joe Feldman -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst
That's great. Thanks. That's a helpful response. Thanks, guys, and good luck with this quarter.
Operator
Thank you. We will take the next question from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. The line is up now. Please go ahead.
John Heinbockel -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst
Hey, guys, a couple of questions on Family Dollar merchandising. So, you know, one, given the size of the box, how do you think about product breadth versus depth, you know, that fundamental tension, and do you need to accelerate cooler capacity as part of the process? And then lastly, I know you're working on supply chain, right, to try to improve out of stocks. How quickly do you think that begins to impact the business, right? Is that kind of, you know, six months out, a year out, maybe not that long? Thoughts would be great.
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, I'll start with the breadth and depth of Family Dollar. And, you know, again, Larry and his team is going category by category, and he's already made changes in our new H2.5. But that will be a continuous improvement throughout this next year.
As him and his team apply that discipline and strategy to each category, we will be bringing in more SKUs where it makes sense to help meet the needs of the customer and comparing it to the rest of the market. And where we've done that and the categories that he's done so far, we're seeing great results in it, and I think that's why we're excited about our 2.5. We're also using our linear space more. We're putting in more shelves inside the box, and then we can go vertically higher in the gondolas, the rows of shelving that we have right now.
And again, that allows us to bring in more assortment into the store and getting more sales per square foot. The cooler is absolutely an improvement. And every time we remodel a store, we want to bring in more coolers, both cold -- cool beverage and frozen beverage, because that's where the customer is moving to. And it's a convenience item and it's meeting their needs.
So, there is room for continued expansion there. And Larry and his team has even really looked at a reset for the whole frozen food set. And we're -- we've rolled that out going into this back half of the year. So, that's going to be a continuous improvement side.
And on the supply chain, I would say we're constantly looking at reenabling our supply chain, as Rick said, to try and drive efficiencies and making it easier for our stores. And we're seeing improvements right now on things that we're doing in our supply chain. So, I think you'll see it now throughout the next two to three years on how do we continue to refine our supply chain as a key enabler to drive the efficiencies and make it easier for our stores to get the product in the stores more efficiently.
John Heinbockel -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst
OK. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We will take the next question from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. The line is open now. Please go ahead.
Edward Kelly -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Yeah. Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about the Dollar Tree gross margin.
You know, you've hinted at the past that, you know, this potentially could be higher than 36% over time. I think if I try to sort of like, you know, look at where your run rating now based on a commentary around a little bit of incremental pressure in Q4, you know, maybe your run rating, you know, sort of high 35% range. Just thoughts around that. And then as we think about next year, you know, you do get a big freight benefit likely.
How do you think about, you know, investing that versus letting that flow through? And I asked that question because, you know, the consensus is probably in the high 37% range for next year. And it sort of all boils down to, you know, what do you think the right margin is for this business to provide value to customers while also delivering for shareholders?
Jeff Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, thank you for the question. If you think about our margins right now, and as we think about a move forward, it's really driven by what the customer is really leading into and buying. So, right now, we're seeing a little more of a rotation into our consumables versus our discretionary. But yet, you're seeing good growth on both sides.
We like the balance of that. We're doing a number of things to continue to provide value to the customer and maintain that margin rate as best we can, recognizing right now that we're still under some level of product cost pressures, as well as from a freight component, but still being able to deliver, as you said, you know, high -- mid-30s types of margin rates. You know, as we move forward, we will continue to look to deliver value to the customer across both of those broad categories of discretionary and consumables. We believe that a number of things that we're doing with a multi price point will allow us to lean into the discretionary even more and hopefully continue to balance out that end of the business also.
So, it's really a combination of the two and it depends on how the customer is and their behaviors and their needs. And we're able to provide them across a broad continuum.
Edward Kelly -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
OK. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll take the next question from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. The line is open now. Please go ahead.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Just within your last answer, you mentioned a mid-30% gross margin moving forward for the Dollar Tree banner. The Dollar Tree banner has $0.5 billion of costs that were negatively impacted from all the significant amount of freight and transportation over the last few years, especially container costs.
Container costs are now back to where they were in 2019 levels. So, understanding that there could be some mix pressure as the consumer focuses on consumables, why would you not get a more significant benefit to Dollar Tree's gross margin from the significant decline in freight cost moving into next year? Should we interpret that to mean that you have to make more sizable investments in Dollar Tree in order to maintain the sales productivity of that banner, especially now that you see how those stores that were early to raise prices last year are performing once they lap that? Thank you very much.
Jeff Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
As I look at this, there is definitely the opportunity as freight rates start to turn back around. That -- you know, we are on contract. Most of the business we do is on contracted carriers versus spot rates. So, there's going to be a little bit of a lag in that time frame.
And at this point, we're not giving any guidance for 2023 as of yet. But to the extent that we continue to see the freight rates and the other trans-Pacific rates coming down and staying down, that will be reflected in our longer-term contract rates. We will then have the opportunity to balance that with giving back to the customer, as well as the shareholder. But having said that, that's only one component.
The other component is underlying product cost. And right now, there is as much pressure and many times in the product costs, underlying vendor product costs as there is in freight. So, you know, we have to balance the two and definitely keep an eye on, in my mind, how we create value for the overall organization is balancing that in being priced right in the marketplace for our customer, as well as providing a higher return to our shareholder.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
So, if I can just follow up on that, Jeff. As of November 2022, you have 312 stores that are now anniversary-ing the rollout of the $1.25 price point from last year. Are those stores comping positively in the range with the rest of the Dollar Tree banner performance?
Jeff Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, we're in a new quarter here. We're not going to give you interest quarter guidance. And it's really early for us to tell.
So, you know, I think that when we release our fourth quarter results, we'll be able to tell you more about that.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
Thank you very much and good luck.
Operator
Thank you. We will take the next question from the line of Michael Montani from Evercore. The line is open now. Please go ahead.
Michael Montani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask, first off, if I could, on the SG&A side, if there's a level of comp that you feel you'd need for natural leverage into the fourth quarter and into 2023 in order to lever some of the expenses there? And then a follow up.
Jeff Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, you know, Michael, it's a good question. You know, it's one in which what would be a natural level to leverage in normal circumstances versus what we are doing, as we had mentioned earlier, a good focus, continued focus and commitment around elevating our store standards, investing in not only store standards, but our wage rates for our stores. We're -- and the combination of the two. You know, we have been making some material investments.
But if you look over a period of time, we've been able to leverage our SG&A, if you will, on about a 2% to 3% comp.
Michael Montani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
OK. Thank you. And then if I could just follow up on capex. The past few years, it was trending around $8 a foot, and this year, it looks like it could be north of nine.
So, given some of the inflationary components there and the investments you all are making, is that kind of the right baseline, that nine-plus, to build off of or should we think of this as maybe some more catch up that could subside?
Jeff Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, you know, once again, I don't want to give any guidance beyond 2022 other than what we've provided. The investments that we're making this year in technology and supply chain on top of our normal base is what's really driving the increase. And, you know, we believe it's the right thing to do as we set up for the right capabilities for us to accelerate our growth going forward.
Michael Montani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We will take the next question from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. The line is open now. Please go ahead.
Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett Research Advisors -- Analyst
Hey, thanks very much. Jeff, on the implied fourth quarter guide, can you help us think about the segments where you see more margin compression relative to the third quarter? It looks like you're anticipating operating margins to be down about 30 basis points or so. They were up about 70 basis points in the third quarter on a similar comp. So, just wanted to hold our hands on the segment for 4Q a little bit.
Jeff Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, we historically have not given guidance necessarily on a banner basis. We look at it in total. The pressure that we're seeing is, once again, continued rotation in the consumables and how the customer is responding there, as well as we know that we are continuing to see other inflationary cost pressures across the P&L. But all of this is more -- was anticipated back when we gave our earlier guidance.
It's really the product mix shift that is the predominant sort of driver of our sort of direction around the lower half of the range.
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
And the continued pressure on cost.
Jeff Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes.
Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett Research Advisors -- Analyst
OK, great. And follow-up question for Rick and Mike. Obviously, the price investments a few months ago were smart. I'm curious, when you think out over the next couple of years and the next big levers you can pull to improve productivity, you know, I guess what should we be thinking about? Mike, you touched on a little bit in terms of raising the [Inaudible] adding coolers.
But I guess maybe a little bit of looking inside the playbook on what to expect.
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I would say that --
Rick Dreiling -- Executive Chairman
So, Mike -- go ahead, Mike.
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Go ahead.
Rick Dreiling -- Executive Chairman
Yeah, I was going to say -- go ahead, brother. I'm sorry. Bye. Bye.
Go.
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
You know, Rick opened up with the clean it up, fill it up, and straighten it up. I think getting the product filled in our stores and better store conditions and more consistently for our customer is one thing. I think that private brands is another big leverage. And I think the work that Larry and the team are going to do yet that we -- were really at the beginning of that, doing a better job on the category-by-category assortment that our merchants need and being priced right.
I think those are the big levers inside our store to really keep driving the overall sales per square foot of our buildings.
Rick Dreiling -- Executive Chairman
Yeah. And I -- the only thing I would add to that is we are -- especially on the Family Dollar side, we are under-SKUed, and we are under-SKUed based on how we ship product to the stores. We tend to ship only in case packs versus eaches for the higher-margin, slower-turn merchandise. If you look at our cooler commitment, we are undercoolered, for lack of a better phrase, in our Family Dollar stores and probably our Dollar Tree stores.
So, there is lots of upside by managing the SKU base.
Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett Research Advisors -- Analyst
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take the next question from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. The line is open now. Please go ahead.
Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Hi, Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. I was wondering if you could just help us give us a little more specific magnitude of the product cost inflation you're seeing on the consumables versus the discretionary side of both businesses. And just with as you work with suppliers, are you seeing any light at the end of the tunnel in terms of the product cost inflation front?
Jeff Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Kelly, maybe the best way to describe the support dimension to it is if you take a look at our inventory and you take a look at our inventory on a year-over-year basis. And in my prepared remarks, I had mentioned that part of the inventory increase was as a result of last year, the cupboards being fairly bare last year as a result of, you know, customer pull forward and holiday and then us chasing goods. But even if you step back from that, about 40% to 45% of our increase in inventory on a year-over-year basis is a result of product -- vendor product cost increases.
There's another roughly 20% that is a result of higher freight costs associated with those inventories. So, just those two components represented about, you know, roughly 60%, 65% of the increase in the cost of our inventory. And that's what is now embedded in our inventory and then, of course, will be rolling through with respect to, you know, margins on a go-forward basis, in which we have been dealing with over the course of the year. Yeah, as it relates to -- you know, our merchant teams continue to be, I think, very resourceful in looking at, you know, different suppliers, negotiations, working with them around allowances, working with them across other ways to get support on the business.
And then, of course, one of the things that is really important to us and Mike had mentioned is we're leaning into these private brands and the opportunity to blend that more into our offering. Our customers are looking for that opportunity, and it gives us more margin protection.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take the next question from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. The line is open now. Please go ahead.
Simeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Hey. Good morning, guys. It's Simeon Gutman. Following up on the freight question, I wanted to ask maybe a different way.
So, is part of it, you know, that the timing of contracts means that we don't see a lot of the savings in '23 or are you just reserving the right to figure out how to plan the business? There will be savings, but you're not sure of how to -- you know, how to reinvest or use the savings yet.
Jeff Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I think you're spot on as it relates to the freight. Those contracts and the way that we would recognize it is more of a forward look. So, it would be into a 2023 year.
And then as that freight -- as we negotiate those new freight costs, we see those freight costs coming down, they would run through our inventory turns.
Simeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
OK. So, I guess it's a '23 into '24 phenomenon where the real savings builds up. Is that the right way to interpret that answer?
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
We wish to see it in the back half of the '23. We should start to see it. It's about a quarter drag. You know, we turn our inventories four times a year.
So, it's usually about a quarter drag. Once we start appreciating the lower rates, then we can see that in our product as it's coming through.
Simeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
OK. And then just my quick follow-up on the traffic on Dollar Tree. Can you talk about -- I'm sure this has been asked, but, you know, why it's like multiyear? I think it got a little better this quarter, but structurally, it's been down for the past several years. Can you talk about that? And then why shouldn't the right algo be you get price, but traffic is either flat or it could decline because it's hard to understand why the traffic has, you know, structurally been weaker over the last several years? Thank you.
Mike Wytinski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I would just say this. I think it's a lot due to our assortment that we provided for our customer. And the majority was that was on the consumer side. And then just during the pandemic, our customer, it was -- we weren't high consumable driven and high discretionary where they were -- when they had money in their pocket.
Trips were consolidated in '20 and '21, and they were buying high-ticket items to decorate their homes, decorate outside, and replacing a lot of things inside their house. That's not where Dollar Tree is at our single fixed price point. So, '20 and '21 were OK for us. But when we saw the consumable side of the business, that assortment go away, that was impacting our traffic.
That's why I'm really excited about going forward. The last two quarters now, we're seeing that consumable sales come back, 9.4% comp in the third quarter, and we see that continue and especially on a consumable. And then on the frozen side of the business, we do see that traffic starting to settle back into what Dollar Tree has been known for, you know, that low single-digit traffic increases with ticket increase, to have a nice go-forward balance between the two. And continuing to balance our mix between consumable and discretionary, I think that's ahead of us and that's what the work that the team has been doing in the last two quarters.
We're seeing evidence of it.

Nov 22 (Reuters) - Dollar Tree Inc DLTR.O said on Thursday that its full-year profit would be at the lower end of its forecast, with the discount store retailer's margins under pressure from decades-high inflation.
Shares of the company, which has cut prices at its Family Dollar stores to sustain demand, fell about 3% to $159.78 in premarket trading.
Dollar Tree has been hit by slowing demand for everything from toys and party supplies to homeware, which are typically more profitable than food and other perishables.
Industry bellwethers Walmart IncWMT.N and Target CorpTGT.N issued gloomy holiday sales forecasts last week, with Target pointing to a sharp fall in demand for discretionary goods.
Dollar Tree is also grappling with higher freight costs and price cuts at its Family Dollar banner that were rolled out in the second quarter.
The price cuts, however, helped Family Dollar post its strongest quarterly same-store sales jump since 2020.
Dollar Tree now expects annual profit at the lower half of its previously estimated range of $7.10 per share to $7.40 per share.
The company raised its forecast for fiscal 2022 net sales to between $28.14 billion and $28.28 billion, compared with its previous outlook of $27.85 billion to $28.10 billion.

2022-11-22 00:00:00+00:00,Dollar Tree (DLTR) Q3 Earnings and Revenues Top Estimates,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-dltr-q3-earnings-and-revenues-top-estimates,,,"Dollar Tree (DLTR) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.20 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.96 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.56%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this discount retailer would post earnings of $1.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.60, delivering a surprise of 1.27%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.
Dollar Tree, which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, posted revenues of $6.94 billion for the quarter ended October 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.47%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $6.42 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Dollar Tree shares have added about 17.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -17.1%.
What's Next for Dollar Tree?
While Dollar Tree has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Dollar Tree: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.13 on $7.51 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.28 on $28.02 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Discount Stores is currently in the top 22% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
Another stock from the same industry, Costco (COST), has yet to report results for the quarter ended November 2022. The results are expected to be released on December 8.
This warehouse club operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
Costco's revenues are expected to be $55.06 billion, up 9.3% from the year-ago quarter.

2022-11-22 00:00:00+00:00,"Zoom Keeps Slowing, but This Nasdaq Stock's Drop Is a Bigger Surprise",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/zoom-keeps-slowing-but-this-nasdaq-stocks-drop-is-a-bigger-surprise,,,"Stock market investors came in Tuesday morning hoping that the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) would be able to mount a comeback from Monday's declines at some point during the holiday-shortened week. It appeared the Nasdaq would get a bit of a respite, with futures trading higher by about a quarter-percent before the start of the regular trading session.
Technology stocks have had a particularly hard time during 2022, so for many investors, it wasn't too surprising to see Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM) report results that once again came as a disappointment. However, the discount retail industry has generally been a bastion of strength as economic conditions have grown more challenging. That made the decline in Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) stock more of a surprise. Below, you'll learn more about both companies and what sent their share prices lower Tuesday morning.
Zoom fears further slowdowns
Shares of Zoom Video Communications fell 8% in premarket trading on Tuesday morning. The move followed the release of the video conferencing giant's fiscal third-quarter results for the period ending Oct. 31.
Zoom's third-quarter numbers showed just how much the company's growth has slowed. Revenue of $1.1 billion was up just 5% year over year, with the strong U.S. dollar costing the company about 2 percentage points of potential sales growth. Adjusted net income of $323 million was down 4.5% from year-ago levels, although the resulting adjusted earnings of $1.07 per share came in better than most of those who follow the stock had expected.
Zoom has done its best to pivot toward enterprise customers, and revenue from them climbed 20% year over year, offsetting sales declines from its standard online segment. The company saw a 14% rise in enterprise customer counts to 209,300, nearly 3,300 of which contributed more than $100,000 to sales over the past 12 months.
Yet investors weren't satisfied with Zoom's near-term guidance, which called for full-year sales of $4.37 billion to $4.38 billion and adjusted earnings of $3.91 to $3.94 per share. Until economic conditions recover and until Zoom works through the grinding churn of more casual users who've chosen not to rely on its communications services any longer, shareholders can expect continued volatility in Zoom's stock price.
Dollar Tree's earnings guidance falls short
Shares of Dollar Tree didn't see declines of the same size that Zoom's stock suffered. Yet the 3% premarket decline early Tuesday took some investors by surprise, as the dollar store retailer's projections for the full 2022 year didn't live up to high expectations.
Dollar Tree's financial results were relatively solid. Revenue was up 8% to $6.94 billion, with same-store sales climbing 6.5%. As has been the case for a while now, comps for the namesake Dollar Tree stores outperformed the Family Dollar chain, this quarter by 4.5 percentage points. Moreover, the company managed to boost its gross margin, something most retailers have proven unable to do in the current macroeconomic environment. Earnings of $1.20 per share jumped 25% year over year.
Yet even though Dollar Tree increased its sales outlook for the remainder of the year, investors didn't like its new earnings projections. The dollar store retailer now expects revenue of $28.14 billion to $28.28 billion, up from $27.85 billion to $28.1 billion previously. Yet Dollar Tree expects its earnings to finish in the lower half of its guidance range of $7.10 to $7.40 per share, due largely to cost pressures.
Even with the minor setback, Dollar Tree's stock remains higher so far in 2022. That's a rarity in a bear market, but it speaks to the resilience of its business model and the fact that consumers are increasingly attracted to its bargain-priced merchandise.

Gross profit margin was down approximately 450 basis points from last year, primarily driven by 370 basis points of higher freight and raw material costs and 60 basis points from the adverse impact of exchange rates.
Looking ahead, Abercrombie projects a net sales decline of 2 to 4 percent in the fourth quarter from last year's $1.2 billion as well as a 2 to 3 percent decline for the full-year 2022 from last year's $3.7 billion, compared to the prior forecast for a mid-single-digits decline.
The Street is looking for net sales $1.09 billion for the quarter and net sales decline of 4.7 percent to $3.54 billion for the year.

Gross margin for the quarter improved 240 basis points to 29.9 percent, primarily driven by improved initial mark-on and leverage on distribution and occupancy costs, partially offset by a product mix shift to lower-margin consumable products, inflationary cost pressures, higher shrink and markdowns.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the company estimates consolidated net sales between $7.54 billion and $7.68 billion, based on a mid- to high-single-digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise. Analysts expect the company to report sales of $7.52 billion for the quarter.

2022-11-21 00:00:00+00:00,Baidu (BIDU) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/baidu-bidu-to-report-q3-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-offing,,,"Baidu, Inc. BIDU is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 22.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the September-quarter revenues is pegged at $4.74 billion, indicating a decline of 4.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.44 per share, suggesting 7% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.

BIDU’s earnings beat estimates in all its trailing four quarters, the average being 58.1%.
Baidu, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
Baidu, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Baidu, Inc. Quote
Factors to Consider
Gains from Baidu’s expanding footprint in the autonomous driving space are expected to get reflected in the to-be-reported results. The growing traction of the Apollo Go Robotaxi service across China is likely to have hugely favored BIDU’s performance in the third quarter.

The growing efforts to strengthen Baidu’s AI business are likely to have been a key catalyst. BIDU’s robust Baidu Cloud is anticipated to have benefited the business in the quarter under review.

The growing adoption of Baidu ACE smart transportation is likely to have contributed well to the AI business in the third quarter.

Additionally, sustained efforts to bolster the mobile search engine and AI tools are anticipated to have aided the third-quarter performance.

The momentum in Baidu's mobile ecosystem is expected to have aided growth in the average daily active user base of the Baidu App in the third quarter. Hosted solutions on the Baidu App are expected to have driven the Baidu Core segment in the to-be-reported quarter.

BIDU’s well-performing iQIYI segment, offering online entertainment services, is expected to have bolstered the to-be-reported quarter’s performance.

However, the impacts of higher promotional expenses and heavy spending on new growth areas are expected to have affected Baidu’s performance in the quarter under discussion.

Uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic in China are also anticipated to have raised a concern.

2022-11-21 00:00:00+00:00,Vipshop (VIPS) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vipshop-vips-to-report-q3-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-offing,,,"Vipshop Holdings Limited VIPS is set to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 22.

VIPS expects third-quarter total net revenues between RMB 21.2 billion and RMB 22.4 billion, indicating a fall of 15-10% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.25 billion, suggesting a decline of 16% from the year-ago reported figure.

The consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at 27 cents per share, indicating growth of 17.4% from the prior-year reported figure.

Vipshop’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same twice, the average earnings surprise being 10.5%.
Vipshop Holdings Limited Price and EPS Surprise
Vipshop Holdings Limited price-eps-surprise | Vipshop Holdings Limited Quote
Key Factors at Play
VIPS’ consistent efforts to strengthen product offerings and improve product procurement are expected to have benefited its third-quarter performance, given the growing proliferation of online shopping amid the pandemic.

Solid execution of Vipshop’s merchandising strategy is likely to have bolstered its total active customer base in the to-be-reported quarter.

Moreover, its successful transition to discount retailing remains a major positive. This is anticipated to have continued driving the momentum across repeated customers and helped attract the new ones.

Additionally, VIPS’ quarterly results are expected to reflect its deepening focus on high-margin-generating apparel-related businesses, especially the discount apparel business.

Moreover, the business is expected to have accelerated Vipshop’s gross merchandise volume (GMV) in the quarter under review. VIPS’ deep discount channels are expected to have bolstered its online GMV in the to-be-reported quarter.

However, weakening consumer demand in discretionary categories due to the challenging macro environment and the resurgence of COVID-19 in China might have continued hurting its performance during the quarter under review.
Also, intensifying competition in the online shopping market, which hiked Vipshop’s sales and marketing spending, is anticipated to get reflected in the third-quarter results.

2022-11-21 00:00:00+00:00,Is This the Surest Sign Yet a Recession is Coming?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-this-the-surest-sign-yet-a-recession-is-coming,,,"Our wallets may be telling us we're already in a recession, but officially we're not there yet.
The National Bureau of Economic Research's definition of ""a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months"" has enough wiggle room and gray area to push a formal declaration further out into the future. Though a number of economic indicators suggest a recession will hit sooner rather than later, we may have just gotten our clearest sign yet the good times could be over.

Hunkering down for the storm
Last Wednesday, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) told employees that because of ""an unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment,"" it was going to immediately begin laying off as many as 10,000 or more workers. That news was followed by FedEx (NYSE: FDX) saying it would also be letting employees go in its FedEx Freight less-than-truckload division, a last-mile service that delivers bulky items to consumers.
While we've seen tens of thousands of employee departures from tech companies like Meta, Snap, and Twitter in recent weeks, the back-to-back announcements by Amazon and FedEx are especially worrisome because they're happening just before Christmas.
The holiday season, of course, is retail's busiest season. It's the time of Black Friday sales, Cyber Monday, and round-the-clock store shopping. According to the National Retail Federation, we're supposed to see a record 166.3 million people shopping the five-day period between Thanksgiving Day and Cyber Monday.
It's also when the focus is on massive seasonal hiring efforts. In years past, Amazon would hire 100,000 or more temporary employees and FedEx would bring on tens of thousands of new workers. Indeed, Amazon said last month that it would in fact hire 150,000 temps this year, but the fact that it is coupling those new hires with layoffs -- the largest number in the company's history -- means this year is unlike any other. Moreover, FedEx didn't give its usual release on its seasonal hiring plans, and executives said the company would hire fewer seasonal workers for 2022 than in past years
Because we're getting the biggest online retailer and a major shipping company letting some of their people go, it's the clearest sign a recession could be coming, if not here already -- and that shouldn't be ignored.

Not just any port in a storm
What should an investor do? So long as you don't need the money to pay your bills or for emergencies, and don't plan to touch it for at least five years -- better if it's 10, and ideally decades or more -- stocks can, and arguably should, continue to be an integral part of your recession-investment strategy.
In 2008, during the so-called Great Recession when the S&P 500 lost 38% of its value, there were still a lot of winning stock investments.
Toymaker Hasbro gained 14% as consumers shied away from expensive video games and gadgets in favor of timely, simpler, and more affordable board games.
Auto parts retailer AutoZone soared 16% because people held onto their cars longer and fixed them themselves.
Dollar Tree rocketed 60% higher as consumers pinched pennies and found the deep-discount dollar store chain a way to stretch their wallets.
Similarly Walmart (NYSE: WMT) jumped 18% because its everyday low prices consistently provided consumers with good value.
Amgen jumped 24% as investors turned to a safe-haven sector like healthcare during troubled times as it produced critical drugs for cancer, anemia, and other illnesses.
We're likely going to see many of the same trends play out this time around, too. Walmart, for example, just reported robust earnings, because even well-heeled shoppers were going down market to buy lower-cost groceries from its supercenters. Dollar Tree's stock is running 16% higher this year, likely for the very same reasons as last time.
Investing during a recession
The specific stock doesn't matter per se -- the important thing is to not hide your head in the sand until the storm blows over. Careful selection of companies with good businesses that can weather some turbulence can serve an investor well.
This is a time when previously expensive stocks are finally available at discounts, allowing you to buy low with an eye toward selling high. In short, even in a recession an investor can find opportunity.

2022-11-21 00:00:00+00:00,Here's How Guess? (GES) Looks Placed Ahead of Q3 Earnings,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-how-guess-ges-looks-placed-ahead-of-q3-earnings,,,"Guess?, Inc. GES is likely to register a decline in the top line when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Nov 22 after market close. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $614 million, indicating a decline of 4.5% from the prior-year reported figure.

The bottom line of this designer, marketer and distributor of contemporary apparel, denim, handbags, footwear and other related consumer products is anticipated to decline year over year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for the quarter under review has been stable at 55 cents over the past 30 days. The figure suggests a decline from the earnings of 62 cents reported in the year-ago period.

Guess? has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this Angeles, CA-based company’s bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.9%.
Key Factors to Note
The third quarter of fiscal 2023 might have been a soft one for Guess?, at least consensus numbers say so. A competitive landscape, sluggish consumer demand and higher shipping costs might have hurt the company’s performance. Also, a promotional environment and adverse foreign currency might have been added deterrents. COVID-19 restrictions in China might have also hurt the company’s revenues.

On its lastearnings call Guess? guided a 4.5% decline in third-quarter revenues, with an adjusted operating margin of about 8.1%, down roughly 280 basis points due to currency headwinds and last year's pandemic-relief package. On a constant-currency basis, the top line is expected to improve 4.5%.

The aforementioned factors raise concerns about the outcome. However, the company’s customer-centric initiatives, including omnichannel capabilities, and a focus on the speed-to-market model and store productivity should have provided some cushion.

2022-11-21 00:00:00+00:00,How Investors Can Grab Better Returns for Retail and Wholesale Using the Zacks ESP Screener,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-investors-can-grab-better-returns-for-retail-and-wholesale-using-the-zacks-esp-37,,,"Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.
The earnings figure itself is key, of course, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb and vice versa.
Hunting for 'earnings whispers' or companies poised to beat their quarterly earnings estimates is a somewhat common practice. But that doesn't make it easy. One way that has been proven to work is by using the Zacks Earnings ESP tool.
The Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained
The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information.
With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure. The system also utilizes our core Zacks Rank to provide a stronger system for identifying stocks that might beat their next quarterly earnings estimate and possibly see the stock price climb.
In fact, when we combined a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. Perhaps most importantly, using these parameters has helped produce 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
Stocks with a ranking of #3 (Hold), or 60% of all stocks covered by the Zacks Rank, are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. Stocks with rankings of #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy), or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market; Strong Buy stocks should outperform more than any other rank.
Should You Consider Dollar Tree?
The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Dollar Tree (DLTR) earns a #3 (Hold) one day from its next quarterly earnings release on November 22, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.24 a share.
DLTR has an Earnings ESP figure of +6.31%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.24 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17. Dollar Tree is one of a large database of stocks with positive ESPs. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
DLTR is just one of a large group of Retail and Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. Kohl's (KSS) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.
Kohl's is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on March 7, 2023. KSS' Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.14 a share 106 days from its next earnings release.
For Kohl's, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11 is +3.07%.
Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, DLTR and KSS could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.

2022-11-18 00:00:00+00:00,Will American Eagle (AEO) Q3 Earnings Beat Despite the Odds?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-american-eagle-aeo-q3-earnings-beat-despite-the-odds,,,"American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. AEO is expected to register declines in the top and bottom lines when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 22.

American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. price-eps-surprise | American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. Quote
Key Factors to Note
American Eagle’s fiscal third-quarter results are likely to reflect the continued impacts of the tough macro environment and changing consumer spending behavior. High inflation rates, increased gas prices and stronger-than-expected demand for other discretionary categories are expected to have marred the company’s fiscal third-quarter performance.

Moreover, the company’s fiscal third-quarter performance is likely to have been affected by tough year-over-year comparisons. On the last reported quarter’searnings call management noted that brand revenues had declined in high-single digits in the early part of the quarter due to exceptional growth and a record back-to-school season last year. Our estimate indicates a 6.3% decline in brand revenues for the fiscal third quarter, with an 11.3% decline for the American Eagle brand.

The company has been witnessing higher freight costs, and increased rent and delivery expenses, which have been denting the gross margin. Rising inflation and higher gas prices also remain concerning. Higher markdowns to clear inventory, increased freight costs and the impacts of supply-chain acquisitions are expected to have weighed on the company’s gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter.

On the last reported quarter’searnings call the company anticipated gross margin to be in the mid-30s for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 due to higher markdowns from increased promotions and seasonal clearance cadence. We estimate the gross margin for the fiscal third quarter to decline 920 bps to 35.1%.

On the last reported quarter’searnings call management expected continued freight inflation to dent margins throughout fiscal 2022. We expect the adjusted operating margin to decline to 5.9%, whereas the company reported 16.5% in the year-ago quarter.

However, continued strength in the Aerie brand and a solid online show bode well. Our estimate for the Aerie brand revenues reflects an increase of 8.5% for the fiscal third quarter.

Also, AEO is on track with the Real Power, Real Growth value-creation plan. Its third-quarter fiscal 2022 performance is expected to have benefited from the significant progress on its Real Power Real Growth value creation plan. The plan has been driving profitability through real estate and inventory-optimization efforts, omni-channel and customer focus, and investments to improve the supply chain. The company’s efforts under the plan have been aiding the recovery of the American Eagle brand.

Moreover, the company announced non-critical expense reductions, a hiring freeze and a reduction in capex in the last reported quarter to uplift its financial position. As part of this initiative, it expanded expense cuts in store payroll, corporate, professional services and advertising. As a result, the company expects SG&A expenses to be flat year over year for the second half of fiscal 2022. This indicates slight SG&A leverage in the to-be-reported quarter.

Smucker Company SJM is likely to register a top-line increase from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Nov 21. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $2,161 million, suggesting growth of 5.4% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter bottom line has risen by a penny in the past 30 days to $2.18 per share. However, this indicates a 10.3% decrease from the figure reported in the prior-year fiscal quarter.

The J. M. Smucker Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

The J. M. Smucker Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The J. M. Smucker Company Quote
Factors to Consider
The J. M. Smucker has been benefiting from positive net price realization, which was witnessed in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Net sales growth was mainly backed by positive net price realization in most of the company’s segments during the quarter.

Management’s sales guidance for fiscal 2023 reflects the positive impact of elevated net pricing to counter cost inflation in many categories. The J. M. Smucker is also benefiting from the revival of the Away from Home division.  Management’s sales guidance for fiscal 2023 includes the expectation of sustained momentum in the away-from-home channel. These aspects bode well for the quarter under review.

A focus on core priorities is also working well for The J. M. Smucker. These include driving commercial excellence, reshaping the portfolio, streamlining the cost structure and unleashing its organization to win. Strength in such strategies helps The J. M. Smucker navigate complex supply-chain challenges.

The company’s overall coffee portfolio looks encouraging as at-home coffee habits created during the pandemic and at-home consumption remain high. In the first quarter, net sales for Coffee grew 10%, backed by all brands in the company’s market-leading at-home coffee portfolio.

Moreover, SJM’s Folgers, Dunkin and Cafe Bustelo brands are doing particularly well, with K-Cup sustaining its solid momentum. These upsides are likely to have aided The J. M. Smucker in the quarter under review.

The J. M. Smucker is encountering cost inflation and supply-chain and transportation challenges. Further, the company recently initiated a voluntary recall of certain Jif peanut butter products made at its Lexington, KY facility and sold mainly in the United States. The move was a result of potential salmonella contamination.

Management’s EPS guidance for fiscal 2023 includes the expected impact of inflated costs, an expected volume/mix effect of the price elasticity of demand, an adverse impact of the product recall and elevated SD&A expenses. These factors raise concerns for the upcoming quarter.

Dollar Tree, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  Dollar Tree, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Dollar Tree, Inc. Quote
Factors to Consider
Dollar Tree’s third-quarter fiscal 2022 results are likely to have gained from continued demand for its products, resulting in sales growth and improved margins. The completion of the conversion of the Dollar Tree banner’s $1.25 price point initiative has been boosting the top line. This is expected to have persisted in the fiscal third quarter. Its Combo store and H2 renovation initiatives also bode well.

The company’s restructuring and expansion initiatives, including store openings and improvement of distribution centers, are likely to have boosted revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Dollar Tree has been on track to leverage Family Dollar and Dollar Tree distribution center systems, and combined merchandise.

The company’s digital and omni-channel capabilities, and same-day delivery service with Instacart are also expected to have driven traffic trends in the fiscal third quarter. The aforementioned factors instill optimism regarding the upcoming results.

On the last reported quarter’searnings call the company was optimistic about comps growth in the fiscal third quarter, driven by gains in both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments. Management predicted consolidated net sales of $6.75-$6.87 billion for third-quarter fiscal 2022, with enterprise same-store sales growth in the mid-single digits.

Dollar Tree’s margins are likely to have benefited from measures to control costs. Despite the continued increase in freight costs and SG&A expenses, the gross margin is expected to reflect gains from improved initial mark-on, and distribution and occupancy cost leverage.

However, on the last reported quarter’searnings call management announced plans to make competitive pricing investments in the Family Dollar chain to improve store productivity and profitability, which is anticipated to weigh on the gross margin in the second half of fiscal 2022. Additionally, the company expected inflationary pressures and an unfavorable product mix related to consumers’ shift toward lower-margin consumable products to continue in the second half.

The company expected gross and operating margins for the Family Dollar segment to remain pressured in the second half mainly due to the aforementioned pricing investments as well as the shift in consumer demand to consumables. Driven by the accelerated price investment, the company expects the Family Dollar segment to report a breakeven operating margin in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022 on a combined basis. This marks a decline from its first half’s margin of 2%.

Driven by these investments and the shift of consumers’ preference to more need-based consumable goods, the company expects the gross margin to be pressured in the second half of fiscal 2022. It anticipates earnings of $1.05-$1.20 per share for the fiscal third quarter.

DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. price-eps-surprise | DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. Quote
Factors to Note
DICK’S Sporting has been gaining from strength in its core strategies as well as a favorable product mix. The company’s favorable product mix was a result of its shift to higher-margin categories, including the reduction of its exposure to the hunting business. It has been benefitting from the favorable shift in consumer behavior to a healthy lifestyle.

DKS has also been on track with its store initiatives. Its earlier launched DICK'S House of Sport, Golf Galaxy Performance Center, Public Lands, and Going, Going, Gone! have been performing well. The two Golf Galaxy performance centers, featuring TrackMan and BioMech golf technologies, are likely to have acted as upsides. Progress on its store remodeling efforts is also expected to have aided its performance in the to-be-reported quarter.

However, the company has been reeling under the adverse impacts of the ongoing macroeconomic environment, supply-chain conditions and the current geopolitical situation. DKS has been witnessing higher supply-chain-related costs and rising fixed occupancy costs. These downsides are likely to have dented the fiscal third-quarter performance.

BBY is likely to register a decline in the top and the bottom line from the respective prior-year quarter’s reported numbers in its third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Nov 22, before the opening bell.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $10,292 million, indicating a 13.6% decrease from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Although the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has been stable in the past 30 days at $1.03 per share, the same suggests an above 50% plunge from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally.

We expect revenues to be down 13% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to $10,365 million and adjusted earnings to plunge 51.5% to $1.01 per share. Comparable sales are likely to decrease 12.6% in the quarter under review.

BBY delivered an earnings surprise of 22.2% in the last reported quarter. This specialty retailer of consumer products has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7%, on average.
Key Aspects to Note
Best Buy’s quarterly performance is likely to have been hurt by a challenging operating environment, including a volatile consumer electronics industry, inflation, supply-chain issues and softness in consumer demand. These factors coupled with increased consumer electronics industry’s promotional activity remain a headwind. Also, investments in the Totaltech initiative are likely to continue putting pressure on BBY’s margins. It has been witnessing lower sales across both its Domestic and International segments for a while.

On its lastearnings call management had expected soft margins and an SG&A rate deleverage for the fiscal third quarter stemming from a higher sales decline. For the fiscal third quarter, BBY had forecast comparable sales to drop slightly above the 12.1% decline seen in the fiscal second quarter.

Nonetheless, Best Buy has been undertaking cost-containment actions for a while to manage profitability. BBY’s focus on developing omnichannel capabilities, including buy online, pickup in-store services, curbside pickup or ship-from-store delivering products to customers, is encouraging.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

ANF is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 22, before the opening bell. The leading apparel retailer is expected to register declines in the top and bottom lines when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 numbers.

For fiscal third-quarter earnings, the consensus mark is pegged at a loss of 13 cents per share, implying a decline of 115.1% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure. The consensus estimate has moved down by a penny in the past 60 days.

In the last reported quarter, the company recorded a negative earnings surprise of 230.4%. ANF’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 163.1%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.
Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price and EPS Surprise
  Abercrombie & Fitch Company price-eps-surprise | Abercrombie & Fitch Company Quote
Abercrombie has been reeling under challenging environment and weakness in its Hollister brand, stemming from inflation and the shift in consumer preference. On its last reported quarter’searnings call management expected third-quarter fiscal 2022 net sales to decline in the high-single digits.

Higher product costs due to inflation and elevated digital fulfillment expenses are likely to have dented margins in the fiscal third quarter. For third-quarter fiscal 2022, the company anticipated a break-even operating margin mainly due to dismal sales and lower AURs.

The company has also been witnessing the adverse impacts of foreign currency. On its last reported quarter’s earnings report, management anticipated fiscal third-quarter sales to have a 220-bps impact from adverse currency rates.

However, ANF continues to benefit from strength across dresses, jeans and knits. Also, reduced promotional activity and higher tickets act as upsides. Its store optimization is also expected to have provided some cushion to the stock in the fiscal third quarter.
What the Zacks Model Unveils
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Abercrombie this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.

2022-11-17 00:00:00+00:00,Why Dollar Tree (DLTR) Might Surprise This Earnings Season,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-dollar-tree-dltr-might-surprise-this-earnings-season,,,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.
That is because Dollar Tree is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for DLTR in this report.
In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.24 per share for DLTR, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for DLTR, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 6.31% heading into earnings season.
Dollar Tree, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
Dollar Tree, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Dollar Tree, Inc. Quote
Why is this Important?
A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).
Given that DLTR has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.
Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Dollar Tree, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.

JD.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
JD.com, Inc. price-eps-surprise | JD.com, Inc. Quote
Factors to Note
JD.com’s JD Retail segment comprising the e-commerce business is expected to have been the key catalyst in the third quarter, courtesy of a strengthening momentum across lower-tier cities.

The growing traction across the supermarket category, especially FMCG and fresh produce, is likely to have contributed well to JD’s third-quarter performance.

Increasing traction among the beauty brands owing to the rising number of their flagship stores on JD.com is expected to have aided its momentum across customers in the quarter under review.

JD’s recent partnership with fashion and beauty brands like CELINE, Maison Margiela, Maison Kitsune, Moose Knuckles, GCDS, LA MER, ARMANI, Jo Malone London, Shiseido and M.A.C is expected to have contributed well to the upcoming results.

JD’s strong efforts in offering services at the best prices on the back of its scale and lower procurement costs from suppliers are expected to have benefited its third-quarter performance.

The strengthening of JD.com’s omnichannel offerings is also expected to get reflected in JD Retail’s revenue results.

JD.com’s intensified focus on ensuring the supply and distribution of essential products to customers amid the pandemic is anticipated to have significantly aided its quarterly performance.

The solid momentum of JD Health on the back of robust online pharmacy retail services and strong logistic support is likely to have aided JD in the to-be-reported quarter.

Strengthening of the JD Logistics business is anticipated to have driven JD.com’s quarterly performance.

However, JD.com’s mounting fulfillment expenses, including procurement, warehousing, delivery, customer service and payment processing expenses, are likely to have weighed on its third-quarter performance.

Rising marketing and R&D costs are expected to have hindered JD.com’s margin expansion. Further, uncertainties associated with the ongoing pandemic are likely to have been concerning for JD.
