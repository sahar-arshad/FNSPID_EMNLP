2022-05-15 00:00:00+00:00,3 Best Dividend Stocks for Retirement,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-best-dividend-stocks-for-retirement-2,,,"Passive income is perhaps the most attractive benefit a stock can offer for a retiree. When that's the main goal, the higher the dividend yields, the better. But that comes with a caveat: only as long as the stock is supported by an established, reliable company.
There are massively high dividends out there that come with risk, such as Annaly Capital Management, a mortgage real estate investment trust (mREIT) that yields more than 13%. Since it deals with mortgages, it's highly susceptible to interest rate changes. That makes it potentially inconsistent, which might suit a younger investor but not work as well for a retiree dependent on consistent income.
In addition, the best portfolio is a diversified one, so you'd want to spread your confidence among different industries and not only invest in REITs, for example. With those factors in mind, I recommend Realty Income (NYSE: O), Prudential Financial (NYSE: PRU), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG).
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Realty Income: A top REIT
Realty Income is a growing, high-yielding REIT that's about as dependable as REITs come. A REIT owns and rents properties and is structured in a way that it needs to pay out 90% of income as dividends, which is why REITs are typically sought-after passive income streams.
There are a few reasons why Realty Income is a top REIT. One is the sheer amount of properties it operates -- more than 11,000 (after acquiring fellow REIT VEREIT last year), making it one of the largest REITs in the world. It also typically works with large, secure chain stores in essential industries.
Those solid tenants proved their worth at the beginning of the pandemic when they were allowed to stay open and paid their rent while nonessential stores had to close, with some of them delaying rent payments or closing up shop altogether. Its top five tenants (by percentage of portfolio) are Walgreens, 7-Eleven, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, and FedEx.
However, Realty Income works with over 1,000 tenants in 70 industries. It maintains a nearly 99% occupancy rate, and the average weighted remaining lease for its tenants is almost nine years, putting in a strong long-term position.
In the first quarter, net income per share improved from $0.26 to $0.34, and adjusted funds from operations, a standard metric for evaluating REIT performance, increased 47% year over year to $1.02. As for its dividend, it pays a monthly dividend and has done so for 621 months consecutively, including 98 quarterly increases.
Its dividend yields 4.5%, and retirees don't need to look any further than this for a stable, consistent dividend.
2. Prudential Financial: A financial powerhouse
Prudential is a financial services company that offers insurance policies, retirement plans, and general investing services for individuals. It's one of the oldest companies in the U.S., going back to 1875, and it prides itself on its stability -- so much so that its logo is the Rock of Gibraltar, although many people just recognize it as the Prudential rock. The company has more than $1.6 trillion in assets under management, with its largest presence in the U.S., although it operates globally.
As a financial services company, Prudential is highly susceptible to interest rate changes. That came through clearly in the first quarter, when it posted a loss of $31 million, after net income of more than $2 billion last year. However, this cash-rich company keeps a steady load on its balance sheet, with more than $16 billion at the end of the first quarter, and nearly $520 billion in equity and bonds.
This isn't a growth company, and investors shouldn't expect high gains from its stock. That's why it's incredibly cheap, trading at less than 6 times trailing 12-month earnings. What they can expect is a super-reliable dividend that yields 4.6% at the current price, has been raised for the past 14 years, and should provide years of passive income.
3. Procter & Gamble: All your household essentials
Procter & Gamble markets household products under many of your favorite brand names, such as Tide laundry detergent, Bounty paper towels, and Oral-B dental hygiene. It's even older than Prudential -- around since 1837. The company took in $79 billion in trailing 12-month sales, and fiscal third-quarter sales (ended March 31) increased 7% year over year. So while it's an established essentials giant, it's still managing to increase its presence and capture market share.
Like most companies, Procter & Gamble has had to deal with increased costs due to inflation and supply chain backups. However, it has been able to successfully navigate these difficulties with price increases and cost-cutting. One of the advantages of being a large, stable company is the ability to leverage relationships and processes to manage challenges, which is why Procter & Gamble is a compelling stock to own.
The other reason is the dividend. Not only is Procter & Gamble a Dividend King, but it has one of the longest streaks of annual dividend raises on the market at 66 years.
Its stock yields 2.3% at the current price, the lowest on this list. That has decreased as the price per share has risen.
PG Dividend Yield data by YCharts
Procter & Gamble's dividend in the kind you can count on without thinking about, making it an excellent choice for retirees.

2022-05-10 00:00:00+00:00,This Leading Discount Retailer is Trouncing the Market,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-leading-discount-retailer-is-trouncing-the-market,,,"There aren’t many stocks that are widely outperforming the market this year. With the exception of energy names, it’s been a rough go for equities in 2022 – particularly for growth and technology names. As costs have spiked for businesses, it’s become increasingly difficult given a 40-year high in inflation for even the leading discount retailers and other low-cost stores to maintain prices at a fixed level.
Tomorrow morning we’ll get a glimpse into April’s inflation reading when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the CPI data. The median forecast calls for an 8.1% increase in consumer prices year-over-year, a slight slowdown from March’s 8.5% figure. Lower-than-expected numbers may signal an easing of supply chain issues which could lead to cooler consumer prices, while hotter inflation prints may exaggerate the move even further.
Discount retailers primarily sell low-margin consumables such as food, household staples, and seasonal goods. It becomes more challenging for these companies to hold costs low when their own costs are skyrocketing. That’s why it’s very important – particularly in this type of market environment – to identify businesses that are able to pass on these increased costs to consumers without any negative effects.
One of the more defensive businesses, discount retailers are consumer staples that are fairly resilient. The leaders in this space exhibit high pricing power. They can pass on rising costs without losing much volume at all. These defensive companies tend to fare better during inflationary periods and market downturns.
Let’s take a deeper look at a leading discount retailer that is outpacing the market. This company is part of the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry, which ranks in the top 24% out of approximately 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. By targeting stocks within the top industry groups, we can dramatically improve our odds of success.
Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR)
Dollar Tree operates discount variety retail stores. The company is the largest single-price-point retailer in North America. DLTR provides consumable products such as food and personal care items, household paper and chemicals, health and beauty items, as well as clothing and other fashion accessories.  Dollar Tree was founded in 1986 and is headquartered in Chesapeake, VA.
DLTR was the last major dollar store chain that kept prices at $1 or under before raising prices to $1.25 several months ago. The company acquired Family Dollar back in 2015 to expand its retail reach; it now operates over 16,000 stores in 48 states and five Canadian provinces.
DLTR has been on a hot streak in terms of earnings surprises, exceeding estimates in each of the past nine quarters. The retailer chain most recently posted Q4 EPS back in March of $2.01, a +12.29% surprise over the $1.79 consensus. DLTR has posted a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of +11.76%, helping shares advance 36.22% higher in the past year. The stock is up over 12% this year while most stocks have been in bear market territory.
Dollar Tree, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
Analysts covering DLTR have upped their Q1 EPS estimates by +2.56% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $2.00, translating to potential growth of 25% relative to the same quarter last year. Sales are expected to have risen 4.05% in first quarter to $6.74 billion.
Make sure to keep an eye on this leading discount retailer that is bucking the overall downtrend of the market.

Bitcoin, Like the Internet Itself, Could Change Everything
Blockchain and cryptocurrency has sparked one of the most exciting discussion topics of a generation. Some call it the “Internet of Money” and predict it could change the way money works forever. If true, it could do to banks what Netflix did to Blockbuster and Amazon did to Sears. Experts agree we’re still in the early stages of this technology, and as it grows, it will create several investing opportunities.
Zacks’ has just revealed 3 companies that can help investors capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.

2022-05-06 00:00:00+00:00,"MercadoLibre (MELI) Q1 Earnings Miss, Revenues Rise Y/Y",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mercadolibre-meli-q1-earnings-miss-revenues-rise-y-y,,,"MercadoLibre, Inc. MELI reported first-quarter 2022 earnings of $1.30 per share, which compares favorably with the year-ago loss of 68 cents per share. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 21.7%.

The company’s revenues surged 63% on a year-over-year basis (67% on an FX-neutral basis) to $2.25 billion. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01 billion.

The total revenues were driven by accelerating commerce and fintech revenues, which grew 44% and 113% year over year to $1.3 billion and $971 million, respectively.

Increasing total payments volume (TPV), courtesy of the robust Mercado Pago, aided the company.

MercadoLibre’s rising gross merchandise volume (GMV), owing to increasing mobile GMV, remained another positive.

Strong shipment growth on MercadoEnvios and the growing penetration of managed networks in the reported quarter were tailwinds.

Strengthening momentum across Mercado Fondo and Mercado Credito also benefited the company.

The market tried to find its footing after a brutal day on Thursday and following the jobs report on Friday morning. With all of that in mind, let’s look at a few top stock trades as earnings continue to trickle in.
Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Block (SQ)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Earlier this year, Block (NYSE:SQ) gave us a perfect dip down to the $83 breakout before a monstrous bounce sent it back up toward $150. Now that rally has fizzled out, sending shares back below $100.
On a further dip, let’s see how Block handles the $83 to $87 area. The lower end of the range is prior breakout level and the upper end is the 78.6% retracement. A breakdown and close below this area may put more pressure on Block.
However, a break of this zone and a reclaim of it could open the door for a nice reversal.

On the upside, however, watch $100. Back above it could open the door to the declining 21-week moving average, which was stout resistance on that big rally in March.
Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Dollar Tree (DLTR)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Believe it or not, there are a handful of stocks that continue to trade well. Dollar Tree (NYSE:DLTR) is among the group and you can see it in today’s action.
Specifically, I was looking for a break of this week’s low at $160.15 and a tag of the 10-week and 50-day moving averages, followed by a bounce back above $160.15.
That allows traders to get long on the reclaim at $160.15 and use a stop just below Friday’s low at $157.85.
On the upside, though, I’d love to see $166 to $167 as a potential trim zone. Above that puts $170 to $171 in play as the next trim zone. That’s followed by $175 to $177.
Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Cloudflare (NET)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
I don’t know how else to say it, but Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) is a top-tier growth name. Unfortunately, the stock has been crushed as it’s caught up in the bear market of growth stocks.
Longs who bought Friday morning’s dip can use a stop-loss near $58 or $59. While that’s $10 below current levels, it’s only a few dollars below Friday morning’s low, near the current support zone in the low $60s and the 78.6% retracement at $59.26. So, where traders buy is important.
On a bounce, the $80 area is back in play. Back above $86 and the $100 level could be on the table. Keep in mind, trading growth stocks has been a nightmare for many investors, so don’t dabble in this arena if the risk is too wide.

As the old saying goes, “I’d rather wish I was in a trade than wish I was out of it.”
Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Under Armour (UAA)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) got steam-rolled today — shocker. It’s been a mess out there and this is not a name I plan on working with personally.
I’d rather be a buyer of high-quality but distressed stocks — Nike (NYSE:NKE) is down 35% from the high and trading into its 200-week moving average — or trading some of the relative strength names, like DLTR.
On the downside for UAA stock, watch $10. A break of this level could put the $7.50 to $8 area in play, which were the lows in Q1 and Q2 2020.
On the upside, however, a recapture of $11.50 and the 78.6% retracement could give longs a potential reversal, with the new risk level being at whatever the low ends up being after $11.50 is reclaimed.
That would put $13.70 in play, followed by a potential push to the $14.75 to $15 zone.

SBH reported drab second-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with the top and the bottom line missing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Net sales and earnings declined year over year. The company witnessed more-than-anticipated pressure on the top line as inflation and supply-chain related challenges escalated in the second half of the quarter.

Sally Beauty continues to focus on its four strategic growth pillars. These include leveraging the digital platform, driving loyalty and personalization, undertaking product innovation and enhancing the supply chain.
Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. Quote
 Q2 in Detail
Sally Beauty reported adjusted earnings of 47 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents. The metric declined from 57 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.

Consolidated net sales of $911.4 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $947.1 million. The metric dropped 1.6% year over year, with an impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 50 basis points (bps) on consolidated net sales. Comparable sales inched up 0.2%. The company operated 142 fewer stores compared with the year-ago quarter’s levels.

The company’s global e-commerce sales came in at $81 million, reflecting 8.9% of consolidated net sales.

Consolidated gross profit came in at $465.3 million, down 0.4% from $467.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted gross margin expanded 20 bps to 51.4%, thanks to increased product margins at Sally Beauty and Beauty Systems Group. These were somewhat offset by increased distribution and freight costs. The unfavorable sales mix shift between the greater margin Sally U.S. and lower margin Sally international operations was a downside.

Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses came in at $378 million, up $15.8 million thanks to higher cost pressures from labor and expenses associated with the re-opening of international territories shut last year. These were somewhat offset by reduced variable and accrued bonus expenses. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A expenses stood at 41.5%, up from 39.1% reported in the year-ago quarter.

Adjusted operating earnings decreased to $90.2 million from $112.1 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating margin contracted from 12.1% to 9.9% in the second quarter.
Segment Details

During the second quarter, the company provided cash flow from operations of $2.9 million. Capital expenditures came in at $17.7 million during this time.
Fiscal 2022 Outlook
Taking into account the volatile macro environment like the impact of inflationary pressures and significant supply chain challenges, management revised its fiscal 2022 guidance. Sally Beauty expects fiscal 2022 net sales to be flat to drop 2% year over year. Earlier, the metric was anticipated to grow 3-4% in fiscal 2022.

Net store count is anticipated to decline in the range of 1-2%, reflecting management’s focus on optimizing the store portfolio. The gross margin is likely to expand 40-60 bps year over year. The adjusted operating margin is envisioned to come in at 11%.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.
Right now, both Dollar Tree and Burlington Stores are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.
DLTR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.97, while BURL has a forward P/E of 29.50. We also note that DLTR has a PEG ratio of 1.35. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. BURL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.24.
Another notable valuation metric for DLTR is its P/B ratio of 4.83. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, BURL has a P/B of 18.74.
These metrics, and several others, help DLTR earn a Value grade of B, while BURL has been given a Value grade of C.
Both DLTR and BURL are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that DLTR is the superior value option right now.

2022-04-19 00:00:00+00:00,"Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-inc.-dltr-soars-to-52-week-high-time-to-cash-out,,,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Dollar Tree (DLTR)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 11% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $174.35 in the previous session. Dollar Tree has gained 22.4% since the start of the year compared to the -11.5% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the -0.4% return for the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry.
What's Driving the Outperformance?
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on March 2, 2022, Dollar Tree reported EPS of $2.01 versus consensus estimate of $1.79 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0.69%.
For the current fiscal year, Dollar Tree is expected to post earnings of $7.91 per share on $27.8 billion in revenues. This represents a 36.38% change in EPS on a 5.63% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.84 per share on $29.29 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 11.86% and 5.37%, respectively.
Valuation Metrics
Dollar Tree may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.
On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.
Dollar Tree has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.
In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 21.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 21.2X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 18.9X versus its peer group's average of 17.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.4. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Dollar Tree currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Dollar Tree passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Dollar Tree shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.

TJX benefits from efforts to enhance offline and online businesses. The leading off-price retailer’s HomeGoods segment has been aiding for a while. However, the company is not immune to rising cost inflation. In addition, unfavorable foreign currency translation might be a threat.  

Let’s discuss.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
What’s Aiding The TJX Companies?
With more consumers resorting to online shopping, The TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen its e-commerce business. In its lastearnings call management highlighted that it is impressed with the sales growth of e-commerce businesses in 2021. During the year, the company introduced new categories and brands to all its online banners while launching shopping on homegoods.com.

The TJX Companies is benefiting from its solid store enhancement efforts. Management has been expanding its footprint rapidly in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia. During fiscal 2022, the company increased its store count by 117 stores to reach 4,689 stores. Management expects to incur capital expenditures in the range of $1.7-$1.9 billion for fiscal 2023. This will be spent on opening new stores, remodels, relocations and investments in distribution, network and infrastructure. The TJX Companies is optimistic about its capabilities to provide fresh spring merchandise to its stores and online.

The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s HomeGoods segment has been seeing robust demand for quite some time now. Owing to store closures amid the pandemic, management had come up with a temporary new sales measure — open-only compstore sales — to offer a better view. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, open-only comp-store sales surged 22% in the HomeGoods (U.S.) segment from fiscal 2020 levels. Management highlighted that it witnessed consistent strength in every key category and geographic region for HomeGoods and HomeSense through fiscal 2022. We note thatThe TJX Companies launched homegoods.com in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The company expects to offer impressive home fashion products at great value on its digital platform with this launch.
Cost Hurdles To Stay
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, The TJX Companies’ consolidated pretax profit margin came in at 9%, down 1.9 percentage points from fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 levels. Management highlighted that additional investment to expand distribution capacity and wage hikes hurt margins. In addition, net pandemic-induced expenses hurt the pretax margin by 0.5 percentage points. Merchandise margin in the quarter was affected by rising freight expenses. In its lastearnings call management highlighted that it expects expense headwinds to persist for fiscal 2023 compared with the fiscal 2022 level. It anticipates first-quarter fiscal 2023 to be most pressured with incremental freight expenses. The company also expects escalated wage costs to affect the fiscal first-quarter pretax margin.

Well, it is yet to be seen if strength in its HomeGoods unit along with other growth efforts can help The TJX Companies sustain its growth amid a rising cost environment. TJX’s stock has declined 8.5% in the past three months against the industry’s 11.3% growth.
Hot Retail Bets
Here are some better-ranked stocks — Target Corporation TGT, Costco Wholesale Corporation COST and Dollar Tree DLTR.

2022-04-14 00:00:00+00:00,7 Inflation Resistant Stocks to Buy Now,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-inflation-resistant-stocks-to-buy-now,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Dollar Tree (DLTR): High inflation is helping this discount retailer deliver solid earnings growth.
Mondelez International (MDLZ): The market may be overestimating how much inflation will impact this snack company’s future results.
Altria Group (MO): Inelastic demand for tobacco products enables this cigarette giant to pass rising costs onto its customers.
Nutrien Ltd. (NTR): Investors may be underestimating how long high prices for potash and nitrogen will last.
UnitedHealth Group (UNH): Recession and inflation-resistant, this healthcare powerhouse will continue to report strong results.
VICI Properties (VICI): The casino landlord has inflation-protection baked into its lease agreements.
ExxonMobil (XOM): Continued high inflation means high oil prices.
With the latest consumer price index coming in at a staggering 8.5%, it’s safe to say inflation is something that remains top of mind. Not just among U.S. households, squeezed by a higher cost of living. As this issue continues, investors are on the lookout for inflation resistant stocks. Such names stand to thrive in this environment.
Sure, you may think it’s too late to start diving into inflation plays today. Many of the stocks listed below have already gone up by meaningful amounts in recent months. With some commentators stating that inflation has peaked, you may be concerned you’re getting into these names too late, and at too high of a price.
7 Stocks to Add to Your April Must-Buy List
Then again, maybe not. Even as there’s hope it will not continue to get worse from here, it may be a while before it falls back to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. With this, these seven inflation resistant stocks likely have more runway:

Inflation Resistant Stocks: Dollar Tree (DLTR)
Source: shutterstock.com/Jonathan Weiss
Up nearly 22% in 2022, Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) has seen a boost from its inflation-resistant bona fides. This discount retailer  is expected to see meaningful earnings growth this year. Rising prices are driving consumers to its stores, instead of pricier retail options.
Per analyst consensus, the company is expected to earn around $7.97 per share this fiscal year (ending January 2023). That’s a big jump from the $5.80 per share in earnings reported for DLTR stock in FY22 (ending January 2022).
But while it’s popped on the prospect of high inflation giving its earnings a jolt, that’s not to say it’s too late to buy. Shares continue to sport a reasonable valuation (forward price-earnings ratio of 21.2). Better yet, high earnings growth is expected to carry on into the next fiscal year (up another 13.2%, to $9.02 per share).
Mondelez International (MDLZ)

Back in November, it was uncertain whether Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) could pass rising costs onto the consumer. The confectionary and snack foods giant (owners of brands like Cadbury, Oreo and Ritz) raised its prices in order to account for higher costs (ingredients, labor and shipping).
So far, inflation has had a moderate impact on its operating performance. Back in January, The company reported a slight quarterly earnings miss. MDLZ stock pulled back sharply in late February/early March, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Considering all this, you may think it’s odd I would consider it one of the inflation resistant stocks.
Even so, while it is not exactly crushing it today, the market may have priced in inflation headwinds too much into Mondelez shares. The company’s price increases only kicked in starting late last year. It’s possible the company’s profitability figures improve as 2022 plays out.
Altria Group (MO)
Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.com
If you’re OK with the controversy surrounding its business (tobacco products), there are many reasons to like Altria Group (NYSE:MO) stock. For starters, it’s a value play, with a low forward P/E ratio (11.3). It’s also a high-yield stock, sporting a 6.5% dividend yield. Not to mention, it’s also a low volatility stock.
Along with these positives, Altria, parent company of Marlboro maker Philip Morris USA, it’s an inflation resistant name as well. Cigarettes benefit from inelastic demand. This company is able to pass along rising costs onto its consumers.
Investors this year have quickly caught on to the appeal of owning this sin stock lately. So far in 2022, MO stock is up by double digits, and has recently hit a new multi-year high.
That said, Atria is still cheap, still offering a high dividend yield, and with modest earnings growth. Consider it a buy.
Inflation Resistant Stocks: Nutrien Ltd. (NTR)
Source: Pavel Kapysh/ShutterStock.com
Supply shocks stemming from the Russia/Ukraine conflict have been a boon for shares in Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR). A major producer of potash, nitrogen and other crop nutrients, this Canada-based company stands to see a big earnings windfall.
Earnings per share for NTR stock is expected to more than double this year, from $6.23 to $13.68. Not surprisingly, shares have already skyrocketed ahead of this happening. Since the start of Russia’s invasion, the stock has bolted from around $75 per share to around $110.
Given fertilizer prices could come back down, it makes sense to be concerned high-flying Nutrien could fall back down to earth. But with no end in sight for the war, and other factors playing a role in high crop nutrient prices, Nutrien’s earnings could stay elevated for longer-than-expected. This could give the stock more runway.
UnitedHealth Group (UNH)
Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com
Just like how it’s a recession-resistant sector, healthcare is also a sector resistant to inflationary pressures. This explains why so many have already rotated into healthcare stocks, including UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) stock.
Yet like many of the inflation-resistant stocks listed above, it may not be too late to make it a buy. A diversified provider of health insurance and related services, it’s long been a top-performing stock. It has a forward valuation (24.7x) that you can say is pricey relative to peers. Still, paying up for this high quality name could just well be worth it.
Recession and inflation-resistant, UnitedHealth Group stands to continue delivering strong earnings growth. Analyst estimates call for EPS to rise around 13.6% this year, and around 14.1% next year.
Strong performance, even during tough times, will likely pave the way for solid gains for investors buying into the stock today.
VICI Properties (VICI)
Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock
A casino real estate investment trust, VICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) may at first seem like an odd name to include on this list. After all, isn’t high inflation, and the possibility of a recession, bad news for consumer discretionary sectors like gaming?
Yes, these factors could mean trouble ahead for gaming operators. Yet for the company leasing them real estate to conduct gaming, the impact may not be so severe. The rents collected from its casino tenants are not based on how well the house is winning (or losing). In fact, even during the lockdown period, when casinos were closed, casino tenants continued to pay their rent.
Also, as my InvestorPlace colleague Tezcan Gecgil pointed out last month, 97% of its rental agreements have escalators based on CPI. That means the ability to keep up with inflation, maintaining (and perhaps someday, growing) its current dividend payout (5.1% yield).
Inflation Resistant Stocks: ExxonMobil (XOM)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
When talking about stocks to buy to ride out high inflation, you can’t forget oil & gas plays. There are many options out there, but sticking with a well-known name like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) may be the way to go.
XOM stock has seen a big run-up in price over the past two years. First, due to oil’s post-pandemic recovery. Oil’s comeback enabled it to maintain, and slightly grow, its dividend. Then, due to Russia tailwinds sending crude oil prices to as much as $126.42 per barrel.  As oil has pulled back, you may think you have missed the boat.
Yet if high inflation persists, oil prices will likely remain high. The market may be assuming oil will “return to normal” much sooner. Also, as Louis Navellier argued earlier this month, the company’s cost-cutting and capital allocation strategy could create shareholder value, no matter where oil prices go from here.

2022-04-08 00:00:00+00:00,Best Stocks To Invest In Right Now? 5 Consumer Staples Stocks To Know,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/best-stocks-to-invest-in-right-now-5-consumer-staples-stocks-to-know,,,"Should You Add These Top Consumer Staples Stocks To Your April 2022 Watchlist?
As we tread through a volatile stock market, some investors may consider rotating into more defensive stocks. This is where consumer staples stocks enter the picture. Consumer staples, such as food items and household supplies, will always be in demand. Because of that, consumer staples stocks tend to offer investors more stability as compared to growth and tech stocks. Even now, when inflation is high, consumers will still need to purchase these everyday essentials. Hence, the sector often comes to mind for investors looking for a safe haven.
A prime example of a consumer staples stock is Walmart (NYSE: WMT). On Tuesday, the company announced the expansion of its Walmart Health centers. The company will be opening five new centers across North and Central Florida, making health care more accessible to the local community. Elsewhere, we have tobacco and cigarette producer Altria (NYSE: MO). Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) recently upgraded the company to a “buy”. Goldman says that, when compared to its competitors, Altria is in a better position thanks to its defensive, domestic-focused business. And on that note, watch out for these top consumer staples stocks in the stock market today.

General Mills, on March 23, reported its results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022.

2022-04-07 00:00:00+00:00,May 27th Options Now Available For Dollar Tree,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/may-27th-options-now-available-for-dollar-tree,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options begin trading today, for the May 27th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new May 27th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $155.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $155.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $148.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $157.26/share today.
Because the $155.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.52% return on the cash commitment, or 32.97% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $155.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $160.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.15. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $157.26/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $160.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.29% if the stock gets called away at the May 27th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $160.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $160.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.55% boost of extra return to the investor, or 33.19% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 254 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $157.26) to be 36%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-04-07 00:00:00+00:00,Two “Perfect 10” Consumer Goods Stocks to Fight Inflation,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/two-perfect-10-consumer-goods-stocks-to-fight-inflation,,,"Imagine making investment decisions in an ideal world with the absence of war, favorable interest rates, demand-supply equilibrium, and enough disposable income at consumers' discretion to spend on goods and services. One would have a plethora of stocks to invest in with an appealing risk-reward appetite.
Now, coming back to the reality of a slew of uncertain economic factors and limited resources, investors are fraught with making the right investment choices that suit their palate.
Don’t worry! TipRanks has the perfect solution to the problem. The TipRanks Smart Score tool gives investors a simple way to gauge a stock’s performance. This is a data-driven score that evaluates a stock based on eight key market factors. Six of these are based on TipRanks’ unique data and take into consideration Wall Street analyst consensus; whether hedge funds are buying or selling shares; what the companies’ insiders are up to on the open market; and the opinion of financial bloggers, along with technical and fundamental indicators.
Notably, since 2016, Top Smart Score stocks (available only to TipRanks Premium Members) with a “Perfect 10” score have significantly outperformed the S&P 500, generating an alpha of 76.1% over the index, indicating that at volatile times, stocks with the maximum Smart Score offer market protection.
Let’s look at two consumer goods stocks with a Smart Score of “Perfect 10,"" which implies that these stocks are some of the best bets in the sector at current times.
Lowe’s Companies (LOW)
Lowe’s is a home improvement retailer with operations in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. With the pandemic-mandated stay-at-home practices, the retailer witnessed a boom in the demand for its offerings as consumers spent more time in the convenience of their homes.
The stock has lost 21.2% year-to-date amid a broader market sell-off, and gained more than 5% over the past year. The company boasts of over 19 million customer transactions per week through more than 2,200 home improvement and hardware stores.
In its upbeat Q4 results, the company beat expectations on both the revenue and earnings fronts and also raised guidance for full-year Fiscal 2022.
A rising interest rate scenario deters the home buying interests of consumers, albeit the effects will not be visible in the short term but will roll over in the longer term. However, millennials continue to rent out homes at an accelerated pace, which also boosts industry growth.
With the spring season kicking off soon, the retailer is expecting a resurgence in demand for its offerings. Lowe’s typically organizes its Lowe's SpringFest event, where customers are welcomed to best-in spring products, virtual experiences, and DIY tours to beautify their homes.
As per Statista, the U.S. home improvement market size in 2021 stood at $538 billion, and by 2025 the market size is expected to grow north of $620 billion, representing a huge opportunity for the players in the sector.
Undoubtedly, Home Depot (HD) is the largest player in the space and Lowe's biggest competitor. Lowe’s currently trades at 1.48x sales, higher than the industry average of 0.96x sales, but lower than HD’s multiple of 2.13x sales.
Wall Street analysts are highly optimistic about the LOW stock, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys and two Holds. The average Lowe’s price forecast of $275.77 implies 37.4% upside potential to current levels.  
Lowe's Stock Analysis
Remarkably, according to TipRanks’ Smart Score, Lowe’s scores a “Perfect 10,"" indicating that the stock is highly likely to outperform the market.
Bloggers and news articles are bullish on the stock. Meanwhile, in the last quarter, hedge funds bought 2.0 million shares of LOW stock, and retail investors have increased their exposure to the stock by 7.1%, indicating an inclination towards the retailer’s future performance.
Dollar Tree (DLTR)
Dollar Tree is an American discount retailer that traditionally sells products for $1 or less across the U.S. and Canada. The company operates more than 16,000 stores under the brands Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, and Dollar Tree Canada. The company’s offerings include quality everyday merchandise such as candy and food, housewares, seasonal goods, health and beauty care, stationery, toys, party goods, and other consumer items.
Surprisingly, the DLTR stock has gained 10.6% year-to-date even amid the broader market sell-off. Similarly, the stock has gained more than 33% during the past year.
The retailer reported mixed Q4FY21 results, with earnings topping expectations and sales missing expectations. Furthermore, the retailer’s guidance for FY22 also provided a mixed outlook, with earnings above and revenue below analysts’ estimates.
Hit by the historically high inflation and absence of state cash stimulus, which incentivized shoppers last year, the company decided to move its price range for its majority of product lines to $1.25 in the U.S. Additionally, DLTR also continues to expand its $3 and $5 Plus assortment in its stores to skirt the diminishing margins.
Moreover, the company also noted that persistent supply chain and logistics issues have raised the prices it pays to move the products to stores, further hitting their bottom lines.
Although the move has helped boost the retailer’s margins, it has also driven away consumers to competitors like Dollar General (DG). Currently, DLTR trades at 1.35x sales, above the industry median of 0.96x, but below the multiple of DG of 1.57x, making it a cheaper investment option.
Notably, Wall Street analysts have awarded the DLTR stock a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys and two Holds. The average Dollar Tree price forecast of $173.33 implies 11.1% upside potential to current levels.
Dollar Tree Stock Analysis
Furthermore, according to TipRanks’ Smart Score, Dollar Tree scores a “Perfect 10,” indicating that the stock is highly likely to outperform the market.
Bloggers and news articles are bullish on the stock. Meanwhile, in the last quarter, hedge funds bought 3.6 million shares of DLTR stock, and retail investors increased their exposure to the stock by 8.3%. Even corporate insiders have bought 66.3K shares of the stock over the last three months, reflecting optimism about the company’s future potential.
Bargaining Points
Although the ongoing geopolitical environment and rising inflationary pressures are changing consumer behavioral patterns, both Lowe’s and Dollar Tree offer comforting insights, according to the TipRanks Smart Score tool.
With a proven track record of generating above-average market returns, investors can safely invest in the Top Smart Score Stocks in the TipRanks universe to protect their investment in the volatile market.

Product cost inflation, tight labor market and supply-chain bottlenecks are some of the headwinds that players in the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry have been encountering of late. Also, the lack of stimulus checks this year could result in a drop in demand.
That said, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investment to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corp., Target Corp., Dollar General Corp. and Dollar Tree, Inc..
About the Industry
The Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, arts and crafts supplies, toys, and seasonal décor products. These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both.
Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.
3 Key Retail-Discount Stores Industry Trends
Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled a number of players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs.
Apart from these, any deleverage in SG&A rate, higher labor and occupancy costs, and increased marketing and other store-related expenses might build pressure on margins. Meanwhile, the impact of additional employee payments and benefits along with investments undertaken to preserve the safety and health of customers and team members amid the coronavirus crisis cannot be ruled out. For now, the industry is dealing with supply-chain bottlenecks, rising freight charges and labor shortages.
Consumers Seek Better Bargains Amid Inflation: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices. Under the current circumstances, people in the low-to-middle income groups have been showing a preference for discount stores to get quality products at reasonable prices.
Industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Clearly, companies are leaving no stone unturned to tap any surge in demand unless derailed by elevated inflation and looming COVID-19 impacts. We also believe that failure to restock inventory at fair prices or delay getting the products delivered to consumers' doorsteps could compound retailers' woes.
Digitization is Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Apart from upgrading digitally, companies are coming up with unique products and better deals. Initiatives such as building omni-channel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store are worth mentioning.
Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers' product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.
Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak Prospects
The Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #174, which places it in the bottom 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.
The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.
