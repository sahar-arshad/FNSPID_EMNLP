Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Dollar General remains a compelling growth story in the retail space. Thanks to its value-creating initiatives, defensive product mix and real estate growth strategy, DG has the capabilities to gain market share. Its commitment to better pricing, private label offerings, effective inventory management and merchandise initiative should drive sales.
We also remain encouraged by Dollar General’s host of initiatives such as DG Fresh, Fast Track, non-consumables, digitization and private fleet that should yield same-store sales growth and margin expansion. We expect same-store sales to increase 3.5% and 3% in fiscal 2022 and 2023, respectively.
DG has an Earnings ESP of +1.04%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 13.6% for the current year (ending January 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.3% over the last 30 days.
Dollar General recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 2.8%. The company is set to release earnings results on Aug 25, before the opening bell.
Dollar Tree has benefited from the completion of the $1.25 multi-price point initiative at the Dollar Tree stores, as well as robust margins, despite the increase in freight costs and SG&A expenses.
Following the robust first-quarter fiscal 2022 performance, DLTR raised its guidance for fiscal 2022 and provided a decent second-quarter view. In first-quarter fiscal 2022, Dollar Tree reported the tenth straight quarter of earnings beat.
DLTR has an Earnings ESP of +1.75%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 40.7% for the current year (ending January 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.1% over the last 7 days.
Dollar Tree recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 13.1%. The company is set to release earnings results on Aug 25, before the opening bell.
Ulta Beauty has been benefiting from its omnichannel strength. Also, the skincare category has been gaining from consumers’ rising interest in self-care. ULTA’s solid performance was backed by the strong execution of its strategies and solid guest demand, with the latter gaining from exciting brand launches.
Also, increased in-person activities and travel have been leading to the revival of the beauty category demand. All major categories delivered double-digit comp sales growth. Encouragingly, Ulta Beauty raised its fiscal 2022 view.
ULTA has an Earnings ESP of +4.07%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.5% over the last 7 days. Ulta Beauty recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 49.8%. The company is set to release earnings results on Aug 25, after the closing bell.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is benefiting from strong executions in clearing backlogs and increasing customer acceptance. HPE’s efforts to shift focus to higher margin offerings are aiding its bottom-line results. Additionally, HPE’s target of saving at least $800 million annually by fiscal 2022-end through cost optimization plan is a positive.
Moreover, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s multi-billion-dollar investment plan across expanding networking capabilities will help diversify business from server and hardware storage markets, and boost margins over the long run.
HPE has an Earnings ESP of +1.05%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 3.1% for the current year (ending October 2022). Hewlett Packard Enterprise recorded earnings surprises in three out of the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 7.8%. The company is set to release earnings results on Aug 30, after the closing bell.
Chewy engages in the pure play e-commerce business in the United States. CHWY provides pet food and treats, pet supplies and pet medications, and other pet-health products, as well as pet services for dogs, cats, fish, birds, small pets, horses, and reptiles through its www.chewy.com retail Website, as well as its mobile applications.
CHWY has an Earnings ESP of +1.03%. Chewy recorded earnings surprises in two out of the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 4.1%. The company is set to release earnings results on Aug 30, after the closing bell.

2022-08-22 00:00:00+00:00,What to Expect Ahead of NetApp's (NTAP) Q1 Earnings Release?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-to-expect-ahead-of-netapps-ntap-q1-earnings-release,,,"NetApp NTAP is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Aug 24.

The company projects the fiscal first-quarter non-GAAP earnings to be between $1.05 and $1.15 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.10 per share, suggesting an decline of 4.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.

The company expects net revenues in the range of $1.475-$1.625 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.55 billion, suggesting growth of 6.4% year over year.

The company beat estimates in all of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.6%, on average.
NetApp, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  NetApp, Inc. price-eps-surprise | NetApp, Inc. Quote
 Factors to Note
NetApp’s strengthening go-to-market activities, various cloud collaborations and continued product innovation amid a robust demand environment are likely to have acted as tailwinds. NetApp specializes in providing cloud services, systems and software to business organizations to aid them in optimally operating their applications from the data center to cloud. The continuation of work from home and hybrid work innovation are other driving factors.

Strength in the company’s object storage and all-flash business is expected to have contributed to the Hybrid Cloud segment’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Software product revenues are likely to have gained from the favorable mix shift to the all-flash portfolio.

For the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Hybrid Cloud segment’s revenues is pegged at $1.41 billion.

Growing clout of Spot by NetApp portfolio might have aided the Public Cloud services business along with strong demand for other cloud solutions like Azure NetApp files, Cloud Volumes and Cloud Insights services. Spot by NetApp facilitates enterprises to make multi-cloud management easier and lower expenses at the same time.  Incremental gains from an uptick in the company’s NetApp Astra solution and NetApp ONTAP data management software might have favored the top line.

In the last reported quarter, Public Cloud Services recorded annualized recurring revenues (ARR) of $505 million, up 68% year over year.

For the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Public Service segment’s revenues is at $135 million.

Synergies from the buyouts of CloudCheckr and Data Mechanics is likely to have acted as tailwinds. NetApp’s recent buyouts include Fylamynt and Instaclustr.  

However, pandemic-induced supply chain headwinds and substantial increases in freight and logistical and component costs are likely to act as headwinds.
What Our Model Says
According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

NetApp has an Earnings ESP of -1.98% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Guess, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  Guess, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Guess, Inc. Quote
 Things To Note
In its lastearnings call the company highlighted that it expects revenue growth of nearly 1% (up 8% at constant currency) year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company is benefiting from solid digital business. It is on track to progress in its customer-centric initiatives, including omnichannel capabilities, advanced data analytics and customer segmentation. Focus on its six key strategies, including organization and culture, functional capacities, brand relevance with three main consumer groups (heritage, Millennials and Generation Z customers), customer focus, product brilliance and international footprint, bodes well.

Yet, Guess? is battling supply chain disruptions which is impacting its supply cost and inventory availability. The company continues to operate amid a dynamic environment, which includes increased inbound freight and product costs, weak euro and higher wages. The recent COVID-induced lockdowns across China and the energy crisis stemming from the war in Ukraine are a concern. Management expects an operating margin of roughly 7.5% in the to-be-reported quarter.

Stocks With Favorable Combination
Here are some companies you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:

2022-08-22 00:00:00+00:00,Macy's (M) Lined Up for Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/macys-m-lined-up-for-q2-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-cards,,,"Macy's, Inc. M is likely to register a decrease in the top line when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Aug 23 before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5,481 million, indicating a decline of 3% from the prior-year reported figure.

The bottom line of this New York-based company is also expected to have declined year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share has decreased by a penny to 85 cents over the past seven days. The figure suggests a sharp decline of 34.1% from the year-ago period.

We expect second-quarter net sales to be down 2.1% year over year to $5,527 million and the bottom line to decline 32.9% to 87 cents a share.

Macy's has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 198%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 31.7%.
Key Factors to Note
The soft consumer demand due to the inflationary environment and incremental promotional pressures are likely to have weighed on Macy’s second-quarter performance. On its lastearnings call management guided second-quarter net sales between $5,480 million and $5,550 million. This indicates a decline from the net sales of $5,647 million reported in the year-ago period. It projected adjusted earnings between 84 and 94 cents a share. This suggests a decrease from the earnings of $1.29 per share reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.

Management earlier highlighted that a sudden shift in demand away from casual/active and soft home categories, coupled with relaxation in supply-chain constraints, resulted in a higher percentage of receipts than expected. Markdowns to optimize inventory levels within overstock categories and the possibility of an elevated promotional environment, given the high inventory levels in the industry, might have hurt margins and, in turn, the bottom line.

Despite the aforementioned headwinds, we believe Macy’s successful execution of the Polaris strategy, robust omnichannel capabilities, curated merchandise assortment and initiatives to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience should have provided some cushion to the stock.

Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement of fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results.
Factors at Play
Malibu Boats’ top line in the quarter to be reported is likely to be driven by robust performance of the Malibu, Saltwater Fishing and Cobalt segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Malibu, Saltwater Fishing and Cobalt segments are likely to move 21.2%, 14.7% and 20.8% north to $166 million, $100 million and $64 million, respectively. The company’s results in the quarter are likely to have been aided by strong consumer demand for larger, feature-rich boats.
However, high costs are likely to have hurt margin in the quarter. In third-quarter 2022, cost of sales increased 22.9% year over year. Higher per unit material and labor costs might have resulted in an overall increase in expenses.

What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?
Our proven model does not show that Malibu Boats is likely to beat on earnings in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided, especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP.
Malibu Boats has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

2022-08-22 00:00:00+00:00,Brinker (EAT) to Post Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/brinker-eat-to-post-q4-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-cards,,,"Brinker International, Inc. EAT is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Aug 24, 2022, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.1%. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.4%, on average.
Q4 Estimates
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.17 per share compared with the prior-year quarter’s earnings per share of $1.68. The consensus mark for quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.02 billion, suggesting growth of 0.9% from the year-ago quarter's figure.
Factors to Note
Brinker International's fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results are likely to reflect benefits from its sales-building efforts and the sequential improvement in traffic and expansion efforts. Its expansion efforts are likely to have driven the top line. During the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2022, the company opened 4, 7 and 2 restaurants, respectively. During fiscal 2022, the company is likely to have opened 19-21 restaurants. The company has been witnessing pent-up demand for a dine-in experience. The company continues to benefit from robust off-premise sales.

However, a decline in company sales at Chili's and Maggiano's are likely to have negatively impacted the results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for company sales Chili's and Maggiano's are pegged at $693 million and $86 million, down 22.9% and 6.5% year over year, respectively.

A rise in food and beverage costs as well as restaurant labor costs, which include wage rates, training and overtime, are likely to have negatively impacted the bottom line. Higher repairs and maintenance expenses and an increase in utility expenses are also raising expenses.

Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Factors to Note
Ulta Beauty has been benefiting from market share gains in major beauty categories for a while now, with skincare standing out due to consumers’ rising interest in self-care and the company’s focus on newness and innovation. Apart from these, the company has been seeing strength in the fragrance and haircare category, with product newness being a solid driver. Even the makeup category is on track for full recovery.

The company’s omnichannel strength has been another driver. Ulta Beauty has been enriching its omnichannel experience through launches like Beauty to Go, options like same-day delivery (in some stores) and unique salon services across stores, among others. The company’s buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS) continued to gain traction in the first quarter. Also, its alliance with Target has been yielding favorably.

That said, escalated costs are a concerning factor. The company witnessed elevated supply-chain costs in the first quarter due to higher wage rates, transportation costs and increased fuel rates. It expects elevated supply-chain costs to remain a headwind for the rest of the year. SG&A expenses are likely to deleverage in fiscal 2022, mainly due to expenses ($70-$75 million) associated with the company’s strategic priorities and the increased wage rate. These factors raise worries for the quarter to be reported.

However, Ulta Beauty’s focus on its six strategic priorities bodes well. The company’s foremost priority is to strengthen its omnichannel business and explore the potential of both physical and digital facets. Next, the company is undertaking various tools to enhance the experience of guests like offering a virtual try-on tool and in-store education and reimagining fixtures, among others. Thirdly, ULTA concentrates on offering customers a curated and exclusive range of beauty products through innovation. Fourthly, the company is focused on deepening customer engagement by boosting rewards and loyalty programs. Fifthly, management is committed to optimizing its cost structure. Apart from these, the company strives to boost organizational talent and strengthen the culture.

2022-08-20 00:00:00+00:00,"Dollar Tree, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:DLTR) Stock Is Going Strong: Have Financials A Role To Play?",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-inc.s-nasdaq%3Adltr-stock-is-going-strong%3A-have-financials-a-role-to-play,,,"Most readers would already be aware that Dollar Tree's (NASDAQ:DLTR) stock increased significantly by 31% over the past three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Dollar Tree's ROE in this article.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
How To Calculate Return On Equity?
Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Dollar Tree is:
18% = US$1.5b ÷ US$8.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2022).
The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.18 in profit.
Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.
Dollar Tree's Earnings Growth And 18% ROE
To start with, Dollar Tree's ROE looks acceptable. Even so, when compared with the average industry ROE of 31%, we aren't very excited. Dollar Tree was still able to see a decent net income growth of 7.6% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently. Bear in mind, the company does have a respectable level of ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is higher. So this also does lend some color to the fairly high earnings growth seen by the company.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Dollar Tree's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 15% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.
NasdaqGS:DLTR Past Earnings Growth August 20th 2022
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for DLTR? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.
Is Dollar Tree Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?
Given that Dollar Tree doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.
Conclusion
On the whole, we do feel that Dollar Tree has some positive attributes. Particularly, its earnings have grown respectably as we saw earlier, which was likely achieved due to the company reinvesting most of its earnings at a decent rate of return, to grow its business. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

2022-08-19 00:00:00+00:00,"BJ's Wholesale (BJ) Q2 Earnings Top, Comps Rise, View Up",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bjs-wholesale-bj-q2-earnings-top-comps-rise-view-up,,,"BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. BJ reported second-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with the top and the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving year over year. This operator of membership warehouse clubs registered robust growth in total comparable club sales. The better-than-expected results prompted management to lift the fiscal 2022 view.

Sturdy membership trends, assortment initiatives, enhanced digital capabilities and a robust real estate pipeline aided the company’s performance. Management remains optimistic about the business, given the sustained strength in the grocery business.

Shares of BJ’s Wholesale Club were up 7.2% during the trading session on Aug 18, following the company’s impressive performance. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has advanced 41.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rise of 24.1%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Q2 Insights
BJ’s Wholesale Club reported adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents. The quarterly earnings increased 29.3% from 82 cents in the year-ago quarter.

The company generated total revenues of $5,103.8 million that surged 22.2% from the year-ago quarter’s levels and surpassed the consensus mark of $4,688 million. Net sales moved up 22.4% to $5,005 million, while membership fee income jumped 11.3% to $98.8 million.

Total comparable club sales during the quarter under discussion jumped 19.8% year over year. Excluding the impact of gasoline sales, comparable club sales rose 7.6%, driven by traffic growth and gains in market share led by grocery and perishable categories. Comps in the grocery, perishables and sundries division grew 8% in the quarter. Meanwhile, general merchandise and services division comps increased 4%.

We note that digitally-enabled sales rose 47% during the quarter, as members continued to take benefit of services such as Buy Online Pickup In-Club and curbside pickup.

 A Look at Margins
During second-quarter fiscal 2022, gross profit rose to $860 million from $763.5 million in the year-ago period. Merchandise gross margin rate, which excludes gasoline sales and membership fee income, contracted 50 basis points from the year-ago quarter’s level. Higher freight costs as well as investments in inflationary categories and markdowns in general merchandise inventory hurt merchandise margins.

Operating income increased 23.9% to $202.9 million while operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 4%. We note that adjusted EBITDA climbed 24.3% to $273.7 million during the quarter, while the adjusted EBITDA margin increased 10 basis points to 5.4%.

SG&A expenses rose 8.9% to $651.2 million from the year-ago quarter. This reflects higher labor costs due to last year’s wage investments as well as the buyout, integration and operating expenses related to the acquisition of assets from Burris Logistics. As a percentage of total revenues, SG&A expenses shrunk 150 basis points to 12.8%.
Other Financial Details
BJ’s Wholesale Club ended the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $163.7 million. Long-term debt amounted to $699.4 million, while stockholders’ equity was $853.6 million. Net cash provided by operating activities during the 26-week period ended on Jul 30, 2022, was $443.1 million.

As part of its share repurchase program, the company bought back 353,000 shares worth $22.8 million in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had $413 million remaining under its $500 million buyback authorization.

BJ’s Wholesale Club remains on track to open 11 new clubs this fiscal.
Outlook
Management now envisions fiscal 2022 comparable club sales, excluding the impact of gasoline sales, to increase between 4% and 5%, up from the prior view of low single-digit growth. BJ’s Wholesale Club now foresees full-year earnings in the band of $3.50-$3.60 per share, up from its earlier estimate of approximately $3.25 per share. However, the company expects continued merchandise margin rate pressure.

2022-08-19 00:00:00+00:00,Kohl's (KSS) Expands Partnership With Sephora to Fuel Growth,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/kohls-kss-expands-partnership-with-sephora-to-fuel-growth,,,"Kohl's Corporation KSS is committed to strengthening ties with its strategic partners. Moving on these lines, the company announced plans to expand Sephora’s presence to all 1,100 plus Kohl’s stores. Currently, the company has Sephora at Kohl’s in nearly 600 locations throughout the country. Management highlighted that Sephora at Kohl’s continues to deliver impressive results as it makes prestige beauty easily accessible to more people in the country. The partnership is bringing a younger, new and more diverse crowd to the locations.

We note that the partnership between the two parties commenced a year ago. During 2021, management opened 200 Sephora at Kohl’s locations, which have sustained a high-single digit percent sales lift compared with the rest of the chain. Further, the roughly 400 stores opened in 2022 are witnessing a mid-single digit percent sales rise. Sephora at Kohl’s is delivering solid performance in all categories like skincare, makeup and fragrance. In addition, Sephora at Kohl’s brands are gaining on higher distribution.

Kohl’s and Sephora are on track to innovate and optimize customer experiences. Management is piloting a cross-company Buy Online, Pick-Up In Store service, which helps people to purchase items on Sephora.com and pick up the order at Kohl’s stores. Continued cross-store promotions, which make Sephora savings accessible to Sephora at Kohl’s shoppers, also bodes well. Customers can buy and redeem Sephora gift cards at Kohl’s stores, irrespective of where the gift cards were bought. During the end of the year, both parties will expand the holiday gifting assortment and increasing marketing investments to drive traffic during the season.
Sephora at Kohl’s, which was introduced in 2021, is expected to grow to 850 locations by 2023. Moreover, management estimates Sephora at Kohl’s to grow to deliver $2 billion insales every year by 2025. Certainly, the introduction of Sephora at Kohl’s is in tandem with Kohl’s strategy to become the leading destination for the active and casual lifestyle.
Wrapping Up

2022-08-19 00:00:00+00:00,Ross Stores (ROST) Tops Earnings & Sales Estimates in Q2,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ross-stores-rost-tops-earnings-sales-estimates-in-q2,,,"Ross Stores, Inc. ROST reported solid second-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, both metrics declined year over year. Results were hurt by ongoing inflationary pressure and an increasing promotional retail environment. On the flip side, lower incentive costs acted as an upside.

Shares of ROST have lost 0.7% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 21.3%.
Q2 Insights
Ross Stores’ earnings of $1.11 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents but declined 20.1% from $1.39 reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.

Total sales of $4,583 million dropped 4.6% year over year but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,579 million.

In the quarter, shoes and men’s categories remained key growth drivers, with Florida and Texas being the top-performing regions. However, continued weakness in the dd’s DISCOUNTS performance in the fiscal second quarter due to escalating inflationary pressures acted as deterrents.
 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
 In second-quarter fiscal 2022, comps declined 7% compared with comps growth of 15% in the year-ago quarter, owing to elevated freight costs, which have been escalating from the second half of fiscal 2021. This was somewhat offset by lower incentive costs.

Cost of goods sold (COGS) of $3,399.5 million dipped 0.3% year over year. As a percentage of sales, COGS was 74.2%, marking a year-over-year increase of 320 basis points (bps) due to lower merchandise margins, higher ocean freight and increased markdowns.

Distribution costs escalated 85 bps, owing to unfavorable timing of pack-away-related expenses and deleverage from its new distribution center. Also, domestic freight expenses rose 35 bps and occupancy deleveraged 55 bps. However, higher expenses were somewhat offset by a 60-bps decline in buying costs.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses of $667.1 million declined 7.1% year over year. SG&A, as a percentage of sales, contracted 30 bps year over year to 14.6%. The decrease resulted from deleveraging effect of lower comps, which was more than offset by lower incentive costs.

The operating margin of 11.3% declined 280 bps from 14.1% in second-quarter fiscal 2021. The decline can be attributed to the deleveraging effect of the comps decline, higher markdowns and ongoing headwinds related to elevated freight costs, which have been escalating from the second half of fiscal 2021. However, lower incentives and COVID-19 costs remained upsides.
Store Update
In second-quarter fiscal 2022, the company opened 21 Ross stores and eight dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. As of Jul 30, 2022, Ross Stores operated 1,980 outlets, including 1,669 Ross stores across 40 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, and 311 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states.

The company remains on track to open 100 stores in fiscal 2022, including 75 Ross and 25 dd's DISCOUNTS stores. Management is likely to open 41 stores in the fiscal third quarter, including 29 Ross and 12 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. Additionally, it anticipates closing 10 older stores in fiscal 2022.
Financials
Ross Stores ended second-quarter fiscal 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $3,903.7 million, long-term debt of $2,454.4 million, and total shareholders’ equity of $4,127 million.

As of the end of the fiscal second quarter, consolidated inventories increased 55% from the 2021 comparable period, driven by higher packaway inventory. Average store inventory increased 15% in the quarter, in line with the pre-pandemic levels. Merchandise packaway levels were 41% of the total inventories compared with 30% at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2021.

Additionally, supply-chain congestions slightly eased in the fiscal second quarter, resulting in the early receipt of merchandise that is now stored in packaway and will flow to stores later in the year.

This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company bought back 2.9 million shares of common stock for $235 million in the fiscal second quarter. Earlier, the company expected to repurchase $950 million under its existing $1.9-billion share repurchase plan, which remains valid till fiscal 2023.

In a recent development, Ross Stores declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 31 cents per share, payable Sep 30, 2022, to shareholders of record as of Sep 6, 2022.
Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
  Ross Stores, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ross Stores, Inc. Quote
Outlook
Given the fiscal second-quarter performance and the uncertain macro-environment, Ross Stores provided a conservative view for the rest of fiscal 2022.

For third-quarter fiscal 2022, the company expects a comps decline of 7-9%, whereas it reported 14% growth in the prior-year quarter. Fiscal fourth-quarter comps are expected to decline 4-7% year over year.

Earnings per share are envisioned to be 72-83 cents, whereas it reported $1.09 in third-quarter fiscal 2021. Fiscal fourth-quarter earnings are likely to be $1.04-$1.21, whereas it recorded $1.04 in the year-ago quarter. For fiscal 2022, earnings are projected to be $3.84-$4.12, which compares unfavorably with the prior mentioned $4.34-$4.58. Notably, it reported $4.87 in fiscal 2021.

The company expects the operating margin to be 7.8-8.7% for the fiscal third quarter, down from 11.4% reported in the prior-year quarter. The operating margin is expected to be affected by the negative comp forecast, lower merchandise margin stemming from ocean freight costs and sluggish sales view, and increased markdowns. Also, the unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs is likely to hurt the operating margin.

Dollar Tree, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  Dollar Tree, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Dollar Tree, Inc. Quote
Factors to Consider
Dollar Tree’s second-quarter fiscal 2022 results are likely to have gained from the completion of the conversion of the Dollar Tree banner’s $1.25 price point initiative. This is expected to have boosted the top line and margins in the fiscal second quarter. Its Combo store and H2 renovation initiatives also bode well.

The company’s restructuring and expansion initiatives, including store openings and improvement of distribution centers, are likely to have boosted revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Dollar Tree has been on track to leverage Family Dollar and Dollar Tree distribution center systems, and combined merchandise.

The company’s digital and omni-channel capabilities, and same-day delivery service with Instacart are also expected to have driven traffic trends in the fiscal second quarter. The aforementioned factors instill optimism regarding the upcoming results.

Dollar Tree’s margins are likely to have benefited from measures to control costs. Despite the continued increase in freight costs and SG&A expenses, the gross margin is expected to reflect gains from improved initial mark-on, favorable product mix at the Dollar Tree banner, and distribution and occupancy cost leverage. On the last reported quarter’searnings call management anticipated improved margins for the Dollar Tree banner in the quarters ahead, driven by strategic initiatives and leverage on SG&A.

On the last reported quarter’searnings call management predicted consolidated net sales of $6.65-$6.78 billion for second-quarter fiscal 2022, with enterprise same-store sales growth in the low to mid-single digits. DLTR anticipated earnings of $1.45-$1.55 per share.

However, elevated freight costs have been weighing on the company’s gross margin for a while now. On the last quarter’searnings call the company expected freight and supply-chain disruptions to remain headwinds in the near term. It anticipated the cost pressures from domestic import freight to continue in the first half of 2022 due to the annualization of fiscal 2021 rates. Additionally, management predicted significantly higher diesel fuel prices for fiscal 2022. These are likely to have dented the company’s margins and bottom line to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter.

Moreover, Dollar Tree’s earnings view for the fiscal second quarter includes a 24-cent-per-share impact from the West Memphis distribution center matter and stock compensation expenses.

Ross Stores, which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, posted revenues of $4.58 billion for the quarter ended July 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.32%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.8 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

What's Next for Ross Stores?
While Ross Stores has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Ross Stores: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2022-08-18 00:00:00+00:00,"Tapestry's (TPR) Q4 Earnings Meet Estimates, Revenues Miss",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tapestrys-tpr-q4-earnings-meet-estimates-revenues-miss,,,"Tapestry, Inc. TPR came up with fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the bottom line met the same. Both net sales and earnings per share improved year over year. This house of modern luxury accessories and lifestyle brands witnessed double-digit sales growth on a 13-week comparable basis across North America, Japan, Other Asia and Europe. This helped offset a low-30% sales decline in Greater China owing to pandemic-induced disruptions.
Sales & Earnings Picture
Tapestry posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 78 cents a share that came in line with the consensus mark and increased from 74 cents reported in the year-ago period. On a 13-week comparable basis, adjusted earnings per share jumped 20% year over year.

Net sales of this New York-based company came in at $1,624.9 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,644 million. However, the metric rose 1% on a year-over-year basis, driven by growth across the Coach and Kate Spade brands. On a 13-week comparable basis, net sales improved 7% from the year-ago period.

Management notified that the extra week in fiscal 2021 had contributed $93 million to Tapestry’s top line and 9 cents a share to the bottom line.
Let’s Take an Insight
For the fourth quarter, net sales for Coach came in at $1,209 million, up 2% year over year. Kate Spade sales came in at $344.1 million, up 1% from the year-ago period. Net sales for Stuart Weitzman totaled $71.8 million, reflecting a decline of 15% year over year.

Strength in North America as well as sustained growth in the digital channel contributed to Tapestry’s results. Notably, the company added nearly 1.8 million new customers across channels in North America. Global digital sales increased in high-single digits, and represented roughly 30% of total revenues.

On a 13-week comparable basis, sales in North America and Europe rose 12% and 65% year over year, respectively. Sales in Japan grew more than 25%. However, sales at Greater China declined 32% from the last year.

Margin Discussions
Consolidated gross profit came in at $1,119.2 million, down 3% from the year-ago period. Moreover, gross margin contracted 280 basis points to 68.9%. Management informed that gross margin was adversely impacted by higher freight cost, which totaled $36 million or 215 basis points.

Further, the company reported an adjusted operating income of $259.6 million, down from an adjusted operating income of $272.5 million in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the adjusted operating margin shrunk 90 basis points to 16%. However, the figure was slightly up from the adjusted operating margin of 15.9% reported in the prior year, on a 13-week comparable basis.
Store Update
At the end of the quarter, Tapestry operated 343 Coach stores, 207 Kate Spade outlets and 39 Stuart Weitzman stores in North America. Internationally, the count was 602, 191 and 61 for Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, respectively.
Other Financial Details
Tapestry ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $953.2 million, long-term debt of $1,659.2 million and stockholders' equity of $2,285.5 million.

Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 was an inflow of $759 million. The company incurred capital expenditures and implementation costs related to Cloud Computing of $162 million in the fiscal year. For fiscal 2023, management anticipates capital expenditures and implementation costs related to Cloud Computing of about $325 million.

Tapestry looks to repurchase approximately $700 million worth of shares in fiscal 2023, under its existing $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization. Meanwhile, the company’s board approved a 20% hike in the quarterly dividend of 30 cents a share. The dividend will be paid out on Sep 26, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on Sep 9.

In fiscal 2022, Tapestry repurchased $1.6 billion worth of shares or approximately 42 million shares at an average cost of $38.08 per share. This included the buyback of $350 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter or approximately 11 million shares at an average cost of $32.77 per share.
Outlook
Tapestry envisions revenues to be approximately $6.9 billion for fiscal 2023. This suggests an increase of 3-4% on a reported basis, which includes roughly 300 basis points of FX pressure. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth is projected to be approximately 6-7%.

The company guided earnings in the band of $3.80 to $3.90 per share. The current projection suggests a sharp increase from adjusted earnings of $3.47 per share reported in fiscal 2022.

Management foresees fiscal 2023 gross margin as relatively in line with fiscal 2022. Tapestry had reported a gross margin of 69.6% in fiscal 2022. It expects the fiscal 2023 operating margin to shrink in the area of 50 basis points year over year owing to FX headwinds of about 100 basis points.

2022-08-18 00:00:00+00:00,Domino's (DPZ) Rallies 22% in 3 Months: Will the Upside Last?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dominos-dpz-rallies-22-in-3-months%3A-will-the-upside-last,,,"Shares of Domino's Pizza, Inc. DPZ have gained 22.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s increase of 19.2%. The company is benefiting from robust digitalization, expansion efforts and sales-building initiatives. However, staffing challenges, supply chain problems and inflationary pressure hurt the company. Let’s delve deeper.
Growth Drivers
Domino’s is investing heavily in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering to bolster sales. Domino’s digital loyalty program — Piece of the Pie Rewards — continues to contribute significantly to traffic gains. The extended ways to order a pizza have thus kept Domino’s at the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience. The company has more than 29 million active members in its Piece of the Pie loyalty program. The company has almost 70 million customers enrolled in its loyalty database.

Moreover, other digital enhancements in terms of ordering, selecting service methods, paying and tipping were implemented to enhance the consumer experience. It continues to innovate aggressively across all aspects of its business, including GPS, e-bikes, AI in-store technology, great food and an evolving digital experience.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the company made substantial progress regarding its Carside Delivery. With consistent waiting time-averaged below two minutes, franchisees and operators have enthusiastically embraced this new service method. Also, it was successful in bringing in new customers as well.

Since this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company generates a chunk of its revenues from outside the United States, the company remains committed to accelerating its presence in high-growth international markets to boost business. Meanwhile, the company’s international growth continues to be strong and diversified across markets, courtesy of exceptional unit-level economics.

During the fiscal second quarter, the company added 22 net new stores in the United States, thereby bringing the total U.S. system store count to 6,619 stores. During the quarter, its international business added 211 net new stores (reflecting a store growth rate of 9% year over year). The company also initiated its 500th store opening in China. Other markets of store growth included India, Mexico, Spain, Turkey and Guatemala. Together with the United States and international store openings, the company reported global net store growth of nearly 7%. The company remains bullish on the long-term unit growth potential in the United States, with the anticipation of an 8,000-plus store market. Also, it is confident about its two to three-year outlook of 6% to 8% in annual global net store growth.

Hurdles to Cross
Inflationary pressure in commodity, labor and fuel costs continues to hurt the company. The industry players expect to witness higher costs due to labor and supply chain shortages for quite some time. The company has been witnessing labor challenges in a handful of markets. During the fiscal second quarter, the company’s total cost of sales amounted to $678.9 million compared with $624.8 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The company anticipates fluctuations in commodity prices (including wheat) and fuel costs arising from geopolitical risks and the impact on the overall macroeconomic environment.

Moreover, during the fiscal second quarter, comps at Domino’s domestic stores (including company-owned and franchise stores) declined 2.9% year over year against 3.5% growth reported in the prior-year quarter. The downside was primarily due to a fall in order counts partially offset by ticket growth. Limited operating hours (due to staffing challenges) and supply chain challenges (driven by labor issues within distribution channels) further added to the downside.
Key Picks
Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector are Potbelly Corporation PBPB, Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. ARCO and Dollar Tree Inc. DLTR.

Potbelly has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), at present. PBPB has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 26.2%, on average. Shares of PBPB have declined 0.3% in the past year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Arcos Dorados carries a Zacks Rank #2. ARCO has a long-term earnings growth of 34.4%. Shares of the company have increased 38.4% in the past year.

2022-08-18 00:00:00+00:00,Dollar Tree (DLTR) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-dltr-earnings-expected-to-grow%3A-should-you-buy,,,"Dollar Tree (DLTR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.
The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 25, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings call it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.57 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +27.6%.
Revenues are expected to be $6.79 billion, up 7% from the year-ago quarter.
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.05% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Dollar Tree?
For Dollar Tree, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.75%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.
So, this combination indicates that Dollar Tree will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?
While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Dollar Tree would post earnings of $1.98 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.37, delivering a surprise of +19.70%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
Dollar Tree appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

2022-08-18 00:00:00+00:00,The J.M. Smucker (SJM) Readies for Q1 Earnings: Things to Note,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-j.m.-smucker-sjm-readies-for-q1-earnings%3A-things-to-note,,,"The J. M. Smucker Company SJM is likely to register a top and bottom-line decline when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Aug 23. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $1,848 Million, suggesting a drop of 0.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has risen by a penny in the past seven days to $1.25 per share, which, however, indicates a 34.2% decline from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter. The branded food and beverage product company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.7%, on average. SJM delivered an earnings surprise of 18.6% in the last reported quarter.
The J. M. Smucker Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

The J. M. Smucker Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The J. M. Smucker Company Quote
Factors to Note
The J. M. Smucker is encountering cost inflation, as well as supply-chain and transportation challenges, along with isolated labor shortages. In its fourth-quarter earnings release, management stated that pandemic-related impacts, together with cost inflation and a volatile supply chain, continue to affect the company’s results and cause risks for fiscal 2023. The company expects cost inflation to have an impact of the mid-to-high-teen percentage on the total cost of products sold in fiscal 2023. Management’s EPS guidance for fiscal 2023 includes the expected impact of inflated costs and elevated selling, distribution and administrative (SD&A) expenses. SD&A expenses are expected to rise about 9%, mainly due to higher compensations, elevated pre-production expenses and greater marketing expenditure.

Apart from this, results for the quarter under review are likely to be affected by the company’s product recall. After Apr 30, 2022, The J. M. Smucker initiated a voluntary recall of certain Jif peanut butter products made at its Lexington, KY facility and sold mainly in the United States. The move was a result of potential salmonella contamination. The product recall impacted the company’s performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and is likely to affect the fiscal 2023 top and bottom lines. The fourth-quarter top line included a 1% adverse impact related to expected customer returns associated with the Jif peanut butter product recall. Further, management’s sales guidance for fiscal 2023 includes a 2% adverse impact related to the product recall.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, management expects net sales to have been flat year over year and earnings to have decreased about 35%, mainly due to the product recall impact.

On contrary, the positive net price realization has been working well for the company. Additionally, The J. M. Smucker has been progressing well with core priorities, which include driving commercial excellence, reshaping the portfolio, streamlining the cost structure and unleashing its organization to win. Strength in such strategies is helping The J. M. Smucker navigate through complex supply-chain challenges.

The company is benefiting from strength in its coffee business. The overall coffee portfolio looks encouraging as at-home coffee habits created during the pandemic and at-home consumption remain high. In the fourth quarter, net sales for coffee grew 11%, backed by all brands in the company’s market-leading at-home coffee portfolio. Management stated that there is solid momentum in its Coffee business. At-home consumption now forms more than 70% of coffee drinking occasions, per management’s fourth-quarter earnings call. These aspects bode well for the quarter to be reported.

2022-08-18 00:00:00+00:00,"The Children's Place (PLCE) Posts Q2 Loss, Stock Declines",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-childrens-place-plce-posts-q2-loss-stock-declines,,,"Shares of The Children’s Place, Inc. PLCE dropped roughly 11% during the trading session on Aug 17, following the company’s dismal performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Both the top and bottom lines not only missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also declined year over year. Comparable retail sales continued with the sluggish run in the quarter. Management also disappointed investors with its soft third-quarter and fiscal 2022 view.

Cautious consumer behavior amid the soaring inflation, increased promotional activity from key competitors and supply-chain issues adversely impacted the company’s results. These weighed on fashion AUR and margins during the quarter. However, this pure-play children’s specialty apparel retailer highlighted that the third-quarter to-date sales trend has improved compared with the last two weeks of July and that the quarter-to-date AUR increase is encouraging.

Jane Elfers, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Based on the current environment, although we are now anticipating that consolidated sales for full year 2022 will be down approximately 8% versus pre-pandemic levels in 2019, we anticipate operating income will be up approximately mid-teens versus 2019 and EPS will increase approximately 30% versus 2019. With the multiple headwinds we are currently facing, these results would only be possible due to the structural reset to our business model since the start of the pandemic.”
Let’s Analyze
The Children’s Place posted an adjusted net loss of 89 cents a share. This was sharply down from the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 68 cents and the year-ago period’s earnings of $1.71 per share.

Net sales of $380.9 million decreased 8% year over year, primarily due to the soft consumer demand resulting from the unprecedented inflation, higher promotional activity across the sector, the lapping of the enhanced child tax credit last July and the impact of permanent store closures. The top line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $383.6 million, marking the fifth straight miss. Comparable retail sales declined 8.7% for the quarter.

U.S. net sales fell 13% year over year to $313 million, while Canadian net sales decreased 5% to $35 million.

Consolidated digital sales declined 7% year over year during the quarter. We note that digital sales represented 47% of total retail sales, with approximately 76% of the digital business now coming through a mobile device. Management expects digital revenues to represent 50% of retail sales in fiscal 2022 and 60% of retail sales by the end of fiscal 2024. Again, store net sales were down 14% from the year-ago period, while comp-store traffic fell 4% during the quarter.

Margin Discussion
Moving on, the second-quarter adjusted gross profit was $114.8 million, down from $168.1 million in the year-ago period. Again, the adjusted gross margin shriveled 1,046 basis points to 30.2%. This year-over-year contraction was the result of lower merchandise margins due to unplanned AUR pressure resulting from soft consumer demand, combined with increased promotional activity, higher domestic supply-chain costs and the increased penetration of the wholesale business, which carries a lower margin. Higher inbound transportation costs and the deleverage of fixed expenses resulting from lower net sales also hurt the gross margin.

Adjusted SG&A expenses decreased 0.5% year over year to $113.5 million in the reported quarter. As a percentage of net sales, the metric deleveraged 224 basis points to 29.8%, primarily due to the deleveraging of fixed expenses resulting from lower net sales and higher planned marketing spend. The Children’s Place expects fiscal 2022 SG&A expenses to be marginally lower than the prior year, with SG&A expenses planned to be approximately $450 million for the year.

The company posted an adjusted operating loss of $11.7 million, down significantly from the adjusted operating income of $40.1 million in the comparable period last year.
Store Update
The Children’s Place ended the quarter with 658 stores. Concerning its store fleet optimization strategy, The Children’s Place permanently shuttered seven stores during the second quarter. The company plans to close roughly 40 stores in fiscal 2022. Since the announcement of the fleet optimization initiative in 2013, the company has permanently closed 541 stores.
Other Financial Aspects
The Children’s Place ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $28.2 million. The company had $283.9 million outstanding on its revolving credit facility as of Jul 30, 2022. Stockholders' equity at the end of the quarter was $184.2 million.

The company incurred capital expenditures of $8 million during the quarter. Management anticipates fiscal 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $45 million, with a major portion to be allocated for digital and supply-chain fulfillment initiatives.

During the quarter, the company bought back 484,000 shares for approximately $22.6 million. As of Jul 30, 2022, the company had approximately $196.1 million remaining under its existing share repurchase program.
Outlook
The Children’s Place assumes a low-single-digit jump in AUR for the back half of the year and foresees significant growth in the Wholesale channel with Amazon. It anticipates lower occupancy costs for the balance of the year due to favorable lease negotiations, permanent store closures and lower variable expenses. It also expects lower interest expenses in the back half of the year.

The Children’s Place estimates third-quarter fiscal 2022 net sales of approximately $500 million, down from the $558.2 million reported in the year-ago period. The company anticipates a low-double-digit decline in comparable retail sales. It projects the adjusted operating income of approximately 14% of net sales, down from 20.9% in the last year. The company envisions third-quarter adjusted earnings to be approximately $3.95 per share. This suggests a significant decline from the earnings of $5.43 per share reported in the prior-year quarter.

For fiscal 2022, management guided net sales of approximately $1,725 million. This suggests a decline of 10% from the net sales of $1,915.4 million reported in fiscal 2021. The company expects a low-double-digit decrease in comparable retail sales. It expects the adjusted operating income of approximately 7.5% of net sales, down from 15.1% in the last year. The company expects adjusted earnings of approximately $7.00 per share for fiscal 2022. This indicates a meaningful decline from the earnings of $13.40 per share reported in fiscal 2021.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have dropped 24.3% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 20.7%.

Management slashed its overall guidance for fiscal 2022. Results were hurt by a tough macroeconomic landscape, increased inflation and sluggish consumer spending. Shares of the company fell more than 8% during the pre-market trading session on Aug 18.

Management has undertaken initiatives to alter its plans, such as reducing the inventory and cutting costs due to a weaker demand outlook. Further, the company is on track with its transformation strategy and remains encouraged about having witnessed a solid performance in its roughly 600 refreshed and elevated stores – including Sephora as an important cornerstone.
Quarter in Detail
Kohl's posted adjusted earnings of $1.11 per share, which plunged 55% from the $2.48 reported in the year-ago period. However, the bottom line came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08.

2022-08-17 00:00:00+00:00,Starbucks (SBUX) Rallies 25% in 3 Months: Can It Continue?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/starbucks-sbux-rallies-25-in-3-months%3A-can-it-continue,,,"Shares of Starbucks Corporation SBUX have gained 25.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rally of 19.7%. The company is benefiting from higher North America comparable sales, expansion efforts, successful innovations and digital offerings. However, dismal performance in China and higher costs hurt the company. Let’s delve deeper.
Growth Drivers
The company’s North America comps have impressed investors for the sixth straight quarter. North America comps rose 9% in the fiscal third quarter, owing to an improvement of 8% in average ticket. Global comparable store sales rose 3% year over year. The upside was primarily driven by a 6% rise in average tickets, marginally overshadowed by a 3% decline in comparable transactions.

Despite the pandemic, the company continues to focus on store expansion efforts. In fiscal 2021, Starbucks opened 1,173 net new stores worldwide. In the second and third quarter of fiscal 2022, Starbucks opened 313 and 318 net new stores worldwide, respectively, taking the total store count to 34,948.

During the second and third-quarter fiscal 2022, operations in Starbucks China were affected by pandemic-induced restrictions. However, the company is very optimistic about long-term growth opportunities. Despite the pandemic, the company opened 107 net new stores in China, taking the store count to 5,761 across 228 cities.

Starbucks is strengthening its product portfolio with significant innovation around beverages, refreshments, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings. Starbucks is leaning toward fast-growing categories like Cold Brew, Draft Nitro beverages, and plant-based modifiers, including almond, coconut, and soy milk alternatives. Apart from the numerous beverage innovations, Starbucks has also been making an effort to offer more nutritional and healthy products to its customers.

This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is also benefiting from a robust loyalty program. Starbucks Rewards loyalty program’s 90-day active members in the United States increased to 27.4 million, reflecting an increase of 13% year over year.

Hurdles to Cross
The coronavirus pandemic has negatively impacted the company’s performance in China. Shanghai, a city four times the size of New York City, was closed for two months. The company’s performance in China continues to be impacted by the decline in office occupancy in the company’s largest urban markets. Due to the uncertainty in China, the company is unable to predict its performance in the country in the back half of the year. During the fiscal third quarter, comps in China declined 44% year over year. The downtick was caused by a 1% decline in average tickets and a 43% fall in transactions. China continues to battle COVID resurgences and navigate through prolonged lockdowns. At the end of third-quarter 2022, the company noted that nearly one-third of its stores in China remain temporarily closed or are offering mobile ordering channels only.

The company’s earnings in fiscal 2022 are likely to be impacted by strategic investments and cost inflation. The expiration of government subsidies in Asia and the transition of Starbucks Korea to the licensee is likely to hurt the company’s margin in fiscal 2022.

2022-08-17 00:00:00+00:00,Can Dollar Tree (DLTR) Keep the Earnings Surprise Streak Alive?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-dollar-tree-dltr-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive,,,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Dollar Tree (DLTR), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry.
This discount retailer has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 15.99%.
For the most recent quarter, Dollar Tree was expected to post earnings of $1.98 per share, but it reported $2.37 per share instead, representing a surprise of 19.70%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.79 per share, while it actually produced $2.01 per share, a surprise of 12.29%.
Price and EPS Surprise
For Dollar Tree, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Dollar Tree currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.75%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on August 25, 2022.
Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.
Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

2022-08-17 00:00:00+00:00,"Target (TGT) Q2 Earnings Miss & Decline Y/Y, Margins Hit Hard",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/target-tgt-q2-earnings-miss-decline-y-y-margins-hit-hard,,,"Target Corporation TGT came up with second-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but grew year over year. Comparable sales increased for the 21st successive quarter, gaining from growth in both store and digital channels. However, higher markdown rates and increased freight costs continued to weigh on margins. Management’s actions to tackle the excess inventory hurt profitability. As a result, the bottom line missed the consensus mark and fell sharply from the year-ago period. This was the second straight earnings miss.

Target’s recent attempt to rightsize its inventory is a step in the right direction, as demand skews toward frequency categories like Food & Beverage, Household Essentials and Beauty from discretionary categories. This may hurt margins now but better positions the company to gain market share. Markedly, the Fall season’s receipts in discretionary categories were lowered by more than $1.5 billion.
Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Target Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Target Corporation Quote
Sales & Earnings Picture
Target reported adjusted earnings of 39 cents a share, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents and our estimate of 75 cents. Also, the bottom line declined significantly from the $3.64 reported in the year-ago period.

The big-box retailer generated total revenues of $26,037 million, which increased 3.5% year over year but came lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26,159 million and our estimate of $26,222.1 million. We note that sales jumped 3.3% to $25,653 million, while other revenues rose 14.8% to $384 million.

Stores fulfilled more than 95% of the company’s sales in the quarter. Same-day services (Order Pick Up, Drive Up and Shipt) grew approximately 11%, led by Drive Up, which grew in the mid-teens. Target registered a sturdy performance in the Food & Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials categories. During the quarter, the company opened five new stores.

Meanwhile, comparable sales for the quarter under discussion increased 2.6% but fell short of our estimate of 3.7%. The comparable sales growth reflected a 2.7% increase in traffic. Again, comparable store sales grew 1.3%, while comparable digital sales increased 9%.

Target’s debit card penetration contracted 40 basis points to 11.2%, while credit card penetration increased 20 basis points to 8.9%. The total REDcard penetration declined to 20.1% from the year-ago quarter’s 20.3%.
Margins
The gross margin decreased 890 basis points to 21.5%, reflecting higher markdown rates due to inventory impairments and measures undertaken to address softer-than-anticipated sales in discretionary categories as well as higher merchandise, inventory shrink and freight costs. Additionally, the increased compensation and headcount in distribution centers, the cost of managing the excess inventory and higher per-unit last-mile shipping costs also hurt the gross margin rate. Meanwhile, the operating margin shriveled to 1.2% from 9.8% in the year-ago period.
Other Financial Details
This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,117 million, long-term debt and other borrowings of $13,453 million and shareholders’ investment of $10,592 million. During the quarter, Target paid out dividends of $417 million. This reflected an increase of 32.4% in the dividend per share.
Outlook
Target reaffirmed low-to-mid-single-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2022. It foresees the operating margin rate to be centered around 6% in the back half of the year.

We note that shares of this Minneapolis, MN-based company have risen 11.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rise of 19.6%.
3 Hot Stocks
Here we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Dollar General DG, Costco COST and Dollar Tree DLTR.

2022-08-17 00:00:00+00:00,"Pricey pencils, paper: U.S. teachers get schooled in inflation",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pricey-pencils-paper%3A-u.s.-teachers-get-schooled-in-inflation,,,"By Gigi Zamora
NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Teachers face a harsh lesson as inflation drives up the cost of everything from paper to pencils before the school year begins, leading some to cut back on supplies - or substitute with cheaper items.
""If you ask any teacher, Ticonderoga pencils are it,"" said Kristina Eisenhower, 35, an instructional facilitator. Yet a 12-pack of that popular brandcosts $3.99, up nearly 25% from a year ago, on Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.
In parts of Arkansas, where Eisenhower works, teachers' annual $500 stipend for classroom materials has not increased in 15 years. ""They're buying cheaper pencils, cheaper supplies, which in reality are not going to last as long as the name-brand supplies they've bought in the past,"" she said.
Folders and binders cost 17% more than a year ago, according to data from analytics firm NielsenIQ. Prices are up 23% for graph paper, 8% for scissors, and 28% for book covers.
Some teachers have formed groups to buy supplies in bulk from retailers like The Dollar Tree Inc DLTR.O and Walmart Inc WMT.N.
""Educators are going to try to stretch each dollar and they're probably going to dip into more of their personal funds to ensure kids have what they need,"" said Colin Sharkey, executive director of the Association of American Educators.
A National Retail Federation survey in July found 47% of consumers were switching to cheaper options for school supplies due to higher prices.
Some teachers create Amazon wish lists for classroom supplies, which they may share on social media for readers to buy and donate the items. Such lists posted on Twitter include disinfectant wipes, power strips, classroom decorations, snacks, dry erase markers and highlighters.
FEWER DONATIONS TO 'WISH LISTS'
Kindergarten teacher Melissa Hunt, 53, from Albany, New York, has noticed higher prices and fewer donations to her Amazon.com Educator Wish List.
Last year she cleared her list in three days, but this year it has remained online for weeks and prompted a donation of only $12, she said.
A letter by a school districtseen by Reuters told teachers to ""refrain"" from posting wish lists on social media, without providing a reason. Similar letters have been issued by other districts, said an educator on condition of anonymity.
Atlanta-based Chaneè Jackson-Kendall, 35, is unhappy about picking up the slack, having to buy items for her second grader that she believes should be supplied by the school.
This year she has spent around $300 on clothes, $300 on shoes, $180 on school supplies, $40 on face masks, $45 on a water bottle and $20 on a lunch box.
""We're giving billions of dollars to Ukraine but we're having to buy copy paper for our schools,"" Jackson-Kendall said.
On average, parents in the United States will spend $661 on back-to-school shopping, 8% more than last year, according to Deloitte. Thirty-three of survey respondents said their personal financial situation has worsened since 2021.
Sarah Fleming, who chairs Glowing Hearts Charity in Canada, said the program took in fewer donations this summer than a year earlier and that she has been forced to buy lower quality supplies.
""When we did our ordering this year, we were told that if we waited much longer then prices were going to go up also,"" Fleming said. ""So, I wonder, will we be able to continue to provide for that many students next year?""

2022-08-17 00:00:00+00:00,DLTR vs. TJX: Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dltr-vs.-tjx%3A-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now,,,"Investors with an interest in Retail - Discount Stores stocks have likely encountered both Dollar Tree (DLTR) and TJX (TJX). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.
Dollar Tree has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while TJX has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that DLTR has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.
DLTR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.62, while TJX has a forward P/E of 21.37. We also note that DLTR has a PEG ratio of 1.33. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TJX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.04.
Another notable valuation metric for DLTR is its P/B ratio of 4.58. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TJX has a P/B of 13.96.
Based on these metrics and many more, DLTR holds a Value grade of B, while TJX has a Value grade of C.
DLTR is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that DLTR is likely the superior value option right now.
