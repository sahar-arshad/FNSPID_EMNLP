2022-09-28 00:00:00+00:00,"eBay Stock Lost 8% In One Week, What's Next?",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-stock-lost-8-in-one-week-whats-next,,,"eBay stock (NASDAQ: EBAY) has lost 7.8% in the last week, underperforming the S&P 500 (down 6.2%). Further, the same trend was observed over the last ten days (-16% vs -11%) and one month period (-18% vs -13%). Notably, the recent stock market volatility was due to high inflation levels, aggressive interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions. The Fed has increased the interest rates five times in the year, with more hikes to follow. While it is aimed at taming inflation, it also has the potential to push the economy into recession.
The company operates an online marketplace “eBay.com”, where third-party buyers and sellers can transact in a variety of products (both new and used goods). It neither owns the inventory nor handles the shipping & handling of goods, making the business model asset light. While the firm’s net transaction revenues decreased 8% y-o-y in Q2 due to a drop in website traffic, it is to be noted that web traffic volume was at very high levels in 2021. We expect the revenues to continue to suffer over the subsequent quarters.
Now, is eBay stock set to drop further, or could we expect some recovery? We believe that there is a 73% chance of a rise in eBay stock over the next month (21 trading days) based on our machine-learning analysis of trends in the stock price over the last ten years. See our analysis on eBay Stock Chance of Rise.
Twenty-One Day: EBAY -18%, vs. S&P500 -13%; Underperformed market
(less than 1% likelihood event; 73% probability of rise over next 21 days)
eBay stock lost 18% over the last twenty-one trading days (one month), compared to a broader market (S&P500) drop of 13%
A change of -18% or more over twenty-one trading days is a less than 1% likelihood event, which has occurred 11 times out of 2514 in the last ten years
Of these 11 instances, the stock has seen a positive movement over the next twenty-one trading days on 8 occasions
This points to a 73% probability for the stock rising over the next twenty-one trading days
Ten Day: EBAY -16%, vs. S&P500 -11%; Underperformed market
(less than 1% likelihood event; 56% probability of rise over next 10 days)
eBay stock decreased 16% over the last ten trading days (two weeks), compared to broader market (S&P500) loss of 11%
A change of -16% or more over ten trading days is a less than 1% likelihood event, which has occurred 9 times out of 2515 in the last ten years
Of these 9 instances, the stock has seen a positive movement over the next ten trading days on 5 occasions
This points to a 56% probability for the stock rising over the next ten trading days
Five Day: EBAY -7.8%, vs. S&P500 -6.2%; Underperformed market
(3% likelihood event; 45% probability of rise over next five days)
eBay stock lost 7.8% over a five-day trading period ending 09/26/2022, compared to the broader market (S&P500) decrease of 6.2%
A change of -7.8% or more over five trading days (one week) is a 3% likelihood event, which has occurred 76 times out of 2515 in the last ten years
Of these 76 instances, the stock has seen a positive movement over the next five trading days on 34 occasions
This points to a 45% probability for the stock rising over the next five trading days

[Editor’s note: “Even in a Recession, Divergent Stocks Will Prosper” was previously published in May 2022. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]
Everyone is concerned about a recession these days. And who can blame them? Inflation’s been running at decade highs. A war is raging on in Europe. We’ve been dealing with soaring gas and food prices. There are rapidly rising interest rates and a crashing stock market. The Fed is on a super-hawkish rate-hiking path. And many fear that its tightening will push the U.S. economy into a deep downward spiral.
Previously, investors were fearful of high inflation. But after last week’s Fed meeting and subsequent press conference, those fears have shifted. Now investors are driven by fear of an incoming recession.
But what if I told you that a downturn has already arrived?
That’s right. The U.S. economy may already be in a recession.
That’s a scary thought. You’ve probably been worrying about a recession that the mainstream media has said won’t come until 2023. But it may have already arrived — and it could send the stock market spiraling lower.
Though, here’s the thing. In every bear market, certain stocks tend to soar. Thanks to a rare phenomenon called “divergence,” we’ve uncovered a special group of stocks that tend to soar during downturns. And they do even as the broader averages crash.
These are the stocks you need to be buying today. Forget index investing. It’s time to ditch the S&P 500 and Dow Jones. Buy divergent stocks to survive — and even thrive — in a bear market.
Otherwise, you could lose 20% or 30% in a hurry.
A Recession May Have Already Arrived
Everyone seems worried about a recession that’s set to materialize in 2023. But it increasingly appears that it may have already arrived.
The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Well, as of August, we hit that benchmark. Indeed, the U.S. is in a technical recession.
Recent economic data has been very weak. The 10-year Treasury yield is just about as overextended as it’s ever been. Eurozone economic activity is rapidly contracting, and it’s very widespread, elevating concerns about a global economic recession. The Pound sterling hit a new 37-year low against the dollar. Home sales keep falling. Consumer spending is slowing. And sentiment is at lows comparable to previous U.S. recessions.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve seems married to an aggressive rate-hike cycle. And that will only sap more energy out of an already stalling U.S. economy.
Of course, that’s scary. Recessions are never good. And they tend to be very bad for the market.
But not all stocks drop during these downturns.
Divergent Stocks Soar During Recessions
As many of you know, we’ve been researching a rare market phenomenon called a “divergence” for several months now.
This anomaly only emerges about once a decade, during periods of peak market volatility. And it usually only happens in high-quality growth stocks that can grow rapidly, even during a recession.
At a high level, what tends to happen during a divergence is this:
Investors start to panic about a recession.
Stocks begin to drop on those fears.
Most keep dropping because as the economy slows, those holdings suffer from declining revenues and earnings, too.
Certain high-quality growth stocks don’t suffer from declining revenues and earnings. Instead, those fundamentals keep growing at a rapid rate because their growth drivers are so powerful that they’re “recession-proof.”
This results in a massive divergence between the price of those stocks and the relative revenues and earnings.
This divergence always corrects itself. And that sends those high-quality growth stocks significantly higher within a short time — even if the market keeps crashing.
This is a phenomenon that has repeated time and again throughout U.S. stock market history.
A Look Back to Past Recessions
For reference, let’s look at the last two major economic recessions.
Back in 2001, the U.S. economy slipped into a recession on the heels of the dot-com crash. During this time (illustrated by a gray highlight in the chart below), the stock market struggled. From early 2001 to late 2002, the S&P 500 dropped 24%, while the Dow Jones fell 16%. But over that same stretch, certain divergent stocks that grew revenues rapidly right through the recession (like Amazon (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), and F5 Networks (FFIV)) saw stock prices soar. While the S&P 500 dropped deep into a bear market, those stocks basically doubled!
Fast-forward to 2008-09. The U.S. economy was reeling from the housing crash and financial sector meltdown. We were deep into a recession. From late 2008 to early 2009, the stock market struggled. The S&P dropped 14%. The Dow fell 16%.
Yet, over that exact period, certain divergent stocks were able to sustain rapid revenue growth. Those stocks — like Amazon, Netflix (NFLX), and Booking.com (BKNG) — soared. Booking rose 50%. Both Amazon and Netflix popped more than 70%.
By now, you see the pattern.
The divergent stocks that we’ve discovered are the perfect recessionary medicine for your portfolio. During crashes, they tend to soar — while the rest of the market collapses.
Indeed, stocks are collapsing, and a recession may have already arrived. You owe it to yourself to at least check out some divergent stocks.
The Final Word on Combatting a Recession
We sit on the verge of a very pivotal moment in U.S. stock market history.
I think we may already be in a recession. I think the broader market could struggle over the next few weeks to months. And I think investors who ignore this divergence phenomenon could lose a lot of money.
But… for those who listen to and capitalize on this divergence, the potential returns could be enormous.
Our models indicate realistic, back-tested potential gains of 200%-plus over the next 12 months alone.
So, the way I see it, you have three choices:
Stay invested in index funds and exchange-traded funds, and risk losing money as the markets potentially struggle amid a recession.
Cash out and put your money in a savings account, where inflation will eat your nest egg.
Buy divergent stocks, and score 3X returns in 12 months, beating both a recession and inflation.
I think the right choice is obvious. But, of course, I’ll leave it up to you to seek out more about Divergence 2022.

David Gardner: A lot of people, when they first think about stocks, tend to lock in on the share price. Maybe this was you or maybe this is a friend of yours. They'll say, ""Well, Alphabet, is at $102 per share; that's expensive."" By contrast, the same mentality when looking at penny stocks can get a lot more excited. Some penny stock they're seeing promoted by someone, perhaps some ne'er-do-well, and they'll think, Wow, the stock, is it a $1.02 -- not 102 like Alphabet -- $1.02."" They'll think that's the one to buy, the $1.02, because if it just reaches $2, you double your money. Well, from the earliest days of The Motley Fool, we've tried to get people focused not on the price per share of the company, but rather on the market cap of the company. The price per share of a stock tells you almost nothing. It's the price to buy one share of the stock.
But how many shares does the company have outstanding? In math, we multiply two multiple cans together, but the price per share is only one multiple canned. If you don't know the other one, you can't do any meaningful math or figure out much of the world around you. Fools with a capital F know that you need to know the shares outstanding, and then multiply that by the price per share. Now you know the actual full value of the company, its full price tag, its market capitalization, market cap. Well, to teach this lesson inexorably and unforgettably, we invented a game. That's what I do. The date was Aug. 9, 2017. We've been playing every quarter since. You're playing too. You know this. Now into the sixth the year you've been playing along all the way through, I hope. It's that time of the year, again, that time of the quarter, again, 10 new stocks, two guests stars, both returning champions, actually three guest stars because you too. Only on this week's Rule Breaker Investing.
Welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing. It is the penultimate Wednesday of the quarter. Therefore, it is the Market Cap Game Show. Can't wait to share this with you. Bring back two guest stars, play along with you in the hour or so ahead. Before we start, I want to say just a few things. The first is next week is mailbag. Our email address is rbi@fool.com. Any reactions to share to this month's podcasts, including today's market cap game show. I led the whole month off with my pet peeves volumes seven, we did a review-a-palooza of 25 stock samplers, five stocks indistinguishable from magic, and five stocks with a tailwind blow. We'd love to hear from you. You can tweet us @RBI podcasts and we hope you'll subscribe to this podcast and listen in each and every week. I want to thank Mike Steele for constructive criticism to improve the Market Cap Game Show, Mike, you tweeted out to me a quarter ago. It takes too long to get into the game. You talk too much up front.
Get the game going already. Mike, because I told you one quarter ago, I agree. I hope even new listeners have by now grasped our rules here. You're guessing the market capitalization, the value of 10 different companies will feature this week. You score yourself for correctly agreeing with or correctly disagree with my celebrity contestants. If you're new, listen and play along, you'll get it. Now one final note, Brian Stoffel and Yasser El-Shimy, last quarter tied 5-5. Offline before the show one of them said, ""It'd be really weird if we tied again."" The other applied, ""It would be really weird if we didn't tie again."" Even though those two statements directly contradict each other, they're both right. I love paired contradictions. In a past great quotes episode I pointed to another such pair. There's an old line, we can all appreciate it, but you've heard this before. If thing is worth doing, it's worth doing well. Sure heck, but then there's the very opposite statement by G.K. Chesterton. ""If it thing is worth doing, it's worth doing poorly."" I can again say here, sure, in some contexts, that's also right. The lines say the opposite. They're both right. We shall see whether we tie this time or not. I promise simply that it'll be weird no matter what. Let's get started with returning champions, Brian Stoffel and Yasser El-Shimy.
[Music]
David Gardner: Brian Stoffel is a Fool contributor. He works primarily on write-ups for Motley Fool Stock Advisor and appears on Motley Fool Live two to three times per week. Yasser El-Shimy is an investment analysts at The Motley Fool, working on several services including Trend Spotter, Next-Gen Supercycle, and the Backstage portfolio. Gentlemen, welcome.
Brian Stoffel: Thanks David.
Yasser El-Shimy: Good to be here, David.
David Gardner: I talked about this a little bit at the start, but you're not allowed to tie this time unless if you do, we'll have extra fun and there will be no tie. You guys both have been briefed about that, you know that, and are ready. Let's get started with company No. 1. By a lot I have selected the first call to be made by Brian Stoffel. Brian here we go, company No. 1. Brian, are you a morning person or a night?
Brian Stoffel: I am definitely a morning person.
David Gardner: Even before I fully asked the question, you were already jumping. Does that mean that while most morning people may rise at six you're up at 04:30?
Brian Stoffel: Oh yeah, definitely does. It's an interesting dynamic because my wife is a night owl.
David Gardner: That is also true in my household, although we reverse the gender roles of your household. I think it's good to have one of each, frankly, because with kids and I know we've had kids young and older, but young kids especially, you want to have coverage. Most of the time. Brian, do you sleep well at night?
Brian Stoffel: I sleep well most nights, but there is the occasional night where I find myself up without anything to do and a little bored.
David Gardner: This isn't even relevant to the company we're about to talk about, but in my own case, I use an app off my Apple Watch to score my sleep each night. I think I'm addicted to having scoring systems all around me and too many areas of my life sleep, being one of them, Brian. But while most people may not use an app to give a three digit number to score their sleep each night, it's called Sleep Watch, I use it every day. Many others measure the quality of their mattress. That itself has become a cultural phenomenon. I think a lot of us might know the phrase sleep number. Well these days, sleep number gives itself to a public company. The ticker symbol is SNBR. Brian, have you ever used one of these mattresses?
Brian Stoffel: I have not. Although I've got to admit I'm interested when I see the commercials for them.
David Gardner: Because it's like a number 1 to 100 and you can dial 37 for you and 78 for her. Everybody sleeps soundly and it's just one mattress. It's all about your sleep number again, in an age addicted to scoring systems. An historian was pointing out recently to me that about 150 years ago no one really was scoring anything just about; there was no sense of big data or any likes or anything going on. We're all surrounded by scoring systems today, including underneath us at night for some of us. Brian Stoffel, what is the market cap range you would like to record Sleep Number Corporation, ticker symbol S-N-B-R?
Brian Stoffel: This is not a company I am familiar with, but I'm going to imagine that it's probably a smaller one that I might think, even though they've got enough money to get Dak Prescott on their commercials during football games. I'm going to say it's between $2.8 billion and $4.3 billion.
David Gardner: All right, $2.8 billion to $4.3 billion. Yasser, is this a stock you've ever researched or looked at or maybe a product that you use?
Yasser El-Shimy: I have not looked at it. Although I did think about it as a product I could potentially use. We all could use a good night of sleep for sure, but I imagined in my case, I'm not going to have that no matter what mattress I get, because I have two young kids. I'm going to go with outside the range.
David Gardner: You're going with outside the range. Now again, listeners at home, you're playing right along with us. You either say inside the range or outside the range, Yasser is going outside the range of $2.8 billion to $4.3 billion and [bell] he's right. Indeed, friends. I, myself was surprised how low the market cap has gone for this well-known consumer branded public company that has had some remarkable recent volatility. Sleep Number's market cap is $962.27 million as of market open Tuesday, Sept. 20. That is indeed outside Brian's range. Brian, I liked your answer. It felt comfortable and what I thought of sleep number and the truth is, as of about a year ago, that would've been a good call, but the stock has dropped from 150 down to 40 in the last year or so. Sleep Number has had a number done on it. I do want to point out over the 10-year run, this dock as well. It's a double from where it was five years ago from 20-40. But it had one of those COVID swoons in March of 2020 went from 60 to below 20 in one month, and then it went from below 20 to over 140 for that glorious year of something like summer 2020 to summer 2021, but not so good. Since one of the things guys we've talked about sometimes in the past is when you think a company has a higher market cap than it actually does, that can sometimes add a ticker to your watch list. Because Brian, if you thought this company, maybe a $3-billion company and by the way, it was not too long ago and it's one-third that maybe worth a look.
Brian Stoffel: I agree. It's not my investment, but I think that that thought recognition, that pattern recognition holds true.
David Gardner: And Brian, why does this one not really fit the Stoffel Folio?
Brian Stoffel: I don't see a ton of optionality for sleep number. I don't see them getting into cushions for cars or bring this to your sporting game and your butt won't be sore.
David Gardner: Well said, I'm not going to say anybody's but is sore because it's only one to nothing but Yasser one Brian, nothing. Let's move on to company No. 2. Yasser, did you ever follow the foolish four or dogs of the Dow? Are you aware of that strategy?
Yasser El-Shimy: I'm aware of the strategy, although I have not followed it as closely.
David Gardner: It first appeared in a book and the 1980s by Michael O' Higgins called beating the Dow and whether or not he invented it. It's not clear to me, we tweaked it a little bit and wrote about it as the foolish four in our first book, The Motley Fool Investment Guide, and the age-old practice is basically to look at the Dow Jones Industrials, find the ones that have performed the worst over the last year or three or five, however you want to do it? Then check the dividend yield to look for higher dividend yields and worst-performing stocks and then maybe to buy that, or at least consider buying that stock because these, after all, this I sometimes say, or the Unsinkable Molly Browns of American commerce, presumably if they're Dow Jones Industrials and if they've gotten beaten up and have attractive dividend yields, well, that might be a good list to beat the market and Michael O'Higgins showed in his book, and we updated the data in our initial one.
That sure enough, this has been a pretty good rinse and repeat way to beat the market. Now, the reason we eventually went away from it, one reason guys, you would know right away as with any regular listener, this podcast, back then we were much shorter term in our thinking and the idea of a new set of stocks to buy each year, sell out last year's, every year. That does a number on your tax bills and on your ability to compound at good rates. Not really fans of the so-called Foolish for back in the day or the Dow dogs anymore. But I've always still liked the idea and I'm glad we got to talk about it a little bit and share it out because I think it has a good underlying philosophy behind it. When you think of the Dow Jones Industrials, Yasser, without trying to quiz you because I don't think I do too well these days in which is in the 30, which aren't. Can you think of any really, really big medical companies that might come to mind, specifically ones that have a single syllable?
Yasser El-Shimy: Single syllable.
David Gardner: As a name. That starts with a letter M.
Yasser El-Shimy: Merck.
David Gardner: Good one You must be a professional. You nailed it. Ticker symbol, MRK, Merck, and company been at Dow Jones Industrial for a long time. More importantly, though, Yasser, we're concerned with the market cap today in the market cap range that you'd like to estimate for Merck. Again, ticker symbol, M-R-K.
Yasser El-Shimy: Wonderful. Like Brian before, this is not the company that I would have probably looked at doing my work. But Merck is a familiar household name of big pharmaceutical company and definitely one of those classic pharmaceutical companies in the Dow if you will. I'm going to give Brian a fairly generous range here and I'm going to say Merck's market cap is somewhere between $220 billion to $260 billion.
David Gardner: $220 billion to $260 billion. A $40 billion range to work with Brian, although in percentage terms not necessarily as generous as it sounds about a 20% or so parameter there. Brian Stoffel, listeners at home, Merck, $220 billion to $260 billion inside that range or outside that range.
Brian Stoffel: I'm going to say outside that range.
David Gardner: [Bell] Sure enough, you're right and we're tied one-to-one, not outside that range by much though. This one was close, Yasser, the market cap for Merck as trading opened yesterday, Tuesday, Sept. 20, $217.06 billion. It's outside the range of 220 to 260.
Yasser El-Shimy: I think I deserve a half a point for this one. The 2022 discount was the only reason I did that.
David Gardner: Merck, by the way, has been lifting its dividend about 10% a year or so over the last five years. The yield in the stock today, 3.2% for those yield hunters and those scoring at home. Guys, is this a stock that either of you owns?
Yasser El-Shimy: No, I don't.
David Gardner: Why not? This is a staple of American business, it is a company doing good work in this world, one that a lot of us grew up hearing about, even if it was a little opaque.
Yasser El-Shimy: I'm actually restricted from owning any pharmaceutical or food and beverage companies because my wife works at the FDA. But Merck would have definitely been one of those companies that I would have taken a look for at least my retirement portfolio for sure, but unfortunately, I can't.
David Gardner: Well, that's a really interesting answer, Yasser. Either I didn't know that or I'd forgotten that and between that and then Motley Fool restrictions that we have as employees, where if we mentioned a stock, for example, Sleep Number, on a podcast, we can't trade in advance of that or after that by a few days. Now, the direction. Yasser, are you able to buy any stocks?
Yasser El-Shimy: I am, just not in those categories. Sometimes the way we work at The Fool and we have all these restrictions, sometimes they just have to wait, it could of wait of a week and could be a few months, but eventually, I get my hands on those stocks.
David Gardner: Patience. Let's move on to company No. 3. We've got Brian one, Yasser one. Brian, do you make any concerted effort to stay fit?
Brian Stoffel: Yes.
David Gardner: What form does that take or forms?
Brian Stoffel: I go running about once every four days and I lift weights. I used to do a little bit more, but that pretty much eats up whatever time I might have available.
David Gardner: That's pretty impressive. Are you systematic with that four days? Do you circle it on your calendar? Do you start to feel an itch if you haven't run in five days? How does that play?
Brian Stoffel: I definitely feel an itch, but I don't circle it on my calendar. What the big thing is, is I start to feel like I need to if I haven't done it in some time.
David Gardner: Wonderful. Well, you've always looked trim to me, Brian, whether it was back in the day at Fool HQ when you came to work for a while full-time or as an older and yet still not that old gentleman approaching middle age with a little bit of a gray beard that you are scratching as we speak. You're in great shape and good for you. I'm curious, Do power your workouts with a proprietary, clinically proven formula at any point?
Brian Stoffel: This is so funny because I usually don't, but I will admit that I aim to get my best run at the year-end and always at the Turkey Trot. There's a Turkey Trot I always sign up for and I cheat because when I usually run, I'll do it in a fasted state, but when the Turkey Trot comes, I have snickers bar and I will have a Celsius drink to power me.
David Gardner: It does come in several delicious sparkling and non-carbonated flavors. Do you have a favorite flavor of choice for the Turkey Trot?
Brian Stoffel: I like the berry.
David Gardner: I have tried some of these, I like the orange. I haven't tried the berry. Have you tried the orange and you like the berry more?
Brian Stoffel: Yes.
David Gardner: I'm going to shift to berry next time. Thank you, Brian Stoffel. But I guess more to the point, the ticker symbol for Celsius Holdings is C-E-L-H. This is a stock, I never formerly recommended this myself, but there are a number of Fool analysts and stock pickers who are fans of this company have been. And man, talk about a stock that has lifted off in the last couple of years. It's had its volatility like all the rest, but this looks like a home run over the last few years. More to the point though, Brian Stoffel, what is the market cap range you'd like to accord Celsius Holdings ticker symbol C-E-L-H?
Brian Stoffel: We're going to go with $6.1 billion to $8.1 billion.
David Gardner: $6.1 billion to $8.1 billion, I like how you're rocking the point ones. That could be helpful or detrimental to Yasser. It's really hard to know how he's reacting to those right now. Yasser, 6.1-8.1 billion. On the face of it, a tight range of only two billion and yet a little bit more generous than you were giving Brian for your Merck, if we're scoring percentages, not points. Yasser, listeners at home, 6.1-8.1 billion is Celsius Holdings inside or outside that range?
Yasser El-Shimy: I'm going to go outside the range.
David Gardner: [Buzzer] It is indeed inside Brian's range, so Yasser, Brian scores that point. You said outside and boy, were you close to being right because the market cap for Celsius Holdings is $8.09 billion and it's almost like Brian Stoffel keeps up with these things and studies market caps in the wee hours of the morning.
Yasser El-Shimy: I think the stars are aligned against me today. This question, it's of $100 million, the previous question was $3 million or something like that. It's just crazy, come on.
Brian Stoffel: It's not even $100 million, it's $10 million.
Brian Stoffel: $10 million? Yes.
David Gardner: Good math, you've slipped that passed me yourself, Yasser. But Brian, you're absolutely right. Oh, my god, $10 million. Listeners at home again, if you said inside the range, give yourself a plus one. Brian, it seems like you have familiarity with this company. You're also a consumer of the product at least once a year. Is this a stock you own or follow closely because my golly, was that market cap close?
Brian Stoffel: Follow closely, yes, just because I think it's interesting because it's a consumer-facing brand and its only moat is its brand. That's why I'm not invested in it, but I like it and it is taking market share like crazy.
David Gardner: I'm not really following it, although I do use it from time to time. I haven't followed the stock. For those who haven't, you should know along with me that this stock was around $5 a share as 2020 began, today, the stock is trading at about $100 a share. We're talking about a 20-bagger over the last two and a half years and again, many of my favorite stocks aren't up that much. They're more like down 40% over the last year or two. This is a volatile stock. Celsius topping at just over 100 at the end of last year, bottoming this year closer to 40, but again, back up to 102. It's interesting, Brian, to think that this company whose products is, I would say, maybe less well-known than Sleep Number maybe it's just Sleep Number has been around longer, but the market cap, eight times Sleep Number's market cap. Any final thoughts about Celsius before we proceed to company No. 4?
Brian Stoffel: I'm very glad that you took the market caps at the beginning of the day because if right now Celsius is down even 1%, I think I would have lost that.
David Gardner: It's an actual point. The market not strong Tuesday at least as we're recording, so probably it was, but we're doing start of market trading on Tuesday as mentioned earlier. Let's move it on to company No. 4. How are you doing at home? If you're doing really well, you have three points. Yasser, now, as an American and I grew up in this country, I've spent my entire life in this country, basically, 56 years or so. It does seem to me that there is somewhat of a coastal bias felt by some in the U.S. I think that thinking goes that there's more business, there's more savvy, or more restaurant choices, or whatever it is on the coasts maybe because of geography, maybe because more people just go to the coasts of other places and hang there and the beach and others. As opposed to the Midwest or some might say, Middle America. Brian Stoffel, I'm not asking you this question, but I'm quite conscious that you are a Wisconsin man and I think a lot of us would say that as the middle of America. Yasser, there does seem to be some coastal buys felt by some of the U.S. Is there an Egyptian equivalent?
Yasser El-Shimy: For sure. We have this idea of Cairo versus the rest. Cairo being of course the capital city, it's a huge metropolis of over, almost 25 million people. Roughly one out of every four or five Egyptians resides in greater Cairo. There's definitely concentration of everything from colleges to businesses, and government offices in that city, and not so much if you travel even 100 miles outside.
David Gardner: Now I know you're not saying this, you didn't actually say this. You're not saying that there's not charm outside Cairo. There aren't great, amazing people and things happening in Egypt outside Cairo. You're not saying that?
Yasser El-Shimy: No, absolutely not. In fact, if I were to retire in Egypt in the future at some point, I probably would prefer to reside somewhere in the less densely populated cities of Egypt, either on the Red Sea or the Mediterranean Sea. That'll be my pick, not the hustle and bustle of Cairo.
David Gardner: That sounds amazing and I still haven't been to Egypt and thank you for sharing that, Yasser. Well, I guess the reason I'm asking about this, and I know Brian Stoffel will not only weigh in with his final guess, but I'd love to hear his viewpoint in a minute. But the reason I'm asking is because we're talking about a company whose name, and this is not one I'm familiar with. This is not a company that I've ever picked or researched. The name of the company is Mid-America Apartment Communities and the ticker symbol is M-A-A. It's a quick reminder, how do I find companies? Well for each market cap game show, I randomized from our Fool data base. We have a list of the companies that we favor and cover the most. I take the top 500 of those, I think of them as the Fool 500 and I randomized for that group and I happen to have come upon Mid-America Apartment Communities. It's a publicly traded REIT, that's a real estate investment trust. Mid-America is based in Memphis, Tennessee, it invests in apartments in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. Before I ask you for your market cap range, Yasser, have you ever heard of or looked at Mid-America Apartment Communities?
Yasser El-Shimy: I did a while back. I was looking at various REITs and Middle America Apartments definitely came up as part of the high-quality REIT companies worthy of consideration.
David Gardner: Excellent. That means you have more clue about Mid-America Apartment Communities than I do. I love my Middle America, I just don't know my real estate investment trusts that well, but forget about me, Yasser. Let me turn to you now and ask you, what is your market cap range you'll give to Mid-America Apartment Communities, ticker symbol M-A-A?
Yasser El-Shimy: Sure. I will give a market cap range of $12.8 billion to $17.8 billion.
David Gardner: $12.8 billion to $17.8 billion. I noticed you rocking the 0.8 in the same way that on the previous question, Brian rocked the 0.1. Is this a little bit of psychological warfare I'm starting to pick up on?
Yasser El-Shimy: You will never know.
David Gardner: [Laughter] Players at home, Brian Stoffel, Yasser has stated $12.8 billion to $17.8 billion for this company which owns well as of December a year or two ago, 300 apartment communities containing over 100,000 apartment units. The largest owner of apartments in the United States, the seventh largest apartment property manager in the United States, Brian Stoffel, players at home inside Yasser's range, of 12.8-17.8 or outside that range?
Brian Stoffel: I feel like he's playing mind games with me because my guess was going to be much lower. But he gave me such a generous range that I'm going to say inside.
David Gardner: [Buzzer] It is outside that range. But once again, friends, and this is why Brian and Yasser are invited onto this show, and many of my past guests, these people are professionals, they're really good at this. I wouldn't have known a thing about Mid-America Apartment Communities market cap, but it is $19.06 billion. Outside the range, but again, not by much. Only about $1 billion outside range from 19.
Yasser El-Shimy: Giving you a taste of your own medicine, Brian.
Brian Stoffel: Yeah, that's fair.
David Gardner: [Laughter] Brian. What state were you born in?
Brian Stoffel: I was born in Wisconsin.
David Gardner: You identify as a Wisconsinite?
Brian Stoffel: Very much so. It annoys my wife quite a bit, but I do.
David Gardner: When I use the phrase Mid-America, what do you think of?
Brian Stoffel: I usually think of more plains states like less populated because I live near Milwaukee, it's a major metropolitan area. I usually think of farmland, more like where I went to college.
David Gardner: Farmland, and I've driven across some of Americans, certainly seen some of it, not all of it, it's beautiful.
Brian Stoffel: Especially during the summer.
David Gardner: Especially during the summer. It's also really important. We're finding, especially given some of the world events in 2022, the importance of food and making sure that we're well cared for, or if possible, that we can grow as much as we can ourselves. There are a lot of people who love to buy local and eat local. Are you one such?
Brian Stoffel: I tried to as much as I can.
David Gardner: But that may or may not include Celsius Holdings drinks once a year, which probably aren't produced in Milwaukee.
Brian Stoffel: When you talk about beverages in Wisconsin, it's just beer or water and that's about it.
David Gardner: Well, let's keep the game moving. Friends it is Brian two, Yasser two. We're not working toward a five-to-five tie, are we? Let's go to company No. 5. Brian, if you had to toss out a couple of, let's say, your highest-conviction winners for the long term -- one, two, or three stocks that you really believe in that are presumably in your portfolio with stronger positions, you may not think that they're going to skyrocket in the next year, but you have high conviction that this company will win over the only term that counts, the long term, throw us a few stock picks.
Brian Stoffel: The top three for me would be Amazon, MercadoLibre, and Axon Enterprise.
David Gardner: How about for the fun of it, a line or two elevate our pitching each one.
Brian Stoffel: Amazon with their fulfilment network plus AWS that's hard to beat. MercadoLibre it's much the same thing in South America, except instead of AWS it's their payment platform, Mercado Pago. And Axon is the closest thing to a functional monopoly in my portfolio.
David Gardner: I like all three of those companies. I think of each of them as a rule breaker unto itself. I certainly love the idea that this forms some of the bedrock of yours and your family's portfolio, is awesome. Thank you for sharing that, Brian. I will share out that in the Fool 500, one of the very highest-rated stocks of all is our next company. The ticker symbol is M-D-B. The company is MongoDB. Is this also in the Stoffel folio?
Brian Stoffel: It most definitely is.
David Gardner: I have a lot of the companies that we cover in my family portfolios, one or another of them. Yet, I don't always know the market cap, even of the stocks that I hold. It will be interesting to hear your range right now Brian for MongoDB ticker symbol M-D-B.
Brian Stoffel: My range is going to be $14.7 billion to $15.3 billion.
David Gardner: 14.7 to 15.3, by far, the narrowest range presented on this edition of the Market Cap Game Show. Anyway, thus far, Yasser players at home, $14.7 billion to $15.3 billion. Yasser, is MongoDB inside or outside Brian's range?
Yasser El-Shimy: Well, speaking of mind games, this is an awfully tight range right here and I see what you're trying to do, Brian. But you know, I'm not going to fall for it. I'm going to go with outside the range.
David Gardner: [Bell] It is indeed outside the range, though as I'm starting to become accustomed, not far outside another great stated range. The market cap as of the opening of Tuesday's trading Sept. 20 for MongoDB was $16.1 billion. Therefore, if you said outside a tight 14.7 to 15.3 range, you give yourself a plus one, players at home, and we're going to give you a plus one, Yasser, for that. How confident were you as you answered ""outside the range,"" Yasser?
Yasser El-Shimy: I was about 80% confident. I knew that it was higher. I didn't realize how perfectly close it was to Brian's range, but I knew it was higher.
David Gardner: It should be pointed out with the market not having a very strong day yesterday, of course, we're taping this before we even know how the market closed on Tuesday, it might have ended up in Brian's range, but as things live, friends and as the rules have stated, this time it's outside. Yasser, we're going to be a plus one. You are at a 3-2 lead. Yasser, I somehow forced a couple of stock picks out of Brian Stoffel. Could I force a couple out of you using the same considerations?
Yasser El-Shimy: Of course. I would say that one of the companies that I have the highest conviction in and one that I don't even spend a lot of time thinking about, which is a good trade for a stock with high conviction, is The Trade Desk. It's a company that completely reinvented how digital advertisements are effectively traded between buyers and sellers. It has completely overcome, or maybe I shouldn't say completely, but it has definitely overcome the big challenges of Apple and Alphabet cracking down on cookies and other tracking software that advertisers love to have. A lot of advertisers are flocking toward The Trade Desk. That's one stock I like. Another stock would be Confluent, ticker symbol C-F-L-T. It's one of my highest-conviction stocks. I believe that data is the future. You started the show, David, you said we score everything, we keep numbers and everything. Confluent helps keep data moving within an enterprise. It's effectively a data-streaming platform. I believe that the way they have their proprietary software, Apache Kafka, that they've built, and customers love it, and I see a much brighter future ahead.
David Gardner: Well, thank you for that. We don't do five-stock samplers anymore on this podcast, but you guys just provided five pretty good stocks that I know a lot of our listeners either already own in some cases or I'm sure with interests will begin to research further. We're at halftime right now, guys, and I say, let's open up our halftime follies. I have a simple halftime question for you both. After all, the purpose of this podcast is to make the world smarter, happier, and richer. That's the purpose of The Motley Fool. One of the ways we make the world happier is occasionally we share out our best streaming entertainment ideas. We live in the age of capitalists streaming, arguably, there are too many shows that one could stream at this point and even more coming. Then there's YouTube, which aren't even professionally-produced -- in many cases -- streaming shows. And yet they get a lot of views, too. We are living in a video-centric age, fellows, I think you know that. But I thought I would ask. Let me turn to Brian first. What's a recent streaming show that has given you delight and you think listeners, if they haven't already watched, would enjoy?
Brian Stoffel: Think any listener who might have come of age in the 90s and is a sports fan would enjoy The Last Dance which chronicles the [Chicago] Bulls, their dynasty building up, falling apart. Being from Milwaukee, was huge in my upbringing because we always lost to them. But it's really fascinating and it's also really fascinating to go back and realize that Michael Jordan retired and went and played baseball for 18 months.
David Gardner: It is incredible to think back on it. I think he went to the Chicago White Sox, staying in town, and I remember he was in minor league ball. Did he ever get an official Major League at bat? I can't remember, Brian.
Brian Stoffel: No he didn't have an impact. He wouldn't have been in Double-A. according to the documentary. The reason he started in Double-A was because it was the only level that had the facilities to handle the media circus. It probably would have been better for him to start down in Single-A rookie ball.
David Gardner: Fantastic. Well, I've watched a portion of The Last Dance, like many shows I'm halfway through, and then got distracted by 14 other streaming shows. But I know it's a wonderfully produced show and I'm even a [University of North Carolina] Tar Heel. I shouldn't be a Michael Jordan fan except I showed up at North Carolina as a freshman the year after he left early for the NBA, so I never really got to cheer on Michael, and I always view it more as a Bull than a Tar Heel. But I know much of the world sees it differently anyway. Great show. Yasser, let me turn to you before we go back to the game show. Yasser, what's a streaming show you would recommend to give delight to Rule Breaker Investing listeners?
Yasser El-Shimy: Well, I'm a big fan of everything off-beat. Recently I caught up on Season 3 of a show called Barry. It's on HBO Max. If you want to see the story of a veteran who turned into an assassin and then tried to quit being an assassin in order to become an actor in L.A., That's the show for you.
David Gardner: I'm wondering, Yasser, how did you hear about Barry? I'm half curious, not just the shows we watch, but how we hear about the Bert keep-up.
Yasser El-Shimy: I actually don't necessarily read a lot on shows or go browsing the internet looking for show recommendations. Usually, what I do is I would browse through my favorite streaming apps and I would try and read the description for the show. If I feel that there's something there, I'll give it a try.
David Gardner: Well, Barry, which is the Bill Hader vehicle, I guess it's three seasons now I haven't watched that. I have heard good things. I'm a big Internet Movie Database fan, and 8.4 out of 10 from 80,000 voters is enough for me to know, that is quality and it's probably a show I need to be watching. Thank you for that, Yasser. Thank you, Brian. Without further ado, half time's over, let's go to company No. 6. While we're getting back to the serious stuff of the game show that we're playing, Yasser, I find myself still wanting to play another game, a metagame, a side game, if you will, a game of word association. Would you play this game with me briefly?
Yasser El-Shimy: I can try.
David Gardner: I will share with you a word or a phrase and you will simply say back the first or second thing that comes to mind as you hear these things. Let's go, rapid-fire here. Most beloved soccer or football team?
Yasser El-Shimy: A.S. Roma.
David Gardner: Thank you for that. Queen Elizabeth.
Yasser El-Shimy: The second.
David Gardner: Not particularly interesting, but it doesn't have to be. It's the word association game [laughs] came to mind. It makes sense. I got two more for you. No. 3, you're ready?
Yasser El-Shimy: Sure.
David Gardner: Plastics.
Yasser El-Shimy: Recycle.
David Gardner: My last one. You were supposed to say The Graduate, by the way, that was the Dustin Hoffman film where he gets pulled aside by the avuncular friend of his dad at the party is like ""I got one word for you, kid. You ready?"" Dustin Hoffman comes out with him and he says, ""Yeah, what?"" ""Plastics."" That's going to be the future, which in a lot of ways it has been. But my last one for you, Yasser, as we get closer to our company now, my last word, association game word for you is lasers.
Yasser El-Shimy: Lasers, weapons.
David Gardner: Well, they can take many forms and well, especially when I think about light sabers, which looks like a standing laser coming out of it's pommel. They can be weapons and they are lots of different things. Coherent Corp. also comes to mind for some people when they hear lasers. This is a company, a leader recently in a merger with II-VI, one of its competitors. It's now a larger merged company. The company took on the name Coherent Corp, officially recently, ticker symbol C-O-H-R. Yasser, you had just ended our last company description with one of your favorite companies, Confluent. I was thinking about how similar the word Coherent seems to Confluent. Have you ever looked into Coherent?
Yasser El-Shimy: I have not. I will admit that.
David Gardner: Well, that always makes the market cap game show more interesting. With that said, let me turn right back to Yasser. We're not playing word-association-game anymore, we're playing give us your best guess at the market cap range of this company. Again, it's Coherent Corp., ticker symbol, C-O-H-R. Yasser, your range, please.
Yasser El-Shimy: Sure. I will give a range of $14.5 billion to 16.5 billion.
David Gardner: $14.5 billion to $16.5 billion. Players at home, Brian Stoffel, is it inside that range or outside that range?
Brian Stoffel: I'm going to say outside the range.
David Gardner: [Bell] Sure enough, it is outside. In fact, this is the only real miss we've had in terms of the right-sizing for a company thus far. Yasser, I have to admit I haven't been following this company very carefully myself anymore. Had I been, I would know that the market cap was $5.43 billion, which is what the market cap was as of yesterday for Coherent. Therefore, if you answered outside that range, players at home and Yasser as well, you would have gotten a plus one.
Yasser El-Shimy: I had expected it to be less than 50% of Arista Networks, which works in a similar business that I felt that it would be on the bigger side because of the merger. But you know what? I was way off.
David Gardner: You were at this time, and I easily could have been myself, but more importantly, Brian did say outside that range, and so I think friends, we're back to a tie. Brian three, Yasser three. Let's move on to company No. 7. Brian Stoffel, what are a couple of, in your mind, typical reasons that companies change their names?
Brian Stoffel: Branding. I guess they're related. One is branding, the other is a change in focus. If something bad happens, I remember there was an airline that changed its name when it had an accident. But the other could be branding because like Axon, the company I just talked about it used to be Taser, and they changed their focus and became Axon, focus on body cameras.
David Gardner: Great example. Can you think of any other big, higher-profile renamings far bigger, let's go with, than Taser in recent market history?
Brian Stoffel: The two that come to mind are Alphabet and Meta.
David Gardner: Those are really, really big. Without giving away the market cap here, the one I'm thinking of, not quite as large as those companies, because I never really followed Square that carefully, I was certainly familiar with the technology, I was certainly a user, but never did recommend a winning stock a lot of the time, a volatile stock. But Square, do we all know this? Listener at home, wherever you are across this fair planet, did you know? You probably did. Square renamed itself recently to Block. Just Block. Block, Inc, B-L-O-C-K. In the same way Facebook went to Meta, Square became Block. Brian, is this a stock that you own?
Brian Stoffel: It is not a stock that I've owned, and it's been a while since I've looked at it.
David Gardner: Which is again, what we want from our experts, occasionally, for them to be maybe asleep at the switch, here and there makes the game more fun. You guys have been so good with the market cap ranges. I'm wondering, Brian, whether you can be really good with Block, Inc. What is the market cap for Block, Inc? Get the ticker symbol here, friends, S-Q.
Brian Stoffel: The last I checked, it was down a ton from where it had been. It's been a while since then, but I'm going to guess big range here, $45 billion to $70 billion.
David Gardner: That is a big range. It'll be interesting to see whether it's inside or outside that range. Listeners at home, prepare your answer. I know you're always making the call before I read off the official result, you're playing along with us. Yasser, Brian said $45 billion to $70 billion, inside or outside that range?
Yasser El-Shimy: Well, I know that it's definitely outside the range. Brian was absolutely right that the stock had been absolutely pummeled over the past year or so, and I believe that has taken it below this range.
David Gardner: [Bell] You are indeed correct, although not by much. Once again, the market cap for Block, which has retained a Square-like ticker symbol of S-Q, the market cap is $40.09 billion. $40 billion, just outside the 45-to-70 generous range that Brian offered. By saying outside, Yasser, you've taken a 4-3 lead. Players at home, if you said outside, give yourself a plus one. Yes, this stock has been very volatile. Hugely to the upside through the middle of the last decade, the stock made a meteoric rise from the nearly single-digits now looking backward from these prices around 2016, it almost touched 300, last year, it is down to 62 as we're talking. It's lost about four-fifths of its value in about one year. Brian, does that make you bullish?
Brian Stoffel: I have a really hard time understanding what the moat of a company like Square is.
David Gardner: I really like your focus on moat. I know your work and some of your frameworks and how you think, Brian. Many who've watched you on Motley Fool Live will expect that from you. Many who are hearing you for the first time might not realize that this is how you roll. What do you mean by moat exactly, and why is that so important for you?
Brian Stoffel: Well, it's something I learned when I invested in Whole Foods, is that you can have a great company with a great product that does a lot of good for the world. But if it can be copied just like you can go to a farmer and ask them to plant organic food and say you'll sell it in your grocery store, then you can be undercut on price. All the value goes to the world, which is a good thing, but it doesn't go to the company or its investors.
David Gardner: Understood. Was that really the stock that changed your mind? Do you still feel burnt by Whole Foods? Do you shop at Whole Foods?
Brian Stoffel: I will. We don't have one terribly close to us. I don't feel burned by Whole Foods because Whole Foods was just doing its thing. It was fulfilling its mission. I'm all for that. More than anything, I think I've made a ton of money off of that lesson because it's made me avoid stocks that don't have a moat. If it can be copied, it probably will be copied eventually.
David Gardner: Well said. There are some things you can't copy, like I was thinking of Amazon, we have Jeff Bezos, you don't. That's one of our favorite moat examples, probably The Fool, and it's about humanity, and human capital, as opposed to any number you might find on the balance sheet or income statement. Well, that's brief grandstanding on my part. But thank you, Brian, for sharing that viewpoint. It is 4-3 right now. Yasser, you have taken a one-point lead. I need to turn back to you, sir, as we move to stock No. 8.
Yasser El-Shimy: Don't worry, we're going to tie again.
David Gardner: It's starting to feel more and more that way. Yasser, what are a couple of reasons that companies have multiple ticker symbols?
Yasser El-Shimy: Multiple ticker symbols. I know this is common with specs, for example, where you have two classes stocks with warrants and the regular. But it's also common for companies that have two or more classes of shares to trade with different ticker symbol, for example, Zillow Group can trade under the ticker symbol Z or Z-G, depending on which class of stock you are.
David Gardner: It's funny to me. First of all, I wish that that hadn't happened because it causes online sites that feature the stock market, for example, fool.com comes to mind, to have to reflect the same company, basically, with two different ticker symbols and usually two different market caps as well, which can be slightly confusing, but even just having to repeat. It's almost like as a baseball fan looking down a box score and seeing that you have both the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Cubs playing against, I don't know, let's go with the Milwaukee Brewers. It's just confusing. Why do we have the same thing repeated twice? It causes all problems with market data. I really wish founders -- and I love you founders -- I really wish you didn't create your own separate class of stock with a separate ticker symbol. I'm not going to talk about specs, but I am glad, Yasser, that you mentioned Zillow Group because it turns out that is company No.8. Now, I am going to use for our purposes here -- and the market caps are different, although only slightly -- we're going to use Z-G for this one, Zillow Group.
I think a lot of us recognize Zillow is the online site that gives prices to our neighbors' houses or that vacation house you dream of one day, and that price may or may not be accurate. It's the Zestimate. In general, I'm a fan of Zestimates. People in the real estate industry, especially Realtors, often aren't. Although ironically, there are huge fans often of Zillow because Zillow butters and spread mainly by people who are Realtors advertising for their local ZIP codes. It's generally a win-win, Zillow with some escapades as a buyer of real estate and then trying to sell real estate. That didn't work out very well in the last few years. Very disappointing from a standpoint of optionality, the company's certainly having been repriced. Here, I am talking more about it. It's one of those companies I own, which is why I guess I can be valuable in the topic. But forget about my view of Zillow Group or what I might think about it. I'm much more interested right now, Yasser, in your market cap range for Zillow Group, ticker symbol Z-G.
Yasser El-Shimy: Right. Not Z, Z-G. Got it.
David Gardner: That's right, and this makes a huge amount of difference, and that's where my tongue-in-cheek is.
Yasser El-Shimy: Yeah. Let's go with a tight range here. Let's say $6.9 billion to $7.96 billion.
David Gardner: $6.9 billion to $7.9 billion. I try not to tilt anybody, especially my listeners or the person about the guests, but I'm going to say that's not a bad range at all. I mean, this is fairly consistent with where we are in this show that it seems like Yasser and Brian -- and I hasten to add they have no idea what companies I'm going to pick and they are not looking at any browsers, anything there in soundproof, video proof chambers that we've sequestered them in their own homes somehow -- and so they don't know what's coming and yet you guys are pretty good at this, and I'm going to say that was pretty good again. Brian Stoffel, players at home. Yasser said $6.9 billion to $7.9 billion. I noticed the repetition again of the single decimal point, a little bit of a shot across the bow. I think Brian Stoffel. But Brian, inside or outside that range.
Brian Stoffel: I'm going to go outside the range.
David Gardner: [Bell] And you've done well to do so because once again, it is outside the range, but only barely of an already very impressively tight range. So Zillow Group's market cap is $8.55 billion. If you'd looked at just ticker symbol Z, it's more like 8.01, but both of those are outside a very tight range of $6.9 billion to $7.9 billion. Players at home. If you said outside the range, give yourself a plus one. I'm going to give a plus one to my friend Brian Stoffel. My friends, it's four to four.
Yasser El-Shimy: I told you we were going to tie again.
Brian Stoffel: David, there's an episode of Ted Lasso where the team ties its first, like, eight games of the second season, and then they finally lose. And they have a party, and they said, ""What's the party for?"" They said, ""We didn't tie for the first time."" Even if we don't tie and I lose, I still think I'm going to throw a party.
David Gardner: Well, you are both very worthy competitors, and while we may just have spoiled season two of Ted Lasso, shame on you listeners if you haven't already gotten through season three. So giddy-up. All right, let's move on to our final two companies. It's four to four. We're going to turn next to Brian and ask you kind of offbeat questions. It doesn't fit with the rest of the conversation today. Brian, have you ever had a particularly good or particularly bad experience buying a car?
Brian Stoffel: No, I can't say I have. I've only bought one car ever and it was pretty straightforward.
David Gardner: New or used?
Brian Stoffel: It was new ,and it's still the car I own today. I've had it for 10 years.
David Gardner: Did you do research ahead of time? Did you take their first offer? Did you walk away angrily and come back a week later? What was the approach?
Brian Stoffel: No. I did my research. I knew what a fair price was, Went in, we were lucky enough to have the cash saved up to pay for it. We left that day with the car, honestly, about an hour-and-a-half later.
David Gardner: I love it. There is something about that Midwestern charm. These things are cliches and stereotypes would probably not fully true. But when you say honestly, I'm just picturing you, an honest man, going into a Midwestern car dealership, having an honest conversation, you said luckily, but there's not luck there. You had the cash because you'd saved it, and I know you live below your means and you're very good at that. And honestly, you came by an honest car in an honest place and it sounds like it's a happy ending, and this lightly relates to the company we're talking about, but then not directly because it sounds like you didn't buy that by auction.
Brian Stoffel: Did not.
David Gardner: You didn't go into an online site and started looking around and poking around and trying to figure out whether you would buy that used car on Copart.com. Copart is a global provider of online vehicle-auction and remarketing services. It's not as much of a consumer brand per se. A lot of automotive resellers work with Copart. It is a very impressive, long-standing company. It was an S&P 500 company today, not to give away the market caps, and people in Dallas, Texas, may know the company since its locally headquartered there. Brian, have you ever looked at Copart?
Brian Stoffel: I have not.
David Gardner: Well, I'm sorry to hear that as I know, you have your market beater name, but you missed one there because Copart really has been a spectacular performer and I can think of it dearly, as pretty sure I picked it for Motley Fool Stock Advisor many years ago. I don't own it myself though. It's a reminder so many of us at The Motley Fool are often picking more stocks than we ourselves can even own, having picked hundreds of stocks over the years. How many times do I say, ""Man, I wish I'd actually bought that one that I picked."" But if you've been listening to The Motley Fool, are following us for any meaningful period of time, you'll realize that how we performed for you with our stock picks for many of us is much more important than how our own portfolios do. So I do love that we picked Copart, ticker symbol C-P-R-I-T, for Stock Advisor members even though I've never had the benefit of owning it myself. But more importantly, let's talk about the market cap of Copart. And again, Brian, this is your final chance to state a range for this episode of The Market Cap Game Show. Brian, what's your market cap range for Copart?
Brian Stoffel: So it's going to be $25.1 billion to $38.7 billion.
David Gardner: 25.1 to, did you say, 38.7?
Brian Stoffel: That's correct.
David Gardner: Are you allowing such a generous range because you find yourself less sure than some of the other ranges you've specified, or are you playing games with our listeners?
Brian Stoffel: Wouldn't you like to know?
David Gardner: All right, Yasser, players at home, Brian has said $25.1 billion to $38.7 billion for Copart, ticker symbol C-P-R-I-T. Yasser, inside or outside that range?
Yasser El-Shimy: Yeah. About sets off on David. I'm going to go with inside the range.
David Gardner: [Bell] Indeed, it is $26.52 billion is the market cap of Copart, so it was inside the range. Yasser, you have taken a five-to-four lead, creating a showdown around company No. 10. But before we go there, Yasser, have you had a particularly good or bad experience ever buying a vehicle?
Yasser El-Shimy: So I would say I've bought and sold cars at least four times so far, and my first experience trading in a car at the dealership convinced me that I just never want to do this again. I mean, everything about the used-car dealership makes for a horrible experience from the haggling to the long waits to just being surprised with last-minute details you didn't think about. All of that makes for a pretty abysmal experience, which is why I have been buying and selling my cars online since.
David Gardner: Well, I hear you, and Copart, of course, does a huge business there. Again, a lot of this is just facing the dealers themselves, but 80% of the company's revenue comes from the service fees just collected for the use of its online auction platform. Does it sound like eBay? It's kind of the same business but aimed at the automotive industry, so an interesting long performing winning stock. I'm seeing here 10 years ago, the stock was around 15. Today it's at 109. Ain't bad for a pretty quiet, sleepy company that most people can't name or certainly give the ticker symbol for, but now all of us know the market cap. Yep, $26.52 billion.
All right, let's move to the dramatic conclusion. We're not going to have a tie this episode. Brian, you can either guess wrong now and just not put us through the tiebreaker or guess right and force our hand at our first-ever Rule Breaker Investing Market Cap Game Show tiebreaker. Which one do you think you're going to do, Brian, before we start?
Brian Stoffel: I mean, if history is any indication, it's going to be a tie.
David Gardner: If we were doing this before you came on the show here, you've done this. This is your fourth time now and the previous three scores were ...
Brian Stoffel: ... Five to five, five to five, and five to five.
David Gardner: Here we go. Yasser, five, Brian four. Turning now to Yasser. Yasser, before you came to the Fool -- and you've been with us for a couple of years and it's been a delight to work with you, even though I'm not as active or regular as I once was, I'm a Fool for life as you well know, co-chairman of our company, love what you're doing and what we're all doing to make the world smarter, happier, and richer. But Yasser, before you came to the Fool, did you ever listen to this podcast?
Yasser El-Shimy: Yeah, all the time. In fact, it's one of the main reasons I decided to apply for a job at The Motley Fool -- is listening to the podcast.
David Gardner: I'm delighted to know that. Did you listen to the early days of The Market Cap Game Show?
Yasser El-Shimy: Yes. I mean, I would say I've started listening to the RBI podcasts around 2015-2016, and yeah, so I've heard my fair share.
David Gardner: Do you remember that Matt Argersinger was my first guest. And back then it wasn't a head-to-head game, it was just me quizzing Matt, those first early episodes?
Yasser El-Shimy: Yes, I do.
David Gardner: Do you remember that there was an iconic company that I would randomize, but if we keep coming back and each time somehow, Matt, would get it wrong and he'd always under-guess it. Do you remember that?
Yasser El-Shimy: You know, that one is not coming to mind. I know the one that tripped Emily [Flippen] a lot, and that was Etsy.
David Gardner: She continued Matt Argersinger's tradition because that is sure enough. The company and I did happen to randomize this one out of the full 500 for this show. This was not intentional even the ordering was randomized. So for us to close this episode of The Market Cap Game Show, hailing back to our earliest origins at this moment of high drama, is very random and very special indeed.
Brian Stoffel: It's worth noting that when I tied Brian Feroldi the second time, Etsy was the tiebreaker.
David Gardner: Perfect. I have a hard time remembering all of our past game shows, and I'm not even a professional game show host. Think of people who do this every day and people like, do you remember that thing three or four 17 years ago and I had forgotten but I'm so glad you said that, Brian. And now, let me turn to Yasser and ask you, Yasser, what is your range of the market cap for Etsy ticker symbol E-T-S-Y?
Yasser El-Shimy: I will go with $23 billion to $26 billion.
David Gardner: Just sticking with some round numbers this time, keeping it simple.
Yasser El-Shimy: Yes.
David Gardner: I'm not going to get in the way of drama. I know when to sit back, get away from the mic, and just let the game take over -- $23 billion to $26 billion: Brian Stoffel, listeners at home, inside or outside that range?
Brian Stoffel: I'm going to go outside.
David Gardner: [Bell] You've done it, Brian. You've done it. You got it.
Brian Stoffel: What for?
David Gardner: In fact, it wasn't even close because the actual market cap for Etsy is $14.7 billion. The tradition of overestimating, thinking that Etsy is much bigger than it actually is, has persisted to the present day. Let's be very clear, fellow Fools, Etsy was worth a lot more until recently. It's one of those many stocks as a Rule Breaker that had a great run throughout much of the last decade. And yet in the last year, the stock has dropped from its all-time high, at the end of last year, at 300. It's down closer to 100 as we speak. Its market cap, as I mentioned, $14.72 billion, which is outside the range of 23-26. You guys have done it. You forced my hand.
Brian Stoffel: Happened again.
David Gardner: Well, this is a first, and I'm really glad in a way that it happened because it had to, although it didn't have to at all. It lets me feature the mailbag entry of a concerned listener who reached out after last quarter's show and said, ""Guys, there's a better way to end this than just say five to five."" His name is Sam Stevens and I shared this on the Mailbag episode earlier this year but I'm going to reshare it because I don't expect everybody remembers all my mailbag. Sam Stevens, who by the way was a former Motley Fool intern and obviously a longtime Fool and a listener of the Rule Breaker Investing podcasts, had this to say. He said"" ""Hi, David. Here's a tiebreaker idea for The Market Cap Game Show. An 11th stock is presented. To ensure no advantage is given to either player by going first or second, both players must simultaneously and secretly write down a range of market caps. The contestants then reveal their written answers one after another, but the correct answer is, of course, not revealed until after.""
Now, if one contestant provided a correct range, the other didn't, well, of course, that contestant wins. You can include yourself, all listeners everywhere at home, in this very same exercise. You too, dear listener, are also writing down your market cap range. If one of you is right, the others are wrong, that person, of course, wins. If everyone's right, if both in this case are correct, well, the tighter range wins. Sam's smart. He was a Motley Fool intern, he's grown up now. Hey, Sam, if no one's correct, well, the range with the closest bound to the correct answer will win. Sam concluded, by the way of his Mailbag item earlier this year, you can actually play the whole game this way. But he said, ""I like it better as a tiebreaker."" I do, too. We don't want to make this too complex. Anyway, Sam Stevens, thank you for leaning in. This is known, starting today, as the Stevens Sudden Death Rule. It is being invoked for the first time right here, right now. Gentlemen, players at home, are we all ready?
Brian Stoffel: I'm ready.
David Gardner: As they say, sometimes this on the raceways, ""Gentlemen, start your market caps."" This company is one of those cloud-based businesses that people loved for awhile and seemingly now hate or have hated recently. This is one, my brother, Tom Gardner, CEO at The Motley Fool, I believe he had recently a chance to interview, talk a little bit with the brass of this company. He came away impressed, I'll say that. This is not a stock I've recommended, I don't know it very well. But a lot of people these days, at least those who follow the stock market, might've heard the name Cloudflare. If they're really good, they would know the ticker symbol is N-E-T. Cloudflare is our 11th Stevens Sudden Death Rule company. Rick Engdahl, cue the fake Jeopardy waiting music for about 10 seconds so all players everywhere can think of their market cap range for Cloudflare, ticker symbol N-E-T.
David Gardner: Now, I do want to mention that we are now 3:08 p.m. Eastern on Sept. 20. This is a live market cap as we record because I wasn't expecting to have to do an 11th company and I don't know what Cloudflare's market cap was at the start of trading today. This one is about as live as we get on these one-day delayed podcasts. By the way, a lot of podcasts, and I'm sometimes on other people's podcasts and I love doing that. I'll say, I'll be in your podcasts. Then they're like, great. We do the podcast and they're like, ""This will be on in seven weeks,"" and [laughs] I say: ""What? Wait, seven weeks? Everything will have changed by then."" I take pride, Rick Engdahl, my producer to humble ever does his, but we turn this baby around in 24 hours every single week, eighth year in counting. Rick's really good. That's why I say this is about as live as this show can ever get. I'm going to ask Brian Stoffel first to provide his range of market cap for Cloudflare.
Brian Stoffel: My range, if it comes in there, is $19 billion to $30 billion.
David Gardner: $19 billion to $30 billion. Listeners at home, I know you're holding up your piece of paper or shouting out your range as we speak. I turn to Yasser El-Shimy. Yasser, your range of market cap for Cloudflare, ticker symbol N-E-T.
Yasser El-Shimy: My range for Cloudflare is $35 billion to $45 billion. If this is $32.5 billion, I'm going to throw my headset.
David Gardner: Well, you are both worthy contestants and even better than that, you are noble men. That's what I want to do on this earth. I want to hang out with people who are noble of all genders, all generations, and all cultures. I love it. I thank you both for your work. I'm here to announce that we have our first-ever tiebreaker winner, and it is Brian Stoffel, who guessed a slightly wider range, but more importantly a lower range. Because Cloudflare, having lost a lot of value from, I don't know, like 180 last year, is down to about 61 as we speak. That puts its market cap at $20.73 billion, inside Brian's 19-30 range, short of Yasser's range. Congratulations both to Yasser and to Brian, our champion, this show and everybody who played along at home, presumably some of which got an even better score than our contestants. Yes, that happens, too. Brian, thank you so much. One quick line from you as champion.
Brian Stoffel: I don't think it counts as a champion if you've tied every time, but I'll take it.
David Gardner: Honorable in victory and noble in defeat. In fact, some people love to cheer for the guy who just came up short. We see ourselves in that person sometimes, Yasser. I think it's fair to call you a Rookie of the Year of this game. This is which number Market Cap Game Show for you?
Yasser El-Shimy: I believe this is my third or fourth.
David Gardner: We'll do with that.
Yasser El-Shimy: Probably.
David Gardner: I think it's third.
Yasser El-Shimy: 1,1, tied 2, I guess, and lost on the sudden death.
David Gardner: How about a line of encouragement to the losers? I include myself everywhere.
Yasser El-Shimy: Well, keep your chin up. It's OK to lose. You win some, you lose some. The journey is more important than the destination. I've had a lot of fun playing this game with you, David, of course, but also with Brian and Tim Beyers before Brian. I look forward to coming back in the, hopefully, not too distant future.
David Gardner: Wonderful. Thank you, Yasser. You are an excellent returning champion and returning tie-er. You performed wonderfully.
I want to thank both of my talented contestants and, of course, all three of us along with my pal, Rick. Thank you for playing along at home. It's a delight to do this four times a year. I said at the top to the guys offline before we started. It's only four times a year, therefore by definition, it's special because there's scarcity to these times together, and I have so much fun. Thank you, again, to Yasser, to Brian, and to you at home for playing The Market Cap Game Show. Fool on.

Chris Hill: Don't look now, but big retailers are making big investments in the future. Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Chris Hill, joining me in studio, Motley Fool senior analyst Jason Moser. It's good to be back in the studio.
Jason Moser: It's always good to be back in this. A little chilly, but it's good to be back.
Chris Hill: We're going to have to have some sweatshirts just on hold. The listeners don't care about whether or not we're comfortable. Before we get to the retail, let's get to Disney's big event over the weekend. They had the D23 Expo and overwhelmingly was focused on new movies, and new programming coming to Disney+, but CEO Bob Chapek was on hand and talking to the media, and by way of background, Dan Loeb, who we've talked about every once in a while on this show, activist investor from the firm Third Point. Loeb has been publicly pushing for Disney to spin off ESPN and in at least one and possibly more than one interviews, Chapek was asked about that and just shot it down point-blank. You and I were talking right before we started recording. The surprising thing to me is that Dan Loeb completely reversed course. Let me just read this thing he tweeted out. We have a better understanding of ESPN's potential as a stand-alone business and another vertical for Disney to reach a global audience to generate ad and subscriber revenues. We look forward to seeing Mr. Pitaro, Jimmy Pitaro, the president of ESPN. We look forward to seeing Mr. Pitaro execute on the growth and innovation plans, generating considerable synergies as part of the Walt Disney Company.
Jason Moser: Synergies.
Chris Hill: Were you also surprised at Loeb? Part of me wonders did they have a private conversation? Was this just in response to Chapek? Because by the way, when you look at what's happening with live sports being the last thing to actually generate meaningful ratings for television networks, both broadcast and cable, and the reports we're getting on the next Super Bowl already being almost completely sold out, I'm on Chapek's side in terms of no, we're keeping ESPN because we believe in the future.
Jason Moser: Well, yeah, I think that when we talk about Disney today, more so today than really probably ever before, this is a true entertainment company reaching every corner of the entertainment industry, whether it's the parks, the on-site, or ultimately what you find in video form, whether it's in the theaters or on one of their direct consumer offerings. We've talked about this for years in regard to Netflix and this move toward streaming away from the bundle in a little bit more to the a la carte offerings. Reed Hastings had the foresight years back to really recognize the value of exclusive content. I don't think that's something you can really emphasize enough. Exclusive content really does make a big difference, particularly now in this landscape where there are so many streaming apps, so many different services now.
It is getting to be a little bit frustrating from the consumer's perspective because you're telling me, instead of having this convenient bundle that I used to have, now I've got to have this whole collection of 6, 7, 8 different streaming services to be able to watch all of the stuff that I want to watch. I think that when you consider the exclusive nature of sports, I absolutely understand why Chapek would want to hang onto ESPN. It feels like maybe it gets batted around a little bit from critics as far as how the business has performed lately, but the bottom line is there's a ton of brand equity still on ESPN and they do something that not a lot of other properties do.
They really do have that brand equity in sports that gives them a lot of opportunities to grow here in the near future. For me, I think it makes absolute sense ultimately to hang onto it because it gives them access to that exclusive content, and then ultimately exclusive content is going to garner the eyeballs, which is what advertisers want. You see Disney being able to capitalize on not only the subscription fees but really more so the advertising. When you consider the other properties that Disney has, whether it's Hulu or Disney+, you see all of this coming together. It's a very complementary offering. I have no doubt that ESPN could succeed on its own, but I think it can do better as a part of a bigger family. In times when maybe ESPN runs into some challenges, that gives Disney the luxury of emphasizing the parts of the business that are working better so that maybe people aren't so laser-focused just on that one thing.
Chris Hill: We have years of data now just looking at when it comes to broadcasting cable television, what are the most-watched shows? Overwhelmingly, it's pro sports, put aside the Super Bowl because that's a single event. Although Fox has the Super Bowl next year reportedly, it is almost completely sold out and a 30-second ad is going to cost more than $7 million. But putting that aside, you look at things like Sunday Night Football routinely being at or near the top of the most-watched things. We got the other part of this that never really made a ton of sense the comparison that Dan Loeb was using was eBay spinning off PayPal. I agree with your point, ESPN, I believe, succeeds over the next 10-20 years, whether it is part of the Disney empire or not. But the eBay spinoff of PayPal, that was something years before that happened, we were all clamoring for that. That all just seemed like yes, there is true value to be unlocked there.
Jason Moser: It felt like you look at that comparison. We were all happy to see PayPal spin off from eBay because eBay seemed to be at the time and even still today a somewhat challenged business, whereas I would not classify Disney or ESPN necessarily as challenged businesses. Maybe going through a little bit of a challenging time as our viewing habits are making this big transition. We're going from cable to direct-to-consumer, it's funny. We talked about years ago, the value in the bundle that we got from our cable providers and you're paying your cable bill every month and you're getting 700 channels that you don't ever watch, but you're getting the core channels that you do watch and ultimately there's value in there because it's an easy interface, it's all in one place. Then we see streaming take over and we get back to that collection of all of these different apps. It's not the greatest user experience. Now we're moving back to this bundle, so to speak.
I think that where Disney is concerned, they want to make this bundle as valuable as possible because I think a lot of this really does boil down to just bundling this content and in offering consumers a value proposition and a place to be able to go see anything they want whenever they want. I think that's one of the big questions that probably a lot of folks have. I know I have it today. As a subscriber to the Hulu Live product and we also have Disney+, which means we also have ESPN+ because we have that bundle. Right now, you do have that experience where I've got to log in to Hulu or I've got to log in to ESPN+, or I've got to log in to Disney+. There's going to be a time where they're going to have that consolidation. They're going to bring everything under one roof. Now, what that ultimately looks like, whether it's under the Disney+ roof or whether it's under the Hulu roof, we don't really know that yet, but they definitely have that plan.
Then I think another thing to keep in mind, too, is in regard to sports, we're talking more and more about it now, but sports betting is becoming a bigger part of this equation, becoming a greater consideration. Because there's a tremendous market opportunity out there to do that and that's something that is being discussed more and more on the calls. They're not giving away their hand yet. I mean, we don't know exactly what they're going to do but when you look at the market opportunity. Wagering on sports came in and was an $89 billion business in 2021, it's estimated to hit $144 billion by the year 2026. Now, I'm not saying that Disney or ESPN has to be the leader in sports betting, and chances are they will probably choose to take the partnership path on this particular part of the journey but that's going to be something else they can incorporate into their business because of the exposure to sports, because they have so much under that ESPN roof.
That I think is going to be another valuable part of the equation. Maybe that was part of why Loeb changed his mind so quickly on this is that he saw Chapek's commitment to ESPN, and heard more in his tone that, ""Hey, listen, we're not taking this for granted. We've got big plans, but right now we're in this big transition. We're moving over from this cable relationship, that legacy relationship that we've built this business around for so long. We're having to blow that up and reapproach this. We're taking this one step at a time, but trust me, we will get there,"" and maybe that was enough to sway Loeb into believing that yes, it makes more sense to remain a part of the Disney family because I think most people would agree it should.
Chris Hill: How many DraftKings ads did you see over the weekend watching college football?
Jason Moser: Quite a few.
Chris Hill: Let's move on to retail because like a lot of industries retail stocks have gotten hit in 2022 and yet we're getting more data coming out about Walmart, Amazon, Target, just to name three, continuing to spend money continuing to invest. You look at the research, Gartner Research had come out looking at the past as an example of how this can pay off in the future. They looked at all these companies to continue to invest through the Great Recession and what that did for their earnings potential over the subsequent 5, 6 years. It's one of those things that reading all that made me think, if you're a shareholder of Amazon, Target, Walmart, you should probably be happy about the investments that they're making because they are making huge investments.
Jason Moser: They are. The beauty of having the scale and retail that companies like that have your Amazons and Walmarts of the world is they can afford to continue investing. That's what that scale gives them, those financial resources. They can continue investing in times like these when other smaller players, they have to play a little bit more defense. They have to be far more careful with where their investment dollars go and we talk about that a lot. I think in tough times, that's when the strong tend to get stronger. This made me think back toward, and I don't know if you recall, but I think over the past couple of years, we talked a little bit about Darden Restaurants throughout all of this. In Darden, obviously, over the last couple of years, restaurants have had a very difficult time. We saw a lot of smaller restaurants go under.
But the bigger restaurants that have multiple brands under that umbrella have been able to play offense, and Darden was a good example of that. They really were playing offense, opening new stores, trying to take share, understanding that was going to hamper the financial performance in the near term, but that it was going to give them a greater footprint in the longer term. Ultimately it gets back to that scale argument. You want to be bigger and sometimes you got to take a little bit of a risk there and spend when the times are tough. It seems like with companies like Amazon and Walmart, Home Depot, Target, they're all doing that and it makes a lot of sense. I think ultimately the investments that they make just depend on the nature of the business. I thought there were some interesting data in there in consulting company executives and asking what investments will they cut first versus what investments will they cut last? I was encouraged to see this in the sense that the last that they're going to cut, this is what they're going to focus on first and foremost, they're going to cut technology and investments in the workforce last, in other words, that's where they're going to be really focused on.
Making sure they're up to speed on their technology and making sure that they're actually investing in their workforce. We're hearing a lot of stories these days about unionization. A lot of that just boils down to companies who have not invested in their workforce the way that they should have. I'm not saying that Amazon or Walmart necessarily has that figured out, either, but that's something that's encouraging to see at least that executives are going to be focused on investing in things like technology and the workforce, whereas the investments they'll cut first are things like M&A, mergers and acquisitions. I wasn't terribly surprised to see this, but also sustainability and environmental impact. I think that sustainability and environmental impact is important is that is, I think that's still a very squishy subject, it's very open for interpretation of exactly what that means. Maybe as time goes on, if that becomes a little bit more of an understandable concrete definition, maybe that changes but for now, I do believe that the investments in technology and the workforce make the most sense. Again, it goes back to when you have the scale and the space it really gives you a lot of opportunity to when you come out of these difficult times, the strong can be stronger as long as they make the right investments.
Chris Hill: Part of that in terms of the workplace, you look at Target, which is on track to invest $5 billion this year in their stores, opening 30 new ones, but giving a refresh to 200 more which is, you think about their footprint, that's a sizable impact. A nice reminder that increasing the store count is not the only way to invest in locations. That when you look at a business and they say, it's like, well in the grand scheme of Target, 30 new locations isn't necessarily a huge increase, but the upgrade of 200 more can make a meaningful impact. Again, all of this with an eye toward like we talked about on the show with Emily on Friday. All with an eye toward, hey, we got to get through the next 6-12 months. This is setting us up for beyond that.
Jason Moser: The E word, what we talked about last week, efficiency. A lot of these companies are focused on efficiency right now and I think in retail, particularly, efficiency matters a lot. When you look at the way these companies are spending their investing dollars, I think a lot of this also depends on the nature of the business. You look at something like a Target or a Walmart in investing in that in-store experience, just like you said, it's not just about opening new stores, but it's about making your existing stores better and getting them up to snuff and up to speed. With today's technology. You look at something like a Target and Walmart, it makes sense to really invest in those stores. Whereas Home Depot has been focused more so on investing in their supply chain, really trying to maximize the efficiencies there because part of the difference between something like Walmart and Home Depot, you look at the customers that Home Depot serves. It's not just the do-it-yourself, but they have an entire pro demographic that they have to cater to. That pro demographic is really important because they spend a lot of money with Home Depot. It's not necessarily about the in-store experience for them, it's about the supply chain. We've seen Home Depot making a lot of investments in the supply chain over the last couple of years as opposed to that in-store experience just because of the difference in the nature of the customer, so just something to keep them on.
Chris Hill: Jason Moser, thanks for being here.
Jason Moser: Thank you.
Chris Hill: From consumer retail, we move to commercial real estate. Joseph Ori is an executive managing director at Paramount Capital Corporation. Motley Fool contributor Marc Rapport caught up with Ori to get his thoughts on commercial real estate trends and the red-hot industrial market.
Marc Rapport: Well, the industrial sector has been really one of our hottest since the pandemic. How hot has it been from your perspective? Do you have numbers you could point out to indicate that record-low vacancy rates, soaring rents, all of the above?
Joseph Ori: Yes, the industrial market in U.S. has been booming for the last four or five years. The cap rates, that's the return you look at when you buy a property at record lows between 3% and 5%. They should be between 5% and 7%. Again, there's 16 billion square feet. Right now there is 700 million square feet under construction. That is a record, and it's all getting absorbed, absorbed meaning it's getting leased as soon as it's built or a few months thereafter. We have record rents in various markets, 3% vacancy, so yes, it's on fire, it's slowed down a little bit now with higher interest rates. Remember when the Fed raises interest rates and cuts back demand, and higher inflation, food costs, gas costs, etc, people are cutting back and they're not buying stuff and a lot of the demand for industrial comes from all the stuff people are buying, primarily coming over from Asia and then they need a place to store it and distribute it and the logistics for it and that was the big creator of demand, but it's starting to slow down.
Marc Rapport: Well, what involvement do you and your clients have in this sector and where in general terms, of course?
Joseph Ori: What we do is we provide advisory services. We tell our clients and my clients are primarily institutional, large real estate developers, private real estate firms, money managers, investment managers, REIT managers and we tell them how to make more money in commercial real estate. Since the industrial market has been so hot the last few years, we've done a lot of stuff on industrial.
Marc Rapport: Well, do you think valuations have gone too high and why or why not? What is the bubble and are we in one?
Joseph Ori: Yeah, definitely. I mentioned cap rates, for most of your viewers, you probably don't know what a cap rate is, but it's a measure of return on a real estate, commercial real estate deal. The way you calculate it, you take the net operating income nature, your rents less your operating expenses divided by the value of the property. Cap rates today for industrial are between 3% and 5%. I've been doing this for 40 years, Marc. If you would ask me 10 years go, hey, industrial is going to trade at a three cap rate in 10 years, I would have bet you a million dollars, no way. But that's what's happened and a lot of it has been the Federal Reserve since 2008. We've had zero short-term interest rates other than the short-term blip higher in 2018 and then the last six months when they've been raising it, so yes, they are compressed. I'll give you another good example, Prologis is the largest industrial REIT, they're buying a competitor, Duke Realty for a huge price. That's three and a quarter cap rate acquisition. Five or six years ago, cap rates on industrial were average 6%, 7%, now they're between 3% and 4% and 5%. We're in a little mini-bubble, but as demand starts to pull back and rates go higher because capitals cost more now, cap rates will rise and we'll start to see the market get back to some normalcy. It's not going to be where it was five or six years ago, but it won't be so robust as it is today.
Marc Rapport: That's what we're hearing about the retail on especially the residential markets, too, including multifamily, is that rather than a bubble, maybe we're just going to see a general cooling off. Can you share your observations about those sectors? Of course, retail has been pretty hard hit by the pandemic, but what about those sectors?
Joseph Ori: Apartments are the second-hottest sector, have been the last four or five years after industrial rents have taken off in a bunch of markets. But that's also starting to soften. We're out in Silicon Valley, I see it here, so yes. A single-family what I'm hearing right now, it's hit a brick wall with these rate rises. A year ago, you could finance a 30-year mortgage at three and a quarter, today you're at five and a quarter, and that's if you have a great FICO score, you're going to be a 5.5. I'm hearing that prices are being cut, buyers are backing out. What happens in housing is going to depend on what the Fed does in the next two meetings. They have a meeting in September and then another one in November.
Marc Rapport: Well, back to industrial then, what markets do you see as being perhaps particularly overpriced or underpriced? What building types, for instance, large warehouses versus small last-mile infill facilities, can you shed some light on those there?
Joseph Ori: Sure. Here's the hottest markets, the highest rents in industrial, the Inland Empire, remember 40% of our goods comes from Asia, primarily China, they come to California, Oakland and then Long Beach, those three ports, primarily Long Beach and LA, and once it gets off the ship and we've had some supply issues in our supply line and that's gotten a little better but six months ago there were 70,80,90 ships outside of the LA ports. I just counted them this morning, there's 50, so we we're getting better, but it's not the best. Here's the markets with the most building, most robust, highest rents, the Inland Empire, in Southern California, LA, Boise, Oakland, and Orange County. All these locations have industrial rents that are in the double digits, typically in the good old days and when I say the good old days I'm talking about five or six years ago, industrial rents were six, seven bucks. Now these are triple-net rent. Now Inland Empire is 16, LA is 14, Boise $11 a square foot, Oakland 12, Orange County $17 a square foot.
Marc Rapport: That's amazing. By the way, when you mentioned Boise, that's like which one of these is not like the rest? Why Boise when you got all these West Coast?
Joseph Ori: Well, they want to get out of California because of the higher cost and taxes and stuff like that so that I can see. But then you would think, what about Vegas, what about Arizona? But their rents aren't as high.
Marc Rapport: Well, Boise has been one of the hottest residential markets certainly the last few years.
Joseph Ori: Definitely. That's cooled down, too, I'm hearing.
Marc Rapport: When you talk about 16, 17, you're talking about per square foot rentals?
Joseph Ori: Per square-foot rental rates, yes.
Marc Rapport: Just to clarify, let's tell our listeners what you mean by net lease.
Joseph Ori: A net lease is in industrial, if I say the rent is $16 a square foot, that is triple-net so the tenant will pay that every year. Plus, they will pay all the operating expenses on the property, real estate taxes, maintenance, insurance, landscaping, etc, and that's what a triple-net lease is.
Marc Rapport: The opposite of course, would be a gross lease.
Joseph Ori: Exactly.
Marc Rapport: When you say 16% or something like that, you're talking about the rent increase per square foot and a renewed lease, is that correct, or in a new lease versus the previous tenant?
Joseph Ori: Yeah, well, $16 is the rent per square foot but that rent has doubled in the last five years.
Marc Rapport: Got it.
Joseph Ori: Almost all of these markets I mentioned, it's doubled.
Marc Rapport: What about the underlying demands in spaces? We've heard, of course, the headlines about Amazon not needing this space perhaps going forward than it has and are they a real bellwether in this or how do you see this demand changing and fluctuating?
Joseph Ori: They definitely are a bellwether. They're probably the largest outside of some of the REITs single owner of industrial in the country. I think that when Bezos was a CEO, they overexpanded a little bit with their real estate. The new CEO came in like eight months ago and I think he's tightening things up. But demand is slowing, when the Fed raises interest rate and you have high inflation, it hurts demand because people don't have enough money to pay for their groceries and gas and everything else so they cut back on buying stuff. Remember, we don't make anything here anymore. We have to buy everything from overseas but that demand is starting to slow down. It's not dropping off a cliff yet. It's going to depend on how high interest rates go, but it's definitely slowing down.
Marc Rapport: Well, in your work, do you have a pretty good view of who the clients are renting these spaces because it's like we assume when we're talking about industrial space and warehouses, we're all talking about nothing but logistics warehouse, but a lot of stuff manufacturing space, too, isn't it?
Joseph Ori: Some of it is. When you look at that 16 billion of industrial, maybe 10% is manufacturing, the other 90 is distribution and warehouse. Who are the tenants for these? Any big company, from Procter & Gamble down to Skechers, down to Amazon, any company who's selling or distributing a product has a network of distribution warehouses around the country, and retail. You look at any retail, look at calls, look at Macy's, they'll have 10,12 distribution centers and these are huge buildings. There are 700, a million, a million two square feet, that's like five football fields. They distribute all their goods around the country. It's a very important part of our logistics and supply chain in the country and we definitely need it. Like I say, we're building 700 million square feet, 1,000 million new space, and it's all going to get absorbed. Even though the demand is starting to slow down a little bit.

Moreover, a report published by Verified Market Research provides a mind-boggling prediction for the market’s future, projecting its value to increase to a whopping $231 billion by 2030.
The market is expected to become a bridge to what is expected to become a trillion-dollar industry in the metaverse. Hence, there’s plenty to love about NFT stocks, which makes them an interesting bet in the long run.

eCommerce giant eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), turned heads earlier this year in May when it announced its foray into the NFT business.
It partnered with OneOf, a leading web3 NFT platform, in releasing a limited edition NFT collection featuring hockey legend Wayne Gretzky. Though eBay’s move into the NFT business may have come as a surprise to many; the platform is perfect for those passionate about trading unique collectibles. Hence, it was essentially a match made in heaven.
Furthermore, a month later, in June, eBay acquired a leading NFT marketplace in Known Origin. eBay calls it an “important step in its tech-led reimagination.”
KnownOrigin has been one of the most popular NFT platforms, giving artists a unique platform to create and sell digital art in exchange for crypto payments. It has facilitated over $7.5 million worth of NFT transactions since its inception in 2018.
For eBay, moving into the NFT space could be a business masterstroke. With over 140 million buyers worldwide, the sky is the limit for eBay in its NFT endeavors.
Funko (FNKO)

Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO) is the top collectible toy maker, boasting an incredible track record in growing its top and bottom-line results.
In March last year, its Chief Creative Officer Brian Mariotti talked about how Funko is the only company that could create a rare physical product and then tie it to a rare NFT. The ability to tie NFTs with physical products and leverage its massive fan base in the process sets Funko apart from its peers.
Funko launched its NFTs called Digital Pop! last year and partnered with leading NFT marketplace Droppp. The partnership enabled Funko to create the Funko Digital Pop! community, which continues to grow at an exceptional pace.
Additionally, it acquired an NFT platform called TokenWave, which boasts a massive visitor base. Also, it purchased a collectibles business Mondo, to further improve its digital repertoire. These moves will likely add incredible value to Funko’s top-line growth as we advance.
Dolphin Entertainment (DLPN)

Dolphin Entertainment (NASDAQ:DLPN)  operates a premium content development business that focuses on providing publicity and marketing services. It’s one of the first companies to start a dedicated NFT division called Dolphin Digital studios. Through the division, it helps various brands launch and market NFTs.
Moreover, it has partnered with top crypto exchange firm FTX.US to develop large-scale NFT marketplaces targeted at sports and entertainment. Also, it announced Creature Chronicles: Exiled Aliens and the Olympics Winter Sports Champions NFT collection recently.
NFTs are likely to be a major part of Dolphin’s long-term success. Its overall business has been remarkably successful, with its five-year average revenue growth at an amazing 90.4%.
Additionally, it trades at just 0.92 times forward sales, making it one of the best investments at this time. As we advance, its 2.0 initiatives could usher in the business’s growth phase. In addition to a recurring income stream from its clients, it will also be looking to receive an equity stake.

2022-09-15 00:00:00+00:00,Adyen and Block Team Up: Will Investors Win?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/adyen-and-block-team-up%3A-will-investors-win,,,"Payment processing companies Block (NYSE: SQ) -- formerly known as Square -- and Netherlands-based Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y) are often thought of as competitors. And in many ways, this is true. Both provide payments solutions to businesses, and while their target business customers aren't exactly the same, there is certainly some overlap.
However, there are more differences than similarities between the two businesses, and the two are partnering to maximize the value they are offering their U.S. customers.
Adyen and Cash App are teaming up
Adyen and Block's Cash App have announced a partnership to offer Cash App Pay to Adyen's U.S. customers. In a nutshell, Cash App Pay is a mobile payment tool that allows Cash App users to pay online and in store for purchases, and it will soon be available to Adyen's customers in the United States.
Cash App Pay already lets users pay for goods and services at Square Sellers and was made available to e-commerce sites outside the Square network a couple of weeks ago. A few retail brands, including American Eagle Outfitters and Finish Line, have partnered with Cash App to offer the feature. However, Adyen is the first financial technology platform to partner with Block to bring Cash App Pay to businesses on a large scale, so this is certainly an exciting development. After all, Adyen is one of the largest payment processing solution providers in the entire world, with hundreds of billions of dollars in payment volume through its ecosystem annually.
Why the partnership makes sense
Adyen is one of the largest fintech companies in the world. But unlike Block and PayPal Holdings, Adyen focuses on large businesses. Microsoft is an Adyen customer, as are Uber Technologies, McDonald's, and Etsy. You may recall that eBay surprised investors a few years ago by dropping PayPal as its preferred payments solution -- that was in favor of Adyen.
While Adyen has an extremely impressive customer base, it's also important to realize that one of the biggest reasons U.S. consumers largely haven't heard of it is that Adyen doesn't have any consumer-facing products. Block has Cash App, and PayPal is a consumer payment service, but Adyen doesn't have anything similar. It makes money from swipe fees based on its merchants' sales volume, but is purely a service provider to businesses, not individuals.
So, by partnering with Block to offer Cash App Pay, Adyen gets a piece of the consumer side of the payments business without having to build its own consumer payments platform. And from Block's perspective, this adds an extremely valuable feature to the already popular Cash App ecosystem.
What it could mean to investors
Adding Cash App functionality to Adyen's businesses could be a big win for the company, as Cash App has 80 million annual active users. But it's important to mention that the specific terms of the deal aren't known, nor is it known how often Cash App users will actually make use of the Cash App Pay feature, so it's tough to gauge what this could mean to Adyen's bottom line. The same logic applies to the deal from Block's perspective.
Having said that, this deal could certainly add value to both platforms, and could help both Block and Adyen increase the value they offer their customers.

2022-09-15 00:00:00+00:00,"Amazon hands out shipping software to merchants, including on rival sites",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-hands-out-shipping-software-to-merchants-including-on-rival-sites,,,"Sept 15 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O on Thursday said it would give merchants free software for managing shoppers' orders on and off its platform, as the retailer extends its e-commerce reach.
The company is ending monthly fees of Veeqo, a shipping software firm it recently bought, for sellers including when they fulfill orders via rival platforms like Shopify Inc SHOP.TO, eBay Inc EBAY.O or Etsy Inc ETSY.O.
D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said of Veeqo, ""The acquisition should improve Amazon's ability to compete against Shopify,"" which helps merchants set up online stores and sell elsewhere. Still, he said Amazon's ""primary focus"" remained sales through its own marketplace.
Amazon in April announced ""Buy with Prime"" to let sellers market Amazon's fast-shipping service on their direct-to-consumer websites, which reportedly prompted a response from Shopify.
On Wednesday California sued the online retailer for allegedly pushing up prices for consumers, which Amazon dismissed as without basis.
Matt Warren, Veeqo's founder, said in an interview that the Veeqo news was not a move against Shopify or others. He said, ""Amazon takes a very long-term view that anything that helps sellers eventually will be good for Amazon.""
Veeqo, which gives access to discounted shipping rates, will be free for merchants in the United States and United Kingdom, Amazon said.

2022-09-13 00:00:00+00:00,Are the Best Days of PayPal's Stock in the Past?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-the-best-days-of-paypals-stock-in-the-past,,,"As an early pioneer of the financial technology (fintech) industry, PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) has rewarded its shareholders in fantastic style since spinning off from eBay in July 2015. Even after plunging 66% in the past year, shares of the mobile payment leader are still up about 160% all-time. As evidenced by its latest stock price movement, however, the company has hit a roadblock in recent quarters.
Unlike the vast majority of fintech businesses today, PayPal has historically been a profit-generating machine. That changed in its second quarter -- the mobile payment company suffered a net loss under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the first time since the first quarter of 2014. That's an eye-opener, to say the least, and certainly something investors should closely monitor over the next few quarters. In the end, will the fintech giant bounce back or are its best days in the past?
Image source: Getty Images.
A second quarter (not) to remember
PayPal's stock has surely been a victim of the broader tech sell-off related to high inflation and rising borrowing costs, but the fintech company is facing problems of its own. In its second quarter, the company reported a net loss of $341 million, a drastic swing from its $1.2 billion profit in the same quarter a year ago. Fortunately, it generated a positive operating profit of $764 million, though it did decline 32.2% year over year. So, what happened?
Two of PayPal's operating expenses, transaction costs and transaction and credit losses, experienced significant upticks from a year ago. The company's transaction expense grew 21% year over year to $3 billion, equal to 45% of total sales. Management traced the rise to Braintree, a mobile card payment system for e-commerce businesses. Braintree, which PayPal acquired in 2013, generally has higher expenses than the fintech's other services. To boot, management mentioned a shifting funding mix -- specifically more normalized debit card usage compared to last year -- for the increased transaction expense as well. The company's transaction and credit losses also rose 165% year over year to $448 million due to an ongoing insolvency proceeding and fraud schemes related to its Venmo service offering.
How does PayPal plan to fix its problems?
Although investors should closely watch the company's expense and profit situation in the coming quarters, I think PayPal will bounce back. In its second-quarterearnings call management was very clear about plans to cut operating costs. Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman talked about leveraging its scale to drive cost reductions across its supplier base. The company has also reduced its workforce and plans to shift its real estate footprint by hiring employees in lower-cost locations.
As a result, the fintech leader believes it can realize its $900 million savings target across operating and transaction expenses in 2022. It also believes its initiatives will allow for $1.3 billion in savings in 2023. While execution is much different than planning, it's clear that PayPal is prioritizing cutting costs and increasing profits in the coming years. It will be interesting to watch how the company's cost-saving plans pan out, but it looks like the company is heading in the right direction.
Should investors buy PayPal stock?
I believe PayPal will rebound mightily. Not only is the fintech leader well positioned with 429 million active users and a cash and short-term investments position of $9.3 billion, but I love where management's head is with its ambitious cost-cutting plans. At a forward price-to-earnings ratio of a little more than 20 and a price-to-sales multiple of 4.3, PayPal stock appears to have reached a fine entry point for long-term investors.
Over the past five years, the fintech stock has pegged a mean price-to-earnings ratio of 57.2 and a price-to-sales multiple of 8.8. But regardless, I believe PayPal's rich history of profitability will continue for years to come, and long-term investors should feel confident that the stock will generate market-beating returns.

2022-09-12 00:00:00+00:00,We Did The Math ESGU Can Go To $108,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/we-did-the-math-esgu-can-go-to-%24108,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (Symbol: ESGU), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $107.55 per unit.
With ESGU trading at a recent price near $90.72 per unit, that means that analysts see 18.56% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of ESGU's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Mosaic Co (Symbol: MOS), eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY), and NortonLifeLock Inc (Symbol: NLOK). Although MOS has traded at a recent price of $56.24/share, the average analyst target is 21.24% higher at $68.19/share. Similarly, EBAY has 21.09% upside from the recent share price of $45.10 if the average analyst target price of $54.61/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting NLOK to reach a target price of $27.00/share, which is 18.79% above the recent price of $22.73. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MOS, EBAY, and NLOK:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF ESGU $90.72 $107.55 18.56%
Mosaic Co MOS $56.24 $68.19 21.24%
eBay Inc. EBAY $45.10 $54.61 21.09%
NortonLifeLock Inc NLOK $22.73 $27.00 18.79%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2022-09-12 00:00:00+00:00,Quick-thinking online sellers see royal memorabilia sales soar,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/quick-thinking-online-sellers-see-royal-memorabilia-sales-soar,,,"By Richa Naidu
LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Laura Sheldon, 36, co-owner of the LulaandGray store on Etsy.com ETSY.N, had a busy weekend, fulfilling dozens of orders for Queen Elizabeth II keepsakes since she died on Thursday.
Sheldon, whose store ships from Macclesfield, England, designed a small wooden token that has Elizabeth's crown carved into it along with her name, and the dates ""1926 - 2022"". The handmade token costs 3.90 pounds ($4.56) and comes with a Union Jack postcard that has facts about the queen.
""I actually designed them on Thursday night, and listed them then,"" Sheldon said. ""We had a single order for nearly 180 units on Sunday that will be distributed throughout nursing homes in the UK, and we have had 40 individual orders on Etsy and Amazon for them since Friday,"" Sheldon said.
""The queen passing away is a massive moment in history, and we created these little keepsakes to pop into our children's memory box for when they grow older.""
Other royal memorabilia is also selling fast, with mourners and fans on Amazon, eBay and Etsy buying everything from T-shirts and mugs to wooden plaques.
Britain's longest-reigning monarch marked the 70th anniversary of her accession in February, with national celebrations held in June.
On Monday, the top three items sold on Amazon.co.uk in the prior 24 hours were two wooden wall decorations with the late queen's face on them, and a Platinum Jubilee mug for 9.90 pounds ($11.56).
The 10th most popular book on the website was a 9.99-pound hardcover copy of the ""Queen Elizabeth: A Platinum Jubilee Celebration"" children's book, while No.12 was Robert Hardman's ""Queen of Our Times: The Life of Elizabeth II"".
'SMALLER TREATS'
The number one newly released item in Amazon's Home & Kitchen department was a Union Jack-themed Queen Elizabeth II memorial flag for 5.89 pounds, made by a Chinese supplier called Shinfengzhou.
""We will see people wanting to have that memorabilia,"" Linda Ellett, KPMG's head of consumer markets, retail and leisure, said. ""With pressure on people's budgets, what we do see is the idea of being able to spend on smaller treats because they can't buy big things like cars and houses ... I think this will be an occasion that people will want to remember.""
In Windsor, where the queen spent much of her time in recent years, souvenir seller Muthucumarasamy Kesavan also reported brisk trade.
“This is not just about business or money but people want to carry something with the queen on it,"" he said.
Kesavan, who moved to Britain from Sri Lanka in 1986, has been running his small shop next to the castle gates since 2011. He said souvenirs for King Charles would take ""a couple of months"" to hit the shelves because of import difficulties.
“We are trying but still we couldn’t find anything ... bringing things from outside is not easy,” he said
Meanwhile, some people are selling memorabilia related to the new king online. Suppliers have been quick to post listings on eBay for ""God Save the King"" banners, portrait prints, commemorative mugs and other items.
A copy of ""Highgrove: Portrait of an Estate"" by King Charles, signed by the author, was standing at 221 pounds on eBay.com, with five days of the listing to go. The listing notes the ""historical and monetary value of this item"".
The same seller, also listed a ""hand-signed Christmas Card from 2002 featuring photo of the King w. Princes William & Harry"", whose current bid is for 160 pounds.
Amazon and eBay declined to comment. ($1 = 0.8561 pounds)

2022-09-08 00:00:00+00:00,October 28th Options Now Available For eBay,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/october-28th-options-now-available-for-ebay,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 28th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new October 28th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $37.00 strike price has a current bid of 26 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $37.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $36.74 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $44.40/share today.
Because the $37.00 strike represents an approximate 17% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.70% return on the cash commitment, or 5.13% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $37.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $47.00 strike price has a current bid of 94 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $44.40/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $47.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.97% if the stock gets called away at the October 28th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $47.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $47.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.12% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.45% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $44.40) to be 36%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-09-07 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: SoFi or Affirm?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-sofi-or-affirm,,,"Last year, financial technology, or fintech, stocks were all the rage. Many fintech companies saw their stocks shoot up and reach astronomical valuations. But this year, as interest rates have surged, investors have gotten a lot more selective about these stocks. In fact, the market this year has been brutal for most fintech stocks.
Two popular ones that fall into this category are digital-bank SoFi (NASDAQ: SOFI) and buy now, pay later (BNPL) company Affirm (NASDAQ: AFRM). SoFi's stock is down more than 64% this year, while Affirm's stock is down more than 78% during the same time period. These declines create a potentially interesting entry point. Let's take a look at which is the better long-term buy.
SoFi: One-stop shop for financial services
SoFi is a digital bank that seeks to provide all financial services for high-income earners, typically those who make more than $100,000 per year. Most consumers get financial products from at least several different banks, but SoFi wants to be the one-stop shop and meet all of the financial needs of its target-customer base.
The company offers checking and savings accounts, online-investing capabilities, credit cards, mortgages, personal loans, student loan refinancing, and personal finance tools. SoFi also has several tech banking businesses that are really B2B businesses but could be an attractive and diverse source of revenue over time. Earlier this year, SoFi secured a bank charter through the acquisition of a tiny California bank, which now enables it to hold deposits and use those to fund a chunk of its loans.
SoFi has done a nice job of drawing in new members and bringing them onto its flywheel, which is a key strategic priority to increase cross-selling and lower customer-acquisition costs. In the second quarter, SoFi generated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $20 million on adjusted revenue of $356 million.
The bank is also expected to benefit from the expiration of the student loan moratorium at the end of the year and with President Joe Biden's plans to forgive $10,000 of student debt for certain borrowers.
With the moratorium in place for more than two years, borrowers haven't had to make payments on their federal student loans, which naturally depressed refinancing activity. Borrowers have also been putting off refinancing on expectations that some kind of relief could be coming, so borrowers now have the clarity they need to decide on whether to refinance. Student loan refinancing, which used to be SoFi's largest product before the pandemic, has been operating at about half capacity or less since the moratorium went into place.
Despite the success SoFi has had, I'd like to see the company reduce its high levels of stock-based compensation and start to narrow the loss in its financial services division, which includes checking and savings accounts and its online investing brokerage. The financial services division is one of the main ways SoFi draws customers in, but customer-acquisition costs start to look uneconomical if SoFi can't show a path to profitability in this division.
Affirm: BNPL mania
Started by former PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm has brought BNPL to the masses in a big way. BNPL allows people to buy goods with no money down, then repay on an installment schedule.
Affirm allows people to do this with a variety of products including interest-bearing BNPL loans and short- and long-term duration BNPL loans, as well. The company is also preparing to roll out its Affirm+ debit card, which has BNPL optionality.
The opportunity that Affirm has is huge. The company has signed several big partnerships with businesses like Walmart, Amazon, Shopify, and eBay. Affirm's partners in total address roughly 60% of all e-commerce sales in the U.S. Additionally, the North American e-commerce market was valued at $900 billion in 2021, and BNPL sales only represented $34 billion of that total addressable market.
In fiscal 2022, which ended June 30, Affirm's gross merchandise volume (GMV) through its platform reach $15.5 billion, up from $8.3 billion in fiscal 2021. The company is forecasting between $20.5 billion and $22 billion of GMV in fiscal 2023.
I think one of the big things casting doubt on Affirm's business is credit quality. BNPL products are effectively short-term loans, and there have been a lot of reports regarding BNPL borrowers making late payments. Furthermore, Affirm saw delinquencies rise in July and August and charge-offs -- which is debt unlikely to be collected and a good indicator of actual losses -- jumped in Affirm's most recent quarter, as well.
This has partially been expected as credit conditions normalize amid higher interest rates, but I'm sure investors are wondering how credit will continue to trend if the U.S. economy tips into a more severe recession.
Which is the better buy?
While Affirm is certainly the bigger potential opportunity, SoFi is the better buy. SoFi is generating strong growth, and I believe it will be much better insulated in a severe recession.
The company caters to very strong borrowers with high credit scores and high annual incomes. Furthermore, being able to gather deposits and hold them at the bank gives SoFi a very stable source of funding and a much better framework for holding loans on its balance sheet.
There's a lot about Affirm that I just don't understand, such as credit quality. This makes me very uncertain about the company right now.

2022-09-03 00:00:00+00:00,Stock Market Plunge: 3 Unstoppable Stocks to Buy Now,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-plunge%3A-3-unstoppable-stocks-to-buy-now,,,"With all the major stock indexes posting double-digit losses year to date, investors have had a challenging year. But sooner or later, this bear market will turn into a new bull market. While some stocks still look expensive based on traditional valuation metrics, there are plenty of solid companies on sale right now.
Three Motley Fool contributors each recently selected a company that could deliver even better returns than the market average. Here's why they picked eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), Texas Roadhouse (NASDAQ: TXRH), and Revolve (NYSE: RVLV).
An inexpensive stock and an asset-light business model
Parkev Tatevosian (eBay): With stock markets plunging and the U.S. economy arguably in a recession, it pays to own companies that can do well against that backdrop. It's one of the reasons that eBay is one of my favorite stocks to buy now. The e-commerce and auction site is known for bargain prices on used and new goods. Moreover, since the company runs on an asset-light business model, it's not as strongly impacted by rising inflation.
eBay does not own any of the inventory sold on its platform. Instead, it brings together buyers and sellers and encourages them to transact. It does this by processing payments, offering buyers and sellers protection from fraud, and supporting the technology that makes it all possible. What's notable is what the company doesn't do: It leaves shipping and handling for buyers and sellers to resolve between themselves, sidestepping a costly service.
eBay is not a high-flying growth stock; revenue has remained relatively flat over the last decade. But earnings per share have grown at a compound annual rate of 23.6% during that period.
Moreover, if the economy enters a prolonged downturn, consumers could look to eBay's lower-priced secondhand goods more often. They could also try to sell more of their own used items to generate cash. Each would be a desirable outcome.
EBAY PS Ratio data by YCharts.
Fortunately, the stock-market plunge has eBay's stock selling at a relatively inexpensive valuation. At a price-to-sales ratio of 2.7, eBay is arguably as cheap as it's been in the last five years.
Consistency and quality service in the restaurant industry
John Ballard (Texas Roadhouse): Finding a successful restaurant early in its growth cycle can be one of the simplest and rewarding ways to generate market-beating returns.
Texas Roadhouse looks very promising. The stock delivered a 15% annualized return to investors over the last 10 years, but its focus on consistency, quality service, and performance-based management culture should keep the growth streak going for many years.
This steakhouse chain was founded in 1993 and has grown to 680 restaurants in 49 states, including a growing footprint in 10 foreign countries. The company started in Clarksville, Indiana, but it now operates restaurants across the world in places like Saudi Arabia and Taiwan. That speaks volumes about how well this concept adapts beyond cultural boundaries.
Despite 40-year-high inflation that's causing higher commodity costs for the food-service industry, consumers are still eating out. Texas Roadhouse expects to report positive comparable-sales growth for the full year. It reported a 18% year-over-year increase in revenue in the first half of the year, with comp sales up 8% in the second quarter.
The restaurant growth stock is attractively priced at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23. For a company delivering a consistent return on invested capital in the mid-teens, that's a good price to initiate a position.
A thriving fashion stock with enormous potential
Jennifer Saibil (Revolve Group): Revolve Group is an artificial-intelligence-based fashion retailer that's been doing what many fashion retailers have been unable to do over the past few years: demonstrate meaningful growth. Sales increased 54% year over year in 2021, and the company has continued to deliver strong results in 2022, with a 27% increase in the second quarter. Active customers, average order value, and total orders placed all continue to increase.
Revolve Group is also profitable, although it's feeling the pressure of inflation. Net income came in at $16.3 million in the second quarter, a 48% drop from last year.
Management didn't have an exciting update for the rest of the year. It said that July sales were up 10% over last year, a huge slowdown from what has been fantastic growth. That's not surprising, but investors don't like to hear that growth is coming to a halt, even if it may be temporary. So it's also not surprising that Revolve Group stock is down 57% this year.
But I do think the slowdown is very likely to be temporary. There are several reasons to envision Revolve Group getting back to an amazing future. Most notably, it speaks its market's language.
Revolve Group is in touch with how millennials think and shop, and it gives this core market what it's looking for. It offers a constantly updated and vast collection of designer clothing, shoes, accessories, and beauty products, and it markets those goods though a large network of celebrities, influencers, and other social media personalities and bloggers. Everything it does is powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning, making it easy for Revolve Group to know what's hot and what's not.
Since it's entirely online, it can easily add and delete products. This helps it sell more products at full price instead of being forced to put items on sale at the end of a season. In 2021, 87% of items were sold at full price. That percentage is likely to be lower in 2022, but Revolve Group's model is a demonstrated winner.

[Editor’s note: “Find Bear Market Shelter and Mega Upside With ‘Divergence’ Stocks” was previously published in May 2022. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]
This year has been defined by bear market turmoil.
The reality is that the entire global financial market is built on the back of super low interest rates. If those rates go way higher in 2022, stocks are due for more pain.
But if you think that’s a reason to sell everything, let me ask you this. Did you know that a certain group of stocks has a proven history of soaring during market crashes?
It’s true. And we uncovered those stocks thanks to a rare market phenomenon we recently discovered called the “divergence” — a phenomenon that repeatedly appears during bear markets and scores savvy investors huge returns (even if the broader markets keep crashing).
This phenomenon just started to appear recently for the first time since 2008. It’s going to score savvy investors huge returns. And investors who miss this opportunity could get crushed by a bear market.
Here’s what I’m talking about.
Divergence Stocks Soar Even in a Bear Market
As many of you know, we’ve been studying this divergence phenomenon for months now.
To recap, the divergence is not something you’ve probably ever heard of elsewhere. It’s this ultra-rare phenomenon, which occurs only about once a decade, wherein certain individual stock prices diverge significantly from their true stock prices, as determined by the company’s fundamentals.
The divergences always end with those individual stocks snapping back to their true stock prices, resulting in enormous returns for investors who bought during the divergence window.
We’ve made a lot of interesting discoveries about these divergences. They usually revolve around growth stocks. They usually last a few months. And they usually result in 100%-plus gains in less than 12 months.
But one of the most interesting and relevant discoveries we’ve made is that divergence stocks tend to soar even if the broader markets crash.
Take, for example, the Great Divergence of 2001. At the time, internet stocks were undergoing an enormous divergence, wherein their stock prices were collapsing yet many of them still had rapidly growing revenues and earnings.
A few stocks that experienced this divergence phenomenon in 2001 were Amazon (AMZN), F5 Networks (FFIV), and eBay (EBAY).
Look what happened to those stocks throughout 2001 and 2002. While the broader market kept reeling during that period — the Dow Jones dropped 16%, the S&P 500 dropped 24%, and the Nasdaq collapsed 27% — these divergence stocks soared by an average of more than 90%. While folks invested in the market lost more than 20% of their wealth, divergence stock investors basically doubled their money!
But this isn’t an isolated example.
It is a repeating pattern that proves the bear market protection that divergence stocks provide.
Let’s zoom to the Great Divergence of 2008. At the time, all stocks were crashing due to fallout from the Great Financial Crisis. But certain stocks were crashing at the same time their companies were rapidly growing their revenues and earnings. Some examples included Amazon, Netflix (NFLX), and Booking (BKNG).
From November 2008 to March 2009, those divergence stocks soared between 56% and 94%. Over that same stretch, the Dow Jones dropped 11%.
Yet again, we see that market investors lost money while divergence stock investors scored huge returns.
This is the power of the divergence. It is such a powerful market phenomenon that is has the ability to send a small group of divergence stocks significantly higher in a short amount of time even if the market crashes.
From an investment perspective, there’s no better value proposition than that.
But divergence stocks aren’t just about scoring huge near-term returns. These stocks have a track record of scoring investors 1,200%-plus returns in the long run, too.
The Best Buying Opportunity in History? 
I’d argue that the divergence market phenomenon offers investors the best buying opportunities in stock market history.
And I’d make that argument because the data would have my back.
Per our analysis, there have been three Great Divergences over the past 40 years: 1988, 2001, and 2008. Each time, they offered investors the chance to buy world-changing companies at blockbuster discounts.
We’re not talking about buying GameStop (GME) or AMC (AMC) and taking on huge risk. We’re talking about buying Microsoft (MSFT) at 40 cents in 1988, buying Amazon at $5 in 2001, or buying Salesforce (CRM) at $6 in 2008.
Obviously, those are fantastic long-term investments. But, to hammer the point, let’s go over the numbers.
Based on data from over 20 stocks through three different divergences stretched over 40 years, we’ve found that the average forward 12-month return in these divergence stocks was about 135% across all the examples. Forward five-year returns were almost 1,000%. Forward 10-year returns were in excess of 3,000%. And forward lifetime returns were more than 20,000%!
So, we’re not just talking about stocks to buy today and sell tomorrow.
Yes, divergence stocks tend to double in 12 months. But they also tend to rise 10X in five years, and more than 30X in 10 years.
We’re talking about stocks to buy today and hold forever — stocks with the chance to turn meager $10,000 investments into multi-million-dollar paydays.
But that chance only comes around about every so often when the divergence phenomenon emerges.
Well, folks, today another Great Divergence is emerging. And we’re ready to capitalize on it for huge returns.
The Final Word
We sit on the precipice of a truly unprecedented money-making opportunity.
A rare stock market phenomenon is emerging as you read this. Historically speaking, investors who have capitalized on this phenomenon had the chance to double their money in 12 months, 10X their money in five years, and 30X their money in 10 years… even if the broader markets crashed!
These are opportunities that could simultaneously soar and offer you protection from any bear market turmoil.
Can you see why I’m so excited right now? It doesn’t get any better than this!
Throughout my stock-picking career, wherein I jam-packed more than twenty 10X picks into just a few years, I’ve never been more bullish than I am right now.
And I really don’t want you to miss out on this opportunity.
Our models suggest the perfect moment to buy could come at any time. When it does, we will immediately broadcast our message — and reveal of top divergence stocks to buy.
Needless to say, you should sign up for that alert. If you don’t, you could miss out on one of the biggest opportunities in stock market history.
Instead, see how you can turn today’s market pain into your personal fortune.

In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 2.00% for eBay Inc., 1.45% for Progress Software Corp, and 1.60% for NetEase, Inc.

2022-08-29 00:00:00+00:00,Should Invesco S&P 500 GARP ETF (SPGP) Be on Your Investing Radar?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-invesco-sp-500-garp-etf-spgp-be-on-your-investing-radar-3,,,"Looking for broad exposure to the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market? You should consider the Invesco S&P 500 GARP ETF (SPGP), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 06/17/2011.
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $1.28 billion, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.
Why Large Cap Growth
Large cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.
Growth stocks have higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. While these are expected to grow faster than the broader market, they also have higher valuations. Also, growth stocks are a type of equity that carries more risk compared to others. Even though growth stocks are more likely to outperform their value counterparts in strong bull markets, value stocks have a record of delivering better returns in almost all markets than growth stocks.
Costs
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.36%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.90%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
It is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Healthcare sector--about 32.10% of the portfolio. Financials and Information Technology round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN) accounts for about 2.04% of total assets, followed by Nrg Energy Inc (NRG) and Ebay Inc (EBAY).
The top 10 holdings account for about 19.09% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
SPGP seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 GROWTH AT A REASONABLE PRICE IDX before fees and expenses. The S&P 500 Growth at a Reasonable Price Index is composed of securities with strong growth characteristics selected from the Russell Top 200 Index.
The ETF has lost about -11.93% so far this year and is down about -6.76% in the last one year (as of 08/29/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $77.45 and $97.61.
The ETF has a beta of 1.11 and standard deviation of 28.14% for the trailing three-year period. With about 77 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
Invesco S&P 500 GARP ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SPGP is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Growth area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.
The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) and the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) track a similar index. While Vanguard Growth ETF has $75.33 billion in assets, Invesco QQQ has $171.24 billion. VUG has an expense ratio of 0.04% and QQQ charges 0.20%.
Bottom-Line
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.

2022-08-29 00:00:00+00:00,Is eBay Stock Attractive At The Current Levels?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-ebay-stock-attractive-at-the-current-levels,,,"eBay’s stock (NASDAQ: EBAY) has lost roughly 32% YTD as compared to the 13% drop in the S&P500 index over the same period. However, at its current price of $46, the stock is trading 14% below its fair value of $53 – Trefis’ estimate for eBay’s valuation. 
The company operates an online marketplace “eBay.com”, where third-party buyers and sellers can transact in a variety of products. While it topped the consensus estimates in the second quarter results, the net revenues were down 9% y-o-y to $2.42 billion. It was primarily driven by an 8% drop in the net transaction revenues, due to a decline in website traffic from the elevated levels seen in the year-ago period. Further, the key metric – Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), decreased by 18% in the quarter. Notably, the re-opening of offline stores, normalization of consumer behavior, and tough macroeconomic conditions led to negative growth in the top line. On the expense front, the operating margin decreased from 27.4% to 21.7% due to the higher cost of revenues. Further, loss on equity investment and warrant increased from $273 million to $1.2 billion. It led to a profit before tax (PBT) of -$727 million, as compared to the figure of $401 million in Q2 2021. 
The net revenues increased 17% y-o-y to $10.4 billion in 2021. It was mainly due to higher than usual sales volume due to the Covid-19 crisis. That said, the online sales numbers have normalized in 2022. Markedly, the GMV for the first half of 2022 was down 19% y-o-y, leading to a 6% drop in net revenues to $4.97 billion. We expect the same trend to continue over the subsequent quarters. Altogether, eBay’s revenues are estimated to remain around $9.7 billion in FY2022. Further, the revenue per share (RPS) is likely to increase from $15.72 to $15.99 in the year. This coupled with a P/S multiple of just above 3x will lead to the valuation of $53.

2022-08-27 00:00:00+00:00,Why It Might Not Make Sense To Buy eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) For Its Upcoming Dividend,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-it-might-not-make-sense-to-buy-ebay-inc.-nasdaq%3Aebay-for-its-upcoming-dividend,,,"eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 3 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase eBay's shares before the 31st of August in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 16th of September.
The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.22 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.88 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, eBay has a trailing yield of approximately 2.0% on its current stock price of $44.53. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether eBay can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.
Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. eBay lost money last year, so the fact that it's paying a dividend is certainly disconcerting. There might be a good reason for this, but we'd want to look into it further before getting comfortable. Given that the company reported a loss last year, we now need to see if it generated enough free cash flow to fund the dividend. If cash earnings don't cover the dividend, the company would have to pay dividends out of cash in the bank, or by borrowing money, neither of which is long-term sustainable. Over the last year it paid out 51% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.

NasdaqGS:EBAY Historic Dividend August 27th 2022
Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?
When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. eBay was unprofitable last year and, unfortunately, the general trend suggests its earnings have been in decline over the last five years, making us wonder if the dividend is sustainable at all.
Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last four years, eBay has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average.
Final Takeaway
Is eBay worth buying for its dividend? First, it's not great to see the company paying a dividend despite being loss-making over the last year. On the plus side, the dividend was covered by free cash flow."" It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective, and we'd probably give this one a miss for now.
So if you're still interested in eBay despite it's poor dividend qualities, you should be well informed on some of the risks facing this stock. For example, eBay has 3 warning signs (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) we think you should know about.
If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.

*Stock Advisor returns as of August 17, 2022
This video was recorded on Aug. 23, 2022.
Chris Hill: How would an investor react if the company they bought shares of went bankrupt? Let's find out. Motley Fool money starts now.
I'm Chris Hill and just like yesterday's episode with Jason Moser, today, we've got the investing origin story with Motley Fool Senior Analyst Matt Argersinger. Yes, the first stock he ever bought shares of was a company that went bankrupt just three years later. We'll get to that in a minute. But I started the conversation by asking him, who was the first person to really start him on his investing journey.
Matt Argersinger: My dad was a little bit of an investor. He was in the army. But I remember we get the Wall Street Journal at home and I can't remember when, but I remember at some point I was probably seven or eight years old. You flip through the Wall Street Journal back in the day when they had pages and pages of stock tickers. You just like what is going on here, why the number is moving around every day plus, minus fractional, it was all fractional back then. I think I just got kind of intrigued by the idea that you could invest in these numbers. But they are companies, these symbols, right? The next day you could have more money. I think that was fascinating to me. As early as I remember, I had a paper route as a lot of kids did back in late '80s, when I was eight or nine years old. I could save a little bit of money. If it wasn't video games or something like that, I was trying to think, can I save enough money to buy one of these stocks that my dad was talking about. I can't remember when the light went off, but that was my earliest memory of being interested in investing.
Chris Hill: I remember thinking it was like a code, looking at stock charts, not even charts but just as you said, the pages and pages of the shortened names of the companies and thinking like, oh, it's a secret code for names of actual businesses, right?
Matt Argersinger: Right. Then you know there was magical when you could go to the mall or something and you'd say, oh, here's the Gap. Just to name a company that was popular in the '80s or '90s, or a Walmart or something like that. You realize, wait, that's one of the symbol, so you could actually buy a piece of this company that I know that I can see and touch. That was also just the wow moment. Yeah.
Chris Hill: What was the first stock you bought?
Matt Argersinger: It's a funny story. You finally saved enough money. I had a paper route, I was mowing lawns for people. I think I saved like 500 bucks [laughs] which when you're like nine or 10.
Chris Hill: That's lot of money with your kid.
Matt Argersinger: Yeah. I was like, I'm rich, man. I said, OK, I want to buy a stock. I remember I talked to my parents and they gave me terrible advice. [laughs] But it's good advice, I'll tell it, it's like a back story to this. We were living in Massachusetts and one of the big companies at the time, was a company called Wang Laboratories. It was founded by a really great entrepreneur named An Wang. I think he immigrated from China way long time ago in the '20s or '30s. He just built technology companies, software companies in the '60s and '70s. Eventually he built this company Wang Laboratories, that was one of the leading word processing machine companies, calculators and word processing. It became a big company, I think at some point in the early mid '80s, it was employing 10 of thousands of people. Anyway, so I asked my parents, hey, what should I invest in? They said, well, Wang Labs is a great company. It's right near us. I think it was based in Lowell, Massachusetts. Of course I was like, this sounds really great. I invested $500 in Wang Laboratories.
I think it was like 1989. Well, in 1990 An Wang, the CEO, died, and the company was passed to his son. Two years later, the company went bankrupt. No idea how or why. But my first stock investment ever went up in smoke. The lesson I took from it though, which is not the lesson you expect, at the time I remember I was into video games and computer games as a lot of kids were. There was a computer company called Sierra On-Line, which made games like King's Quest and Space Quest. These games I love to play. I remember asking my parents at the time, can I invest in Sierra On-Line? They said no, you should invest in something established like Wang Laboratories. It didn't take much to convince me to do that. But I remember looking back, way on later on when I was adult, I could've invested in Sierra On-Line in 1989, and I think the company went on to five or 6x before it was acquired. I could have had a great first investment by investing in Wang Laboratories.
Chris Hill: What's great about this Matt is, there are so many people who have a similar experience to you. That alone just drives them away from the stock market [laughs] for the rest of their life. Not only have you continued to invest, you've made it your profession. Let me move on to, because obviously you've been doing this for a long time, what's the worst stock you've ever bought? Because you could go with Wang Laboratories, the company you bought went bankrupt. But I'm guessing you have another choice.
Matt Argersinger: No, I've many other choices. But one that really comes to mind is a company that's still traded today. It's not bankrupt and it wasn't even my worst performing investment. But it's company called Biglari Holdings and the ticker is BH. I think what really brought me into that company was as a young investor, especially since I remember 10 years ago or so. We're all searching for the next Warren Buffett, and we're always so quick to name the next Warren Buffett. Well, here I found a young entrepreneur named Sardar Biglari, he had run a hedge fund as a young person, he had a really good track record, and he ends up acquiring this restaurant company called Steak 'n Shake, which you can still find in the Midwest and other states. He turns around the restaurant and his whole plan was Steak 'n Shake is going to be this business that kicks off a lot of cash flow. I'm going to invest in all these other businesses, and he does.
He invests in an energy company, he invests in insurance business. In my eyes, I like this is my Warren Buffett. This is the guy that's going to lead me to the promised land, he's going to build the next Berkshire Hathaway. I literally went to every annual meeting for about five or six straight years up in New York. I was so enthralled by it. The reason it's my worst investment is because I let the mystique of him and the company force me to keep putting money into this business, even though I could see that the way it was being managed was not right. The Steak 'n Shake business itself was falling off and it's really fallen off now if you know the company. I let myself just be load in and not really objective about it as much as I should have been as an analyst. I think it's my worst investment just because of the time, the mental energy, and the amount of capital I put in routinely into this company for years before I wised up and sold my position several years ago.
Chris Hill: I appreciate you making that distinction because I think the default thinking for a lot of people is the worst stock you buy, is the stock that you lose the most money on, or it has the greatest percentage drop. But as you said, there's a time element there.
Matt Argersinger: Right?
Chris Hill: A mindshare element that can cost you as well. Let's go in a more positive direction. What's the stock that means the most to you, not necessarily because it's been the biggest winner, but because of some affinity you have for the business.
Matt Argersinger: Yeah. This is an easy one. Right about when I was about to finish college, one of my first investments I made where it was my own brokerage account making the investment was Boston Beer. You know it, maker of Samuel Adams. This was in 2001, I believe. The stock was trading from $14 a share. The reason I love it is because in college, I loved the Samuel Adams blogger. At that time they really just had the Samuel Adams lager, and now of course these days they've got dozens of labels. They've got the Twisted Tea, Angry Orchard cider, and the Seltzer. They've got a lot of beverages, and they're a much bigger company. But I just knew the company, I had an affinity for the brand. I love the story of Jim Koch, the founder and CEO. I've owned shares ever since.
One of the cool things is I remember when I first bought shares for myself, my brother was graduating high school and I ordered away one of those ones share certificates that you can get. I don't know if you can do that anymore, but I got them one share of Boston Beer, at $14 a share, plus 10 or 20 bucks whatever the shipping handling was for this certificate. The beautiful thing is, over the years, I could tell him like, hey, you know that certificate you've got hanging on your wall, it keeps going up in value. At one point Boston Beer was trading over $1,000 a share. The bad part about this story is that several years ago, my brother didn't tell me this, but he actually sold it, I know in 2016 or 17. He sold it when he was, I guess, moving apartments and he just was like how are these things worth like four or 500 bucks now, I should sell it, and what a bum. [laughs] But anyway, so it's just got an interesting story and I've held this stock for so long that yeah, it's pretty much pardoning me now.
Chris Hill: Also, when you're in college, beer tends to be a commodity that people save money on. Like if you're buying Sam Adams beer in college like that's a premium beer.
Matt Argersinger: Well. It was the aspirational beer. It's was like we would buy the Yuenglings and the Budweisers thinking about someday, someday we're going to pay 999 for that six pack of Sam Adams. Now I'm in it, it's like a tree.
Chris Hill: Is there one that got away? Do you have your version of a stock that you sold too soon or just for whatever reason never pulled the trigger on?
Matt Argersinger: Yeah, the one it's an easy one, because I bet you everyone listening on this has owned it at least part of their life, but I never owned Apple. Can you believe that? I've never owned shares of Apple, and I think because I always assumed for years that Apple's they're at their peak, it's really a hardware business, and hardware over time, especially in the consumer electronics space, it's not exactly a great business. I totally underestimated their amazing transition to software services, and just the whole they have on the App Store, which has become the ecosystem of mobile apps and technology. For some stupid reason, I admired the company. I was always impressed by the company, I used their products like no one else, but I never bought shares. It's pretty sad.
Chris Hill: Apple is one of those companies that, from the standpoint of investing, it essentially broke to long-standing things that all investors tended to agree on. One is what you already spoke to, which is the whole, well, consumer electronics, the price comes down over time. For such a long time, that was the narrative around Apple. It's like, well, they're not going to be able to keep charging this amount of money for those phones, are they? The other one was all of the debate around them paying a dividend. Are they going to pay a dividend? Well, if they do that, it will turn them into a stodgy old dividend paying company, and it will just kill their growth. It's like they did that, and then we've never had that conversation since. As investors, we've never had that.
Matt Argersinger: Apple broke some serious rules. They fooled me for sure, lowercase fooled, and I never bought shares, missed out on huge gains.
Chris Hill: Is there a company you own shares of that you particularly admire?
Matt Argersinger: Yeah, I was thinking about this. I think I have two that I need to mention. They're similar but different in a lot of ways, but Amazon and the Home Depot. Amazon, not just because what the scope and scale of this company that Jeff Bezos has built, but just their ability to always, to use that old analogy, escape where the puck is going, in terms of e-commerce, of course, but just third-party fulfillment. Amazon Web Services, cloud computing, mobile advertising, just so many streaming, they're always into the best places in such a great job. I just so admire how they've been able to get into all these different businesses. I think the Home Depot, if you just think of their history as a ""big box retailer"", the margins they put up, the growth that they've been able to achieve without actually growing that many stores. These days Home Depot they open maybe a dozen stores per year. But you just see the growth that they're able to continually put out and the affinity that people have for that experience that they get from Home Depot and the products and services. The way they got into the big contracting business several years ago, that's been worked out. Two businesses, Amazon and Home Depot, that I think of always just seems like they're ahead of the competition, ahead of the curve, and I love owning both businesses, and I plan to hold them for a very long time.
Chris Hill: You have to assume that both of those businesses also have a lot of institutional discipline built-in. Just hearing you talk about The Home Depot really not opening a lot of new locations year after year. You have to believe there are some people inside the executive ranks saying, no, we can do more than this, even if we just go from 12 to 24 in a year, that sort of thing.
Matt Argersinger: Right.
Chris Hill: The same with Amazon. The discipline not just to go after new initiatives, but to say no to a lot of others.
Matt Argersinger: Absolutely. It's so impressive.
Chris Hill: What is the stock that is your biggest holding?
Matt Argersinger: Yes. It's a base holding by orders of magnitude and it wasn't really by design. Well, maybe kind of. MercadoLibre, which I've talked about on this show for years. The reason it is my biggest holding, not only because it's been such an amazing winner over the last, I've held it for gosh now, 13 or 14 years, and I've added to it. But the reason I've added to it is that not only has the business been successful, but I was a part of this service called Supernova, which you know about, and we recommended MercadoLibre for our portfolio in Supernova, I want to say, seven or eight times, and I made it a point when I was the advisor of that service to really follow our owninvestment advice I bought pretty much every investment we made, including MercadoLibre, seven or eight times.
That was incredibly fortunate, but I certainly love the business. I mean, as the e-commerce leader in Latin America, big presence in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and other countries. What I loved especially is early on they are actually owned by eBay. I don't know if many investors know that, and I was worried that they were going to a little bit follow the eBay model, which is not a terrible model, and not really go after the logistics and fulfillment part of the business that really completes that consumer shopping cycle. But fortunately they really did go after Amazon starting about seven or eight years ago, modeling Amazon but also modeling PayPal with payments and transactions. It just becomes such a big e-commerce powerhouse throughout Latin America, and I just see many years ahead of big growth for them.
Chris Hill: You're the reason I own shares of MercadoLibre. I wish I had listened to you the first several times you'd mentioned it on the show before finally clinging in. But I do want to ask you about something you mentioned, which is the number of times you added to it. What was that like? To the extent that you can, walk me through that mental process, because I find this to be a challenge, and I'm sure other investors do as well. The idea of adding to our winners sounds great in theory, but for me, the struggle is, well, wait, I already bought it at this lower cost base. I do have that hurdle I need to get over. I've gotten into it some times in my life, but not all the time. How did you do it?
Matt Argersinger: It took me a long time too, and I think it was really honestly just working closely with David Gardner for years and seeing him. We rerecommend these stocks that he'd recommended years ago that were up five, six, 10x and he's recommending them again. It was tough for me early on as well, but then I just thought, why am I so focused on what David Gardner would say, which is what most investors do, which is they water their weeds and trim their flowers. I should be watering my flowers and trimming my weeds. I had to pound that in my head, but eventually I did, and thankfully, it's led me to buy MercadoLibre all the way up, buy Amazon and other companies on the way up. Winners tend to keep winning. I think that's something also David Gardner says. It is hard to get your head around as an investor. As an investor, we're hardwired to be looking for bargains, and discounts from what we paid. But if you have a premium business, pay up and keep paying up as you go, it'll make a huge difference. The biggest difference to my portfolio, my returns, my net worth over time has come from adding multiple times to winners. It hasn't come from seeking bargains or doubling down on stocks as we like to do.
Chris Hill: Matt, thanks so much for being here.
Matt Argersinger: Thank you, Chris.

Bill Mann: One of the best pieces of advice I've ever gotten from someone is that you should be jealous of your equity. There are small-cap managers out there who have come public without selling any shares into the public markets.
Chris Hill: I'm Chris Hill, and that's Bill Mann, Director of Small Cap Research at The Motley Fool. Ricky Mulvey caught up with him for part two of their series on small-cap investing. They talk about how to discover new opportunities among small-cap stocks and some key metrics that can tell you a lot about a company's future.
Ricky Mulvey: Last week, we laid out a framework for small-cap investing. This week we're diving a little deeper. Joining us again is Bill Mann. He accepted the calendar invite and he's also the small-cap investing director at the Motley Fool. Thanks for joining us again.
Bill Mann: Thanks for letting people know that my presence on this show is just due to my availability.
Ricky Mulvey: That is correct. I think there's you can't have one without the other. First, I want to start off with some framing questions a little bit different than last time. We talked about the benefits of holding onto small caps for a long period of time. But it's also like investing is a game. If small-cap investing is a game then who is this game for?
Bill Mann: When you think about small-cap investing, you're talking about companies that generally speaking have less available information, they are less liquid. Frankly, a lot of people just haven't really heard of these companies, which means that your ability just to come across them is somewhat reduced. You need to be willing to be an active participant in the markets in order to be a small-cap investor in order to do it well. Now by active participant in the market, I don't mean that you need to be a trader. What I mean is that you need to be willing to do the work to learn about companies that are going to have a lower level of information about them than you might be used to with some of the larger companies.
Ricky Mulvey: Then on the flip side of that, who are the types of investors, the types of folks you would recommend, turn off the podcast, go home, stay away from the small-cap game?
Bill Mann: Well, I mean, one of the things that we talked about last week that is true on an individual level is that small caps tend to be much more volatile than larger-cap companies. That has to do with a lack of information, a lower market cap, and simply little more obscurity and a little less liquidity. I happen to think that small-cap investing is one of the areas where individual investors have an absolute advantage over institutional investors. It is one of the areas in which if you are willing to do your homework, you are able to get into companies both earlier and in some cases ones that institutions cannot buy.
Ricky Mulvey: I think it's worth it, but I know we mentioned that last week, but I think it's worth diving that idea a little bit deeper. If you're a Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, if you're a major mutual fund company like you, it straight up, isn't worth your time to look at the small-cap companies because often you're investing more money than the market caps of some of these companies?
Bill Mann: That's exactly it. To be a diversified mutual fund in the United States, you cannot put more than five percent of your money into any one company. You immediately start to think about just the mechanics of a mutual fund that's got several billion dollars in assets under management, what good is it to them to go and find a $100 million company if they are limited by how much of the company that they can buy, also, how much of the fund they can commit to that company. There are all sorts of limitations that really make it. It's not worth their while to play in this pool, which is why it's great for us as individual investors. I mean, people get excited about IPOs because of the pops and things like that. That's not really truly where the advantages for investors. The advantage for individual investors is investing in places where institutions cannot go.
Ricky Mulvey: Well, I think there's a couple of exceptions like you can buy. There are small-cap index funds like VB, the Vanguard Small-Cap fund is a very popular ETF with very low expense fees. I guess the only, I shouldn't say issue, but the cost of that it's literally thousands of companies within that one ETF, which in itself has an advantage, you have the diversification. But to your earlier point if you do the homework, they are drastic differences in the qualities of these companies.
Bill Mann: I think that's absolutely right, and research has actually borne this out. There is a much higher prevalence of companies that fail or underperform within small caps. The other reason why I think that small-cap investing from an institutional standpoint is not necessarily the way that you want to go is that the definition of small caps at the institutional level is fixed. For example, a company like Activision, which is now a massive company. When it first came public, it was a small cap company. But at some point, if it is a successful small-cap company, it moves into the mid-cap space and it moves into the large-cap space. You can't continue to hold it as an institution, which we as individual investors can. I mean, very famously here at The Motley Fool, David Gardner did that with Amazon having held it since 1998 when it actually was a small cap, so we do have that advantage.
Ricky Mulvey: Since these are less talked about, less followed, how do you look for interesting small-caps?
Bill Mann: I mean, Ricky, this is going to sound a little diminutive, but just open your eyes. The fact that companies aren't talked about that much means that one of the things that you can do is you can just start to pay attention whenever you go to the store and you choose one product over another, there's a point in time where you can say, well, who makes this or when you hear someone talking about being excited that a chain is coming to your area or when you hear your kids talking about a website that they use. All of these things they don't feel like research, but particularly in the small-cap realm, they are. Most of the companies that I own that I bought when were small caps really came from some form of personal experience.
This goes back a long way. It's perhaps, maybe the most famous story of someone doing this was Peter Lynch, who was the longtime portfolio manager for Fidelity Magellan went to go have lunch one day and he noticed a line going out the door at Taco Bell. He went back and this was before Taco Bell became part of Pepsi and then part of Yom and Taco Bell had its own ticker. With not that much more research, he bought part of it. That turned out fantastically well for them. The great news with small-cap companies is that if you see something small that's well-run, that's public, that's really a big part of your research.
Ricky Mulvey: In many cases though, you're looking for younger companies. Within the past couple of years, a lot of the younger companies have SPAC'd or IPO'd at extraordinarily high levels. Now they're, they're down. I guess there's two parts of this question, or I guess there's one part of this question. Market timing tends to be a losing game, but it seems like now might be a richer environment to look for small caps now that a lot of those valuations have been brought back down to earth.
Bill Mann: I like the way that you put it that way, and again, because small caps are actually defined by the market as by the size of market cap, there were a lot of companies that were actually very small companies that had mid-cap and even large cap valuations and have now come way back down to earth. For example, there's a Korean company that came public in 2021 called Coupang, and it is a combination of Amazon and eBay, and it's a wonderfully run company. It's now much lower in price, and so, therefore, it is a small cap. In some ways, there is a level of risk that comes with smaller companies with higher share prices or higher valuations. When they come back to earth, you get to see that risk turned on its head where the expectations that are being put into these companies now are much lower. Ricky, they're really the same companies. Obviously, the environment has changed from 2020 and 2021. Let's hope we never go back to that again, but at the same time, these companies are not that far away from that same part of their development curve, as they were then at 60, 70, even 80 percent lower price than they were even a year ago.
Ricky Mulvey: Last week we talked about some of the metrics to watch, sales, trading volume, minimum share price, all that good stuff. Let's look at some more. One of which we didn't talk about on last week's show, but I think is worth bringing up is Insider Holdings. What are you watching for in terms of management owning the company that they're managing?
Bill Mann: I think with small-cap companies, you want someone who is lashed to the mast of the company. We talk a lot here at The Motley Fool about companies being founder-led. That's a bit of a shortcut to saying that you want a CEO who is absolutely positively dedicated to making sure that this company succeeds. One way that you can see that their interests are aligned with yours as shareholders is straight, insider ownership. What percentage company does the insider own? This gets to be somewhat absurd with larger cap companies because you're talking about companies that are billions and billions of dollars, but in the smaller cap companies, if you see a company that is valued at a billion dollars and the founder owns less than a million dollars in shares you know that this founder has in some ways traded away whatever interest he or she has in the business for some upfront payment. It doesn't mean that this isn't a talented founder, this isn't a talented CEO, but it is a way that you can determine whether they are going to be really motivated to see that share price go up over time.
Ricky Mulvey: They're not exactly playing in a contract year.
Bill Mann: They're not playing into contract year, that's right. When you own 10 percent of the company, every day is a contract year.
Ricky Mulvey: I think it's also worth talking about how these companies manage share count a little bit. Younger companies have more opportunities to widen them, is getting diluted out of a younger company. Is that something you watch is how they manage that share dilution? We had a conversation earlier before recording about Rent the Runway a little bit.
Bill Mann: Rent the Runway, I believe that their share count went up about six times between last year and this year. It's an extraordinary amount. Now, that in and of itself is not 100 percent concerning, because they did go public, and when a company goes public, they are in fact selling shares to the public. But it is a tremendous amount of dilution, and it does tell you in some ways that the insiders are more interested in selling than they are making sure that they retain as much equity as possible. One of the best pieces of advice I've ever gotten from someone is that you should be jealous of your equity. There are small cap managers out there who have come public without selling any shares into the public markets. It's all secondary and pre-public shareholders who want to sell. Again, it's not a sure thing that a company that you see a big share dilution is a bad company and a company that doesn't dilute shares is a good company, but it's a pretty good way to vote.
Ricky Mulvey: When you're looking at profitability, cash flow from operations, free cash flow, is that something that you're keeping a close eye on or are you giving a lot of these companies the benefit of the doubt, hey, these are younger, they might need some time to reach profitability?
Bill Mann: It really depends. For younger companies, you absolutely do. You have to keep in mind, when companies go bankrupt, and in smaller caps, they really do actually go bankrupt more often than large caps do. I think that the reasons why probably makes sense. They are much more on a razor's edge. It's not a lack of profits that causes a company to go bankrupt, it's a lack of cash. You really do see situations where companies aren't showing much profitability, but at the same time, they are either generating cash flows or they're not burning that much. Now, with a younger company, that's something that I'm pretty comfortable with, just so you can see the path, even though you have to keep in the back of your mind the knowledge that you are doing something that is a little bit higher risk anytime that you own a company that is not currently profitable. But yeah, cash is king. What you need to do with smaller cap companies that are not generating profits or are not generating free cash flow is tests the thesis. Make sure that you understand what the path is. Are they in a heavy development stage? Keep yourself honest. If you see a new excuse for why they're not free cash-flow positive or they're no closer to profitability, that's a company that you probably want to get out of pretty.
Ricky Mulvey: Off the cash flow statement, off the balance sheet, are there any metrics or data points that you like to look at it as a small cap investor?
Bill Mann: One of the things that I think is really important with small cap companies, and this might sound funny, but I really want to see a rising number of customers. You have small cap companies and sometimes they'll have customers where you see the biggest customer is 60 percent of their revenues. That means that this company is in some ways captive or hostage to that big company. If you see a company with a rapidly growing number of customers, and this is something that they all disclose in their 10Ks, if you know where to look for it, there's a management discussion of the business, and they will describe how many and what types of customers they have. One thing I love to see is a breadth and growing number of customers for these small cap companies.
Ricky Mulvey: We've done the academic portion. Let's look at some real life companies. Get some real-life fish on the line [OVERLAPPING]. Last week, we talked about how every company has good dysfunction. It's the question you have as an investor is, is what do you look past and then what puts up a red flag. Let's go off that point. Are there companies that you see with some good dysfunctions and then are there any dysfunctions that you're happy to watch on the sidelines?
Bill Mann: One company that I really do admire is Wingstop. The ticker is, as you might guess, W-I-N-G. It is a franchisor of the Wingstop brand. It sells chicken wings and boneless wings and all sorts of deliciousness in about 1,600 franchised restaurants all around the United States. One of the things that I look for with restaurant companies in particular is low food costs and low cost of production. A very well-known CEO by the name of Selim Bassoul, who was the CEO of Middleby, was a kitchen supply company, talked about companies that were in the restaurant space that treated their kitchen like a factory. Now that sounds terrible. As a purchaser and as a customer, you don't want to think of your restaurants as being a factory, but what he means by that is where the steps are all standardized and it takes as much cost as possible out of the process. Wingstop, as a small-cap company, is one of the best in the business.
Ricky Mulvey: At a little bit of a pivot, did they do the Thighstop during the chicken wing shortage?
Bill Mann: They did; that's right. That's one of the areas of dysfunction. Obviously, if you were to talk about the risks to Wingstop, maybe the best one is that people will stop eating chicken wings, but I mean, come on. But chicken wings by themselves are a singular supply risk that they have, and wings like a lot of other things this last year, the price went parabolic. They shifted, I think, in a very funny, clever way, and people embraced it.
Ricky Mulvey: Speaking of restaurants, there's one that I've been happy to watch on the sidelines, and that has been Red Robin, where their dysfunctions as a company seems a little bit more difficult to surmount.
Bill Mann: It's so disappointing, isn't it? They've got a huge number of franchises. They sell wine milkshakes. How is it possible that this hasn't worked?
Ricky Mulvey: Looking through some of their financials, they've had about, this is last year, not this year, 1.2 billion in sales and a price to sales ratio of 0.22, which is that of a grocery store, not a restaurant.
Bill Mann: Yeah.
Ricky Mulvey: I think there's questions for me about essentially, how are you not profitable selling hamburgers to Americans at a beloved chain? Then number 2, for me, has been management, particularly the way that they've been handling the balance sheet. As of 2021, Red Robin had 23 million in net cash, 51 million in short-term debt, and $620 million in long-term debt. Right now, [inaudible 00:20:12] , of a market cap of about a 130 million.
Bill Mann: It's really incredible, isn't it? Now they've got about 600 restaurants, 500 of which they own, and then they have about another hundred of them that are franchised. You can't understand why a company that has franchises would have cash dynamics like that. Now, this is a company that has been pretty good at selling but has been absolutely positively lousy over time at managing its costs. It's very different from something like Wingstop where it's easy to say, their costs are higher now because of one input or two or three inputs. This is a case of a company that has never gotten its cost structure under control. I don't care how many hamburgers you sell, the point of a company is not to sell as many hamburgers as possible, it's not to sell as many wine milkshakes as possible; it's to make money. They have not figured out how to do it, and their stock is down 70 percent since 2015. You're not talking about a company that has seen its stock drop sharply over the last year. That is seven years' worth of the market telling the company that it needs to change its ways.
Ricky Mulvey: CEO Paul Murphy is retiring, and just as an observer, I do enjoy watching how he handles conference calls. In the latest one, this is just how he opened the presentation to investors, ""As the headlines have become increasingly negative as it relates to consumer confidence, general inflation, and the likelihood of a recession, casual dine-in traffic has been trending downward, still when we evaluate our sales and traffic trends relative to our peers in the same markets, we are outperforming the casual dine-in segment."" That to me is an absolute heater telling investors like, to start this off, listen folks, the economy is bad, it is really bad.
Bill Mann: I don't know if you've heard, I know I'm going to get asked about this, the economy's bad.
Ricky Mulvey: I feel bad beating up on Red Robin. I like the restaurant, I like going there, and I want it to be profitable. That's why I follow it, but it's been difficult. Let's speak a little bit more positively. I don't need to keep beating up on hamburgers. But one thing you brought up in the last show was a way to frame companies as an investor. As you say, if this company disappeared, it would be extremely painful to its customers.
Bill Mann: This isn't exciting at all. Prepare yourself. We're about to talk about workers compensation insurance.
Ricky Mulvey: I'm buckled in.
Bill Mann: We're talking about a company called Employers Holdings Incorporated. The ticker is EIG. It's based in Reno. It provides insurance to companies, specifically for workers' compensation, which is an area for companies that is an enormous, almost open-ended risk if their insurers do not handle it properly. Employers Holdings, this is essentially their only line of business, and they are really good at it. We'd like not to think much about insurance, but it really bears remembering how many things would cease to happen in this country if companies were unable to have insurance that protected them against specific types of claims, and maybe at the top of the list is workers compensation.
Ricky Mulvey: Bill, it is incredibly difficult for me to tell if you're pausing for comedic timing or if your screen is simply frozen. These are the joys of remote recording.
Bill Mann: Maybe both. How about both?
Ricky Mulvey: It could be, sure, why not? Last thing, one quality we talked about in last week's episode is, hey, it's OK to look at products that customers just really seem to like. Going back to the Peter Lynch idea. When you think of smaller companies with the products that customers really seem to like, that's the fill-in-the-blank. What do you think of?
Bill Mann: Well, there's a company that's based actually in the UK, but almost all of its business is here in the United States, about 80 percent of it, called Naked Wines. Naked Wines, you're going to like this, they'll send wine to your door on a subscription basis and their customers love it, and the vineyards love it because the vineyards get to lock in an entire vintage of wine, and it's pre-sold to Naked Wines who then sells it out to their customers, an absolutely wonderful model. It's a really small company. Obviously as we have come out from the pandemic, people are leaving their houses again, maybe we don't need as much wine mailed to our house as we did in late 2020, but it's a company that has a tremendous amount of what's called customer retention, which means that very few of the people who actually try Naked Wines end up leaving it.
Ricky Mulvey: Supply side, that seems nice that you don't have to deal with the entire complex distribution process of all the wine shops that seem to be independently owned, multiple wine distributors, I clearly see the problem that it's solving.
Bill Mann: Also vineyards, basically all of their investment is upfront. There's this strange pressure because they know the optimal day to pick their grapes. These are basically very, very high-end chemistry experiments. But they also know that if they pick them just a few days sooner, they start to get their cash sooner. If their cash is fronted to them, they can actually optimize on the quality of the grapes, the end quality of the wine. From beginning to end, it is a better process for really everyone involved.
Ricky Mulvey: The other thing is companies don't just start out as small caps, they can also go back to being small caps. In this past, let's call it bearish market, you've seen a lot of companies that went to the mid cap land and then turned out to be small caps like sure, there's Lemonade, there's Upstart, but also if you look in the, we call it the dredges of the S&P 500, there's a flooring manufacturer called Mohawk Industries. You got your sin stocks, Penn Gaming, Wynn Resorts, and you also got an IT outfit called DXC Technology. Let's call some of these companies that mid cap graveyard. It doesn't have to be from an investability perspective, but are there any of these companies that went to mid cap land and came back that are interesting to you?
Bill Mann: Well, we already talked about Coupang earlier, but Penn National, PENN Entertainment is absolutely one of those and yes, it is a sin stock. They've got casinos in 20 states, 44 properties. They are a management company of casinos. I don't know about you, Ricky, but I really do believe that 20, 30, even 50 years from now, we Americans will still gamble.
Ricky Mulvey: Yes, I'm pretty confident in that. It's like this is the thing I struggle with, which is it's invest in the best vision of the future. But also I think part of the future might look a little bit like that movie Idiocracy, and if I can sit on my couch and gamble on the baseball game, UFC fight, NFL game that's on TV, am I going to deny that that makes the game somewhat more exciting?
Bill Mann: My best vision of the future is not in a casino outside of Saint Louis on a Thursday night, it just isn't.
Ricky Mulvey: I think that's pretty fair.
Bill Mann: But Idiocracy is exactly right. We should embrace the fact that we as human beings do like to have fun, and we like us a good gamble. We really do. There's absolutely, positively, nothing wrong with that, and Penn National is a company that's been incredibly intelligent about how they go about deploying places for people to do this all around the United States of America.
Ricky Mulvey: We are moving into the wrap-up as we're completing these two episodes on small cap investing. Is there anything you think that we didn't talk about for the small-cap curious that you would want to make sure they know before they entered this investing space?
Bill Mann: The best thing that you can do with any small cap is go and get their annual report and read the letter to shareholders, which will, generally speaking, be written by the CEO or the chairman, whoever the most important person at the company is. In those words, you can get a sense of what this company is about and what this leader is about. Because these companies, they are so specifically dependent upon good management, you really want to know what this management is. One thing that I like to do actually is just go onto YouTube and see if there's an interview with the person who is running the company. In almost all situations, you'll be able to find something and you will get a sense of whether this is a person that you would like to put your money with or if this is a person who you would like to wish good luck.
Ricky Mulvey: It's not so fun to gamble outside of Saint Louis on a Thursday night, but it is a lot of fun to read a company's annual report and its management discussion for shareholders. Bill Mann, thanks for being a part of this series. Thanks for guiding us through the small cap investing landscape.
