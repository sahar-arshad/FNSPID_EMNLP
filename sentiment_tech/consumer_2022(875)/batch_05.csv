2022-09-22 00:00:00+00:00,7 Stocks to Buy That Can Soar in Good Times or in Bad,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-to-buy-that-can-soar-in-good-times-or-in-bad,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Many commentators, analysts, and economists are convinced that the U.S. will enter a recession next year. Given the strength of the labor market and of corporate balance sheets, along with the onshoring phenomenon and the many jobs that the energy transition is creating, I have my doubts as to whether a recession is on the way. Still, I can certainly understand investors’ desire to find recession-proof growth stocks to buy.
Such equities can come in a few different forms. Pharmaceutical stocks rely primarily on governments and health insurers for their revenue, neither of which is overly affected by recessions. As a result, the shares of successful drugmakers can soar in good times and bad.
Then there are the companies that become more popular with some consumers during recessions. Also known as “trade-down” stocks, fast food chains and deep-discount retailers fall into this category.
Finally, there are companies that sell products that most consumers, companies and governments will find necessary even during recessions, such as energy and cybersecurity.
Here are seven stocks to buy regardless of where the economy is headed.
LLY Eli Lilly $311.32
MCD McDonald’s $247.91
GSK GlaxoSmithKline $30.02
DLTR Dollar Tree $139.33
DG Dollar General $240.25
LNG Cheniere Energy $166.29
FTNT Fortinet $48.74
Eli Lilly (LLY)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
The broader market may be in the bear’s grips, but pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) isn’t. Shares are up 34% over the past year. The company has many successful drugs that treat ailments such as diabetes, psoriasis and breast cancer. But perhaps the one that holds the most promise is the company’s potential obesity drug.
Tirzepatide, which is marketed as Mounjaro, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat diabetes back in May after clinical data showed it lowered blood sugar levels and led to weight loss. The market for diabetes treatment is large, but the market for a successful weight loss treatment could be astronomical. Eli Lily is currently conducting studies on Mounjaro as a weight-loss treatment.
UBS analyst Colin Bristow upgraded LLY stock to a “buy” from “neutral” based on the potential of Mounjaro. Per Barron’s:
Bristow’s thesis is simple: Treating 1.6 million Americans annually would equate to $20 billion in U.S. sales. And that is still less than 2% of the estimated obese population in the U.S., he said. Usage is likely to be higher partly because the drug has strong trial results and a favorable position in terms of competition, he said, noting that management said on anearnings callthat demand is robust.
It’s possible Eli Lilly has one of the most lucrative drugs of all time on its hands. I don’t expect the stock to have any problem continuing to outperform.
McDonald’s (MCD)
Source: Tama2u / Shutterstock
A few weeks ago, I identified McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) as a stock that will benefit from the “trade-down” phenomenon during a recession. MCD “is a good defensive stock because many working-class and middle-class families will start eating there instead of more expensive restaurants if the economy turns south,” I wrote.
I’m far from the only one bullish on the fast food chain.
On Aug. 26, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said he sees shares hitting the $300 level, which is about 20% above the current share price. And he’s not even the most optimistic of the bunch. Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth recently upped his price target to $320, implying nearly 30% upside. Per The Fly, Feinseth said McDonald’s “reinvests its cash flow in new growth initiatives and enhances shareholder returns through ongoing dividend increases and share repurchases.”
Anecdotally, I remember that, in the 1990s and early 2000s, many members of Generation X and Generation Y with whom I was acquainted refused to eat McDonald’s food. But since around 2009, I’ve noticed that the company’s offerings have become accepted by more people in those generations, and the chain is popular among millennials. When I go to McDonald’s restaurants, they are often quite crowded.
Also noteworthy is that, during the second quarter, McDonald’s global comparable sales soared 9.7% year over year.
MCD stock is up 3% over the past year compared with a loss of 13% for the S&P 500. I believe shares will continue to perform well in both good and bad economic times.
GSK (GSK)
Source: Willy Barton / Shutterstock.com
GSK (NYSE:GSK), formerly GlaxoSmithKline, has more than 100 approved products across 80-plus markets, along with a promising pipeline with more than 60 drugs and vaccines in development.
GSK has seen great success with its blockbuster shingles vaccine Shingrix, which provides more than eight years of protection against the virus, according to the company. Speaking at a recent industry conference, Roger Connor, president of GSK Vaccines, said that 33 million Americans have received at least one dose of Shingrix. But with 120 million people in the U.S. over the age of 50, and thus recommended to get the vaccine, Connor said the company is “still only scratching the surface” of the available market in the U.S. Meanwhile, GSK is distributing Shingrix in 24 countries and plans to raise that number to 35 by 2024, according to Connor.
On the oncology front, GSK has two very promising drugs. The first is Zejula for ovarian cancer. Earlier this month, GSK released positive results from a Phase 3 trial. The company said it “maintained a clinically significant risk reduction of progression or death of 48% compared to placebo” after a median time period of 3.5 years among patients with HRD biomarkers.
The second drug is Dostarlimab, sold under the brand name Jemperli, which has been approved to treat mismatch repair-deficient recurrent or advanced solid tumors. These are most often associated with endometrial, colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers.
As I wrote recently, a small study showed that 100% of the 12 rectal cancer patients who completed treatment with Dostarlimab went into remission. This success rate is extremely unusual for a cancer drug. Larger studies are obviously needed, but the potential for a highly effective cancer treatment is a good reason for investors to keep their eye on GSK stock.
Dollar Tree (DLTR)
Source: shutterstock.com/Jonathan Weiss
So-called “dollar store” operators always get a lot of attention when the economy is struggling, for obvious reasons. There are actually two of them on today’s list of stocks to buy, the first being Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR).
Shares are up 62% over the past year despite a sharp sell-off over the past month following the release of the company’s second-quarter results. Revenue increased nearly 7% year over year to $6.8 billion, while same-store sales increased 7.5%. And earnings of $1.60 per share beat analyst estimates by a penny. However, management reduced its guidance for the full year, citing a focus on offering more competitive pricing at its Family Dollar stores.
Despite its reduced outlook, Dollar Tree has felt the love from analysts. On Sept. 6, JPMorgan’s Matthew Boss reiterated his “overweight” rating and raised his price target for shares to $176 from $171. Boss noted that the stock looks undervalued based on its historical forward price-to-earnings ratio.
Meanwhile, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli said the post-earnings sell-off looks overdone. And despite lowering his price target to $168 from $178, he recommended investors be “aggressive buyers” of DLTR stock.
Dollar General (DG)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Dollar General (NYSE:DG) CEO Todd Vasos made headlines earlier this month when he said that more of the retailer’s customers have been higher-earning individuals who make between $75,000 and $100,000 a year. These middle-income and wealthier shoppers are feeling the sting of inflation as well and looking to cut costs.
Wall Street analysts have been beating the drums for DG stock. Citing solid Q1 and Q2 results, Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai called it “one of the few stable retailers in a rocky retail backdrop.”
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman called DG his “preferred stock in the Dollar Store space” and upped his price target to $270 from $250. The new target implies 12% upside from current levels. Per The Fly: “The company’s 10.5% EPS growth suggest[s] Dollar General is benefiting from the macro backdrop, including from trade down, while execution on initiatives and solid margin control reinforce what he sees as safety in his estimates, Gutman tells investors.”
Dollar General’s shares are up significantly less than Dollar Tree’s over the past year at around 9%. But this underperformance could mean shares have more room to run. They certainly look undervalued, trading at just 1.6 times sales.
Cheniere Energy (LNG)
Source: Aerial-motion / Shutterstock.com
Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG) is the top U.S. liquefied natural gas exporter. As I wrote in a previous column, it is extremely well-positioned to benefit from sky-high natural gas prices in Europe. Although the eurozone is almost certainly heading for a recession, energy demand is not likely to be affected much and could very well rise as the region looks to transition to electric vehicles.
Also boding well for investors, the company recently said it expects to generate over $20 billion of available cash through 2026 and distributable cash flow of more than $20 per share on a run-rate basis.
Cheniere continues to add new infrastructure that will allow it to export much more liquefied natural gas over the long term. Despite its strong positive catalysts and the 90% gain in LNG stock over the past 12 months, shares have a forward P/E ratio of just 10.8.
Fortinet (FTNT)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Given the huge legal bills and negative publicity that large-scale cybersecurity attacks bring, most companies are unlikely to cut their cybersecurity budgets much, if at all, during a recession. Uber (NYSE:UBER) was the latest big company to get hacked. Meanwhile, governments, which as I noted previously, are largely immune to recessions, are also spending a great deal of money on cybersecurity.
This makes Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) a good stock to buy for investors who are looking for names that can thrive during economic downturns.
On Sept. 17, MKM Partners analyst Catharine Trebnick initiated coverage of FTNT stock with a “buy” rating and a $70 price target. That’s 44% above the current share price. Trebnick notes that Fortinet has a number of competitive advantages, including the ability to monitor network traffic across multiple devices. She forecasts its billings could reach $10 billion by 2025.
While FTNT stock is down 19% over the past year, shares are unlikely to remain in a downtrend for much longer.

2022-09-21 00:00:00+00:00,"Is Trending Stock Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR) a Buy Now?",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-trending-stock-dollar-tree-inc.-dltr-a-buy-now,,,"Dollar Tree (DLTR) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Over the past month, shares of this discount retailer have returned -14.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -8.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, which Dollar Tree falls in, has lost 7.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Dollar Tree is expected to post earnings of $1.16 per share, indicating a change of +20.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -34.8% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.27 points to a change of +25.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -10.8%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.07 indicates a change of +11% from what Dollar Tree is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -14.9%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Dollar Tree is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
In the case of Dollar Tree, the consensus sales estimate of $6.83 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6.5%. The $28.01 billion and $29.69 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.5% and +6%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Dollar Tree reported revenues of $6.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. EPS of $1.60 for the same period compares with $1.23 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.78 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.28%. The EPS surprise was +1.27%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Dollar Tree is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Dollar Tree. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

2022-09-20 00:00:00+00:00,7 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy During a Stock Market Crash,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-nasdaq-stocks-to-buy-during-a-stock-market-crash,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
With technology-focused companies suffering a disproportionate beating during the present market rout, diving into Nasdaq stocks to buy seems risky. After all, the Nasdaq Composite has sustained a loss of 27% since the start of the year, far wider than the other two major indices. Nevertheless, daring contrarians should consider the compelling discounts on tap.
For one thing, not all Nasdaq stocks to buy are levered to the tech sector. Indeed, investors will find incredible diversity in the exchange that presents viable prospects should a market crash materialize.
As well, the equities sector operates in cycles. We got through an extraordinarily bullish cycle, so it must be corrected with a bearish one. That’s not unusual, nor should it necessarily be something to be feared. Therefore, the Nasdaq stocks to buy on the dip represents a way to take control of an otherwise dour-looking situation.

PepsiCo (PEP)

Arguably one of the best Nasdaq stocks to buy following a market implosion, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) specializes in soft drinks. Given the addictive quality of the underlying products, PEP really could be a no-brainer during times of trouble. Essentially, people seek a respite from various troubles and PepsiCo can help address them, though in a cynical fashion.
According to a report from CNN, soft drink manufacturers enjoy a captive audience framework. “The more soda you drink, the bigger the ‘reward,’ and as would happen with most pleasurable things, we develop an affinity and want even more of them,” said Cordialis Msora-Kasago, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
Further, even the diet variety of popular soda brands feature their own addictive qualities. During a market downturn, people will turn to stimuli, and caffeine and sugar represent popular ones. Therefore, PEP is an easy name to consider for Nasdaq stocks to buy.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com
Under normal circumstances, economic pressures – particularly those impacting consumer sentiment – should hurt Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). And technically, the circumstances that erupted this year imposed significantly negative results for AAPL stock. For instance, it has slipped more than 13% on a year-to-date basis. Still, those seeking Nasdaq stocks to buy following a market meltdown should look closely at AAPL.
Despite myriad reasons to avoid discretionary purchases as much as possible, it appears that logic doesn’t apply to Apple devices. Upon launching its latest gizmos and gadgets, preorder demand encouraged observing analysts. Given these products are hardly what you would call cheap, the robust interest in forking over hard-earned dollars presents many possibilities for the consumer technology giant.
Essentially, even if other discretionary businesses fail, Apple commands a social cachet that refuses to fade. While I wouldn’t throw everything into AAPL right now, it makes for an intriguing position to build up over time. Therefore, it’s one of the Nasdaq stocks to buy for patient investors.
Dollar Tree (DLTR)

As a discount retailer, Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) deserves significant attention among Nasdaq stocks to buy. Currently, the economic topic of the day, week, month and year is inflation. Specifically, when the money supply rises, the subsequent purchasing power of dollars in consumers’ hands declines. Obviously, this is basic Economics 101 – supply and demand.
However, what’s incredibly problematic about inflation is that it impacts modest income earners disproportionately. Indeed, the less money someone makes, the likelier it is that inflation imposes greater pain on them. Of course, the Federal Reserve understands this point. But if it fails to engineer a soft landing and instead facilitates a rough one, plenty of people can fall out of the upper income thresholds.
No one wants to see this circumstance materialize. However, if it does happen, you’ll want to consider DLTR as one of the Nasdaq stocks to buy.
Ulta Beauty (ULTA)

Deeply contrarian, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) could very well be one of those 5,000-IQ market plays if you’re specifically seeking Nasdaq stocks to buy. While the underlying index suffered a loss of nearly 28% YTD, during the same period, ULTA is up 1.3%. True, by absolute standards, gaining 1.3% for the year hardly rates as exciting territory. But again, the major equity indices presently swim (or drown) in red ink.
That ULTA stock rides against the tide presents a worthy case for Nasdaq stocks to buy in and of itself. Still, it begs the question: why is Ulta doing so well (relatively speaking) when other businesses floundered? It may boil down to relevance of the underlying industry.
Currently, one of the debates in the domestic economy focuses on the return-to-the-office battle. In short, workers want to stay home, but upper management wants them physically back in their posts. Because enterprises sign the checks, they make the rules. Therefore, a possible full return to normal could inspire concerns about looking presentable in the workplace, thus boding well for ULTA.
Amazon (AMZN)

Arguably, the red ink Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is seeing may be cathartic to many, if not most people. In several ways, Amazon represented an economic vacuum cleaner, sucking away opportunities from mom-and-pop stores. By killing the diverse small-business ecosystem, the e-commerce giant effectively became the Hollywood epitome of every corporate bad guy. Therefore, I suspect few tears exist for Amazon’s woes.
At the same time, for investors willing to set aside their emotions, AMZN could be one of the better ideas for Nasdaq stocks to buy during a market meltdown. True, the underlying firm suffers from myriad controversies. Nevertheless, replacing such a dynamic and dominant firm will be difficult. Politically, I’m not sure it makes sense to dismantle or otherwise stymie Amazon considering rising competition in the global economy.
Further, Amazon plays into several relevant industries. It’s not just e-commerce, which clearly is massive. Rather, the company delves into other segments, such as cloud computing and even streaming content. Therefore, AMZN is one of the long-haul Nasdaq stocks to buy.
Upwork (UPWK)

Let’s be honest. You don’t need to wait for an equities sector implosion to get a discount on freelancer marketplace Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK). Hemorrhaging 54% of market value, you can acquire shares right now and feel good about the purchase. Of course, you don’t want to haphazardly buy Nasdaq stocks just because they printed crimson ink. That’s a surefire way of eventually suffering catastrophic losses.
However, with Upwork, the freelancer platform fortuitously provides immense relevance. The reality is that people are not as honest as you might think they are. In fact, publications exist that help employers combat potential work-from-home abuses.
Therefore, with this massive debate about the return to office culminating in a head-on collision, at least some folks will pivot to the gig economy. That should be music to Upwork’s ears, making UPWK one of the best Nasdaq stocks to buy.
RCI Hospitality (RICK)

Easily one of the most controversial Nasdaq stocks in any context, RCI Hospitality (NASDAQ:RICK) is a special business. It caters to an audience that predominantly identifies as male with nightclubs, restaurants and other adult enterprises.
From a moral perspective, many investors might question including RICK stock on this list of Nasdaq stocks to buy. Fundamentally, morals shift and overlap between person to person, so it’s not something I can judge. But from an investment perspective, RICK absolutely deserves attention from market participants because of its track record.
According to CNBC, following the wake of the Great Recession, this industry boomed during the troubles. Essentially, RCI caters to a similar narrative bolstering PepsiCo. People want a distraction during rough times, and they crave dopamine. That’s what RCI provides, and it could be due for a repeat performance should a recession occur again.

2022-09-15 00:00:00+00:00,"1 Green Flag for Dollar Tree, and 1 Red Flag",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-green-flag-for-dollar-tree-and-1-red-flag,,,"The past few weeks have been rough ones for shareholders of retailer Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR). The stock is down 20% from its late-July peak, largely in response to a quarterly earnings miss and lackluster guidance, but also thanks to market-wide weakness.
It's not been all bad, though. There was and still is one upside to the underlying circumstances proving challenging for all consumers and corporations alike. The question: Is this particular upside enough to make the stock a buy?
The good news: Inflation is helping
Most investors understand the idea that Dollar Tree and its sister brand Family Dollar aim to offer low-frills value to cost-conscious consumers. What most investors may not fully appreciate, however, is just how big of a deal this strategy is right now. Against a backdrop of still-rampant inflation, even more affluent consumers are now shopping at bargain stores. As CEO Mike Wytinski commented during the second-quarter earnings call, ""[W]e do have a lot of new customers coming into both banners over last year, and the majority of them are at a household income of $80,000 or higher.""
The thing is, it's not just Dollar Tree seeing and pointing out such a shift. Rival Walmart is seeing the same. Its CEO, Doug McMillon, explained during the retailer's August earnings call, ""[W]e're seeing more middle and higher-income shoppers choose us."" Meanwhile, Target -- viewed as something of a premium name among general merchandise retailers -- saw its core customer base cut back during their visits to a Target store last quarter. They're reportedly curbing their discretionary spending due to higher costs of essential goods.
Given that August's inflation report released this week indicates price increases are still accelerating in many categories rather than decelerating (grocery prices are up more than 13% year over year), look for Dollar Tree's top line to continue growing much like it did last quarter. It was up a healthy 6.7% from year-ago levels and higher by 4.9% on a same-store basis.
The bad news: Inflation is also hurting
Inflation may be driving more -- and new -- customers to retailers that can provide more value. Dollar Tree's pricing power, however, isn't limitless.
This reality is indirectly evident in the revised guidance for the half-completed fiscal year. The company is now calling for revenue of between $27.85 billion to $28.10 billion versus consensus expectations of $28.16 billion following last quarter's top-line miss. Perhaps worse, its full-year per-share earnings forecast of between $7.10 and $7.40 is down from previous guidance for a fiscal 2022 bottom line of between $7.80 and $8.20 per share. Analysts had been looking for $8.19.
The company cites price cuts at its Family Dollar stores along with more consumer purchases of lower-margin ""needs-based consumables"" as key reasons for waning profitability. And maybe that's the case. The dialed-back earnings forecast ultimately shows the retailer can't pass along all of its own higher costs to consumers. That's particularly true of its Dollar Tree brand, which for marketing purposes self-limits its price point to $1.25 for most items it sells.
As long as the inflation that's turning affluent consumers into bargain hunters persists, Dollar Tree may find itself stuck between a rock and a hard place.
On balance
Don't read too much into Dollar Tree's headwind here. It's a tricky one to navigate, and it's taking a toll on profits. But the retailer is still on pace to improve its top line to the tune of 6%, though, with earnings set to grow 25%. The company can handle it -- it just won't be able to handle it nearly as well as its arch-rival, Dollar General (NYSE: DG).
Dollar General doesn't have to worry about operating two different discount-store brands, and it's also spent the past several years preparing for the situation consumers are currently facing in a way that Dollar Tree hasn't. Namely, Dollar General has developed a healthy private-label business with a handful of its owned-brand products receiving StoreBrands' Editors' Picks awards for 2022. The company has also made a point of introducing more fresh food and grocery products in its stores in recent years, many of which are offered at the highly marketable price point of $1. With more than 18,000 dedicated Dollar General locations versus 16,000 stores split between the Family Dollar and Dollar Tree banners, Dollar General simply has the scale and focus needed to make such price points viable.
It doesn't take a lot of reading between the lines to come to a wise conclusion. Dollar Tree is a tough name to justify stepping into at this time despite the stock's recent pullback. Its most notable rival is a much stronger pick.

2022-09-14 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting DLTR Put And Call Options For December 16th,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-dltr-put-and-call-options-for-december-16th,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options become available today, for the December 16th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 93 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new December 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $135.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.45. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $135.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $126.55 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $138.33/share today.
Because the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.26% return on the cash commitment, or 24.55% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $135.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $140.00 strike price has a current bid of $10.00. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $138.33/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $140.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.44% if the stock gets called away at the December 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $140.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $140.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.23% boost of extra return to the investor, or 28.36% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $138.33) to be 46%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-09-12 00:00:00+00:00,Does Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/does-dollar-tree-nasdaq%3Adltr-deserve-a-spot-on-your-watchlist,,,"Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.
If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.
How Fast Is Dollar Tree Growing Its Earnings Per Share?
Dollar Tree has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. In previous twelve months, Dollar Tree's EPS has risen from US$6.38 to US$7.00. That amounts to a small improvement of 9.6%.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While we note Dollar Tree achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 5.4% to US$27b. That's progress.
In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.

Of course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Dollar Tree.
Are Dollar Tree Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?
Since Dollar Tree has a market capitalisation of US$32b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$415m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!
While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Dollar Tree, the median CEO pay is around US$13m.
The Dollar Tree CEO received US$10m in compensation for the year ending January 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.
Should You Add Dollar Tree To Your Watchlist?
As previously touched on, Dollar Tree is a growing business, which is encouraging. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for Dollar Tree, but the fun does not stop there. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Dollar Tree by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.
Although Dollar Tree certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.

2022-09-09 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Dollar General Is a Better Buy Than Dollar Tree,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-dollar-general-is-a-better-buy-than-dollar-tree,,,"Investors are rightfully being drawn toward the deep-discount end of the retail industry. With rampant inflation and rising interest rates, companies that help consumers stretch their dollars further in this economy are poised to do well.
There are probably no better examples of this than the two biggest deep discounters, Dollar General (NYSE: DG) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR), both of which are handily beating the stock market indexes.
Yet while Dollar Tree has jumped 49% over the last year compared to a 8% gain by Dollar General over the past year (and versus a 13% decline by the S&P 500), Dollar General just might be the dollar-store stock that investors want to buy now.
Image source: Dollar General.
Setting itself apart
Dollar General has long been willing to sell goods above the $1 threshold, though most merchandise in its stores is $10 or less. Dollar Tree, which was long the industry pure play, selling everything for $1 or less, owns the Family Dollar chain that also sells a mix of goods at various price points. But Family Dollar still struggles to consistently contribute growth.
Yet Dollar General and Dollar Tree have excelled because both made heavy investments in consumable goods years ago, installing refrigerators and freezers in virtually all of their stores. Although the products carry lower profit margins than other merchandise, they build repeat business and help bolster average ticket values at checkout.
Dollar General, though, has distinguished itself by adding fresh produce to thousands of stores, with an eventual goal of offering it in more than 10,000 stores. It's also broadening its focus on healthcare through its DG Wellbeing initiative. This expands product offerings in stores; and in select locations, it is making available preventative care, urgent care, and chronic-condition management through a mobile provider called DocGo On-Demand.
Targeting the price-sensitive shopper
Where it's getting really interesting is in the very-deep discounter portion of its business that defines the space. Dollar Tree, of necessity, has wisely expanded the availability of higher-priced products to give its customers greater selection, whereas Dollar General is finding it advantageous to double down -- and triple down -- on the $1-or-less segment of its operations.
In the just-reported second quarter, CEO Todd Vasos said, ""The $1 price point was one of, if not the fastest-growing subcategory we had here at Dollar General."" As a result, Dollar General is ""definitely leaning in, both in private brand and the $1 price point"" to help shoppers feed their families, particularly toward the end of each month as money apparently gets tighter.
And private-label goods are helping the company boost sales further since pressured consumers are showing a willingness to trade down from name-brand products in exchange for the cheaper price that private-label goods offer. Dollar General is making strong penetration gains in consumables because of these goods, with sales growing quarter to quarter and year over year.
Steady as she grows
Dollar General raised its guidance for the year and now expects sales to rise 11% over 2021 on comparable-store sales growth in the range of 4% to 4.5%, and management forecasts earnings per share 12% to 14% higher than a year ago.
While Dollar Tree is expecting its earnings to pop 25% for the year with per-share profits forecast to be between $7.10 and $7.40, that's down sharply from its previous guidance of $7.80 to $8.20 per share, mostly due to problems at Family Dollar. Sales are expected to be up 6% from last year.
With the two-steps-forward, one-step-back dance with Family Dollar, Dollar Tree's full potential seems muted. Dollar General, though, has been a much more consistent deep-discount retailer. And with a forecast for steady growth and expansion as its value proposition draws price-sensitive consumers, I find its stock to be the better buy.

2022-09-08 00:00:00+00:00,Why Did Dollar Tree Stock Drop 18% in August?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-did-dollar-tree-stock-drop-18-in-august,,,"What happened
Shares of Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) tumbled 18% in August due to forward-looking comments in its earnings report. Investors are worried about pricing pressure and weakness among consumers over the next few months.
So what
Dollar Tree's quarterly results were mostly positive. Its revenue and earnings met Wall Street's forecasts, as same-store sales increased 5%. Instead, investors were focused on the company's outlook, which wasn't particularly bullish.
Management noted some weakness in the Family Dollar portion of its business, which represents roughly half of consolidated sales. Family Dollar only grew 2% last quarter, and the profit margins for that chain are much lower. In the earnings release, management outlined plans to use ""price investments"" to improve its competitive position. That's a delicate way to say that Family Dollar will be cutting prices to keep shoppers from going elsewhere.

This isn't the worst news ever, but it's a step in the wrong direction. This will inhibit growth, and margins will get worse. It also signals more-ominous general economic trends. Consumers are still struggling with lingering inflation, and the Fed's rate hikes in response are raising concerns that economic activity will slow. A recession could trigger rising unemployment and slowing wage growth. If consumer sentiment is bad, then discount retailers like Dollar Tree could struggle.
Now what
Dollar Tree had been a solid performer this year coming into August. Investors have been fleeing growth stocks in favor of value stocks, which was great for lots of stable consumer staples stocks. The stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio was approaching 23 last month, which is fairly high in today's market for a low-growth, narrow-margin business like Dollar Tree. That set it up for failure the minute bad news came around, and that's what happened.
The company's sour outlook isn't great news, and it's a storyline that could impact the stock next quarter if things continue in this direction. Still, it's a much more defensive business than high-flying tech stocks. That should help support the stock if we see a market downturn over the next few months.
A share repurchase program helps improve returns, but Dollar Tree isn't a dividend stock like some of its consumer-staples peers. This is an interesting opportunity to minimize risk while maintaining equity exposure, but it's not suited to growth or income roles in your investment portfolio.

2022-09-07 00:00:00+00:00,Is John Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF (JHMM) a Strong ETF Right Now?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-john-hancock-multifactor-mid-cap-etf-jhmm-a-strong-etf-right-now-3,,,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the John Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF (JHMM) debuted on 09/28/2015, and offers broad exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.
These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.
Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
The fund is managed by John Hancock. JHMM has been able to amass assets over $2.48 billion, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend. Before fees and expenses, JHMM seeks to match the performance of the John Hancock Dimensional Mid Cap Index.
The John Hancock Dimensional Mid Cap Index comprises of a subset of securities in the U.S. Universe issued by companies whose market capitalizations are between the 200th and 951st largest U.S. company.
Cost & Other Expenses
When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.
With on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.41%.
It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 0.97%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 15.90% of the portfolio. Industrials and Financials round out the top three.
Taking into account individual holdings, Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY) accounts for about 0.65% of the fund's total assets, followed by Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR) and Republic Services Inc (RSG).
Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 4.54% of JHMM's total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
Year-to-date, the John Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF has lost about -15.90% so far, and is down about -13.59% over the last 12 months (as of 09/07/2022). JHMM has traded between $42.94 and $56.63 in this past 52-week period.
The ETF has a beta of 1.08 and standard deviation of 26.62% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 665 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
John Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.
Vanguard MidCap ETF (VO) tracks CRSP US Mid Cap Index and the iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF (IJH) tracks S&P MidCap 400 Index. Vanguard MidCap ETF has $49.10 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF has $59.68 billion. VO has an expense ratio of 0.04% and IJH charges 0.05%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend.

2022-09-06 00:00:00+00:00,This Real Estate Stock Is a Must-Own for Any Dividend Investor,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-real-estate-stock-is-a-must-own-for-any-dividend-investor,,,"The reliability of dividend income and the potential for superior yields as dividends grow are two of the big reasons dividend stocks are so appealing. Dividend stocks are a smart asset to own in any diversified portfolio, but in volatile markets like we're seeing today, they are an especially smart investment due to their consistency.
And some of the most reliable dividend stocks are in the real estate industry. Dividend Aristocrat and real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income (NYSE: O) is one of the longest-paying and most consistent real estate stocks out there.
With the company having made 27 years of consecutive dividend increases and paid over 626 monthly dividend payments, here's a closer look at why this real estate dividend stock is a must-own stock for any dividend investor.
Accelerated growth leads to accelerated dividends
Realty Income has been in operation for over 53 years. Since going public in 1994, the company has grown its portfolio from 630 properties to now owning and leasing over 11,400 properties. The REIT originally focused primarily on leasing retail properties to big-name tenants like Walgreens, Dollar Tree, Home Depot, and Walmart among many others.
But as the REIT grew, so did its diversity. Today around 23% of its assets are in nonretail industries, and its properties can be found in three countries. The incredible growth it achieved over the past five decades has undoubtedly helped drive its dividend growth.
Since its IPO, the company has maintained a 5.1% median growth in adjusted funds from operation (AFFO), one of the most important metrics to illustrate a REITs profitability. It's also grown its dividend at a compound rate of 4.4% during that same period and managed to outperform the S&P 500 for the last 25 years by nearly double.
Stable cash flows support its dividends
Paying dividends is easy, but maintaining those dividends and increasing them over the long haul is no easy feat. Challenging economic conditions such as a recession can hurt a company's earnings temporarily. If there isn't sufficient cash flow or enough cash on hand, the company may be forced to cut its dividends to maintain its debt obligations.
That's why stable cash flows and having a healthy balance sheet are so important for dividend stocks -- and Realty Income has both. A net lease passes nearly all of the financial responsibility for managing and maintaining the property onto the tenant. This low-overhead cost to operating its portfolio of properties helps improve Realty Income's gross margin with low tenant turnover due to the nature of the business. Plus the long-term nature of the leases, which can be 10 years or more, creates super-reliable income streams for the REIT.
Its revenues over the last year have grown by 54% and its portfolio is at 98.9% occupancy. That means of its 11,400 properties, only 132 are sitting empty. This is a staggering low vacancy rate and one of the lowest in history for the company. Its rents are growing around 2% year over year, which may not seem like much. But when you earn $3.1 billion in annualized base rent a 2% jump can be quite substantial.
Recessionary concerns and the impact one would have on the retail industry have caused some volatility in the stock price lately. But Realty Income has experienced and overcome many recessions before. The company is built to last, with a grade A balance sheet that makes it well positioned to overcome any recessionary challenges.
Its debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortizatio (EBITDA) is 5.2 times. This is right around the REIT average of 5 times and considered healthy. Plus its payout ratio of 76% indicates its cash flows more than cover its monthly dividend payments.It also has $3.2 billion in liquidity, which is more than enough to cover its near-term debt maturities which come due in 2024 and beyond.
Realty Income's A credit rating, incredible track record, and reliable dividend yield of 4.3% make it a stand-out buy for any dividend investor.

2022-09-06 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Time to Buy the Nasdaq's 3 Worst-Performing August Stocks?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-time-to-buy-the-nasdaqs-3-worst-performing-august-stocks,,,"August was an up-and-down month for the Nasdaq-100. At first, the tech-focused index continued its rising trend from July before peaking mid-month and ending at a lower point than it started. However, this was just the composite index, not its individual components. Some had great months, while others didn't fare as well.
That may get investors thinking, ""Are the worst-performing stocks good buys in September?"" Let's dig in and see if these stocks are worth purchasing.
Match Group
Taking the prize for the worst-performing Nasdaq-100 stock in August was Match Group (NASDAQ: MTCH). It lost nearly 28% of its value in August, which points to some pretty extreme news.
Match Group is the parent company of many top dating apps like Tinder, Match, and Hinge. It makes its money through two methods: subscriptions and advertisements. Anyone following the economy knows advertising businesses aren't doing the best. Still, Match Group's indirect revenue (ad revenue) rose 7% year over year in its second quarter. Overall, revenue rose 12% year over year, with particular strength in the Asia-Pacific region (which grew 32% year over year).
This business performance didn't stop the stock from dropping nearly 18% after it reported earnings -- likely due to comments about the acquisition of Hyperconnect (a video connection service) made last year. CFO and COO Gary Swindler had this to say about Hyperconnect: ""But there's no denying that that acquisition of Hyperconnect has not worked out the way we had hoped, at least in the first year.""
That's not a reassuring comment, but management has also committed to better integrating this acquisition and realizing its full potential.
In the meantime, Match Group's profitability will take a hit (it posted a negative operating margin in the quarter due to $217 million in intangible expenses from the Hyperconnect acquisition). Despite these expenses, the stock trades for 33 times free cash flow, making it relatively cheap when you factor in Match Group's current business state of digesting an acquisition.
I think investors can find some value in Match Group's stock, especially after its terrible August performance.
Splunk
Moving to the second-worst performer, Splunk (NASDAQ: SPLK) dropped 23% in August. For the most part, Splunk's August wasn't terrible until it reported fiscal year 2023 Q2 results on Aug. 24.
At face value, results for Splunk seemed positive. Its data processing platform that aids in business decisions saw total revenue rise 32% year over year to $799 million, and cloud revenue grew 59% to $346 million. But this quarter's performance wasn't the problem.
Investors took issue with Splunk's guidance. It decreased its annual recurring revenue (ARR) and cloud ARR from $3.9 billion to $3.65 billion, and $2 billion to $1.8 billion. Missing projections on the downside is a surefire way to generate negative sentiment, which is why the stock fell nearly 20% from when it reported earnings to the end of the month.
However, with Splunk trading at less than five times sales, there's little valuation risk. But with management revising growth estimates down, I'm more hesitant to give Splunk the green light.
Dollar Tree
The value store Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) had a similar experience in August. Again, it was smooth sailing until it reported earnings, then it all went downhill on Aug. 25, causing the stock to slide nearly 20%.
While the overall quarter was good, guidance was to blame for the stock's tumble. In Q2, earnings per share (EPS) was up 30.1% year over year against sales growth of 6.7% -- solid results for the retailer.
As for guidance, management stated it is committed to competitive pricing and is investing in its merchandising and store standards to achieve this goal. Because of this, management reduced its EPS outlook -- but to a level that still indicates 25% year-over-year growth.
At under 20 times earnings, Dollar Tree is cheaper than competitors Walmart (26 times earnings) and Dollar General (23 times earnings) despite growing faster from an EPS perspective in Q2. As consumers' dollars are squeezed more due to inflation, they may turn to value stores to stretch their funds further.
Because of that, I think Dollar Tree may be undervalued compared to its growth and performance, and investors should consider this stock.

2022-08-31 00:00:00+00:00,Dollar Tree Stock Down 18% Over A Week. What's Next?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-stock-down-18-over-a-week.-whats-next,,,"Dollar Tree’s stock (NASDAQ: DLTR), which also owns Family Dollar, specializes in selling $1 items like toys, books, party supplies, and general discount items, declined by 18% in the last five trading days (one week). In comparison, the broader S&P500 index declined only 3% over the same period. The variety retail firm lowered its earnings guidance to $7.10 – $7.40 from $7.80 to $8.20 previously during its second-quarter earnings call. The company noted that its full-year outlook and margin performance are being hurt by inflationary cost pressures, a material shift in consumer purchasing from higher-margin discretionary merchandise to lower-margin consumable goods, and continued investments in wages, labor, and store condition. That said, the company’s consolidated full-year net sales are now expected to range from $27.9 billion to $28.1 billion, with slightly higher comps offset by slightly reduced square footage growth relative to the prior outlook.
Dollar Tree saw a mixed second quarter with revenues missing estimates by $30 million and earnings per share (EPS) coming in line. DLTR generated record EPS (up 30% year-over-year) of $1.60 on consolidated net sales of $6.8 billion (up 7% y-o-y). Comparable store net sales for Dollar Tree increased 7.5% and Family Dollar same-store sales increased 2.0%. It should be noted that gross margin improved 200 basis points to 31.4%, due to improved initial mark-on and leverage on distribution and occupancy costs. During the quarter, the company opened 127 new stores, expanded or relocated 29 stores, and closed 57 stores.

2022-08-29 00:00:00+00:00,Jack in the Box (JACK) Rises 30% in 3 Months: More Room to Run?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jack-in-the-box-jack-rises-30-in-3-months%3A-more-room-to-run,,,"Shares of Jack in the Box Inc. JACK have gained 29.9% in the past three months compared with the industry’s increase of 5.4%. Emphasis on initiatives like menu innovations, delivery channels, Del Taco acquisition and marketing strategies bode well. However, the rise in commodity costs and wage inflation remains a concern. Let’s delve deeper and find out, whether the company’s bull run will continue or not.
Growth Drivers
Menu innovation is one of the primary characteristics of Jack’s brand. Jack in the Box is one of the nation’s largest hamburger chains. The company makes regular menu innovations and provides limited period offers (LPO) at both its flagship restaurants to drive long-term customer loyalty. With focused menu inventions around premium products like Buttery Jack Burgers, sauced & Loaded Fries, munchie mash-ups and teriyaki bowls running currently, the company is witnessing comps growth. The company is continuously working on maintaining the uniqueness of its brand, menu and premium food offerings.

Jack in the Box is also increasingly focusing on delivery channels, which is a growing area for the industry. Given the high demand for this service, the company has undertaken third-party delivery channels to bolster transactions and sales. The company partnered with DoorDash, Postmates, Grubhub and Uber Eats. It is expanding its mobile application in a few markets that support order-ahead functionality and payment. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the company’s digital sales increased 30% year over year.

On Mar 8, 2022, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company completed its previously announced acquisition of Del Taco Restaurants for approximately $585 million. The move is in sync with its strategy of expanding the customer base. Del Taco, which has nearly 600 restaurants, serves more than three million guests every week. During third-quarter 2022, Del Taco’s same-store sales rose 3.5%, comprising franchise same-store sales growth of 4.8% and company-operated same-store sales growth of 2.3%. During the quarter, the company closed five restaurants.

Concerns
High costs remain a major concern for the company. During the fiscal third quarter, restaurant-level adjusted margin came in at 15.8% compared with the 25.4% reported in the prior-year quarter. The downside was led by a rise in food and packaging costs, wage inflation of 13.2%, and higher utilities and maintenance and repair costs.
Food and packaging costs (as a percentage of company restaurant sales) rose 120 bps year over year to 30.6%. Commodity costs during the quarter increased 16.8% year over year. The upside can be attributed to a rise in the price of proteins, sauces, oil and beverages. The franchise level margin was 41.4% in the fiscal third quarter compared with the 43.3% reported in the prior-year quarter.
Key Picks
Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector are Potbelly Corporation PBPB, Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. ARCO and Dollar Tree Inc. DLTR.

Potbelly has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), at present. PBPB has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 26.2%, on average. Shares of PBPB have declined 12.8% in the past year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

For the Invesco S&P 500 Revenue ETF (Symbol: RWL), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $88.47 per unit.
With RWL trading at a recent price near $75.41 per unit, that means that analysts see 17.31% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of RWL's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are CDW Corp (Symbol: CDW), Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR), and Chubb Ltd (Symbol: CB). Although CDW has traded at a recent price of $179.69/share, the average analyst target is 21.23% higher at $217.83/share. Similarly, DLTR has 20.07% upside from the recent share price of $138.70 if the average analyst target price of $166.53/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting CB to reach a target price of $227.64/share, which is 17.64% above the recent price of $193.51.

Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
Invesco S&P 500 Revenue ETF RWL $75.41 $88.47 17.31%
CDW Corp CDW $179.69 $217.83 21.23%
Dollar Tree Inc DLTR $138.70 $166.53 20.07%
Chubb Ltd CB $193.51 $227.64 17.64%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

Other Financials
Hibbett ended the quarter with $28.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $36.5 million available under its unsecured credit facilities. Total stockholders' investment, as of Jul 30, was $322.5 million.

In the fiscal second quarter, Hibbett repurchased 145,178 shares worth $7 million. Management paid a quarterly dividend of 25 cents.

Capital expenditure was $30.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023 quarter, stemming from store initiatives, including store openings, relocations, expansions, remodels and technology upgrades. For fiscal 2023, capital expenditure is expected to be $60-$70 million for investment in new stores, remodels, technology advancement and infrastructure.
Store Update
In second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company opened 13 stores and shut down one underperforming outlet. As of Jul 30, 2022, it had 1,117 stores across 36 states. HIBB is likely to open 30-40 stores in fiscal 2023.
Looking Ahead
This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company raised its guidance for comparable sales for fiscal 2023 despite the ongoing supply-chain disruptions, rising inflation, wage pressures and geopolitical challenges.

The company now anticipates comparable sales growth to be positive low-double digits versus the positive high-single digits growth expected earlier for the second half of fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2023, the company expects comparable sales to be between flat and positive low-single digits from the earlier expectation of negative low-single digits.

Hibbett expects net sales to increase in the low-single-digit range for fiscal 2023. It currently expects sales growth on a year-over-year basis in the third and fourth quarters, which will likely result in a return to better leverage of fixed costs.

Meanwhile, e-commerce revenues are expected to grow in positive high-single digits.

The gross margin is envisioned to contract 290-310 basis points year over year, with the metric likely to be 35.1-35.3%. SG&A, as a percent of net sales, is estimated to rise 10-20 bps year over year due to wage inflation, higher costs related to growth in e-commerce, a larger store count and back-office infrastructure investments in fiscal 2022.

The operating margin is predicted to be in the low-double-digit range and is likely to remain above the pre-pandemic reported level. Earnings are anticipated to be $9.75-$10.50 per share, whereas it posted $11.19 last year.

2022-08-26 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Investors Should Retain Yum China (YUMC) Stock Now,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-investors-should-retain-yum-china-yumc-stock-now,,,"Shares of Yum China Holdings, Inc. YUMC have declined 17.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s decrease of 14%. However, the stock has displayed some resilience, increasing 15.7% in the past three months. The company’s sales-building efforts and expansion are likely to drive performance. Let’s delve deeper.
Growth Drivers
Yum China focuses on relentless unit growth to drive incremental sales. In 2018, the company opened 819 restaurants and remodeled 931 stores. This exceeded the company’s prior target of opening 600-650 stores in 2018. In 2019 and 2020, the company opened 1,006 and 1,165 new restaurants, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2021, Yum China opened 563 gross new restaurants, owing to the development of the KFC and Pizza Hut brands. During second-quarter 2022, Yum China opened 246 gross new restaurants, driven by the development of the KFC and Pizza Hut brands. As of Jun 30, the company's total restaurant count was 12,170, up 1,147 stores year over year.

Another riveting growth potential of Yum China resides in its continual menu innovation to encourage top-line growth. KFC’s extraordinary performance is attributable to greater sales of menu offerings like crayfish burgers, stuffed chicken wings and spicy chicken burgers. During the second quarter of 2022, the company benefited from its new menu offerings. In KFC, the company unveiled innovative food comprising Wagyu and Angus beef burgers as well as a new chicken bucket (featuring chicken feet, chicken wings, tips, neck and other parts) in select cities.

This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is investing in technology to drive growth. During the second quarter of 2022, the company upgraded its mobile ordering manual (in pizza Hut) with more flexible buy more save more combos and customized product displays. It also upgraded its KFC super app with a friendly interface option (less promotion information), pickup forms and streamlined ordering functions. Moreover, it stated to have progressed on digital capabilities (like restaurant sales forecasting system and pocket manager) and delivery 3.0 version to streamline restaurant efficiency. The company anticipates the initiatives and supply chain infrastructure to drive growth in the upcoming periods. Meanwhile, digital orders during the second quarter of 2022 contributed 89% to KFC and Pizza Hut's company sales. During the quarter, the company’s delivery contributed nearly 38% to KFC and Pizza Hut's company sales, up 7% from the prior-year quarter’s levels.

Moreover, the company is also gaining from a robust loyalty program. Regarding loyalty membership, Yum Brands created a robust loyalty program with more than 385 million loyalty members cumulatively. Pizza Hut’s membership increased by 100 million members. In the second quarter, member sales accounted for nearly 60% of system sales.

Hurdles to Cross
Restaurant industry traffic and high costs continue to hurt the company’s performance. In the second quarter, the company's operations were affected by multiple COVID outbreaks in China. Tightened COVID curbs (including partial lockdowns and suspension of restaurant dine-in services) were implemented to counter the same. The measures paved a path for restricted mobility, reduced travel and softened consumer spending. Although the company initiated the reopening of stores (at reduced capacity), it expects restaurant traffic recovery to take time. Yum China is facing the structural high cost of labor and rentals. Apart from wage inflation, the company is bearing additional costs stemming from promotion, packaging upgrades, menu innovation and technological novelty.

On the other hand, same-store sales declined sharply in second-quarter 2022 due to the pandemic. Same-store sales dropped 16% year over year, primarily due to a decline of 16% in KFC and 15% in Pizza Hut. In April and May, same-store sales fell more than 20% year over year. Although the company reported some improvements in June, it anticipates sales recovery to be nonlinear and potentially volatile. Attributes such as weakening consumer sentiment, downward economic pressures and commodity price inflation pose a threat.

ULTA raises its guidance for fiscal 2022 on posting robust second-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with the top and the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increasing year over year. Shares of the company rallied 3.1% during the after-market trading session on Aug 25.

Results gained from solid consumer demand and broad-based momentum across its business. The company generated double-digit comparable sales growth in all major categories while improving profitability. It witnessed increased market share in prestige beauty. Management noted that consumer engagement with beauty remains solid, courtesy of the continued importance of self-care and wellness and a deep emotional connection with the category.

This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 10.9% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 6.2% growth.
Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
  Ulta Beauty Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ulta Beauty Inc. Quote
 Quarterly Numbers
Ulta Beauty posted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.70, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.96. In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the adjusted EPS amounted to $4.56.

Net sales of this beauty products retailer surged 16.8% year over year to $2,297.1 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,211.7 million. The uptick can be attributed to the positive impact of the ongoing resilience of the beauty division as well as gains from new brands and product innovation. The easing of COVID-19 restrictions relative to the year-ago quarter also contributed to the upside.

Comps jumped 14.4%, driven by an 8.3% improvement in transactions and a 5.6% increase in the average ticket. Transactions in the quarter gained on growth across stores while average ticket benefited from a higher average selling price.

The gross profit increased 16.3% to $928.2 million. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, came in at 40.4%, down from 40.6% reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside can mainly be attributed to reduced merchandise margin and increased inventory shrink. These were somewhat offset by leverage of fixed costs and solid growth in other revenue.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose 15.1% to $534.5 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses stood at 23.3%, down from 23.6% reported in the year-ago quarter, led by reduced marketing expenses and leverage of store payroll, benefits and store expenses owing to increased sales. These were somewhat countered by deleveraging in corporate overhead, among others.

The operating income came in at $391.4 million. The operating margin was 17%. In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, ULTA posted an operating income of $332.3 million, with the operating margin at 16.9%.
Other Updates
Ulta Beauty ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $434.2 million. Net merchandise inventories came in at $1.67 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Stockholders’ equity at the end of the quarter stood at $1,769.1 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $540.7 million in the 26 weeks ended Jul 30, 2022.

The company repurchased 797,994 shares for $301.6 million in the second quarter. As of Jul 30, 2022, Ulta Beauty had shares worth $1.6 billion left under its buyback program announced in March 2022.

For fiscal 2022, capital expenditures are expected in the band of $350-$400 million.

During the reported quarter, the company introduced seven new stores along with relocating four. Ulta Beauty ended the quarter with 1,325 stores.

For fiscal 2022, ULTA expects 50 net new stores along with 35 store remodeling and relocation projects.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Guidance
Taking into account the second quarter performance and sales trends witnessed till August, management is increasing its fiscal 2022 outlook.

Ulta Beauty now expects fiscal 2022 net sales in the range of $9.65-$9.75 billion compared with the $9.35-$9.55 billion range expected earlier. Comps are expected to rise in the range of 9.5-10.5% now compared with the earlier view of 6-8%.

The company projects mid-single-digit comp growth in the back half of fiscal 2022, reflecting the potential risk of a shift in consumer spending owing to inflationary pressures. The forecast also projects the impact of higher distribution points for prestige beauty and a more promotional holiday season.

Management now expects the operating margin to be between 14.6% and 14.8%, which was earlier expected between 14.1% and 14.4%. The company anticipates seeing operating margin deleverage in the second half of the year as sales growth moderates with cost pressures and planned investments having a bigger impact. Further, ULTA envisions gross margin expansion for fiscal 2022 fueled by fixed costs leverage and growth in other revenue. These factors will somewhat be offset by reduced merchandise margin, higher shrink and escalated supply chain costs. Management expects to keep seeing inflationary pressure in operating expenses.

For fiscal 2022, earnings are envisioned in the range of $20.70-$21.20 per share now, up from the $19.20-$20.10 per share range expected before.

GPS rose more than 8% in the after-market session on Aug 25, following the second-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, both metrics declined year over year. Results were affected by changing consumer preference from casual wear to dressier clothes, as well as higher inventory, a tough macroeconomic environment and elevated costs.

However, strength in Banana Republic remained an upside. Also, sales in July and August improved as fuel prices eased, which led to a slight increase in discretionary spending. The company expects to invest cautiously in marketing, pause hiring plans and slow down its spending on technology.

In the past three months, shares of the company have declined 10% compared with the industry’s 1.5% fall.

Although the company entered the fiscal third quarter with higher inventory, it expects inventory to reduce significantly by the end of fiscal 2022. Gap is undertaking actions to lower operating expenses, which are likely to be a headwind in fiscal 2023.
