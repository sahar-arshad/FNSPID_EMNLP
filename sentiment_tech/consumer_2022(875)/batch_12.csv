The company opened its first KFC restaurant in Russia in 1995 and currently has approximately 1,000 stores in the country. The company announced that it has stopped all investments, restaurant developments and operations in the country. In May, YUM sold its Russian Pizza Hut franchises to a local operator.

Western companies are winding up their Russian business in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine. In May, McDonald's Corporation MCD reached a sale and purchase agreement with its current licensee Alexander Govor. Last month, McDonald's stores opened under new branding.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have fallen 0.4% in the past year, compared with the industry's decline of 18.2%.

At KFC International and Taco Bell, same-store sales rose 3% and 5%, respectively, during the quarter. The company has been gaining from a recovery in emerging markets.

Chicago, IL – July 6, 2022 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Electric Power Co. Inc. AEP, Aspen Technology Inc. AZPN, Dollar Tree Inc. DLTR, Seagen Inc. SGEN and T-Mobile US Inc. TMUS.
Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:
Top 5 Nasdaq Stocks Flying High Despite 1H22 Bloodbath
Wall Street has been reeling under extreme volatility since the beginning of 2022. The technology stocks are the major casualties of a hawkish Fed with a higher interest rate regime and tighter-than-expected monetary control. Consequently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index suffered a bloody blow in the first half of 2022.
However, we have identified five stocks listed on the Nasdaq Composite with a favorable Zacks Rank that have popped in 2022 despite the index's recent bloodbath. These are — American Electric Power Co. Inc., Aspen Technology Inc., Dollar Tree Inc., Seagen Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc..  
Nasdaq Composite Tumbles
The U.S. inflation rate is currently at a 40-year high. In order to combat mounting inflation,  the Fed terminated the monthly $120 billion bond-buy program in March and has started shrinking the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet since June.
The central bank raised the benchmark interest rate from 0-0.25% to 1.50-1.75% in June. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank will hike the lending rate by another 75 basis points in July. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note is currently hovering around 3%.
High-growth-oriented companies, especially the technology companies, depend on easy access to cheap credit to expand their businesses. Moreover, higher market risk-free returns mean a higher discount rate for future cash flows from stock investing. This would affect growth-oriented stocks — especially technology stocks — as these generally provide higher returns over the long term.
Consequently, the Nasdaq Composite plunged 29.5% in the first half of 2022, marking the worst first half in the index's history. The tech-heavy index also recorded its worst quarterly performance in second-quarter 2022 since 2008. The index had recorded two straight quarters of decline for the last time in 2016. Moreover, the tech-laden index has been in the bear market since March.
Our Top Picks
At this stage, we have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite listed stocks that have witnessed a double-digit rally year to date. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Dollar Tree is a customer-oriented, value-driven variety store operating at a one-dollar price point. DLTR operates through two segments, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Dollar Tree benefited from the completion of the $1.25 multi-price point initiative at the Dollar Tree stores, as well as robust margins, despite the increase in freight costs and SG&A expenses. Following the robust first-quarter fiscal 2022 performance, DLTR raised its guidance for fiscal 2022 and provided a decent second-quarter view.
Zacks Rank #1 Dollar Tree has an expected earnings growth rate of 40.5% for the current year (ending January 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days. The stock price of DLTR has appreciated 11.3% year to date.
Aspen Technology has been gaining from improving customer demand. AZPN's diversified product portfolio especially its asset optimization and management software solutions and Asset Performance Management suite is witnessing healthy momentum.
The rapid adoption of cloud-based solutions, the proliferation of big data analytics and IoT technologies, along with higher spend on software, will likely drive Aspen Technology's top line in the long haul. The integration with Emerson's OSI Inc and the Geological Simulation Software business bodes well for AZPN.
Zacks Rank #1 Aspen Technology has an expected earnings growth rate of 14.9% for the current year (ending June 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.2% over the last 30 days. The stock price of AZPN has jumped 25.7% year to date.
T-Mobile US has raised its guidance for 2022 across the board. TMUS is on track to complete the Sprint customer network migration mid-year and decommissioning by the year-end. T-Mobile US is expanding its Home Internet pilot extensively while preparing to launch the 5G Home Internet service.
TMUS' Extended Range 5G covers 315 million people or 95% Americans. The Ultra Capacity 5G covers 225 million people and nearly 85% of T-Mobile US' customers. About 45% of postpaid customers are using a 5G phone, and 5G devices account for more than half of the total network traffic.
Zacks Rank #1 T-Mobile US has an expected earnings growth rate of 13.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5% over the last 30 days. The stock price of TMUS has climbed 18% year to date.
American Electric boasts a stable earnings base of approximately 5.5 million customers across more than 11 states. AEP's investment strategy includes incremental investments in renewable generation projects.
American Electric owns the nation's largest electricity transmission system and more than 224,000 miles of distribution lines. AEP plans to invest $24.8 billion in regulated operations, contracted renewables and wires during the 2022-2026 period, which will assist it in achieving long-term earnings growth of 6-7%.
Zacks Rank #2 American Electric has an expected earnings growth rate of 5.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 90 days. The stock price of AEP has advanced 10.1% year to date.
Seagen's lymphoma drug, Adcetris, has been performing well since its launch. The drug contributes the majority of SGEN's revenues. Collaboration with Japan's Takeda for global development and commercialization of Adcetris is also generating royalties.
Seagen's pipeline candidates are progressing well. Padcev, Tukysa and Tivdak were recently approved for three different types of cancer indications. This should reduce the heavy dependence on Adcetris in the future and generate a new revenue stream.
Zacks Rank #2 Seagen has an expected earnings growth rate of 5.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 7 days. The stock price of SGEN has rallied 16.5% year to date.

2022-07-05 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Investors Should Retain Yum China (YUMC) Stock,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-investors-should-retain-yum-china-yumc-stock,,,"Yum China Holdings, Inc. YUMC will likely benefit from its digital initiatives, menu simplifications and unit expansion efforts. Also, focusing on the loyalty program bodes well. However, higher expenses and coronavirus-induced soft traffic are a headwind.

Let us discuss the factors highlighting why investors should retain the stock for the time being.
Catalysts
Yum China is capitalizing on the benefits of its technology. The company is increasingly shifting toward digital and content marketing to expand the customer base. It has adopted a high-grade delivery strategy that includes collaborations with aggregators to source traffic and fulfills orders by the company’s KFC riders. YUMC launched a digital mini program to make community purchasing easier. Digital orders during first-quarter 2022 contributed 88% to KFC and Pizza Hut's company sales. During the quarter, the company’s delivery contributed nearly 36% to KFC and Pizza Hut's company sales, up nearly five percentage points from the prior-year quarter’s levels. Coming to loyalty membership, Yum Brands created a robust loyalty program with more than 370 million loyalty members cumulatively. Pizza Hut membership increased by 100 million members. In the first quarter, member sales accounted for nearly 62% of system sales.

The company focuses on digital R&D Center to drive operational excellence through consolidating and expanding dedicated resources to develop solutions and services. This involves using technologies in big data, artificial intelligence, middle office and digital SaaS to drive end-to-end digitalization. The initiative allows the company to boost in-house digital capabilities across various functions like customer experience concerning membership programs; efficient store operations and decision making; smart delivery in order queuing, trade zones and rider routing; and supply-chain management. The company stated that it has set aside $1-1.5 billion for investment in the digital and technology space over the next five years. As part of this initiative, the company intends to invest $100-200 million and hire up to 500 in the Digital R&D Center to support its business.

Yum China focuses on simplifying its menu to streamline operations and drive growth. During the first quarter of 2022, the company benefited from cross-selling opportunities arising from community purchasing. Notably, positive customer feedback was witnessed with respect to optimized menu offerings such as fried chicken combo (KFC), fried rice and ready-to-cook steak and pasta (Pizza Hut) and Hawker, Fried Chicken and Burritos DIY package (Taco Bell). Going forward, the company remains optimistic with respect to its new business opportunity and anticipates the initiative to boost awareness of its emerging brands.

Yum China is focused on relentless unit growth of restaurants to drive incremental sales. During first-quarter 2022, Yum China opened 522 gross new restaurants driven by the development of the KFC and Pizza Hut brands. As of Mar 31, 2022, the company's total restaurant count was 12,117, up 1,392 stores year over year. In 2022, Yum China expects to open 1,000-1,200 new stores.
Concerns

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Shares of Yum China have declined 23.7% in the past year compared with the Industry’s 17.8% fall. The dismal performance was primarily caused by the coronavirus crisis. In the first quarter 2022, the company’s operations were affected by the Omicron variant. The company stated that many cities across China had been fully (or partially) locked down to counter the crisis. Also, it emphasized on the enforcement of the “dynamic zero-COVID” policy in the region, thereby leading to reduced traveling, fewer social activities and softened consumption demand. The company anticipates the Omicron variant to have a severe impact on its operations in the upcoming quarter.

The company has been continuously shouldering increased expenses, which have been detrimental to margins. Restaurant margin in first-quarter 2022 was 13.8%, down 490 basis points from the year-ago quarter's levels. The downside was primarily due to sales deleveraging, higher inflation in commodity, wage and utility costs, and an increase in rider cost related to rising delivery volume. The company anticipates the inflationary environment to continue in the second quarter of 2022.
Zacks Rank & Key Picks
Yum China currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector are Dollar Tree Inc. DLTR, BBQ Holdings, Inc. BBQ and Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. ARCO.

2022-07-05 00:00:00+00:00,"Down 30%, Is It Safe to Invest in the Nasdaq Right Now?",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/down-30-is-it-safe-to-invest-in-the-nasdaq-right-now,,,"The Nasdaq Composite Index -- along with the Nasdaq-100 Index, which the popular Invesco QQQ (NASDAQ: QQQ) ETF tracks -- is among the most closely watched, technology-focused U.S. stock indexes. Its influence on equity prices is so great that one might discern a chicken-and-egg dynamic in which the Nasdaq's component stocks influence the index's price movements.
However, a sharp downtrend in the index could also prompt traders to dump their individual tech stocks. Wall Street witnessed this dynamic in action when the Nasdaq lost roughly 30% of its value during 2022's first half. As investors flipped the emotional switch from risk-on to risk-off, gut checks and tough choices had to be made: Is it best to stay the course, lean into the negative sentiment, or abandon ship?
Now, in the wake of a dismal six-month performance, some due diligence just might uncover an opportunity for intrepid tech-market traders.
Value in vogue
In case you didn't get the memo, inflation is rather high in mid-2022. Three consecutive months of 8%-plus increases in the U.S. Consumer Price Index are bound to impact the economy and markets -- and in response, the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates for the first time in a long time.
As a result, just about anything perceived as a growth stock (whether justifiably or not) has come under pressure. A less accommodative Fed means that cautious investors are prioritizing value over growth now, and technology stocks were known for flying high when the Fed kept interest rates low.
With traders rotating out of tech stocks -- and with the Fed likely to raise interest rates at every Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting this year -- it might be tempting to dump all of one's technology stocks and just avoid the Nasdaq altogether.
Yet, there's no need to panic sell. The bear market in tech stocks has brought some high-flown valuations back down to Earth and opened up a window of opportunity to get into some steady, sturdy names.
Weighted with heavyweights
If you're going to buy or hold a Nasdaq-tracking fund such as the Invesco QQQ ETF, it's important to apply the principle of ""know what you own."" The Nasdaq 100 (which actually includes 102 stocks) comprises a mix of tech and non-tech names, including Pepsi and Dollar Tree, interestingly enough. Those non-tech stocks are minor players, though, as the Nasdaq is market-cap weighted, and a handful of tech-tonic names dominate the index.
Some critics might accuse the Nasdaq of having a weight problem as the top three stocks -- Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) with 12.58% weighting, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) with 10.92%, and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) with 6.15% -- comprise nearly 30% of the index's weighting. Another major influencer in the index is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), which is listed twice, with the company's Class A and Class C shares each getting nearly 4% index weightings.
It's a lopsided index, to be sure, but at least it's dominated by recognized brands. After all, Apple and Microsoft have been around since the 1970s, and Amazon and Alphabet are unrivaled in the e-commerce and search-engine markets. Maybe the apparent lack of breadth isn't such a bad thing, then.
Besides, now that the air has been let out of their stocks, perhaps these companies could actually fall into the value category. Using the good old trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio as a rough-and-ready metric, we find some decent value here with Apple at 22.6, Microsoft at 27.1, and Alphabet at 20.3 (Amazon clocked in at 51.2, but at least it's not in the triple digits like it used to be).
So now, the rest is up to you. See what's in the Nasdaq and decide for yourself whether these are brands you can stand behind as an investor. A deeper dive into the famous names dominating the index should uncover some surprising values and a potential recovery play for the year's second half.

2022-07-05 00:00:00+00:00,Top 5 Nasdaq Stocks Flying High Amid Index's Bloodbath in 1H,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-5-nasdaq-stocks-flying-high-amid-indexs-bloodbath-in-1h,,,"Wall Street has been reeling under extreme volatility since the beginning of 2022. The technology stocks are the major casualties of a hawkish Fed with a higher interest rate regime and tighter-than-expected monetary control. Consequently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index suffered a bloody blow in the first half of 2022.
However, we have identified five stocks listed on the Nasdaq Composite with a favorable Zacks Rank that have popped in 2022 despite the index’s recent bloodbath. These are — American Electric Power Co. Inc. AEP, Aspen Technology Inc. AZPN, Dollar Tree Inc. DLTR, Seagen Inc. SGEN and T-Mobile US Inc. TMUS.  
Nasdaq Composite Tumbles
The U.S. inflation rate is currently at a 40-year high. In order to combat mounting inflation,  the Fed terminated the monthly $120 billion bond-buy program in March and has started shrinking the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet since June.
The central bank raised the benchmark interest rate from 0-0.25% to 1.50-1.75% in June. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank will hike the lending rate by another 75 basis points in July. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note is currently hovering around 3%.
High-growth-oriented companies, especially the technology companies, depend on easy access to cheap credit to expand their businesses. Moreover, higher market risk-free returns mean a higher discount rate for future cash flows from stock investing. This would affect growth-oriented stocks — especially technology stocks — as these generally provide higher returns over the long term.
Consequently, the Nasdaq Composite plunged 29.5% in the first half of 2022, marking the worst first half in the index’s history. The tech-heavy index also recorded its worst quarterly performance in second-quarter 2022 since 2008. The index had recorded two straight quarters of decline for the last time in 2016. Moreover, the tech-laden index has been in the bear market since March.
Our Top Picks
At this stage, we have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite listed stocks that have witnessed a double-digit rally year to date. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Dollar Tree is a customer-oriented, value-driven variety store operating at a one-dollar price point. DLTR operates through two segments, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Dollar Tree benefited from the completion of the $1.25 multi-price point initiative at the Dollar Tree stores, as well as robust margins, despite the increase in freight costs and SG&A expenses. Following the robust first-quarter fiscal 2022 performance, DLTR raised its guidance for fiscal 2022 and provided a decent second-quarter view.
Zacks Rank #1 Dollar Tree has an expected earnings growth rate of 40.5% for the current year (ending January 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days. The stock price of DLTR has appreciated 11.3% year to date.
Aspen Technology has been gaining from improving customer demand. AZPN’s diversified product portfolio especially its asset optimization and management software solutions and Asset Performance Management suite is witnessing healthy momentum.
The rapid adoption of cloud-based solutions, the proliferation of big data analytics and IoT technologies, along with higher spend on software, will likely drive Aspen Technology’s top line in the long haul. The integration with Emerson’s OSI Inc and the Geological Simulation Software business bodes well for AZPN.
Zacks Rank #1 Aspen Technology has an expected earnings growth rate of 14.9% for the current year (ending June 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.2% over the last 30 days. The stock price of AZPN has jumped 25.7% year to date.
T-Mobile US has raised its guidance for 2022 across the board. TMUS is on track to complete the Sprint customer network migration mid-year and decommissioning by the year-end. T-Mobile US is expanding its Home Internet pilot extensively while preparing to launch the 5G Home Internet service.
TMUS’ Extended Range 5G covers 315 million people or 95% Americans. The Ultra Capacity 5G covers 225 million people and nearly 85% of T-Mobile US’ customers. About 45% of postpaid customers are using a 5G phone, and 5G devices account for more than half of the total network traffic.
Zacks Rank #1 T-Mobile US has an expected earnings growth rate of 13.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5% over the last 30 days. The stock price of TMUS has climbed 18% year to date.
American Electric boasts a stable earnings base of approximately 5.5 million customers across more than 11 states. AEP’s investment strategy includes incremental investments in renewable generation projects.
American Electric owns the nation's largest electricity transmission system and more than 224,000 miles of distribution lines. AEP plans to invest $24.8 billion in regulated operations, contracted renewables and wires during the 2022-2026 period, which will assist it in achieving long-term earnings growth of 6-7%.
Zacks Rank #2 American Electric has an expected earnings growth rate of 5.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 90 days. The stock price of AEP has advanced 10.1% year to date.
Seagen’s lymphoma drug, Adcetris, has been performing well since its launch. The drug contributes the majority of SGEN’s revenues. Collaboration with Japan’s Takeda for global development and commercialization of Adcetris is also generating royalties.
Seagen's pipeline candidates are progressing well. Padcev, Tukysa and Tivdak were recently approved for three different types of cancer indications. This should reduce the heavy dependence on Adcetris in the future and generate a new revenue stream.
Zacks Rank #2 Seagen has an expected earnings growth rate of 5.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 7 days. The stock price of SGEN has rallied 16.5% year to date.

2022-07-05 00:00:00+00:00,4 Stocks to Buy as Back-to-School Season Holds Promise,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-stocks-to-buy-as-back-to-school-season-holds-promise,,,"Retailers have once again started worrying, with sales declining in May. The sector was doing well despite surging prices, as sales continued to rise on higher demand in the first few months of the year. Rising prices have made people spend cautiously on food, fuel and other necessities, which has led to a slowdown in retail sales.
However, retailers are now banking on the back-to-school season, which might drive sales. The back-to-school season is expected to generate higher sales this year, given that educational institutes remained closed almost throughout 2020 and most of 2021. Given this situation, stocks likeDollar Tree, Inc. DLTR, Canada Goose Holdings Inc. GOOS, Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. BOOT and Designer Brands Inc. DBI are likely to benefit in the near term.
Back-to-School Season Likely to Drive Retail Sales
The back-to-school season didn’t mean much for retailers over the past two years as millions learned from home owing to the pandemic. This year, however, retailers are heavily banking on the back-to-school season to give the much-required push to sales. After slowing over the past few months, retail sales finally slipped 0.3% in May.
So, the back-to-school season this time comes as a ray of hope for retailers. Also, the prediction is that sales will witness a solid jump this year as millions go back to school. According to a Mastercard SpendingPulse report, back-to-school sales are projected to grow 7.5% this year. This includes both in-store and online sales.
The back-to-school season is from mid-July through Labor Day. Per the report, sales should grow 18.3% from the pre-pandemic levels in 2019.
Moreover, in-store sales are expected to drive sales as most people prefer to try on new sizes and check out the latest fashion trends in person.
Also, sales at department stores have been rebounding for 15 consecutive months. Department stores will play a major role in driving back-to-school sales as they will serve as one-stop shopping destinations for various products. Department store sales are projected to grow 13% year over year and 27.3% from the pre-pandemic levels of 2019.
Retail Sector Going Strong on Higher Demand
Rising prices have been a cause of concern, and many had predicted that the sector would start witnessing a decline in sales from the beginning of the year. However, higher demand for consumer goods kept helping the retail sector, which saw sales jump in the first four months of the year.
The decline came in May but that too was marginal. Although people have started spending more on services once again, demand for goods is still high. This has seen durable goods orders rise almost every month.
The Commerce Department said on Jun 27 that orders for durable goods produced in U.S. factories grew 0.7% month over month in May to $267.2 billion, while economists had predicted the data to remain unchanged. May’s jump came after a 0.4% increase in durable goods orders in April.
Additionally, more social occasions like weddings and parties are anticipated as the economy continues to reopen, which is expected to help in-store and online sales grow 8.7% year over year during this time.

KR, which operates in the thin-margin grocery industry, has been undergoing a complete makeover not only with respect to products but also in terms of the way consumers prefer shopping grocery. The company has been adding new products as well as eyeing technological expansion to enhance its omnichannel reach.

In a recent update, Kroger and NVIDIA announced a strategic collaboration to build a state-of-art AI lab and demonstration center to expand Kroger’s freshness initiatives, enhance shipping logistics and create a better shopping experience in stores.

Earlier, Kroger had acquired a meal kit company, Home Chef, and partnered with British online grocery delivery firm, Ocado, which reinforced its position in the online ordering, automated fulfillment and home delivery space. The company’s partnership with Nuro, a leading autonomous vehicle company, highlights its commitment to offer fresh food at a great value.

Kroger has been making significant investments to enhance product freshness and quality, and expand digital capabilities. Impressively, the company has been introducing new items under its “Our Brands” portfolio. It launched 239 new items under this banner in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Identical sales without fuel jumped 4.1%. Fresh Department identical sales increased 5.2%, while Our Brands identical sales rose 6.3% in the quarter.

We note that Kroger’s digital business remains one of its key growth drivers, thanks to Kroger Delivery Now, the Boost membership program and the rollout of customer fulfillment centers. The company’s ‘Kroger Delivery Now’ service provides customers with food and household staples in 30 minutes.

Additionally, Kroger has been expanding its customer fulfillment centers so as to ensure efficient deliveries. During the first quarter, the company opened two new customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado's automated Smart Platform, one in Dallas, TX, and another in Pleasant Prairie, WI, bringing the total customer fulfillment centers count to five. It opened three new spoke locations, bringing the total to six.
Wrapping Up
We believe that Kroger’s focus on fresh offerings, technology and process improvements to lower costs, seamless digital ecosystem and margin-rich alternative profit business should continue contributing to growth.

Management envisions identical sales without fuel to be up 2.5-3.5% in fiscal 2022 compared with 0.2% growth registered last year. The company anticipates FIFO operating profit in the band $4.3-$4.4 billion compared with $4.3 billion reported in fiscal 2021. Kroger anticipates fiscal 2022 earnings between $3.85 and $3.95 per share, suggesting an increase from adjusted earnings of $3.68 reported in fiscal 2021.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have surged about 28.7% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 9.4%.

2022-07-04 00:00:00+00:00,"Kohl's (KSS) Stock Crashes on Strategic Review Update, View Cut",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/kohls-kss-stock-crashes-on-strategic-review-update-view-cut,,,"Shares of Kohl's Corporation KSS plunged 19.6% on Jul 1 as the company decided to end its strategic review process with Franchise Group, Inc. FRG after concluding the negotiating period with the same. However, management at Kohl’s is presently reviewing other options to unlock shareholder returns.

Last month, Kohl’s unveiled that its board of directors entered into exclusive negotiations with Franchise Group, a holding company of a collection of market-leading and emerging brands, for the potential sale of the former for $60 per share. Despite solid efforts from both KSS and FRG, the latter decided not to pursue the deal due to the existing retail and financial landscape. Kohl’s stated that given the market volatility and the current scenario, it was not wise to continue with the agreement.

That said, due to its healthy financial status, the company reiterated its commitment to undertaking an accelerated share buyback plan of $500 million after its second-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings release. This forms part of the company’s previously unveiled repurchase authorization of $3 billion.
Update in Q2 Trends
Kohl’s, which presently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is witnessing soft consumer spending patterns due to the increased inflationary pressure. Consequently, management now anticipates net sales in the second quarter to be down in the high single digits compared with the low-single-digit decline projected earlier.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Transformation Strategy on Track
Kohl’s is undertaking core initiatives to scale and boost growth in the years to come. This includes strengthening alliances like Sephora at Kohl’s, which is likely to expand to 850 stores by 2023-end. The company is on track to generate annual omnichannel sales of $2 billion by 2025. Apart from this, KSS intends to open more than 100 smaller-format stores over the next four years, which are expected to drive the annual sales opportunity of more than $500 million.

The company also plans to keep expanding its digital business, with 40% of the digital orders presently fulfilled by stores. Kohl’s is rolling out the Self-Serve Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store facility across all stores in 2022, and it continues to test self-serve returns and check-out, thereby enhancing customers’ experiences.
What’s Hurting KSS?
In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, Kohl's gross margin contracted from 39% to 38.3%, mainly due to escalated freight costs. Further, the company’s SG&A expenses have been rising year over year. In the first quarter, Kohl’s SG&A expenses increased 10.5% to $1,293 million due to investments in the company’s core strategic efforts, such as the support associated with Sephora store opening and refreshes, along with high wages and transportation costs. As a percentage of the total revenues, SG&A expenses expanded 470 basis points (bps) to 34.8%. The company reported an operating income of $82 million, lower than the year-ago quarter’s figure of $273 million.

Management expects SG&A costs to remain high by the mid-to-high single digits in the second quarter and increase in the low single digits for the full year. Apart from this, supply-chain hiccups remain a deterrent. The gross margin is likely to decline 100-125 bps in the full year due to freight and product cost inflation.

Shares of KSS have slumped 51.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 35.4%.
Solid Retail Bets
Here are some better-ranked stocks – Dillard's, Inc. DDS and Dollar Tree DLTR.

Dillard's, which operates retail department stores, sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 224.1%, on average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dillard's current financial-year sales suggests growth of 6.1% from the year-ago period. DDS has an expected earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 14.6% for three to five years.

Dollar Tree, a discount variety retail store operator, sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 15.5% for three to five years.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dollar Tree’s current financial-year sales suggests growth of 6.7% from the year-ago period. DLTR has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13.1%, on average.

From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.

4 Retail Bets That Raise Hopes for the Remainder of 2022
There is not much clue, as of now, to how the stock market is going to behave in the second half of 2022. Truly speaking, things haven't changed much or improved for the best in the past six months. Risk appetite has almost dried up, as investors are walking a tightrope. The Russia-Ukraine conflict, supply chain bottlenecks and soaring inflation are all to blame. Rising crude prices are also worsening matters.
Halfway down the year, let's not be too pessimistic. The market has already factored in almost all the bad news, and any improvement from here in the economic scenario could lift investor sentiment. Any positive development on inflation, supply chain, the ongoing conflict and corporate earnings could trigger a rally in the market.  
Meanwhile, addressing shooting commodity prices is a top priority for the Federal Reserve, and it is treading the path of a rate hike to tame the same. In a bold move to counter inflation, the Fed recently announced a 75-basis point hike in the benchmark interest rate that takes the level to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. This was the biggest rate increase since 1994.
While challenges persist, retailers are still pinning hopes on the back-to-school season. Per Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are projected to increase 7.5% year over year during the period that runs from Jul 14 to Sep 5. With e-commerce still one of the preferred modes for shopping, Mastercard SpendingPulse foresees online sales to rise by 4.3%. Notably, in-store shopping is anticipated to increase 8.2%.
That said, here we have highlighted four stocks from the Retail-Wholesale sector that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) — The Kroger Co., Dollar Tree, Inc., Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. and Ulta Beauty, Inc.. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

2022-06-29 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why You Should Retain Wendy's (WEN) in Your Portfolio,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-you-should-retain-wendys-wen-in-your-portfolio-0,,,"The Wendy's Company WEN is likely to benefit from Breakfast daypart offerings, digitization initiatives and solid comps growth. This and focus on expansion efforts bodes well. However, a decline in traffic from pre-pandemic levels and a rise in commodity and labor costs are a concern.

Let us delve into the factors highlighting why investors should hold on to the stock for the time being.
Catalysts
Wendy’s focuses on Breakfast daypart Offerings to drive incremental sales. Wendy’s continues to focus on Breakfast daypart Offerings to drive incremental sales. In first-quarter 2022, breakfast contributed nearly 7% to sales. The company has been benefiting from its marketing efforts, high-quality offerings, repeat ordering and high customer satisfaction levels. In 2021, the company’s breakfast business surged 25%. It expects the breakfast business in the United States to accelerate in 2022 by roughly 10% to 20%. By the end of 2022, it anticipates average weekly U.S. breakfast sales to be $3,000-$3,500 per restaurant.
Wendy’s has been focusing on digitalization to drive growth. During first-quarter fiscal 2022, Wendy’s had nearly 10% of its sales coming through digital channels in the United States and 17% in Canada. This was driven by gains in delivery and mobile ordering sales and several successful promotions. Since the company launched Wendy's Rewards program app, downloads have increased. The company has been witnessing higher average checks.
Wendy's continues to impress investors with solid global same-restaurant sales growth. During first-quarter fiscal 2022, global comps increased 2.4% year over year. The improvement was driven by continued strength across its U.S. and international businesses. During the quarter, comps in the United States witnessed growth of 1.1% year over year. The upside was driven by growth in breakfast and digital businesses. Same-restaurant sales at International restaurants (excluding Venezuela and Argentina) rose 14.1% year over year. For 2022, the company expects global systemwide sales growth to be 6-8%.
Wendy’s is steadfast in expanding its presence globally. The company’s international business is poised to be a growth driver in the days ahead. During the three months ended April 3, 2022, the company and its franchisees added 67 net new restaurants across Wendy’s system. The company stated that it has a robust pipeline and is on track to achieve its target of 5-6% net unit growth in 2022. Given the solid development foundation, the company anticipates opening 8,500-9,000 systemwide restaurants by the 2025-end.
Concerns

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Shares of Wendy’s have declined 20.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s 19.4% fall. The downside was caused by the coronavirus crisis. The restaurant industry has been facing declining traffic for quite some time. Although most dining services are open, traffic is still low compared with pre-pandemic levels. Going forward, the company intends to monitor the situation regularly to gauge the impacts of COVID-19.

The company has been continuously shouldering increased expenses, which have been detrimental to margins. During the fiscal first quarter, the company-operated restaurant margin came in at 11.6% compared with 17% in the year-ago quarter. The downside was primarily due to a higher labor rate, increased commodity costs and decline in customer counts. General and administrative expenses in the quarter were $62.3 million, compared with $52.6 million in the prior-year quarter. This was primarily on account of higher salaries.
Zacks Rank & Key Picks
Wendy’s currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector are Dollar Tree Inc. DLTR, BBQ Holdings, Inc. BBQ and Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. ARCO.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dollar Tree’s 2022 sales and earnings per share (EPS) suggests growth of 6.7% and 40.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s levels.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BBQ Holdings’ 2022 sales and EPS suggests growth of 46.1% and 67.6%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s levels.

2022-06-29 00:00:00+00:00,"Don't Lose Confidence, Scoop Up These 4 Retail Stocks Instead",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dont-lose-confidence-scoop-up-these-4-retail-stocks-instead,,,"U.S. consumer confidence — a key determinant of the economy’s health — stumbled to a 16-month low in June, as soaring inflation and concerns about the economy’s health dampened the Americans’ spirit. Economists cautioned that a back-to-back drop in consumer sentiment spells trouble for the market and overall spending activity. Per the Conference Board, the Consumer Confidence Index fell to 98.7 in June from May’s downwardly revised reading of 103.2.

Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said, “Purchasing intentions for cars, homes, and major appliances held relatively steady—but intentions have cooled since the start of the year and this trend is likely to continue as the Fed aggressively raises interest rates to tame inflation. Meanwhile, vacation plans softened further as rising prices took their toll.”

Industry experts see more pain ahead as consumers grapple with soaring commodity and record gasoline prices as well as rising interest rates. We note that the consumer price index rose 1% month on month in May, following an increase of 0.3% in April. On a year-over-year basis, the metric rose 8.6% — the fastest pace since December 1981. This jump was a result of higher gasoline and food grain prices, primarily due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Addressing shooting commodity prices is a top priority for the Federal Reserve, and it is treading the path of a rate hike to tame the same. In a bold move to counter inflation, the Fed recently announced a 75-basis point hike in the benchmark interest rate that will take the level to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. This was the biggest rate increase since 1994.

While challenges persist, retailers are still pinning hopes on the back-to-school season. Per Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are projected to increase 7.5% year over year during the period that runs from Jul 14 to Sep 5. With e-commerce still one of the preferred modes for shopping, Mastercard SpendingPulse foresees online sales to rise by 4.3%. Notably, in-store shopping is anticipated to increase 8.2%.

Steve Sadove, senior advisor for Mastercard and former CEO and chairman of Saks Incorporated, said, “While Mastercard SpendingPulse anticipates growth across sectors, retailers will need to find innovative ways to entice shoppers as discretionary spending potentially stretches thin as a result of increasing prices.”

Companies have been undertaking a more consumer-centric approach — emphasizing membership programs, upgrading store technology, shopping via mobile apps and last-mile delivery solutions. Expedited delivery services like doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store, as well as contactless payment solutions, will continue to play a crucial role in maximizing the share of customers’ wallet.

That said, here we have highlighted four stocks from the Retail-Wholesale sector that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Price Performance

2022-06-28 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Appears to be a Promising Pick,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-ulta-beauty-ulta-appears-to-be-a-promising-pick,,,"Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA appears to be a lucrative pick with solid growth prospects. The company has been gaining from its strong omnichannel business and skincare category advancement. Also, a focus on six key priorities has been working well for this beauty retailer, which raised its fiscal 2022 guidance on its first-quarter earnings release.

On its lastearnings call management stated that due to a solid first-quarter show and sales trends witnessed in the second quarter so far, it raised its guidance for fiscal 2022. It now expects fiscal 2022 net sales in the range of $9.35-$9.55 billion compared with the $9.05-$9.15 billion range expected earlier. Comparable sales or comps are expected to rise in the range of 6-8% now compared with the earlier view of 3-4%. Comps are likely to be in the low-to-mid-teens range in the first half and moderate to a low-single-digit rise in the second half.

Management now expects the operating margin between 14.1% and 14.4%, which was earlier expected between 13.7% and 14%. For fiscal 2022, earnings are envisioned in the range of $19.20-$20.10 per share now, up from the $18.2-$18.7 per share range expected before. Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have rallied 16.5% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 38.7%. Let’s delve deeper into the factors backing this Illinois-based player.

Omnichannel Strength
Ulta Beauty has been enriching its omnichannel experience through launches like Beauty to Go, options like same-day delivery (in some stores) and unique salon services across stores, among others. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company opened 26 Ulta Beauty at Target shops and ended the quarter with 127 locations. Apart from this, ULTA is benefiting from its Wellness Shop launch (in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021), which is a cross-category platform providing guests with self-care for the mind, body and spirit across several stores and online. On its first-quarterearnings call management stated that its Wellness Shop reached nearly 55% of its store fleet. The company’s buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS) continued to gain traction in the first quarter. BOPIS sales rose 26% and contributed 21% to e-commerce sales.
Skincare Category – a Major Driver
Ulta Beauty has been seeing market share gains in major beauty categories for a while now, with skincare standing out due to consumers’ rising interest in self-care and the company’s focus on newness and innovation. The trend continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, wherein skincare comps saw strong double-digit growth. Category growth was backed by moisturizers, acne treatments and eye serums. Guests’ increased focus on self-care and maintaining healthy skincare routines works well for this category. Apart from these, the company has been seeing strength in the fragrance and haircare category, with product newness being a solid driver. Even the makeup category is on track for full recovery.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-06-27 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why You Should Retain Papa John's (PZZA) Stock Now,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-you-should-retain-papa-johns-pzza-stock-now,,,"Papa John’s International, Inc. PZZA is likely to benefit from menu innovation, digital initiatives and robust comps growth. This and focus on developing and maintaining a strong franchise system bodes well. However, a decline in traffic from pre-pandemic levels and inflationary commodity pressures are a concern.

Let’s discuss the factors highlighting why investors should retain the stock for the time being.
Factors Driving Growth
Papa John’s continues to focus on product introduction to drive growth. Menu innovations like toasted handheld Papadias and Epics Stuffed Crust continue to witness solid popularity among customers, boosting the top line. Backed by better brand positioning, the new products have driven higher tickets and traffic across dayparts without cannibalizing core premium products and complicating operations at other stores. During first-quarter fiscal 2022, the company launched a New York Style pizza crust comprising larger slices and a thinner stretched crust. It also launched Epic Pepperoni Stuffed Crust (as an LTO). Following the launch, the company reported solid demand for the same. With significant LTO and long-term platform launches in the pipeline, the company anticipates menu innovation efforts to drive long-term ticket and transaction growth in the upcoming periods.
Papa John’s invests in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering to boost sales. The company’s online and digital marketing activities have increased significantly in the past several years, owing to the higher utilization of online and mobile web technology. PZZA is committed to providing a better customer experience with enhancements to the digital ordering process. The company’s loyalty program witnessed a rise in digital transactions during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Larger transaction sizes and better targeting of offers and promotions have benefited the company. This and emphasis on partnerships and integrations of third-party delivery aggregators bode well. The company remains bullish on third-party delivery partnerships as the initiative paves the path for additional opportunities to meet delivery capacity at peak times and reach new customer segments.

Papa John’s continues to impress investors with robust comparable sales growth. The company recorded positive comparable sales growth in first-quarter fiscal 2022, marking the 10th straight quarter of comps growth. It benefitted from initiatives related to menu innovation, strategic pricing actions and higher unit counts. In the fiscal first quarter, total comparable sales rose 1.6% year over year compared with growth of 25.4% reported in the prior-year quarter. Comps at North America restaurants increased 1.9% year over year compared with 26.2% growth reported in the year-ago quarter. Comps at international restaurants were up 0.8% year over year compared with a 23.2% increase reported in the prior-year quarter. Given the emphasis on multifaceted menu innovation strategy and digital innovation, the company anticipates the momentum to continue in the near term.

Papa John’s is committed to developing and maintaining a strong franchise system. The company strives to eliminate barriers to expanding in existing international markets and identifying new market opportunities. In August 2021, the company expanded its partnership with Drake Food Service International to open more than 220 Papa John’s restaurants by 2025. This includes more than 170 stores across Latin America, Spain and Portugal. The company signed a development deal with Sun Holdings (in September 2021) to open 100 new stores across Texas and the South by 2029. The company announced a partnership with FountainVest Partners (in January 2022) to open more than 1,350 new stores across South China by 2040. Backed by its accelerated development plan, the company anticipates opening 260-300 net new restaurants globally in fiscal 2022. This suggests approximately 5% growth in its system for the year. The company expects its worldwide net unit (from fiscal 2023 through 2025) to grow in the range of 6-8% annually. We believe re-franchising a large chunk of its system reduces a company’s capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and ROE expansion.
Concerns

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Shares of Papa John's have declined 37.3% so far this year compared with the industry’s fall of 19.8%. The dismal performance was caused by the coronavirus crisis. Pandemic-induced restrictions, labor challenges and supply chain disruptions have taken a toll on the company. Although most dining services are open, traffic is still low compared with pre-pandemic levels. The company intends to monitor the situation regularly to gauge the impacts of COVID-19.

Papa John's is continuously shouldering increased expenses, which are detrimental to margins. It has been facing significant supply-chain challenges and inflation across most commodities and categories. This resulted in cost pressure in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, including costs related to strategic staffing initiatives. New hiring, referral and appreciation bonuses added to the woes. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, total costs and expenses amounted to $517.1 million, up 11.2% from the prior-year quarter’s level. The company anticipates commodities and labor headwinds to continue in the near term.

2022-06-27 00:00:00+00:00,Ulta Beauty and DoubleDown Interactive have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ulta-beauty-and-doubledown-interactive-have-been-highlighted-as-zacks-bull-and-bear-of-the,,,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – June 27, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Ulta Beauty ULTA as the Bull of the Day and DoubleDown Interactive DDI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Walmart Inc. WMT, Kroger Co. KR and Dollar Tree DLTR.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
Bull of the Day:
Ulta Beauty is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that operates as a retailer of beauty products in the United States. The company offers a wide range of products including cosmetics, fragrance, skincare, hair care, bath and body products, and salon styling tools in stores.
Unlike a lot of other stocks out there, the stock has held up well in 2022,. The question now is if this stock breaks out when the market recovers.
If investors look at recent earnings, rising estimates and relative strength, they see a stock that has a lot of prospects to run higher into the end of the year.
More About ULTA
The company was founded in 1990 and is headquartered in Bolingbrook, IL. It employs 16,500 people and has a market cap of $20 billion. Ulta sells more than 25,000 products from about 500 well-established and emerging beauty brands across all categories and price points.As of March, the company operated 1,308 retail stores across 50 states
The stock has a Zacks Style Score of ""A"" in Growth, but ""D"" in Value. Investors are betting that the growth the company continues to see, helps the stock come into the valuation. The stock pays no dividend.
Q1 Earnings Beat
On May 26th, ULTA reported a 42% EPS beat for Q1and beat on revenues. This was the company's eight beat on EPS in a row and the tenth out of the last twelve quarters.
Same Store Sales (SSS) came in at +18% and they affirmed their plan to open 50 new stores in 2022.
Ulta raised 2022 SSS guidance to 6-8% from 3-4% and hiked their 2022 EPS guidance to $19.20-20.10 v the prior $18.60. They took their revenue expectations higher as well, seeing $9.35-9.55B v the $9.20B expected.
Management said that solid execution, paired with strong guest demand, fueled their performance and helped with ULTA gaining market share.
Estimates Rising
The big earnings beat and raised guidance is helping estimates tick higher over the last month.
For the current quarter, estimates have gone from $4.15 to $4.76, a move of 15%. For the current year, we have seen a move of 8% higher, with estimates moving from $18.60 to $20.08.
And this momentum looks like it will continue, with next year's estimates moving from $20.59 to $22.00, or 7%.
With those estimates going higher, analysts are lifting their price targets for the stock.
JPMorgan reiterated their Overweight on the name, lifting their target to $480 from $460. Barclay also reiterated an Overweight and lifted their target to $491 from $469.
Relative Strength
This year has not been kind to stocks. Many names are down 20% or more, with some tech stocks looking at serious losses anywhere from 50-80%.
In comparison, ULTA is only down about 1% in 2022. This relative strength should be a sign for investors that this stock is ready to breakout when market sentiment improves.
The Technical Take
Looking at the chart, the $340 level has been key all year, with buyers stepping up each time the stock dipped below. This area was the 61.8% retrace drawn from May 2021 lows to 2021 highs. If the stock can break above the post-earnings highs, $450 should be in the cards.
For longer-term investors, $505 is the 161.8% Fib extension draw from the April to May sell off.
Looking at the moving averages, the 200-day offered post-earnings support at $386. From there, the 50-day MA acted as resistance under the $400 level, but that has recently broken. Look for those levels to act as support as the stock tries to breakout.
In Summary
When markets sell off, the stocks that hold price are likely the winners in the next bull cycle. Both the technical and the fundamentals are lining up for ULTA and all the stock needs is market sentiment to improve to get the break higher.
Bear of the Day:
DoubleDown Interactive is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that engages in the development and publishing of digital games on mobile and web-based platforms for casual players in South Korea. 
Since the company came to market with an IPO in September of last year, the stock has slowly drifted lower. The first IPO trades were around he $18 mark, but now the stock trades under $10.
With the poor stock performance, investors should continue to avoid the name until the financials show something positive. For now, that is not the case.  
About the Company
DoubleDown is headquartered in Seoul, South Korea. The company was incorporated in 2008 and was formerly know as The8Games.
The area of focus for the company is digital social casino games. DoubleDown offers games titled DoubleDown Casino, DoubleDown Classic, DoubleDown Fort Knox, and Undead World: Hero Survival games.
DDI is valued at $500 million and has a Forward PE of 7. The company holds a Zacks Style Score of ""A"" in Value, but ""D"" in Growth. The stock pays out no dividend.
Q1 Earnings
The company reported EPS back in early May, seeing a 5% miss on EPS. This was the second miss in a row and the company has only beaten once in its short publicly traded life.
Net income was lower year over year, coming in at $18.5M vs the $19.4M last year. Revenues were lower as well, coming in at $85.5M vs $96.7M last year. Adjusted EBITDA was also lower, coming in at $26.9M v the 33.1M last year.
Investors did not respond well, selling the stock under the $9 level. The stock did rally all the way to $12, but with estimates going down, the bulls might be getting ahead of themselves.
Estimates
Since this is an illiquid low market cap name, not many analysts cover the stock. However, the ones that do are taking their numbers lower over the last 60 days.
For the current quarter, estimates have fallen from $0.40 to 0.36, or 10%. For the current year, the numbers have dropped 9.6%, from $1.66 to $1.50.
Technical Take
This is a low volume stock with big spreads. So the short-term charts can be tricky. However, if you zoom out it is clear that the stock has done nothing but bleed since the IPO.
For now, the stock is an avoid as it trades below its 50-day moving average at $11. If the stock can get above this level, then perhaps it can trade the 200-day MA near $14.
However, all signs point to this stock continuing to struggle until they start beating their numbers. If new lows come, look for the $6.50, which is the 161.8% Fib extension drawn from the recent lows to highs.
In Summary
Casino and gaming names have been hard enough. Investors don't get excited when you start adding extra elements like digital casinos and foreign companies. Look for DDI to struggle unless they start growing their numbers.

Why Are Walmart (WMT) Shares Sinking?
Several retail companies are grappling with supply-chain headwinds and Walmart Inc. is not immune to it. Supply-chain bottlenecks, escalated costs and persistently elevated inflation weighed on the company's first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein management lowered its earnings per share (EPS) guidance for the fiscal. Apart from this, the company's results were somewhat affected by divestitures in the International segment.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal-year EPS has gone down from $6.43 to $6.40 over the past 30 days. Shares of this currently Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company, have declined 13.5% in the past three months compared with the industry's decline of 15.6%. Let's delve deeper.
What's Hurting Walmart?
The gross margin at Walmart U.S. fell 38 basis points (bps) in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 due to an adverse product mix, high supply-chain costs and increased markdowns. Most of the decline was due to the supply chain, fuel and e-commerce fulfillment expenses.
Overall, WMT's consolidated gross profit margin contracted by 87 bps, primarily due to Sam's Club, wherein the gross margin fell 219 bps. This was attributable to supply-chain costs, a fuel mix, inflation and markdowns stemming from the delayed inventory. Management expects the gross margin to remain under pressure in the second quarter, though it is likely to improve sequentially.
Moving on, SG&A costs escalated by 39 bps as a percentage of sales due to higher wage costs at Walmart U.S. The operating income at constant currency or cc fell 22.7% to $5.3 billion. Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 45 bps year over year, stemming mainly from elevated wage costs at Walmart U.S. Some of the cost headwinds are likely to persist.
Walmart completed the divestiture of its businesses in Argentina, the United Kingdom and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.  We note that Walmart's overall revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were hurt to the tune of about $5 billion by divestitures related to the Walmart International business and $0.4 million due to adverse currency movements.
The Walmart International segment's net sales fell 13% to $23.8 billion. Divestitures hurt the segment's net sales by $5 billion and currency movements had a $0.4 billion adverse impact. On a cc basis, net sales dropped 11.6% to $24.1 billion. The operating income, on a cc basis, slumped 33.7% to $0.8 billion.
A Look at Q1 & Ahead
The company posted soft first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings. Management stated that its U.S. business' operating income was mainly hurt by higher costs related to staffing, an adverse mix due to the lower percentage of general merchandise and fuel costs and supply-chain woes.
The soft earnings results were a product of the unusual economic landscape, with U.S. inflation levels (especially food and fuel) creating greater-than-expected pressure on margins and operating expenses. WMT's adjusted earnings of $1.30 per share tumbled 23.1% from the year-ago period's figure of $1.69 and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46.
Management now expects the consolidated operating income to decline around 1% at cc and remain flat, excluding divestitures. The consolidated operating income was previously expected to grow nearly 3% at cc and at a greater rate than net sales, excluding divestitures. Management now envisions the EPS to decline nearly 1% in fiscal 2023 and remain flat year over year, excluding divestitures.
Earlier, the EPS was likely to grow in the mid-single-digit range. Excluding divestitures, it was expected to rise 5-6%. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the consolidated operating income and the EPS growth are expected in the range of flat to a slight increase.
While Walmart's robust omnichannel efforts are likely to continue being a driver, the abovementioned costs cannot be ignored in the near term.

2022-06-24 00:00:00+00:00,Kroger (KR) Hikes Dividend: Few More Things Investors Must Know,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/kroger-kr-hikes-dividend%3A-few-more-things-investors-must-know,,,"The Kroger Co. KR has always been a favorite pick for investors seeking both steady income and growth. This Cincinnati, OH-based company with a strong history of dividend payments as well as sound fundamentals provides a hedge against any odd swings in the stock market. Evidently, Kroger’s strong cash flow generation capability has allowed it to raise dividends consistently over time.

The company once again rewarded investors with a hike in dividend payout. Impressively, the hike marked Kroger’s 16th successive year of dividend increase. The company’s board of directors raised the quarterly dividend by 24% to 26 cents a share, which is payable on Sep 1, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Aug 15, 2022. Last year in June, the company increased its regular quarterly dividend by 17% to 21 cents.

The latest dividend increase brings its annualized dividend to $1.04 per share compared with the prior rate of 84 cents. The quarterly dividend has increased at a 14% compounded annual growth rate since it was reinstated in 2006.

Backed by sound fundamentals and financial strength, Kroger has time and again demonstrated its commitment to enhance shareholder value. The current hike reflects a strong cash flow generation capability, driven by better execution of operating plans. We note that net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,102 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Management expects to generate free cash flow between $2 billion and $2.2 billion in the current fiscal year.

We believe that such strategic steps not only drive the shareholder value but also raise the market value of the stock. In fact, companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip through these dividend increases. People looking for regular income from stocks are most likely to choose companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payouts.

We note that shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have advanced 9.1% in the past six months against the industry’s decline of 10.3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Kroger, which operates in the thin-margin grocery industry, has been undergoing a complete makeover not only with respect to products but also in terms of the way consumers prefer shopping grocery. The company has been making significant investments to enhance product freshness and quality, and expand digital capabilities. Impressively, Kroger has been introducing new items under its “Our Brands” portfolio and launched 239 new items in the first quarter.

Without a doubt, Kroger’s digital business remains one of its key growth drivers. Considering the current scenario, the company has been focusing on a no-contact delivery option, low-contact pickup service and ship-to-home orders. Its ‘Kroger Delivery Now’ service provides customers with food and household staples in 30 minutes. Also, its focus on the margin-rich alternative profit business bodes well.

Management envisions identical sales without fuel to be up 2.5-3.5% in fiscal 2022 compared with 0.2% growth registered in fiscal 2021. Kroger anticipates FIFO operating profit to be $4.3-$4.4 billion compared with $4.3 billion reported in fiscal 2021. It anticipates fiscal 2022 earnings between $3.85 and $3.95 per share, suggesting an increase from adjusted earnings of $3.68 reported in fiscal 2021.
