2022-05-26 00:00:00+00:00,"Jobless Claims, Q1 GDP Both Fall; Macy's, Dollar Tree Beat",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jobless-claims-q1-gdp-both-fall-macys-dollar-tree-beat,,,"Thursday, May 25, 2022

This morning, as most Thursday morning’s, we see new weekly jobless claims data. Initial Jobless Claims last week went down by 8000 to 210K, which is good news following two of the previous three weeks moving noticeably higher. Today’s headline number also beat the 215K analysts had been expecting.

Continuing Claims did move up, however, to 1.35 million. However, this is off the 1.315 million we saw the previous week, which was the lowest weekly print since before Francis Ford Coppola had made a successful movie. At 1.35 million, we’re still seeing exceptionally strong employment in the U.S. currently — or at least as of two weeks ago, from which these numbers are reported.

The first revision to Q1 GDP is also out this morning, sliding a tad further into the negative to -1.5% from the -1.4% first reported, and worse than the -1.3% expected. We hope to see this snap back in Q2 or else we’ll be looking at the first technical recession (two straight quarters of negative growth) since the start of the pandemic.

Consumption jumped notably to 3.1% from 2.7% originally reported, while pricing stayed firm at 7%, with the Pricing Index 8.1%. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) quarter over quarter dipped 10 basis points to +5.1% — still high, considering what we’re up against on inflation metrics.

None of this has had much effect on pre-market futures, which are buoyant on strong Q1 earnings results from Macy’s M and Dollar Tree DLTR — +12% and +15% this morning, respectively — among others. The Dow has gained another +170 points at this hour, while the S&P 500 is +20 and the Nasdaq is +30 points. We continue to see blue chips outgain tech and the wider market, but we are happy to take positive index developments of whatever stripe.

After the opening bell, Pending Home Sales for April are expected to have dropped -2.0%, following -1.2% in March. Higher prices — both in input costs for supplies and workforce as well as mortgage rates scaling higher — are keeping interested parties from pulling the trigger on home buys, and we’ve seen the softening in the housing market in other metrics of late, as well. A continuation of this will eventually start showing up in inflation data, as well.

Tomorrow morning we’ll continue the economic narrative with PCE inflation for April. In our last read, we saw +6.6% year over year PCE inflation, which is something we’re obviously interested in seeing some down. Should we get some notable good news on this tack, we may be looking at the first up-week for market indices in many weeks.

May 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes climbed on Thursday after upbeat annual forecasts from several retailers, while data confirmed the U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter, easing concerns about aggressive interest rate hikes.
All of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced in early trading, with consumer discretionary .SPLRCD up 3%, followed by a 1.7% rise in the financials sector .SPSY.
Macy's Inc M.N jumped 12.1% after the department store raised its annual profit forecast, as party-wear demand rebounds.
Dollar General Corp DG.N and Dollar Tree DLTR.O gained 13.2% and 17.8% respectively, after raising their annual sales forecasts, as more Americans turn to discount store shopping with inflation at a four-decade high.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department's report showed U.S. gross domestic product fell at a 1.5% annualized rate last quarter, revised down from the 1.4% decline reported in April under the weight of a record-trade deficit. The economy grew at a robust 6.9% pace in the fourth quarter.
Separately, weekly jobless claims fell to 210,000 last week, consistent with a tight labor market despite rising interest rates and tightening financial conditions.
""These numbers are indicative that growth is slowing, demand is slowing and maybe prices are even starting to slow. And if all those three things are in place, then the case for a dovish pivot will build over the summer months,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital.
The report came a day after the minutes of the Federal Reserve's May meeting showed most policymakers backed rate hikes of 50 basis points in June and July to tame inflation, but appeared flexible to possibly change course in September.
Markets have sold off sharply this year on growing worries about an economic slowdown due to aggressive Fed policy moves aimed at reining in surging prices. The war in Ukraine, pandemic-related lockdowns in China and recent dismal earnings forecasts have also weighed down markets.
The blue-chip Dow .DJI and the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX have lost 10.5% and 15.4% year-to-date, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC has fallen 25.9% as high-multiple growth stocks took a hit from rising interest rates.
""The reality is a lot more complicated at this juncture and so we will have these counter trend rallies in any bear market environment,"" said Hans Olsen, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company.
At 10:06 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 442.60 points, or 1.38%, at 32,562.88, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 55.00 points, or 1.38%, at 4,033.73, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 162.14 points, or 1.42%, at 11,596.89.
U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba Group BABA.N jumped 11.5% after the company posted upbeat fourth-quarter revenue on growing demand for some of its niche online shopping services in China.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7.18-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 3.32-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index saw three new 52-week highs and 29 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and 66 new lows.

2022-05-25 00:00:00+00:00,Dollar Tree Q1 Preview: What Can Investors Expect?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-q1-preview%3A-what-can-investors-expect,,,"Earnings season continues to wind down, and it’s been one for the books, to say the least.
We’ve witnessed double-digit percentage valuation slashes occur in a few companies’ shares following their quarterly releases, telling us that many of them struggled throughout the quarter. Since stocks typically move up during earnings season, it’s been quite the shock to many.
We’ve all become too familiar with the issues affecting companies throughout the quarter – supply chain bottlenecks, a hawkish Fed, soaring energy costs, and geopolitical issues.
Nonetheless, the market rolls on, and market participants must remain focused. A retailer set to release its quarterly results after the bell rings tomorrow on Wednesday is Dollar Tree DLTR.
Share Performance & Earnings Impact
Dollar Tree DLTR shares had been a bright spot in a dim market throughout the majority of 2022, but since the release of other retailers’ earnings, shares took on a downward trajectory, signaling that investor sentiment has massively changed. Still, DLTR shares have outperformed the S&P 500’s decline of 17%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Shares have not always reacted positively to better-than-expected quarterly results. Over its last six EPS beats, shares have moved upwards four times and have declined twice. Additionally, it’s worth noting that the two negative share reactions occurred when DLTR beat EPS estimates quite handily by double-digit percentages.
Earnings Surprise

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Furthermore, Dollar Tree has an ESP Score of -4.8% heading into tomorrow and is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Pairing a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 or greater vastly increases the odds of an earnings beat, and Dollar Tree is not within those parameters.  
DLTR beat EPS estimates handily by 12% in its latest quarter but posted worse-than-expected sales results, with higher-than-expected freight costs playing spoilsport for both the top and bottom line. Over its last four quarters, Dollar Tree has beat EPS estimates by 12%, on average.
Valuation
Dollar Tree’s forward earnings multiple sits at 16.6X, which is well below 2022 highs of 25.6X, and slightly under the median of 18.1X over the last five years. Additionally, the current value represents a 6% discount relative to the S&P 500’s forward P/E ratio of 17.6X.
In its latest quarter, free cash flow yield was reported at 1.2%, a marginal 0.3% decrease from the prior quarter. In fact, free cash flow yield has fallen from 9.5% in 2021 Q1, a concerning development.
EPS & Revenue Estimates
The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate for the quarter being reported tomorrow sits at $1.99 per share, with one analyst downwardly revising their outlook over the last week – this has been the only analyst to revise their EPS estimate over the previous 60 days, which raises a few red flags.  
However, the quarterly estimate does display a 25% growth in earnings from the year-ago quarter.
Revenue estimates display top-line strength. For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate has DLTR raking in $6.8 billion, a 4% increase when compared to year-ago quarterly sales of $6.5 billion. However, out of its last four quarters, DLTR has beat sales expectations once.
Other Retail Earnings
Retail sales in the United States increased 0.9% month over month in April. It came as a bit of a surprise, as it shows us that consumers are essentially shrugging off the high inflation levels. While this has benefitted the top lines of retailers, the bottom lines have been massively impacted by freight costs and supply chain bottlenecks.
This was further displayed by Walmart WMT and Target TGT in their quarterly results reported earlier this month.
Target reported earnings of $2.19 per share, which majorly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.00 per share by a sizable 27% and reflected a 41% decline in earnings from the year-ago quarter. However, TGT beat on the top line, reporting quarterly sales of $25.2 billion, which easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.5 billion.
Similarly, Walmart beat top-line estimates by a respectable 2.4% and reported quarterly sales of $141.5 billion vs. the consensus estimate of $138.3 billion. However, bottom-line results came in way below expectations; Walmart reported quarterly EPS of $1.30 vs. the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $1.46.
Following the quarterly reports, shares of both companies fell quite extensively. A key takeaway here is that retailers have experienced increased demand in the face of surging inflation, which supports the top line of these companies. However, the bottom line is where the pain has been most significant – margins have been impacted extensively by rising freight costs and supply-chain issues.
Bottom Line
While the top and bottom-line estimates forecast year-over-year growth, I think investors are better off keeping their distance from DLTR, and there are several reasons why.
Retailers have shown us repeatedly throughout this earnings season that their margins had been compressed quite extensively from higher freight costs and supply-chain bottlenecks. These issues are likely to persist throughout FY22.
Free cash flow yield has declined dramatically over the last year, and shares have recently found weakness following other retailers’ quarterly results.
Additionally, the most significant reason is that the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) paired with a negative ESP score heading into tomorrow, which means that the odds of an EPS beat are no longer in investors’ favor.
A robust quarterly report is definitely not out of the picture, but as we’ve seen from other retailers, margins have been impacted significantly, and the safer play is on the sidelines.

Retail stocks are beaten down, laying several opportunities out for investors. 
Target (TGT): If Target maintains its pledge then it will build serious consumer loyalty for a long time to come. 
Albertsons (ACI): Downside is fully priced in already with plenty of growth expected. 
Lowe’s (LOW): Reaffirmed revenue numbers should reassure investors that Lowe’s is the homebuilding supplier to buy. 
Dollar Tree (DLTR): EPS numbers tell a strong story for the discount retailer. 
BJ’s Wholesale (BJ): Strong earnings and relative value make BJ’s a buy.
Amazon (AMZN): The world’s largest e-commerce firm is deeply discounted following the tech wreck. 
Home Depot (HD): Tons of upside remains following unexpectedly positive results.

Retail stocks have seen better days. But the crash earlier this week has investors seeing opportunity as the sector receives attention on the bad news. The crash was led by Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT), which were hit particularly hard by rising costs. 
For its part, Walmart placed the blame on supply chain and employee costs. Retailers like Walmart had been able to increase prices and maintain strong results throughout the pandemic despite higher costs. In the first quarter, however, the company was unable to accurately forecast relevant factors, leading to lower than anticipated EPS figures. 
Target similarly reported disappointing results also noting that fuel and freight costs would be $1 billion higher in 2022 than the firm had prior anticipated. It should be noted that Target has pledged to try and absorb those higher prices rather than raise prices at its stores. 
7 Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Right Now
The news may seem grim given that recession woes continue to rise as the pace of negative news seems to increase by the day. But there is a silver lining here. 
TGT Target Corporation $146.30
ACI Albertsons Companies, Inc. $28.75
LOW Lowe’s Companies, Inc. $184.03
DLTR Dollar Tree, Inc. $128.85

Best Retail Stocks to Buy: Target (TGT) 
Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com
There is a reasonable, if risky, bet to be made on Target immediately following the weaker than expected results. And the reason to make that bet can be found in the company’s promise to customers in the face of rising costs: It is planning not to increase prices to raise profits as the firm knows customers are seeking affordability more than ever. 
CFO Michael Fiddelke was quoted stating, “While we don’t like the impact to our profitability in the short term, we know it is the right thing to do for our guests and our business over the long term.”
Target now knows it has to play a bit of a long game. The idea is straightforward: Absorb those greater macroeconomic problems in its operations, reward customers with unwavering prices and build long-term loyalty. Given that TGT stock has fallen from $215 to $155 and is showing signs of resistance now is the time to buy. 
Albertsons (ACI)

Invest in Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) because all of the current negativity is fully priced into its shares. For one, ACI stock also took a hit as Walmart and Target pulled the broader retail sector down last week. 
Second, Albertsons had already been moving downward since early April when the firm announced full-year profits might be slightly weaker than analysts had predicted. The point here is that the so-called weakness is fairly minor. The company forecast an earnings range between $2.70 and $2.85 for fiscal year 2022. That put the midpoint below the $2.81 consensus expectation, pulling prices downward. 
But at the same time management also noted that same-store sales growth should reach 2-3% for the fiscal year, well above consensus expectations of 1.3% same-store sales growth.

Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) is proving that it has strength despite widespread fear surrounding retail stocks. Yes, it did suffer following the retail stock crash last week. But it quickly rebounded. The broader news that Walmart and Target had disappointed carved a chunk out of the home improvement firm’s market capitalization that was quickly filled less than 24 hours later. 
The net effect was that LOW stock dropped a few dollars, which could occur on a normal day with no significant news. 
The reason for its strength relative to other retail stocks is clear: The company didn’t show any real weakness. In fact, EPS figures reached $3.51, well ahead of the $3.22 Wall Street had forecast for the North Carolina headquartered firm. 
What should also interest investors is that Lowe’s reaffirmed its 2022 revenue outlook of between $97 and $99 billion and EPS between $13.10 to $13.60. Pundits are worried that rising interest rates will affect home improvement spending and house sales, and thus LOW stock, but this latest report seems to refute the notion that Lowe’s investor base will suffer. 
Dollar Tree (DLTR) 
Source: shutterstock.com/Jonathan Weiss
There’s good reason to invest in Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) ahead of earnings on May 26. The reason is that analysts haven’t wavered on the discount retailer stock even as things have gone sideways for the retail sector. 
Here’s what I mean. Yes, DLTR stock did take a hit with share prices dropping from the mid $150s to the mid $130s on sector news. But at the same time, consensus per share earnings expectations are not wavering according to Yahoo! Finance. A week ago analysts were expecting Dollar Tree to post EPS numbers of $2.01 on May 26th. Those EPS expectations have since lowered a single cent to $2.00. 
In other words, if investors were expecting Walmart and Target to negatively affect earnings for Dollar Tree, they may be mistaken.

Further, Dollar Tree has surprised investors in three of the last four quarters with EPS numbers that have well-exceeded expectations. The one exception was Q3 when the firm provided a 96-cent EPS that was exactly as expected. 
Best Retail Stocks to Buy: BJ’s Wholesale (BJ) 
Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com
BJ’s (NYSE:BJ) posted very strong numbers well above expectations on May 19. Both earnings and revenues were well ahead of where Wall Street expected them to be. The wholesale club posted an EPS of 87 cents, well above the 72 cents Wall Street was looking for. Likewise, the company’s $4.5 billion in revenue was well ahead of the $4.24 billion that was anticipated. 
Club sales increased 14.4% during the quarter and 4.1% without the impact of gasoline sales. 
Here’s the reason to buy BJ stock: It is showing that it can rebound quickly while its competitor Costco (NYSE:COST) has wavered. It seems that investors are interested in moving their capital toward BJ’s with its lower P/E ratio of 15.9 while Costco sports a P/E ratio nearly double that of BJ’s. 
That implies that while Costco garnered lots of attention as inflation numbers spiked, BJ’s turn to receive an influx of capital may be at hand. 
Amazon (AMZN)

It’s no secret that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has fallen precipitously through 2022. During the so-called tech wreck, it has dropped from levels above $3,500 per share to current levels below $2,200. 
As my colleague Dana Blankenhorn notes, you don’t lose anything if you don’t sell. His take is that Amazon has always been a long-term investment and that AMZN stock has every possibility of reaching those former highs again. So those who invested when prices were higher have little to fear if he is correct. Further, if Amazon retraces those former highs, there’s a ton of upside for those who purchase shares now.

His thesis is that Amazon’s cloud dominance all but ensures that a rebound will occur. He goes on to note that AWS, as a dominant cloud force, gives Amazon’s other businesses an innate advantage. He also asserts that AWS alone could be as valuable as the entirety of Amazon if it were forced to break up right now. That’s something to think about as AMZN stock continues to trade at low prices. 
Best Retail Stocks to Buy: Home Depot (HD) 
Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com
Investors should breathe a sigh of relief with Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Concerns of an ongoing slowdown in demand for home improvement are not coming to fruition based on earnings from the company. 
In fact, Home Depot just reported its highest ever Q1 sales. That led to EPS figures of $4.06 where analysts were expecting $3.69. There’s more good news: Home Depot raised sales guidance for 2022 to 3% on the positive results. 
Cooler weather had tamped down expectations for first-quarter results as home improvement activity was expected to slow as a result. Now is the time to buy as HD stock remains well below consensus prices and plenty of upside remains.

Factors to Consider
Dollar Tree has been gaining from strength in the H2, Dollar Tree Plus and the new Combo Stores, which are part of the company’s Key Real Estate Initiatives. It is also poised to benefit from the expansion of the aforementioned stores as part of the plan. The company has been progressing well with its store optimization initiatives. These efforts are likely to have boosted its sales and comps in the to-be-reported quarter.

The Family Dollar H2 stores have been performing well, with the newest format store, Combo Store, exceeding expectations. At the Dollar Tree banner, its multi-price point Dollar Tree Plus! concept store has been gaining popularity among customers, particularly for the discretionary categories. This has helped improve store productivity.

Also, its Crafter’s Square offerings have been performing well, driven by the expansion of its Crafter’s Square offerings to include essential and seasonal products. The initiatives are expected to have boosted the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

Dollar Tree’s restructuring and expansion initiatives, including steady store openings and improvement of distribution centers, are likely to have driven revenues. The company has been on track to leverage Family Dollar and Dollar Tree distribution center systems, and combined merchandise.

The company’s digital and omni-channel capabilities and same-day delivery service with Instacart are also expected to have driven traffic trends in the fiscal first quarter.

The aforementioned factors instill optimism regarding the upcoming results.

On the last reported quarter’searnings call management predicted consolidated net sales of $6.63-$6.78 billion for first-quarter fiscal 2022, with enterprise same-store sales growth in the low-single digits. It anticipated earnings of $1.95-$2.10 per share for the fiscal first quarter.

However, DLTR has continued to reel under dismal margins due to increased freight costs, which have been denting the bottom line. The company has been impacted by all aspects of freight, including higher costs for inland transportation by truck and rail.

Management, on its last reported quarter’searnings call envisioned freight and supply-chain disruptions to remain headwinds in the near term. It expected cost pressures from import and domestic freight to continue in the first half of 2022 due to the annualization of fiscal 2021 rates. Additionally, management predicted diesel fuel prices to remain significantly higher in 2022. These factors are likely to have resulted in higher freight costs and a consequent decline in the gross margin in the fiscal first quarter.

The company has also been witnessing higher SG&A expenses for the past several quarters, owing to incremental COVID-related expenses as well as elevated payroll and store re-banner costs.

On its last reported quarter’searnings call management expected the pressures related to in-store and distribution center payroll costs to persist due to competitive markets, states increasing minimum wages, unemployment levels and completing the ongoing initiatives. This is expected to have resulted in higher SG&A expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.

NEW YORK, May 23 (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. retailers and consumer-oriented stocks took a beating last week, but may not yet be low enough to tempt long-term investors who remain worried about whether surging inflation will continue to hurt corporate bottom-lines and cause shoppers to cut back.
Last week, consumer staples .SPLRCS dived 8.6% and consumer discretionary .SPLRCD tumbled 7.4%, the biggest declines of any S&P 500 sectors, with inflation hammering corporate results. Shares of some companies fared far worse, with Walmart WMT.N swooning 19.5% for the week and Target TGT.N plunging 29% after disappointing results.
Investors worry more declines could be in store if consumers cut spending in the face of higher prices. Among earnings reports due this week are Best Buy BBY.N on Tuesday and Dollar General DG.N and Costco Wholesale COST.O on Thursday.
“I think it has been a wake-up call to investors that the consumer is being impacted by higher inflation ... sooner than what I think the Street was anticipating,” said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management. “We are only at the beginning of people trading down and changing their spending patterns.”
The latest consumer price index jumped 8.3% on an annual basis. Prices for gasoline stand more than 50% higher than a year ago, according to AAA.
The Fed has promised to keep raising U.S. interest rates until inflation is squashed, a key factor hitting risk appetite for investors and putting the S&P 500 on the cusp of a bear market, defined as a 20% decline from its record high.
Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, believes surging oil and gasoline prices will keep undermining consumer spending.
""I'd be very cautious of discretionary retail at this point,"" she said. ""So many people are affected by high gas prices and high fuel prices.""
A survey by Morgan Stanley found that more than half of consumers plan to cut spending over the next six months due to inflation. The bank said most cuts were expected to come from categories such as dining out and footwear and apparel.
To be sure, the slump in share prices has made valuations more tempting. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 retailing index .SPXRT, for which Amazon AMZN.O makes up half the weight, has come down to 25.4 times from 33.9 times at the end of 2021, according to Refinitiv Datastream.
Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, said he would likely take a closer look in coming days at whether Target shares warrant buying after sliding 25% the day of its earnings report.
""A stock like Target, when it falls 25%, you ought to look at it,"" Tuz said. ""You may decide not to buy it, but it’s one of America’s premier retailers.""
Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, said that while the ""risk/reward is certainly getting more interesting"" in retail, she wants to see evidence of ebbing inflation.
""While we're seeing interesting opportunities forming, we'd like to have some confirmation of the inflation story before we really step in,"" Mahajan said.

May 20 (Reuters) - A rout in consumer stocks gained more steam on Friday, as shares of Ross Stores ROST.O led a retreat of other discount stores to cap off a bleak week for retailers.
Ross shares were down 24.4% at $70.06 after falling as low as $69.75 after the discount apparel retailer cut its 2022 same-store-sales estimate to a decline of 2%-4% versus an earlier flat-to-up 3% target.
Dollar General DG.N, which is due to report earnings next week, lost 8.4% after falling 14% in the last three sessions. Dollar Tree DLTR.O fell 7.7%. T.J. Maxx parent co TJX Co TJX.N fell 8.2%.
Among auto retailers, Advance Auto Parts AAP.N was down 9.7% and Autozone AZO.N fell 9.1% with both expected to report quarterly results in the week ahead. Shares in rival O' Reilly Auto ORLY.O were down 5.8%.
While Walmart WMT.N and Target TGT.N earlier this week reported that store traffic was still strong, high inflation ate into their profits. With fuel and freight costs still rising and supply chains still disrupted Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, sees sector-wide repercussions.
""It's hard to see how some of these smaller retailers can withstand the margin pressures if some giants like Walmart and Target haven't been able to,"" she said.
But generally healthy balance sheets and retail sales data released earlier this week suggest healthy U.S. spending.
""In a recessionary environment you'd see consumers going towards those bargain brands for sure. But we haven't yet seen that,"" Mahajan said.
The S&P 500 Consumer discretionary sector .SPLRCD was down 3.7% after hitting its lowest point since July 2020, on track for a weekly decline of more than 9%, its seventh in a row and its biggest weekly loss since March 2020.
Target was down 1.1%, tracking a roughly 31% weekly loss. Walmart falling 1.0%, was eying a 20% weekly drop.
Macys M.N was down 9.5% and Kohl's M.N, was down 13.4% and about 19% for the week after its results also disappointed.

Wednesday was a rough day for investors in many retailing stocks. Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR), Tractor Supply (NASDAQ: TSCO), and BJ's Wholesale Club (NYSE: BJ) shares each fell by more than 10% by 12:30 p.m. ET, compared to a 2.7% slump in the S&P 500.
The retailing segment seemed to drive the decline in the wider market, and that pressure came from tough earnings news out of Target (NYSE: TGT), one of the industry's biggest players.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Target said early Wednesday that sales expanded roughly 4% to $24.8 billion in the selling period that ended in late April. That result edged past expectations and was powered by healthy customer traffic.
However, as Walmart revealed earlier in the week, the gains came with a big drawback.
Profitability plunged, with operating margin diving to 5% of sales from 10% a year ago. That decline suggests at least part of the margin gains that Target enjoyed in earlier phases of the pandemic was just a temporary factor. The profit margin was ""well below where we expect to operate over time,"" CEO Brian Cornell said in a press release .
Just about every retailing business fell along with Target in response to this news. Smaller peers like Dollar Tree may face similar margin declines, and investors are worried about the discount chain's upcoming earnings report, slated for Thursday, May 26.
Tractor Supply, meanwhile, posted a fantastic increase in its profitability over the past two years that was driven by many of the same factors that pushed Target's higher. These include a tilt in demand toward fast home delivery and premium products. The company gave no indication of an impending reversal of its profitability wins in late April. But Wall Street is concerned that such a downgrade is coming.
BJ's Wholesale reports its earnings results on Thursday, and investors are worried that the wholesale retailer will scale back expectations on short-term profits for the same reason that Target did today.
Now what
It might seem like an overreaction for investors to push the share prices down for BJ's, Tractor Supply, and Dollar Tree, given that these companies have yet to update shareholders on their latest operating trends. And Target's results hardly painted a dark picture of consumer spending trends. Customer traffic is still rising in its stores even compared to soaring results last year. And the retailer affirmed its 2022 sales outlook that calls for modest growth overall.
Yet Target dramatically reduced its short-term profitability outlook. And until these companies can prove otherwise, Wall Street is assuming that Dollar Tree, BJ's, and Tractor Supply will walk a similar path with their next earnings announcements.

May 17 (Reuters) - Shares in consumer discretionary and staples stocks were trading in opposite directions on Tuesday as encouraging retail sales data was countered by disappointing earnings and financial targets from Walmart WMT.N, which blamed high inflation.
Walmart shares closed down 11.4% after it reported a 25% quarterly earnings decline and cut its full-year profit outlook due to rising fuel and labor costs, while shoppers, squeezed by decades-high inflation on basic needs like food, reined in purchases of nonessential items.
That put Walmart shares on track for its biggest daily percentage drop since an 11.79% tumble on Oct 16, 1987, the last trading session before the ""Black Monday"" stock market crash in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 22%.
Dragged by Walmart, shares in Target Corp TGT.N finished down over 1% ahead of its earnings report due Wednesday morning. Dollar General DG.N and Dollar Tree DLTR.O both fell 3%.
But while the S&P 500 consumer staples sector .SPLRCS declined 1%, the benchmark's consumer discretionary sector .SPLRCD gained 2.7% as some clothing, travel and automaker shares gained ground.
Data showed U.S. retail sales rose strongly in April as consumers spent more on motor vehicles due to supply improvements. They also spent more at restaurants, boosting the economy at the start of this quarter.
The contrast, according to some strategists, is because soaring inflation has a bigger impact on lower-income customers who shop at Walmart or dollar stores than consumers who can still buy pricier items from companies including Under Armour UAA.N, up 4%, Ralph Lauren RL.N, up 3.8% and PVH Corp PVH.N up 3.4%.
Since price increases resulting from the war between Russia and Ukraine were in purchases ""the consumer cannot do without"" such as food and energy, Eric Theoret, global macro strategist at Manulife said, the lower-income consumers are seeing ""real income shock.""
""In terms of ability to spend, the lower-end consumer is also much closer to having exhausted their pandemic savings. With respect to earnings, we are seeing solid wage gains at the lower quintiles but even these are unable to keep pace with inflation – eroding consumers’ ability to spend,"" Theoret said.
This trend was also in evidence in shares of packaged food companies such as Kraft Heinz KHC.O, down 2% and General Mills GIS.N, down 0.7%, after Walmart said shoppers switched to cheaper store-branded goods from well known labels.
Still, while some wealthier consumers are also looking for grocery store savings, the retail sales data showed that people still have money to spend, noted Lindsey Bell, chief markets and money strategist at Ally.
""The consumer is still spending. The consumer isn't dead ... The consumer is really interested in spending their money on services and experiences,"" said Bell, noting that it might be part of the reason clothing store shares were rising.
""Going out, taking part in different activities requires you dress the part,"" she said.
Also, so far in 2022, the staples sector has outperformed, showing a 1% year-to-date decline compared with a plunge of about 25.9% in consumer discretionary stocks.
""Investors are starting to realize they left consumer discretionary sector stocks in general for dead with a big exit from the discretionary sector and into staples,"" said Bell.
Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, noted that even though consumers are very fearful right now, ""they are in really good shape.""
""Almost every fear we have is really tied to one fear - inflation,"" said Paulsen. But he believes inflation may be stabilizing, which would mean investors and consumers can also stop worrying about things like rising bond yields, Federal Reserve rate hikes or an imminent recession.
""If inflation is rolling over it's going to lift consumer confidence. I think it's going to run right through Main Street as well as Wall Street,"" he said.

May 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, as Citigroup led a surge in bank shares after Berkshire Hathaway revealed a big stake and strong retail sales in April eased some concerns about slowing economic growth.
Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced, with financials .SPSY and technology .SPLRCT up 2% each.
Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O gained between 1.5% and 4.8%, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
Banks .SPXBK jumped 3.1%, with Citigroup C.N climbing 7.9%, after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway BRKa.N disclosed a nearly $3 billion investment in the U.S. lender.
""If you have exhausted sellers, there's no one else left to sell ... the market has really been pummeled,"" said Mimi Duff, senior client advisor at investment advisory firm GenTrust.
""So at the very sight of any good news you can get a bounce, but what we are really looking for is some consolidation.""
U.S. retail sales increased 0.9% in April as consumers bought motor vehicles amid an improvement in supply and frequented restaurants.
Another set of data showed industrial production accelerated 1.1% last month, higher than estimates of 0.5%, and followed by a 0.9% advance in March.
""This is consistent with continued economic growth in the second quarter and not a recession underway,"" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank in Dallas.
""The industrial sector is running too hot and needs to slow for inflation to get under control. The Fed will raise the federal funds target half a percentage point at each of the next two meetings to throw some sand in the economy's gears.""
Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later in the day and his comments would be parsed for clues on the path of future interest rate hikes. Traders are pricing in a 50-basis point rate hike in June. FEDWATCH

United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O gained 6.5% after the carrier lifted its current-quarter revenue forecast, boosting shares of Delta Air DAL.N, American Airlines AAL.O and Spirit Airlines SAVE.N.
A positive first-quarter earnings season has been overshadowed by worries about the conflict in Ukraine, soaring inflation, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and aggressive policy tightening by central banks.
The S&P 500 is down 1.6% and the Nasdaq off 3.7% so far in May, largely hit by declines in growth stocks.
U.S.-listed Chinese stocks jumped on hopes that China will ease its crackdown on the technology sector.
