2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00,Here's How Home Depot (HD) is Positioned Ahead of Q3 Earnings,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-how-home-depot-hd-is-positioned-ahead-of-q3-earnings,,,"The Home Depot, Inc. HD is expected to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 15, before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal third-quarter earnings of $4.11 per share suggests growth of 4.9% from the year-ago period’s reported figure. The consensus estimate has been unchanged in the past 30 days.

The consensus mark for quarterly revenues is pegged at $37.9 billion, indicating growth of 3% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.

We expect the company’s fiscal third-quarter total revenues to increase 2.7% year over year to $37,823.8 million and the bottom line to improve 4.9% to $4.12 per share.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 2%. The leading home improvement retailer delivered an earnings surprise of 7.2% in the last four quarters, on average.
The Home Depot, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise

Key Factors to Note
Home Depot’s third-quarter fiscal 2022 performance is likely to have benefited from the continued strong demand for home improvement projects, a robust housing market and ongoing investments. The company has been witnessing a rise in average ticket, driven by high-value purchases by home builders. This has been aiding comparable store sales. For the fiscal third quarter, we expect 6.1% growth in average ticket, offset by a 2.5% decline in the number of customer transactions.

HD is expected to have witnessed growth in the Pro and DIY customer categories, along with digital momentum, in the fiscal third quarter.

Home Depot has been witnessing significant benefits from the execution of its ""One Home Depot"" plan focused on expanding the supply chain, technology investments and digital enhancements. The company’s interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have been consistently boosting web traffic for the past few quarters. This is expected to have aided digital sales in the to-be-reported quarter.

However, Home Depot is likely to have witnessed continued cost pressures in third-quarter fiscal 2022, driven by the impacts of inflation, supply-chain dynamics and the consumer spending environment. Higher transportation costs and product mix are expected to have resulted in higher cost of goods sold in the fiscal third quarter, leading to a lower gross margin. We anticipate a gross margin contraction of 20 bps to 33.9% for the fiscal third quarter.

Further, the investments in its supply chain are expected to have marred the gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter. Higher inventory levels and interest expenses are expected to have been concerning.

On its last reported quarter’searnings call management expected the uncertainties relating to the supply-chain issues, inflation and the overall consumer environment to persist throughout fiscal 2022.

2022-11-09 00:00:00+00:00,"Coupang, Inc. (CPNG) Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/coupang-inc.-cpng-q3-earnings-beat-estimates,,,"Coupang, Inc. (CPNG) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.05 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.03 per share. This compares to loss of $0.19 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 266.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $0.11 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.04, delivering a surprise of 63.64%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.
Coupang, Inc., which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $5.1 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.01%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.64 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Coupang, Inc. Shares have lost about 40.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -19.7%.
What's Next for Coupang, Inc.
While Coupang, Inc. Has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Coupang, Inc. Favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is breakeven on $5.63 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.20 on $20.94 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Commerce is currently in the top 39% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
Another stock from the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector, Dollar Tree (DLTR), has yet to report results for the quarter ended October 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 22.
This discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +20.8%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
Dollar Tree's revenues are expected to be $6.83 billion, up 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.

From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Flowers Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  Flowers Foods, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Flowers Foods, Inc. Quote
 Things To Consider
Flowers Foods’ is benefiting from robust demand for its products in the retail channels. The company’s focus on core priorities — developing its team, concentrating on brands, prioritizing margins and looking out for prudent mergers and acquisitions — bode well. The company is undertaking innovation in its leading brands, which have been yielding well. We believe that the persistence of these factors might have been an upside to the quarter to be reported.

That said, Flowers Foods is battling major hurdles due to cost inflation and supply-chain bottlenecks. In this regard, rising materials, supplies, labor and other production costs are a concern. Management, in its lastearnings call highlighted that it expects inflation to remain a deterrent that will likely reach its peak in the third quarter. That said, the company’s strategic pricing actions have been a breather.
What the Zacks Model Unveils

Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Dollar Tree as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Dollar Tree to post earnings of $1.16 per share.

2022-11-08 00:00:00+00:00,Tapestry (TPR) Queued Up for Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tapestry-tpr-queued-up-for-q1-earnings%3A-whats-in-store,,,"Tapestry, Inc. TPR is likely to register an increase in the top line when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2023 numbers on Nov 10 before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1,509 million, suggesting an improvement of 1.9% from the prior-year reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman brands is pegged at $1,131 million, $308 million and $70 million, indicating an increase of 1.4%, 2.8% and 5.3%, respectively.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings per share has declined by a penny to 74 cents over the past seven days. The consensus mark indicates a decline of 9.8% from the year-ago period. Tapestry has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 14.5%, on average.
Factors to Note
A consumer-centric approach, omnichannel capabilities, brand awareness and an emphasis on high-growth areas are likely to have benefited Tapestry’s first-quarter performance.

Its Acceleration Program has been a major contributing factor as well. The program is aimed at transforming the company into a leaner and more responsive organization with a clearly defined path and strategy for each brand. We also believe that continued strength in North America and Europe, with steady growth in the rest of Asia, might have offset the pandemic-related disruption in China.

On its lastearnings call Tapestry guided mid-single-digit growth in revenues on a constant-currency basis, which included a decline of approximately 15% projected in Greater China. On a reported basis, it expects global sales to increase slightly, including a negative impact of approximately 350 basis points from FX.

Also, we cannot ignore the impact of ongoing supply-chain issues and increasing freight costs. Meanwhile, any deleverage in SG&A expenses might get reflected in margins. Tapestry expects first-quarter earnings to be 75 cents a share, down from the 82 cents reported in the year-ago period.

Capri Holdings Limited Price and EPS Surprise
  Capri Holdings Limited price-eps-surprise | Capri Holdings Limited Quote
Factors to Note
Capri Holdings has long been gaining from the robust performance of all three luxury brands. The company has been on track to maximize the potential of the Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors brands through expanded products and categories. Notably, the Versace brand expanded its license deal with EuroItalia for an additional period of 15 years.

The company has also been emphasizing on boosting its accessories business, including leather goods and handbags. This, along with cost-containment efforts, increased focus on the e-commerce platform and accretive buyouts, bodes well.

Its e-commerce business has been witnessing a sturdy performance, driven by omni-channel capabilities and increased consumer engagement. The company has been investing significantly in digital analytics, expanding capabilities and upgrading the e-commerce platform.

On its last reported quarter’searnings call management anticipated fiscal second-quarter revenues of $300 million from Versace, $140 million from Jimmy Choo, and $960 million from Michael Kors, indicating year-over-year increases of 7%, 3% and 9%, respectively, on a reported basis.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter revenues at Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors brands is pegged at $301 million, $142 million and $957 million, indicating increases of 6.7%, 3.6% and 8.6%, respectively.

However, Capri Holdings has been grappling with supply-chain bottlenecks and higher transportation costs, as well as the war in Ukraine. Lower revenues from China, owing to the pandemic-related restrictions, are likely to have been a drag.

On its last reported quarter’searnings call the company predicted revenues in Mainland China to be down 20% year-over-year for the fiscal second quarter.

Also, increased marketing and supply-chain costs have been weighing on margins. The company, in its last earnings report, expected an operating margin of 17% for the fiscal second quarter, suggesting a decline from 18.5% reported in the year-ago period.

2022-11-08 00:00:00+00:00,"If You Invested $1000 in Dollar Tree a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/if-you-invested-%241000-in-dollar-tree-a-decade-ago-this-is-how-much-itd-be-worth-now-0,,,"For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.
FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.
What if you'd invested in Dollar Tree (DLTR) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to DLTR for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?
Dollar Tree's Business In-Depth
With that in mind, let's take a look at Dollar Tree's main business drivers.
Founded in 1986 and headquartered in Chesapeake, VA, Dollar Tree Inc. is an operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise and other assortments. Its stores successfully operate in major metropolitan areas, mid-sized cities and small towns. The company offers a wide range of quality everyday general merchandise in many categories, including housewares, seasonal goods, candy and food, toys, health and beauty care, gifts, party goods, stationery, books, personal accessories, and other consumer items. Its stores are supported by a nationwide logistics network and distribution centers.

Dollar Tree also owns an e-commerce platform – DollarTree.com – which sells its merchandise in bulk to individuals and small businesses as well as organizations. Through its online platform, the company advertises its in-store events and showcases its special and seasonal promotions for featured products. Further, it acquired Family Dollar Stores, Inc. on July 6, 2015.

The company operates in two reporting business segments: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.

Dollar Tree: Being the major operator of discount variety stores, this segment offers merchandise at the fixed price point of $1.00. The segment has nearly 7,652 stores operating under the Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree Canada banners, 12 distribution centers in the United States and two in Canada. Dollar Tree stores primarily range from 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet.

Family Dollar: This segment operates general merchandise discount retail stores with competitively-priced merchandise in the neighborhood stores. It has nearly 7,827 stores, which sell merchandise at prices ranging from $1.00 to $10.00. These stores primarily range from 6,000 - 8,000 selling square feet. The segment includes store operations under the Family Dollar brand and 11 distribution centers.   
As of Jan 29, 2022, the company operated 16,077 stores in 48 states and five Canada provinces.
Bottom Line
Putting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Dollar Tree, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.
A $1000 investment made in November 2012 would be worth $4,121.30, or a gain of 312.13%, as of November 8, 2022, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.
The S&P 500 rose 172.98% and the price of gold increased -7.23% over the same time frame in comparison.
Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for DLTR.
Shares of Dollar Tree lagged the industry in the past three months. The dismal performance can be attributed to its slashed earnings view for fiscal 2022 backed by the inflationary pressures, plans for pricing investment at Family Dollar and consumers’ shift to consumable products. This is expected to impact gross margin in fiscal 2022. Freight expenses, markdowns, shrink and unfavorable product mix related to a shift toward lower-margin consumable products continue to be headwinds. However, Dollar Tree boasts a robust earnings surprise trend, which continued in second-quarter fiscal 2022. The company reported 11th straight quarter of earnings beat in the quarter. The top and bottom lines also improved year over year on continued demand for the company’s products, sales growth and improved margins.
The stock has jumped 13.13% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 1 higher, for fiscal 2022; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.

DDS is expected to register year-over-year top-line growth when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 numbers. However, higher SG&A expenses and supply-chain costs are likely to have dented its earnings performance despite efforts to manage inventory levels and reduce operating expenses.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter revenues of $1.49 billion indicates 0.6% growth from the year-ago reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.87 per share, indicating a 50.4% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus estimate has been unchanged in the past 30 days.

In the last reported quarter, the company reported an earnings surprise of 222.9%. We note that in the trailing four quarters, the company’s bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 214.9%, on average.
Dillard's, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  Dillard's, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Dillard's, Inc. Quote
Key Factors to Note
Dillard’s has been benefiting from continued momentum in consumer demand and focus on inventory and expense management. The company’s strategy to offer fashion-forward and trendy products in order to attract customers has been a key driver.

Dillard's is likely to have retained its sales momentum on strong consumer demand, and robust sales across product categories and regions. It has recently been witnessing robust demand for men’s apparel and accessories, ladies, and children’s apparel categories.

The company’s initiatives to control inventory and expenses have been contributing to bottom-line gains for the past few quarters. Improved consumer demand and better inventory management have been leading to lower markdowns, which have been boosting the gross margin. The trends are expected to have continued in the fiscal third quarter.

However, stiff competition and raw material price inflation are likely to have been concerning. The company has been witnessing elevated SG&A expenses for the past few quarters, which have been denting the bottom line to some extent. The persistence of the trend is anticipated to have affected the company’s profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.
What the Zacks Model Suggests
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Dillard’s this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.

GO is likely to register an increase in the top line when it reports third-quarter 2022 earnings on Nov 8 after market close. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $876.2 million, indicating an increase of 14% from the prior-year reported figure.

The bottom line of this extreme value retailer of quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products is also expected to increase year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter earnings per share has been stable at 25 cents over the past 30 days. The figure suggests an increase of 4.2% from the year-ago period.

Grocery Outlet has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this Emeryville, CA-based company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 20.8%.
Factors to Note
Grocery Outlet’s flexible sourcing and distribution business model, which helps it offer products at exceptional value and excellent service from independent operators, are among the key factors driving revenues.

The company’s opportunistic purchasing strategy, marketing efforts, store-growth endeavors and e-commerce initiatives to deepen the customer reach also appear encouraging. Cumulatively, these are likely to have favorably impacted the to-be-reported quarter's top line.

The company has been offering the same-day delivery of everyday essentials and staples from nearly all its stores in collaboration with Instacart. We believe that Grocery Outlet’s compelling value proposition continues to attract bargain hunters, encourage customers to revisit stores and increase basket sizes.
Grocery Outlet Holding Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

On its lastearnings call management guided third-quarter 2022 net sales of approximately $875 million compared with $768.9 million reported in the year-ago period. It projected comparable store sales growth of 10% against a decline of 4.3% witnessed in the prior-year quarter.

Despite these tailwinds, high labor costs, increased freight expenses and supply-chain issues remain concerns. These might have weighed on the company's margins.

Management guided a third-quarter gross margin of approximately 30.6% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of about 6.3%. These show marginal contraction from a gross margin of 30.8% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 6.7% in the year-ago period.

2022-11-07 00:00:00+00:00,Is John Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF (JHMM) a Strong ETF Right Now?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-john-hancock-multifactor-mid-cap-etf-jhmm-a-strong-etf-right-now-4,,,"Launched on 09/28/2015, the John Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF (JHMM) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.
Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.
Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
The fund is managed by John Hancock. JHMM has been able to amass assets over $2.53 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the John Hancock Dimensional Mid Cap Index before fees and expenses.
The John Hancock Dimensional Mid Cap Index comprises of a subset of securities in the U.S. Universe issued by companies whose market capitalizations are between the 200th and 951st largest U.S. company.
Cost & Other Expenses
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.
With on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.41%.
JHMM's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 0.98%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
ETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
For JHMM, it has heaviest allocation in the Industrials sector --about 16.30% of the portfolio --while Information Technology and Financials round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY) accounts for about 0.65% of total assets, followed by Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR) and Republic Services Inc (RSG).
Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 4.54% of JHMM's total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
Year-to-date, the John Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF has lost about -16.82% so far, and is down about -16.85% over the last 12 months (as of 11/07/2022). JHMM has traded between $42.60 and $56.63 in this past 52-week period.
The fund has a beta of 1.08 and standard deviation of 27.25% for the trailing three-year period, which makes JHMM a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 665 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
John Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.
Vanguard MidCap ETF (VO) tracks CRSP US Mid Cap Index and the iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF (IJH) tracks S&P MidCap 400 Index. Vanguard MidCap ETF has $48.43 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF has $61.68 billion. VO has an expense ratio of 0.04% and IJH charges 0.05%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend.

2022-11-03 00:00:00+00:00,Zacks Earnings ESP: A Better Way to Find Earnings Surprises for Retail and Wholesale,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/zacks-earnings-esp%3A-a-better-way-to-find-earnings-surprises-for-retail-and-wholesale-29,,,"Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.
Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.
Now that we know how important earnings and earnings surprises are, it's time to show investors how to take advantage of these events to boost their returns by utilizing the Zacks Earnings ESP filter.
The Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained
The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information.
With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure. The system also utilizes our core Zacks Rank to provide a stronger system for identifying stocks that might beat their next quarterly earnings estimate and possibly see the stock price climb.
In fact, when we combined a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. Perhaps most importantly, using these parameters has helped produce 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
Most stocks, about 60%, fall into the #3 (Hold) category, and they are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. Stocks with a #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy) rating, or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market, with Strong Buy stocks outperforming more than any other rank.
Should You Consider Dollar Tree?
Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Dollar Tree (DLTR) earns a #3 (Hold) right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.24 a share, just 19 days from its upcoming earnings release on November 22, 2022.
DLTR has an Earnings ESP figure of +6.57%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.24 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16. Dollar Tree is one of a large database of stocks with positive ESPs. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
DLTR is part of a big group of Retail and Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Darden Restaurants (DRI) as well.
Darden Restaurants is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on December 16, 2022. DRI's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.49 a share 43 days from its next earnings release.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Darden Restaurants is $1.41, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of +5.62%.
DLTR and DRI's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.
Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported
Use the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading. Check it out here >>

2022-10-25 00:00:00+00:00,Should John Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF (JHMM) Be on Your Investing Radar?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-john-hancock-multifactor-mid-cap-etf-jhmm-be-on-your-investing-radar-4,,,"Launched on 09/28/2015, the John Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF (JHMM) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
The fund is sponsored by John Hancock. It has amassed assets over $2.43 billion, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
Why Mid Cap Blend
Mid cap companies have market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. They usually have higher growth prospects than large cap companies and are less volatile than small cap companies. Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.
Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.
Costs
When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.41%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.01%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
ETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 16.20% of the portfolio. Information Technology and Financials round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY) accounts for about 0.65% of total assets, followed by Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR) and Republic Services Inc (RSG).
The top 10 holdings account for about 4.54% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
JHMM seeks to match the performance of the John Hancock Dimensional Mid Cap Index before fees and expenses. The John Hancock Dimensional Mid Cap Index comprises of a subset of securities in the U.S. Universe issued by companies whose market capitalizations are between the 200th and 951st largest U.S. company.
The ETF has lost about -19.11% so far this year and is down about -17.88% in the last one year (as of 10/25/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $42.60 and $56.63.
The ETF has a beta of 1.08 and standard deviation of 27.21% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 665 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
John Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, JHMM is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.
The Vanguard MidCap ETF (VO) and the iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF (IJH) track a similar index. While Vanguard MidCap ETF has $47.09 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF has $58.93 billion. VO has an expense ratio of 0.04% and IJH charges 0.05%.
Bottom-Line
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.

2022-10-14 00:00:00+00:00,These 2 Dollar-Store Stocks Can Handle a Recession,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-2-dollar-store-stocks-can-handle-a-recession,,,"Although every new year generally starts off auspiciously from a sentiment perspective, 2022 immediately imposed a rude awakening for Wall Street. With global inflation skyrocketing off the bat, central banks had little choice but to respond with higher interest rates. Unfortunately, this whipsawing effect imposed significant pressures on the broader economy. Against this backdrop, investors should really consider the fundamental value of dollar-store stocks, specifically the tickers DLTR and DG.
Let’s set up the background for why dollar-store stocks find themselves in the spotlight. 2020's pandemic lockdowns resulted in severe economic penalties. To buttress a desperately spiraling situation, Washington then approved several rounds of fiscal and monetary stimulus programs. While these measures arguably saved the U.S. economy from destruction, they also contributed to an unprecedented expansion of the money supply.
Now, the Federal Reserve finds itself in the awkward situation of mitigating the mitigation. It’s also an unenviable circumstance, as the Fed committed to a hawkish monetary policy to reverse prior excesses. In short, the central bank will undo prior easy money policies in an attempt to stop inflation.
The tricky part for the Fed is that deflating the money supply could also end up deflating the economy. After all, higher interest rates correspond directly with higher borrowing costs. That hurts risk-on names which center on growth, not value derived from earnings.
However, the narrative could work out for dollar-store stocks. While a component of the broader retail sector, these entities provide critical goods at ultra-low prices. Such a business model will appeal to hard-hit consumers across the income spectrum, thus benefiting DLTR and DG.
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR)
An American multi-price-point chain of discount variety stores, Dollar Tree enjoys a wide addressable market. As of October 2022, Dollar Tree features 7,882 locations in the U.S., spanning 49 states and territories. Currently, Texas has the greatest number of stores, at 666, followed by California, with 642. Florida rounds out the top three with 587.
Fundamentally, DLTR represents one of the dollar-store stocks to consider for your portfolio because of its intense relevance. As earnings reports from popular discretionary retail powerhouses demonstrated, consumers are keeping their wallets shut. In turn, this dynamic resulted in sharp increases in inventory that impacted retailers must reduce through margin-killing discounts. However, not many alternatives exist for the essentials, like food and water. Therefore, DLTR appears enticing.
To be fair, Dollar Tree rates as a modestly overvalued investment at the present juncture, with investors paying more for earnings compared to other companies in the defensive retail space. However, faced with either two realities – evermore rising inflation or crippling deflation – DLTR should remain resilient. Again, people need the essentials.
Further, its latest financial trajectory provides encouraging context. In its company’s quarter ended July 2022, Dollar Tree posted net income of $360 million. This tally represented a year-over-year lift of nearly 28%. Moreover, the company’s diluted earnings per share on a trailing-12-months (TTM) basis stands at $6.97. This figure significantly exceeds the EPS of $5.83 posted in the Fiscal Year ended January 2022.
Is DLTR Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, DLTR stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on seven Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average DLTR price target is $169.10, implying 23.8% upside potential.
Dollar General (NYSE: DG)
Another popular name among discount dollar-store stocks, Dollar General features over 18,000 stores across 47 states. As with Dollar Tree, Texas commands the greatest number of Dollar General stores at 1,742. However, Georgia comes in second place at 1,021 stores, with Florida again rounding out the top three with 1,006.
Fundamentally, Dollar General should benefit from millennial migration trends. Even before the post-pandemic new normal, many young people left overpriced coastal metropolitan areas for more rural areas. Naturally, the wild price surges of the COVID-19 cycle helped accelerate this trend. Thus, Dollar General may be situated where the people will be, not necessarily where they are right now.
Financially, DG offers a fairly-valued investment relative to other dollar-store stocks. That should be expected, considering that demand for DG will likely rise as economic conditions become more challenging.
Further, Dollar General features excellent performance metrics in its income statement. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 14.6%, ranked better than 87% of its peers. Additionally, the company’s return on equity hit nearly 38%, far higher than the 8.9% median of the defensive retail industry. This stat indicates that Dollar General enjoys a high-quality business profile.
Is DG Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, DG stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average DG price target is $277.36, implying 17% upside potential.
Conclusion: A Relatively Easy Choice to Make
While it’s vital to steer away from absolute predictions on Wall Street, the reality is that on a relative scale, acquiring some shares of discount dollar-store stocks represents an easy choice. Most likely, the U.S. economy will face a “flation” problem, either inflation or deflation. Either way, consumers must purchase the essentials, and that’s really what makes both DLTR and DG viable.

2022-10-12 00:00:00+00:00,Dollar Tree (DLTR) Announces Hiring Plans for Holiday Season,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-dltr-announces-hiring-plans-for-holiday-season,,,"Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR revealed plans to recruit thousands of full and part-time associates for the upcoming holiday season through a Nationwide Hiring Event on Oct 19 from 11 am to 6 pm. The company will hire sales associates, customer service representatives, stockers, assistant store managers and store managers.

Hired employees will be offered competitive pay, a comprehensive rewards package and flexible schedules. Associates will also gain from DailyPay — a voluntary benefit wherein they can receive their earnings between traditional paydays.

Moving on, the company has an education assistance program called ValuED, which provides financial support and a wide range of development opportunities for upskilling. As part of this, full-time associates will be eligible for tuition discounts and reimbursement allowances for college degrees, GED programs and language courses.

Several other retailers have kicked off their hiring session for the holiday season through seasonal recruits that will improve customer shopping experiences. Retailers are increasingly focused on strengthening supply chains to avoid disruptions, which have been deterrents for a while.

We note that supermarket giant Walmart WMT is leaving no stone unturned to leverage the upcoming holiday season. WMT unveiled plans to deploy 40,000 workers at more than 250 Walmart and Sam’s Club distribution centers, fulfillment centers, and transportation offices earlier this month.

The new positions include seasonal store associates, customer service associates and 1,500 full-time truck drivers. Walmart employed 150,000 associates during the 2021 holiday season.

Macy’s M announced plans to recruit 41,000 associates ahead of the holiday shopping season. The new employees will be posted at Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, as well as its supply-chain locations and call centers.

This reflects a decline from last year when Macy’s hired 48,000 seasonal associates for the 2021 holiday season. M also noted that seasonal workers have the opportunity for seasonal workers to transit into permanent roles.

Kroger KR recently unveiled its hiring plan for the current holiday season. KR is likely to recruit 1,500 associates for full and part-time positions for their North Texas stores.

Vacancies are available in all departments, including retail, e-commerce, manufacturing, supply chain, merchandising, logistics, corporate, pharmacy and healthcare. Kroger hired more than 20,000 associates through its nationwide hiring event for the 2021 holiday sale.

Coming back to DLTR, all is not good in the hood for the company. Dollar Tree has been witnessing inflationary pressures and consumers’ shifts toward lower-margin consumable products. Its second-quarter fiscal 2022 results reflected adverse impacts of freight expenses, markdowns, shrink and unfavorable product mix.

As a result, the company announced plans to make competitive pricing investments in the Family Dollar chain to improve store productivity and profitability in the long run. Going forward, management expects gross and operating margins for the Family Dollar segment to remain pressured mainly due to the aforementioned pricing factor.

The company estimates the mix shift to consumables to hurt Family Dollar by 300 basis points (bps). Driven by the accelerated price investment, it expects the Family Dollar segment to report a break-even operating margin in the second half, down from its first-half margin of 2%.

Higher SG&A expenses from elevated payroll, increase in repairs and maintenance expenses, and store facility costs remain concerning. In second-quarter fiscal 2022, SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 100 bps to 24% due to higher repairs and maintenance costs, store payroll, stock compensation expenses, general insurance liability, utilities, and other inflationary pressures.

Consequently, Dollar Tree lowered the earnings per share view for fiscal 2022. Management envisions earnings of $7.10-$7.40 per share for fiscal 2022 compared with the prior stated $7.80-$8.20 per share. The company anticipates earnings of $1.05-$1.20 per share for the fiscal third quarter.

This video was recorded on Sept. 30, 2022.
Ron Gross: We've got earnings from Nike, thoughts on Amazon's new hardware, and a look at the future of America through the lens of 100 charts from its past. Motley Fool money starts now.
It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Ron Gross sitting in for Chris Hill. Joining me today are senior analysts, Maria Gallagher and Jason Moser. Fools, how you doing?
Jason Moser: Hey.
Maria Gallagher: Good. Thank you.
Ron Gross: Let me just say right at the top that our hearts go out to those impacted by Hurricane Ian and certainly our thoughts are with you all. Fools, it was another very volatile week for the markets as the quarter drew to a close with some mixed economic data, the coming earnings season is going to be, let's just say, interesting. Today, we're going to talk about new gadgets, mountains, and used cars but we begin by just doing it. On Friday, Nike reported sharply lower profits, highlighted by soaring inventory, markdowns, and higher operating costs. Maria, the stock sold off rather sharply on the news are the inventory and cost issues temporary or do we have a bigger problem here?
Maria Gallagher: I think it's not just Nike, I think this is a trend we're going to keep seeing, which is just really uncertainty on consumer spending and really an increase in inventory from a lot of these retailers as there's also uncertainty with supply chain issues. The overall quarter wasn't terrible for Nike. Their revenue was up four percent to 12.7 billion, their direct sales were up eight percent. Their brand digital sales were up 16 percent with 46 percent growth in EMEA. There was a big growth driver in footwear in America, which was up 17 percent. There was a decline in China that market as a whole was down about 16 percent, which isn't too surprising.
Gross margin was down about 220 basis points and they said that as a part of elevated freight and logistics costs, lower margins in some of their direct businesses due to higher markdowns, like you were saying Ron, they're working on liquidating their excess inventory with their inventories up 44 percent and their elevated transit inventories from some supply chain volatility. I don't think that's unique to Nike. I think that they have a brand name and consistent revenue growth even during hard times in recessionary periods. I think there'll be OK, but I do think that is a trend we're going to keep seeing with a lot of these retailers is really high inventory and a need for some markdowns to the upcoming months, especially going into the holiday season.
Ron Gross: They made some negative comments about Christmas. I was going to ask you, do you think that this is the first of many that we're going to see follow along with that sentiment?
Maria Gallagher: As I'll talk about a little bit later to with some other retailers that are doing that. I think they're trying to entice these consumers as much as they possibly can as they spent two years really growing faster and saying this is going to continue into perpetuity. They're now realizing, I think a couple of months ago, a lot of these retailers are saying, maybe it's not going to continue with that growth the way we saw it in 2020 and 2021.
Ron Gross: On Friday, CarMax lost a whopping quarter of its value as inflation and on economics concerned weighed on Americans demand for buying used cars and profits declined sharply. Jason, is this just a storm that CarMax is going to have to weather or is there something more troubling going on here?
Jason Moser: You're right. The stock got hammered on this report and I think it's a storm they're going to have to wether. This is a combination of missing expectations and a view that things are likely going to get worse before they get better from a macroeconomic perspective. There is vehicle affordability that is really a challenge there, which stems clearly from persistent broad inflation as they noted, climbing interest rates, low consumer confidence. This is just a lot of things coming at this business at once. It's not a business that is in parallel, the numbers weren't that bad. Revenue was $8.1 billion up two percent from the same quarter a year ago. Earnings per share really got hit hard though, $0.79 versus a $1.72 a year ago.
When you look at the metrics that matter for the company, total retail used units sold fell 6.4 percent, but gross profit per retail use unit was actually up a little bit there, close to a $100 per unit. That was nice. Average selling prices for used vehicles up 9.6 percent for the quarter and for the first six months up 18.8 percent. I tell you one thing that stood out to me even more so is, CarMax has this wholesale side of the business where they auction vehicles. Those prices were up 17 percent for the quarter and 32.8 percent for the first six months. Get costs really coming into play for this business. It's challenging for sure. It's not really been the best investment when you look out over the last five years, but they seem to do something very well. Maybe this is a point where prospective shareholders could get interested in the stock.
Ron Gross: On Thursday, Peloton announced it will begin selling its bikes, treadmills, and other products in Dick's Sporting Goods stores. Maria, Peloton's going to do something to turn this ship around. Is moving into retail the right move?
Maria Gallagher: It's going to be good. In some instances, it's going to raise awareness but I still think the price point for Pelotons is still sell high. The bikes are almost $1,500, the treadmills are almost $2,000 and at least for my family and we're going to Dick's or Modell's or a sporting goods store. You're not really going to purchase those big ticket items but I do think at least it's good for brand awareness there. It's going to be available in over 100 stores during this holiday season. Dick's has 700 stores, so there's potential for expansion down the line if it goes well. Like you're saying, they'd need to do something. This is after six quarters in a row of losses for Peloton. I think that's similar to Nike. We're just going to continue to see discounting to get consumer interests which do hurt profitability and brands like Nike and contrast, I think can withstand that, or I don't know that Peloton will be able to in the same way. It'll be interesting to see.
Ron Gross: I wanted to stick with fitness for a second Maria. On Thursday, Lululemon announced it was expanding the reach of Mirror, which is its at-home fitness device and it would make it a central component of its new paid membership program called Lululemon Studio. Members will pay $39 a month to have access to thousands of streaming and in-person workout options and receive other perks and discounts. I've been critical in the past of the 500 million Lulu paid for Mirror. The companies still hasn't told us if Mirror is even profitable. Do you like this move?
Maria Gallagher: I think that it's smart rate. I think expanding their fitness options is a good move, but I think that they should consider the route at Peloton went which was you had the app that was associated with the bike or the treadmill, but you could also do it independent of that as well, to just get more and more people to get into the ecosystem. Right now, what Lululemon is doing with the studio is you have to own a mirror to join it. You can now buy the mirror for just $795, which is a 47 percent discount. I think that it's safe to say that the acquisition isn't growing, maybe the way they hoped it would. There are Mirror plus Lululemon shoes the most detail we have is that that's going to be about five percent of their business in the next five years.
They had slashed the expectations for that business in 2021. I do think that it's a smart move. I think that part of this membership launch as it's partnering with popular fitness studios like Jog Pound, Pure Bar, and Rumble. They're going to have deals on both in-person classes and this through the studio. I think it's trying to bridge that gap between saying, you're just going to work out at home. You just want to go back to the studio here you have multiple options. If you have customers who have a lot of disposable income, this could be attractive to them.
Ron Gross: On Thursday Bed Bath & Beyond reported rather dismal results as the company tries to turn itself around. Jason, Bed Bath continues to struggle to turn the business as it tries to clear out excess inventory, shift its merchandise strategy again, and shore up its relationship with vendors. Are they doomed or do they have a shadow pulling with?
Jason Moser: Doomed is a strong word. I don't want to go there yet, but this is a company in turnaround mode. Obviously, it's always a very difficult thing, but it can be done. But for now, it does continue to hemorrhage Money as management works to right the ship and obviously very tough time. We'll see if CFO Gustavo or recent passing. This is now fully in interim leadership team, and I think that's one of the challenges that they have to really address. The number is dismal not anything to smile at. Sales of $1.4 billion down 28 percent, comps down 26 percent, digital sales down 22 percent, and that still remains about 40 percent of the overall business gross margin clocking in at 27.7 percent. This is a company that at least used to generate gross margins above 40 percent.
You can see where they've come in such a short period of time but there are some pockets of improvement. They're seeing some positive sales trends and seasonal categories that are bringing more national brands back into the business. They see opportunity on the Buy Buy Baby side of the business trying to get back to reinvigorating the registry and ultimately creating a relationship with the consumer that starts much earlier. You can't start much earlier than when you're born. Maybe there's some potential there. I think you certainly know when you have kids that register is pretty handy thing to have. They're making some progress on the loyalty program as well, 6.4 million members now that's up 30 percent. I wouldn't say doomed, but they've certainly got a lot of work to do on the clock is ticking.
Ron Gross: Coming up. We'll talk Amazon hardware and we'll do a little skiing and cruising. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money, Ron Gross sitting in for Chris Hill. As always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against them. Don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Earlier this week, Amazon held its fall hardware event where it unveiled some interesting new gadgets. Jason, a lot to unpack, but what's stood out to you?
Jason Moser: Yeah, a lot of interesting new gadgets is right. There's some of the stuff you just forget that it is out there at times but some pretty neat hardware, a couple of big new TVs with Alexa built-in, of course, a new fire cube, updated remote control, Ring camera. People probably forget that they own Ring. They've made an update to the Astro robot that includes pet detection. I don't know how many people are actually going to buy that Astro robot though, Ron. The one thing that stood out to me was the Halo Rise bedside sleep tracker. Enough for really a good reason. I don't really care about how I sleep, I just wake up in the morning and it was either a good night or a bad night but this thing sits by your bedside and it just stares at you and monitors your sleep. I'm not sure I can get on board with that, Ron.
Ron Gross: My Sleep Number bed claims subtract my sleep, but I'm not sure.
Jason Moser: There's a point where I need to be disconnected. Speaking of being connected, I think it speaks toward Amazon's bigger strategy. You're right, they shipped 11 and 1/2 percent of all US smart home devices in 2021, up 15 and 1/2 percent from the year before the runner-up, [Alphabet's] Google, six and 1/2 percent, Samsung and third at 5.8 percent. Amazon has a very clear lead in this space, and the other thing, they own that Eero mesh Internet system. I have one in my house here. They bought that and I think back in 2018. They're getting a lot of data from those Internet connections there. It speaks to this bigger, a philosophy that these devices help them sell more stuff. For them, it's not about making money on the devices, it's about using the devices in making more money from people buying things. It does seem like it's playing very well into that strategy.
Ron Gross: On Thursday, Vail Resorts reported better-than-expected results as the company continues to benefit from the weakening of the COVID pandemic, and it was perhaps the only stock on my monitor that was up for the day. Maria's results for the quarter and the guidance looked pretty good. What do you think?
Maria Gallagher: Yeah, Vail is a company that has a pretty clear vision and executes on it really well, last quarter had net income of 348 million. They announced a quarterly cash dividend of a dollar and 91 cents. For last year, their total lift revenue was up 21.7 percent. Their ski score revenue was up about 55 percent, lodging up 51 percent. Like you said, they're really benefiting from more people getting back to vacation. They are planning to make its largest ever investment in both properties and resorts for this upcoming season, they're investing 175 million in employees. A higher minimum wage, career and leadership differentials, and potential their new 800 newer replacement lifts. I think that that's going to be important to see how this season shakes out and if those are good investments for them. I will also say that something interesting, it just finalized its first strategic investment in a ski resort in Europe with Andermatt-Sedrun which is, I'm sorry I forgot that name, but it's in Central Switzerland. They have about 55 percent ownership. I think that has also a good growth potential for them. I was impressed.
Ron Gross: On Thursday, Cintas reported better-than-expected results and management raised its full-year guidance. Jason, strong report for the uniform and corporate apparel supplier, is this mostly about the strong labor market? If so, what happens if that starts to show some cracks?
Jason Moser: There, I think it plays a big role in our workforce. It holds a strong position in a relatively resilient market. That doesn't hurt, and they offer a strong value proposition to their customers in the face of scarce labor and rising costs. There probably is something to that present-day environment for them, but this has been a pretty decent place to park your money for a while. You look at the five-year chart on this stock, shares are up 188 percent. You stretch that out to 10 years, 985 percent total return on this thing. Bet you it flies under a lot of radars too, but the revenue, $2.17 billion, organic growth of 13.9 percent maintain gross margins, which was nice to see.
The uniform rental and facility services side of the business, that's the biggest part of the business. That revenue was $1.7 billion versus 1.51 billion a year ago, and organic revenue growth of 12.3 percent there. No worthy contributions from first aid, safety, fire sides of the business as well but all back to that raising of the annual revenue expectations that that certainly plays into it. It was just a neat quote, I saw on a call Todd Schneider, the CEO of the business. Only been CEO for a short time, but he's been with the company since 1989. He said, ""We don't think about our customers and quarters or fiscal years. We think about them over decades."" I think that really is a testament to the long-term thinking that this business that this leadership team takes and clearly is paying off.
Ron Gross: Cintas, one of those under the radar, not so sexy stories, but they get it done and then investors may want to take a look. I don't know, I haven't looked at the house cheap or not cheap this stock may be, but it's a company that puts up nice results year-in and year-out. The numbers don't lie. On Friday, Carnival reported quarterly results that seemed to indicate a continuing rebound in the business with a measure of adjusted cashflow coming in at a positive $300 million, and Maria, I know on the face of it, some of these numbers still look pretty good, pretty bad, I should say. Then the stock did fall sharply but there are some bright spots in the report. Is Carnival on the right track here?
Maria Gallagher: I was pretty impressed with some of its capacity numbers which I didn't think would be so close to 2019 levels. I feel like cruise ships are pretty specific environment that I thought would take longer to return to normal, but their occupancy was up 15 percent to 90 percent occupancy rate on August sailings. They're hoping to reach full capacity this upcoming quarter. They're booking volumes for future sailings continue to see some accelerated interest, especially since the company has relaxed a lot of COVID protocols in August. Some of them are credit, so they're still actually below that historical average and price, but they're definitely trending in the right direction.
Their revenue was up 80 percent and they are continuing to work on closing the gap to 2019. They're saying that they're going to expect occupancy to reach historic levels during 2023. Still a little bit, a little ways to go but they're expecting higher advertising expense to drive revenue. They're trying to really get people back, get people interested, and is one of the only companies I've seen recently that saying we're going to really go in more on advertising. I thought that was interesting. I'll be fascinated to see what advertising Carnival Cruises has in the next couple of months.
Ron Gross: Cruises have historically had to deal with the norovirus, that pesky stomach element that sometimes it goes through the ships and then of course, had to deal with COVID. My question to each of you is, have you been cruising before and would you cruise now? Jason you're up.
Jason Moser: I was just going to ask everybody around the table, who's been on a cruise? I grew up on the water down in Charleston, South Carolina. I grew up on boats. I love boats. Honestly, I have zero desire to go on a cruise like that though, and I'm not certain if I can say precisely why other than just I don't want to be around that many people on a ship in. I feel like you're going to get sick. I'm not even, like a germophobe. I just feel like there's no way you're not going to get sick on one of those ships. It's just not anything that has ever really attracted, but I know Mac Greer would take the other side of that argument. He loves those Disney cruises. He said some of the greatest stories to tell. I don't know, maybe I need to take a cruise one day.
Ron Gross: Maria, have you been on one?
Maria Gallagher: No, I can't swim and I know it's a boat, but the water scares me.
Ron Gross: I haven't been on one since I was 22 years old, quite some time ago. All right Fools. We'll you see a little bit later in this show. Up next, a conversation with NYU Stern School of Business professor my alma mater, Scott Galloway, on his new book, Adrift: America in 100 Charts. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ron Gross. Scott Galloway is a professor at NYU Stern School of Business and the author of several best-sellers, including The Algebra Of Happiness and The Four. The hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, [Meta's] Facebook, and Google. Earlier this week, Chris Hill caught up with Professor Galloway to talk about his new book, Adrift: America in 100 charts.
Chris Hill: I think the last time you and I talked, it was your book about happiness. This is a very different book. How did you get the idea for this one?
Scott Galloway: Well, I've been fascinated by charts and trying to communicate information with images and visuals. We've had an alphabet for 1,500 years, but we've been interpreting actions and taking instruction through images for tens of thousands, whether it's paintings on cave walls or trying to figure out when to plant the crops based on the height of the sun in the sky. We can process information communicated through visuals six to 60 times faster, and I've always over-invested and everything I've done in finding someone exceptionally creative to help display information visually. I always said with everything we put out a podcast.
Well, that's actually not true, no podcasts but a book, a video, I would say, can we say this with an image as opposed to words? We produced several thousand images across our body of work over the last decade, and I thought if you were to try and pick the 100 most illuminating or shocking or insightful and then group them or cluster them into themes that told a story. How would you do it? There's a narrative. It's basically the book is laid out a chart than a page of narrative, than another chart and tries to tell a story around A, some of our biggest problems, and then I save the last chapter for what I think there's some potential solutions.
Chris Hill: The process you just described reminds me a little bit of a documentary film maker who has, in some cases, 70, 80 hours of footage and tries to distill it down to maybe 90 minutes or two hours. How challenging was the process of getting it down to a 100 charts? Because certainly, if I was your publisher or your publicist, I would very much be focused on a nice round number, like 100.
Scott Galloway: It's definitely the phenomenon. If I had more time, I would have written you a shorter note. The hard part wasn't what to include, it was what not to include. We've literally have several thousand charts and I backwards integrated, and I said, what do I think are the biggest issues facing America and the people aren't or that are under-reported or if you will, many of them. Then which charts best Illuminate the issue, but the hardest part is finding that narrative and that arc. That story Arc that tells a story with them and then bringing it, trying to bring it all together. That's the hard part. The hard part is the clustering and assorting. You can find the ingredients but somebody really intelligent figured that out. Chocolate and peanut butter actually go really well together. So yeah, that was the hardest part but it's something. This was fun.
This stuff is fun. Writing a book is the hardest thing I do professionally, and they're supposedly a hormone that comes over women up right after childbirth that gives them amnesia. Otherwise, they would never have more kids because it's so painful and unpleasant, and I think there was a similar process with writing a book about halfway. This is my fourth book, about halfway through every book, you think, why the heck did I agree to do this again? Right now is the euphoria stage. You get to the end of book like never again, I get to speak to smart people like you. I get to have fun, people are nice to me on Twitter and LinkedIn, and all of a sudden I can feel that amnesia washing over me and already, we're like, well, what's the next one? We'll see.
Chris Hill: When I think about your first book, which is about Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google was that book, as you were writing this one, was that book, I don't want to say a NorthStar but was part of the process of putting this book together. Looking back at that first book about Big Tech and essentially saying, I want to update what I wrote before.
Scott Galloway: There was some similarities, but for example, in The Four my publisher didn't want charts, the conventional wisdom when you put charts in a book, it feels like a textbook and won't sell. We said no, and I think we have 30-50 charts in The Four. Just think sometimes it's just much more illuminating to show the dominance of these companies graphically. The difference, the major contrast though versus The Four is I started The Four is a love letter to these companies. They are the largest recruiter out of my class at Sterne. I have a decent amount of economic security because I've owned their stocks for a long time. I love their products, and then as I really dug into the research and marinated in the data around these companies. The book turned morphed into a cautionary tale. By the end of writing the book, I was just like cheating, it was like for a moment when you write a book, with the day finished the book, you feel like for a few minutes, you know more on that topic than anyone in the world. Then a few minutes later you don't because things change, but I felt like I was the kid who could see dead people.
That is, I thought these guys are scary people don't realize. If people don't remember when I wrote The Foreign 2017, the only debate about The Four was who's going to be president? Jeff Bezos or Sheryl Sandberg. The general assumption was Sheryl Sandberg was the lock on for governor of California and then going to be Bloomberg's running made and then be president, and we were just all so enamored with these companies including Mark Zuckerberg. I generally for a moment think, I'd like to think, I saw the externalities a little bit sooner than some other people just by looking at the data. This book, Adrift: American 100 Charts, I started out very pessimistic polarization, Failing Young Men, Income Inequality. There's just some Rise Of The Shareholder Class, Decline Of The Middle-class, but by the end of the book, I felt much more optimistic because I think one of the major messages of trying to get across in the book is the biggest problems we're facing are of our own making and we can absolutely unmake them. I have a chapter in the book called The World We Made, and if you look at the things we have faced out, if you look at the things we have pushed back on, if you look at the things and really bad ideas that we have defeated, there's nothing we're facing now that we can't defeat.
There's this great photojournalist. I think her name is Maria Amallo. She's colorizing World War II photographs, and there's this wonderful photograph of land and craft and allied land and craft. That's just front skaters was dropped, and there are a couple of dozen young men. Their average age was 26 or average wage was $800 a month after inflation, weighting toward Omaha beach. Two of three of those men would not leave that beach alive and I imagine them turning around and somehow through some space and time lokey like metaverse, warm hole can see what's going on in our lives, and oh my gosh, we're facing income inequality, we're facing polarization in our media. Then going, I can't imagine they wouldn't say, you can't fix that. Look what's waiting for me on the beach.
Look what I'm about to sacrifice and overcome, and whether it's coming up with vaccines that saved one to two million American lives by most estimates, no one's waiting in line for Russian or Chinese vaccines. Whether it's 50 percent of global philanthropy is sponsored by American organizations, and we've taken world poverty down. The World Health Organization in 1970 said, let's commit to a cutting in half in 40 years. They cut it in half in 20 years, and then they cut it in half again. So in most of this has been American lead, so I actually came out of this book, started down and came at, started at half-empty, started at half-full. Come out of the book actually quite optimistic about America and our ability to face down these challenges.
Chris Hill: I was going to say you end this book on a very hopeful note. For anyone who might be thrown off by the word Adrift in the title. You end the book was, I think a great deal of optimism, and as you touched on recommendations for specific remedies, things like simplifying the tax code. The one that really caught my attention was rebranding nuclear. I'd love to have you share a little bit more about this because I think there's, among other things, relies on your expertise as a professor of marketing, but when I was reading that, I thought yeah, nuclear power really could use rebrand.
Scott Galloway: Well, think about Hollywood and how it portrays electric vehicles or wind and solar. These are generally like the ultimate boyfriend and a Hallmark Channel movie is a guy who owns a solar firm or installed solar panels, or our heroes are innovators coming up with electric vehicles. Think about Hollywood and nuclear power. Start with Monte Burns on The Simpsons, the evil guy owns the nuclear power plant or there's that incredible DOCU, trauma, chernobyl, or there's the China's syndrome with Jack Lemmon where we're going to burn a hole through. Hollywood has done a great job of basically like Nazis than South African Sterne apartheid, there was found a bad guy than the Taliban and nuclear. Nuclear is the corporate bad guy, maybe only second to tobacco executives. If you look at, and I'm not an expert on energy, but it strikes me that if you look at the fact that one power plant or one reactor can power a city the size of Philadelphia, when you look at the actual number of fatalities stemming from 50 or 60 years of nuclear.
When you look at the fact that we are arguably funding a war in Ukraine with fossil fuel dependence. It just strikes me and then you also quite frankly, just look at the relative efficiency or inefficiency of some of the cleaner, sexier technologies, wind and solar, just how much of it we'd have to build to replace fossil at the rate we want. I would argue that most data leads you to any serious conversation around the type of pace and cadence we need to establish to turn back climate change has to involve a sober conversation around nuclear, and that's not to say there are risks. That's not to say there aren't externalities, but the emissions, I think the total nuclear fuel spent from US nuclear power plants could be put in some encasing six feet high and cover a soccer field.
Now it's dangerous stuff and you got to be really careful with it, but that's nothing I believe, compared to the emissions of most other, especially fossil fuels. So in some very bright people including Bill Gates and some people I really respect are saying, yeah, let's start calling it elemental energy because there's some interesting conversation now around whether we put up plans to mothball some plants in California, Germany is thinking maybe they don't unplug their plans, but I think nuclear and the advances in nuclear are really interesting. Even some of this new technology is where you can have a mini plant the size of a Winnebago, that can power a fairly sizable town, or even something the size of a backpack that can power a neighbourhood. I'm actually really excited about nuclear. I think it offers a solution. Sometimes, the most obvious solutions are right in front of you.
Chris Hill: Bill Gates is someone you referenced an article you wrote recently for the Atlantic entitled Americas False Idols. Tech entrepreneurs and one of the things that caught my attention in the article was the number of times a company founder lists his name in the S1 filing, which seems like it might be a new exercise for investors to just go through the S1 and see how many times someone like Adam Neumann lists himself in WeWork IPO paperwork. I am curious though, Scott, if you look at the follow-on leaders of companies differently, if you look at someone like Tim Cook, differently than Steve Jobs or Andy Jassy, different from Jeff Bezos because I don't know, they don't have everything that comes with being a founder attached to them and instead, they are an operator.
Scott Galloway: There's a lot there. The Dollar Tree of innovators, and by the way, if I wrote that article again, I probably wouldn't include Bill Gates in that imagery because actually Bill Gates is doing really good work and have a lot of admiration for him. I think we could do worse than have the wealthiest people in the world with the foci as Bill Gates, but anyways, having said that the charismatic storyteller leader has been a key component of any of these companies that have accelerated from zero to half-a-trillion dollars or more. That is their ability to articulate an incredible vision, whether it's Steve Jobs in showmanship or Jeff Bezos, 1997 investment ladder where you read the thing and you just want to buy shares, or Adam Neumann, who I've been on stage interviewing before, who is just incredibly charismatic. You just want to be around him and a part of what he's building. That ability, that competence of a CEO to articulate a really compelling vision such that they attract cheap capital and basically, to use another World War II reference to overwhelm the enemy with just brute strength.
That's what capital is. Typically, the company in any sector that has access to the most capital, the cheapest capital, that's the odds-on favorite to win. So a really compelling CEO who can raise a lot of capital well ahead of the curve and pull the future forward with that capital to combine amazing things, plans, property, IP, people, wins. What's unusual about you brought up Tim Cook, he's an exception, and Tim Cook has added more shareholder value than any individual in history, and people might say what Steve Jobs did taking a company from zero. Three hundred billion was more difficult, but nobody has taken a company from 300 billion to 2.5 trillion. Tim Cook has added $2.2 trillion in shareholder value and no one has ever done that, accomplish that. He's a supply chain guy, and I don't know if it says as much about the difference in CEOs because I still think at the end of the day, they are spokespeople. When you listen to Tim Cook in his own way, he just wreaks credibility and integrity and the performance is just so outstanding.
I think the jury is still out on Andy Jassy. I don't know if he brings the same level of compelling vision storytelling as Jeff Bezos. I think that's still TBD, but I think there's Elon Musk weaponizing or leveraging whatever the term is, Twitter with 90 million followers and as a result, spans almost zero on traditional marketing and General Motors has to spend two billion. The storytelling visionary, charismatic CEO has become the criteria for a CEO. They become our new heroes. We have an Idiology of dollar and specifically tech CEOs every third year. Times person of the year just picks the richest tech person, and I think it's a phenomena. Talking about the book, the Dollar Tree and innovators is nations become wealthier and more educated. The church attendance and reliance on a superman goes down, but we need new idols. We need to look to people who can answer the unanswerable and technology is the closest thing we have to mysticism or magic or spirituality because my iPhone going to do amazing things. I have no idea how it works, so Steve Jobs is the information age, Jesus Christ and I would argue Elon Musk is taken that mantle, and it leads to some very unhealthy places.
These firms aren't regulated the same way other firms are regulated and these individuals are given a wider birth than any leaders in history. Unfortunately, I think it wallpapers over things such as teen depression, or organizing insurrection, and my last point, I'll stop this word Sal. There's an illusion of complexity that's fomented by these companies that these are big problems we can figure out and yet, you remove one account from Twitter and 30-60 percent a lot misinformation goes away in one night. Amazon gets critic bombed on their lord of the rings series where people are showing up in making incendiary comments and fake comments. They close the common section down. They use AI, they enforce identity, they posted 48 hours later in the comments are legitimate and have more veracity, so they figured it out in 48 hours, but Meta and Google throw up their arms and say these problems are too big. No, they're not. We're not talking about around with a possible we're talking about the realm of the profitable, so they create this illusion of complexity to try and stave off what are fairly obvious solutions and actions they should take.
Chris Hill: The book is Adrift: America in 100 charts. It is out now and available wherever you find books or pick up a copy. Scott Galloway, always great talking to you. Thanks so much for being here.

2022-10-06 00:00:00+00:00,"Here is What to Know Beyond Why Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR) is a Trending Stock",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/here-is-what-to-know-beyond-why-dollar-tree-inc.-dltr-is-a-trending-stock,,,"Dollar Tree (DLTR) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this discount retailer have returned -0.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.5% change. The Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, to which Dollar Tree belongs, has lost 3.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Dollar Tree is expected to post earnings of $1.16 per share, indicating a change of +20.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.27 points to a change of +25.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.06 indicates a change of +10.8% from what Dollar Tree is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.3%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Dollar Tree.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
In the case of Dollar Tree, the consensus sales estimate of $6.83 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6.5%. The $28.01 billion and $29.69 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.5% and +6%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Dollar Tree reported revenues of $6.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. EPS of $1.60 for the same period compares with $1.23 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.78 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.28%. The EPS surprise was +1.27%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Dollar Tree is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Dollar Tree. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Coming into today, shares of the discount retailer had gained 3.71% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector lost 6.55%, while the S&P 500 lost 6.15%.
Investors will be hoping for strength from Dollar Tree as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Dollar Tree is projected to report earnings of $1.16 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 20.83%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $6.83 billion, up 6.45% from the year-ago period.
For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.27 per share and revenue of $28.01 billion, which would represent changes of +25.34% and +6.46%, respectively, from the prior year.
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Dollar Tree. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.
The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.01% lower within the past month. Dollar Tree is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).
Investors should also note Dollar Tree's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 19.47. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 21.32, so we one might conclude that Dollar Tree is trading at a discount comparatively.
Also, we should mention that DLTR has a PEG ratio of 1.23. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Retail - Discount Stores industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.94 as of yesterday's close.
The Retail - Discount Stores industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 218, which puts it in the bottom 14% of all 250+ industries.

2022-09-29 00:00:00+00:00,Here's How Levi Strauss (LEVI) Looks Just Ahead of Q3 Earnings,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-how-levi-strauss-levi-looks-just-ahead-of-q3-earnings,,,"Levi Strauss & Co. LEVI is likely to register top-line growth year over year when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings on Oct 6. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $1,624 million, which indicates an improvement of about 7.9% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally.

However, the bottom line is likely to decrease from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading. Although the consensus estimate for quarterly earnings has been stable over the past 30 days at 37 cents, the same suggests a plunge of 22.9% from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s actuals.

A glimpse of LEVI’s performance over the trailing four quarters shows that it delivered an earnings surprise of 16.1%, on average. In the last reported quarter, Levi Strauss’ earnings beat the consensus mark by 26.1%.
Key Factors to Note
Levi Strauss is benefiting from its robust omnichannel initiatives and brand strength. LEVI continuously strengthens its omnichannel capabilities, including Buy Online, Pick-up In Store, line-queuing, same-day delivery, mobile checkout and return capabilities comprising contactless returns. Gains from e-commerce, direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels might have boosted LEVI’s top-line performance in the fiscal third quarter. Also, demand across a diversified portfolio, strategic price increases and the launch of innovative products are likely to have benefited Levi Strauss’ top line.

The aforementioned factors buoy investors’ optimism on the stock. However, the challenging economic backdrop, including the supply-chain bottlenecks and inflationary pressures, remains a concern. On its lastearnings call management had expected deleveraged SG&A expenses for the fiscal third quarter. These factors might have hurt LEVI’s bottom line in the quarter under review.
What the Zacks Model Unveils
Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Levi Strauss this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Levi Strauss has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, making surprise prediction difficult.
Stocks With Favorable Combination
Here are three companies worth considering as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this season:

Ulta Beauty ULTA currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.22% and a Zacks Rank #1. It is likely to register a bottom-line improvement year over year when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings per share of $4.06 suggests an improvement of 3.1% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals.
