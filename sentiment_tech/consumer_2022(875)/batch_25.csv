2022-08-22 00:00:00+00:00,Buy This Monster Stock Before It Pops,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-this-monster-stock-before-it-pops,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) seems to be having a rough time adjusting to changing consumer behavior. Sales boomed for the online auction and e-commerce business as billions of people looked to avoid shopping in person during the early days of the pandemic. Now that vaccinations against COVID-19 have gained momentum and governments have eased business restrictions, people are prioritizing away-from-home activities they missed out on.
Unfortunately, that's been a headwind for eBay. As a result, the stock is down nearly 40% off its all-time high in 2021. That said, the market pessimism could be an excellent opportunity for long-term investors to buy shares of eBay.
eBay runs a profitable business
One of my favorite aspects of eBay is its asset-lite business model. It does not own any of the inventory for sale on its platform. Instead, it focuses on bringing buyers and sellers together to transact. eBay earns its revenue by taking a percentage of those aforementioned transactions. One other critical thing eBay does not do is fulfillment. It leaves shipping and handling up to buyers and sellers, avoiding a capital-intensive service altogether.
EBAY Operating Margin (Annual) data by YCharts
As noted in the chart above, by dodging expensive and risky endeavors, eBay has grown its operating profit margin from 20.25% in 2012 to 28.05% in 2021. eBay's revenue and earnings have been more volatile over that same time due to acquisitions and divestitures. Still, eBay has demonstrated skill in those corporate maneuvers as earnings per share have increased at a compound annual rate of 23.6% in the last decade.
In the near term, eBay has two significant themes playing out. The economic reopening is taking shoppers away from its platform and into brick-and-mortar stores. Gross merchandise value, which measures the total value of transactions on eBay's platform, has fallen for five consecutive quarters after peaking in the first quarter of 2021. This trend is primarily to blame for eBay's stock falling 40% off its high.
The second significant development at eBay is its concerted effort to raise transaction fees, or the percentage it takes from all sales on the platform. That metric has risen from 10.3% in the first quarter of 2021 to 12.4% in the second quarter of 2022. On average, eBay is taking an incremental $2 million in fees on every $100 million in sales on the platform. Overall, eBay earned $2.3 billion in fees on gross merchandise sales of $18.5 billion in its quarter ended in June. Still, it has room to increase the take rate higher, as one of its rivals, Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY), earned a rate of 19.3% in its most recent quarter.
Notably, the latter development is good news for investors from a financial standpoint. But the more recent shift to brick-and-mortar stores shouldn't make eBay investors flee, as the long-run trend is in favor of more shopping happening online. According to Statista, the percentage of online shopping in the U.S. is forecast to increase to 22% in 2025 from 14% in 2020.
eBay's stock is arguably cheap
EBAY PS Ratio data by YCharts
Meanwhile, the market's reaction to eBay's short-term headwind has its stock price down near the lowest levels its been at in the last five years. The price to sales ratio of 2.9 is less than half its peak of over 6. Investors buying now would be paying less than half per dollar of sales that eBay delivers compared to its peak. It might be a good idea for long-term investors to buy eBay stock now, while the broader market's pessimism remains and before the stock pops back up to its regular levels.

2022-08-22 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: eBay or Etsy?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-ebay-or-etsy-0,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) and Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) stocks both seem like relative bargains today. Sure, the e-commerce platforms have seen their growth rates slow compared to previous phases of the pandemic. And Wall Street is worried about more weak results ahead if economic growth rates stumble.
But their share price movements don't seem to reflect major strengths in the businesses such as improving profitability and the prospect for gushing cash returns.
With that big picture in mind, let's take a look at which stock might make the better buy for investors seeking exposure to this attractive niche in the e-commerce industry.
Financial strength goes to eBay
Both companies have an asset-light operating model that shifts many of the costs and risks of retailing onto sellers. Etsy doesn't maintain huge inventory levels, for example, or a massive shipping supply chain. That's a big reason why the company's operating profit margin is nearly 16% of sales, compared to just 4% for a more vertically integrated retailer like Walmart.
Yet eBay stock should be your preference if you're going strictly on financial strength. The company routinely turns over 25% of sales into operating profit, making it one of the most efficient businesses in the space.
EBAY Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts
Those margins have declined since the pandemic threat faded, but the bigger picture is bright on this score. eBay is adding more value to its platform for sellers, allowing it to charge higher fees. And its new push into advertising and payment processing will lift margins higher over time.
Cash-focused investors will also love eBay for its ability to generate free cash flow, much of which is paid out as dividends and stock buybacks.
Growth potential goes to Etsy
An investor who prizes growth might find more reasons to buy Etsy today. While eBay has shed buyers for several consecutive quarters, Etsy's growth hangover has been much easier on the business. The buyer pool has risen by about 4% over the first half of 2022, compared to a 12% decline at eBay. ""Etsy has maintained most of our pandemic gains,"" CEO Josh Silverman said in a late July statement.
Etsy is hoping to further consolidate those gains over the next few quarters by improving the shopping experience. Additions like video-based buyer reviews will help, and so will its revamped search functionality, which uses artificial intelligence to deliver personalized results for people browsing the site.
eBay has some attractive growth targets, too, including advertising and payments processing. The marketplace has proven it can win share in high-growth niches like rare sneakers and collectible watches. Yet it is easy to see how Etsy could double its current annual sales footprint more quickly than eBay could.
The better deal
Etsy's stock has also been hit harder by the 2022 market downturn, removing some of the risk associated with buying into the growth-focused business. Sure, at over seven times sales you are paying a big premium to purchase its stock compared to eBay's price-to-sales ratio of below 3. But that valuation has come down from nearly 20 in earlier phases of the pandemic.
Etsy stock could move back toward that higher valuation level if the company maintains its growth while boosting profitability toward eBay's industry-leading rate. While the safer choice might be the globally established eBay, long-term investors seeking faster growth should take a closer look at Etsy right now.

This video was recorded on August 15, 2022.
Chris Hill: It's a big week for retail, but before that, things just got tougher for Peloton. Motley Fool money starts now. I'm Chris Hill and I am joined by Motley Fool Senior Analyst, Jim Gillies. Happy Monday. Thanks for being here.
Jim Gillies: Thanks for inviting me, Chris.
Chris Hill: But let's start with Peloton, which is [laughs] cutting nearly 800 jobs, closing some amount of its locations. Along with these moves, Peloton is raising prices on some of its equipment. I'll just spot you up with the most illuminating comment from CEO Barry McCarthy, who said in a memo to employees, ""We have to make our revenues stop shrinking and start growing again, cash is oxygen, oxygen is life."" I don't disagree with that, Jim, but when you and I were chatting earlier today, I said to you, when I first saw this story, the immediate thought I had was this seems a panic move.
Jim Gillies: You're going to get me in trouble, Chris.
Chris Hill: It's one of those shows, good.
Jim Gillies: [laughs] Peloton. It's a panic move and yes, he's entirely correct of everything he said. Might've been nice if the founder, former management, who ran this truck into the dirt might've actually, I don't know, thought about that once or twice before, as I said, running this truck into the dirt. Where's my notes for this here? This is a company that has in the most recent balance sheet, I think, they're going to report their fourth-quarter fiscal earnings, I think they have a June fiscal year, so they're reporting late August if last year's anything to go on. Most recent balance sheet, $1.4 billion in inventory moldering on the balance sheet, $1.9 billion in cash burned in the first three quarters of the present fiscal year. Nice of the CEO to tell us that cash is oxygen after starving the business. Not his fault, but the term management suite starve the business.
This is a business where the CFO, I believe last November, the now former CFO on the conference call. No, we don't need to raise capital and I think eight days later they raise capital. It's the company with $880 million in cash on the balance sheet, roughly the same amount of the debt on their balance sheet. Now, fortunately for Peloton, the debt on the balance sheet is all convertible. Debt doesn't convert, I believe until 2026. The convert price is well over $100, there's no danger of this. When we get there, there's certainly no danger of this company needing to put shares. They'll have to pay that back. But hey, you know what? If the fire is not out by then it won't matter. I don't know what credit line avail of it. This is a company, that's probably going to have to raise capital again, frankly, in the next quarter or two because they're burning $600 million a quarter for the last three or four quarters in a row.
They have got negative product gross margin, which I guess makes sense why they're saying, hey, we're going to raise prices, might be nice to not lose money on every single bike and treadmill they put out the door. Product revenue was down 40% year over year, 25% quarter over quarter, Q2 to Q3. Put into perspective that $1.4 billion in inventory on the books, that's up from $937 million at the start of this fiscal year. It's up from $245 million at the end of fiscal 2020. This is a company that is inventory bloated themselves to frankly near death. I am reminded when I see what the CEO said. Again, it's not his fault, he came in from I believe Spotify and I think he's put Pandora before that, which of course was, I believe purchased by Spotify or maybe that was Sirius anyway, the man has some.
Chris Hill: He was at Netflix in one point.
Jim Gillies: I'm reading his bio here off Cap IQ. I think his most recent gig, no, I don't really know. You said Netflix as a CFO, I think from '99 to 2010, it says here, more recently he was at Spotify. He does have financial chops. That's good, because that's the guy who's going to understand, hey, we're in trouble. I am concerned he's come along a little too late and when something like this comes along, I'm reminded of as I'm often reminded in situations like this by, I quote from Warren Buffett or uncle Warren E. Buffett. The quote is, ""When a management team with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact."" The economics for Peloton went over the cliff real fast. Like I said, in their most recent quarter, they burned over $700 million. They've got $800 million in cash. Do you really want to be raising? I mentioned that prior capital raise that the CFO apparently didn't even have a week's view into her business at the time, or eight days, sorry.
They raise capital, I believe in the lower early 40s, dollar per share. Stock's in the low teens right now, the more you have to raise capital via equity means, the more you're going to dilute present shareholders. For those who have held through a 90% drop, and I'm sorry, I'm so dour out of the gate, you fed me the disaster going here, we'll be better in a bit. If they do have to raise capital and I hope they don't for shareholders who still own this thing, but I'm not seeing a lot of turnaround potential. Just to go back to one more point, when they said, that we need to raise prices, they are going to raise prices. They're raising prices on their bikes by 500 bucks a bike, and I think it's 800 bucks per unit by the treadmill. But remember how I mentioned they had negative gross margin, they're moving products just to get it at the door the last three quarters. It's already not selling and now you're raising the price, good luck. I don't have a lot sunnier disposition to say here. I'm afraid.
Chris Hill: Well, I didn't ask you to come on just for your sunny disposition.
Jim Gillies: [laughs] Good.
Chris Hill: But before we move on to retail though, what would you ask McCarthy on the conference call? Assuming they come out with a report that does not indicate some radical reversal of fortune, what is the question you would ask? Would it be around a capital raise? Because when you just run the numbers, it's hard to imagine they don't get money somehow somewhere.
Jim Gillies: They have to get money somehow somewhere. I have a difficult time believing. Belief is always a terrible word to use with investing, because I can believe a great many things, but cash doesn't lie. This is a company that burned about $735 million in the most recent quarter, about $550 million in the quarter before that, about $645 million in the quarter before that. Like I said, they've got about $880 million cash on the books. Pretty much their value that, where is your cash coming from, Barry? Where is your next capital coming from? Because I think this is a business that you have to demonstrate you're going to survive the next year.
Then you can talk about growth and maybe adding to those subscriptions. The subscriptions are actually monetizing fairly well. People who loved their Pelotons, the number of fitness sessions after spiking during the pandemic with a reopening world, the degradation there has trailed off and they look they're doing fairly decently. It's a small sample set, so I don't want to draw any great conclusions there, but there's some optimism. To get to be optimistic in three years and have this turnaround and they talk very directly and which I like. On the most recent shareholder letter, the third-quarter shareholder letter, although that's a pet peeve of mine as well, that they talk about, hey, turnarounds are hard, we're in a turnaround now.
Chris Hill: Good, you seem to have a reasonable appreciation of where you are in the pecking order at this point, my questions would circle around, what is your fire suppression plan for the next year? Once the fire is out, then we can talk about your turnaround because how especially heading into a recession. Assuming we have a recession, I have some thoughts on that as well, but assuming that the popular opinion of we're heading into a recession is in fact true. Jacking a price on a souped-up treadmill that I have to pay 60 bucks a month for to get a subscription. It's probably not going to clear the books of that bloated inventory.
Chris Hill: Let's move on to retail then because it's a big week.
Jim Gillies: Now that I've just killed it.
Chris Hill: It's a big week for retail. We've got the earnings reports coming later in the week from Walmart, Target, Home Depot. I don't remember big retail being as weird as it is right now and when I say weird, I'm referring to the fact that in general, the major retailers tend to travel in a pack. The fortunes of one tend to reflect the fortunes of another. This is certainly the case for years now with Home Depot and Lowe's where they report earnings one right after the other and whatever. It's much more newsworthy if they don't have similar results than if they do. But at the moment, in part because of what we got three months prior from Walmart and Target with their inventory debacle, I don't have a great sense of the retail landscape, which is why I'm looking forward to this week because I feel like we're going to get some more clues into things like inventory controls, back-to-school shopping, and possibly even the earliest of indications around year-end holidays. When you step back and look at retail, does anything standout to you in particular?
Jim Gillies: We certainly got that negative surprise, negative reporting from Walmart and Target last go-round. Neither of those companies terribly excite me. They are certainly bellwethers and we should pay attention to them. It wasn't just Walmart and Target of course, even going down the quality chain to guys like Big Lots or whatever, it was pretty ugly across the spectrum. Because yeah, inflation seems to have caught them flat-footed so everybody had their inventory spike, inventory spiked because in part or I know a lot of their expenses also got quashed because the higher-cost inventory is now moving through your system. Like I said, as an investor, I'm not real interested in these large specialty, non-differentiated, names. The one I love to watch and love to follow is, which you didn't mention, maybe I'll hit that before we get over to the home improvement folks, is Costco. They have a bit of a different reporting schedule. I think they report third week of September because I believe they're on a June or September fiscal year. I think Costco is hitting on all cylinders. Every time I walk into Costco and walk out of Costco having dropped 250 bucks on an order that I plan to be under 50, I'm just like man, I don't own enough Costco.
The really interesting thing to me about Costco is for years, a lot of people would talk about how Costco passed on so much. Basically, you were buying most goods close to cost because they were making up all their profits essentially on selling memberships. For a time that was true, about 75% of operating profit over I was just looking at this last week. The first half of the last decade, about three-quarters of their operating profit was subscriptions, was memberships. Then it fell to 70%. And then it fell to 65% and in the most recent year, it was 57%. Costco is not only growing and doing well in operating profit, I think, is up 10 or 11% annualized over the past decade, perfectly acceptable. But they've also started to actually make a little bit more profit while keeping that hotdog at $1.50. My favorite retailer, both as an investment as well as just on a personal level, is absolutely Costco. A close second is another one you mentioned though, which is Home Depot and Home Depot and Lowe's. Yes, you're right, they walk lockstep.
I like Home Depot because well, first off, they decided about a decade ago that they were done breakneck expansion and they have gone to a couple of stores a year, opened a few retrofitted. But they've really turned that company into running it for cash and you just have to look at how the dividend has moved has skyrocketed up over the last few years, as well as the share repurchase. When they run that business for cash, all of a sudden they are returning it, all of it to people. I'm remembering the Bob Nardelli days back in the late 2000s. When he was just ruining that company because he wanted to apply GE earnings metrics or whatever and since his ouster, it's just done so much better and also too, I hold them as semi-Amazon proof because you're probably not buying a couple of thousand square feet of drywall from Amazon Prime and having it delivered, I imagine you're still going through the Home Depots.
Chris Hill: Am I wrong to assume that out of both Home Depot and Lowe's, we're going to get some color around presumably the benefit of commodity prices coming down?
Jim Gillies: Absolutely.
Chris Hill: That has to help them, all you have to do is look at the cost of lumber in 2022 and that's got to be accretive for them.
Jim Gillies: I think so. Now my question is going to be, I don't know the exact number, so I'm going to make them up.
Chris Hill: Fantastic.
Jim Gillies: Let's just say a little bit it, because it's it's more about presenting a point. Let's say lumber crisis have come down 50% has Home Depot past all that 50% to their buyers? Has Lowe's passed all that 50%, have they passed 30% back to, I'm reminded here, here in the Great White North, we just raised interest rates about a month ago, we went up a full percentage point. The Bank of Canada raised it by 100 basis points and that day I got an email from my local credit union talking about the higher interest rates they were paying on short-term deposits, certainly on three months to five years. Miraculously Chris, they went up between 10 and 40 basis points.
Chris Hill: Did they pass all those savings onto you?
Jim Gillies: Funny thing, isn't it? I'm wondering if Home Depot and Lowe's and I'm wondering if they've passed all those savings onto you. I'm willing to bet they haven't. Of course, Home Depot, we are emerging from pandemic closures. Those are further and further in the rearview. Thankfully. But people spend a lot of time on their houses because they had nothing else to do for almost two years. People spend a lot of time and money on their houses. I wonder what if that's going to carry over or people have gotten used to continued cocooning. How many companies have gone to a more hybrid work model so there's more people working from home on a regular basis. Someone like me has been doing it for 20 years. It's irrelevant, but for folks who have been doing it for maybe two years and now have the option to work from home three days a week or what have you maybe they want some more creature comforts than Home Depot and Lowe's can provide. I'm a lot more optimistic about those than I'm about the Walmart and the Target.
Chris Hill: Jim Gillies, it always great talking to you. Thanks for being here.
Jim Gillies: Thank you.
Chris Hill: Shopify is one company tied to retail that's tapping the brakes on its growth. But some companies are hitting the gas pedal. Ricky Mulvey and Sanmeet Deo look at a few businesses playing offense in a tough environment.
Ricky Mulvey: You're in a recession, we're not in a recession. Today we're looking at some of the companies playing offense in a challenging environment. Joining us now is Motley Fool Senior Analyst, Sanmeet Deo. Good to see you, Sanmeet.
Sanmeet Deo: Good to see you, Ricky.
Ricky Mulvey: Playing offense is a lot easier when the market is raging upward. That's what Shopify did during COVID and now, some of those companies are feeling a little bit of a hangover.
Sanmeet Deo: Tobi Lütke wrote in a companywide memo to Shopify, ""We bet that the channel mix, the share of dollars that traveled through e-commerce rather than physical retail would permanently leap ahead by five or even 10 years. We couldn't know for sure at the time, but we knew that if there was a chance that this was true, we would have to expand the company to match."" It's now clear that bet didn't pay off.""
Ricky Mulvey: It's this idea that you can go on offense when your stock price is soaring, upward, interest rates are low, but then it becomes a lot more difficult when you're in a more challenging market environment and then Tobi was very open in saying that we made these assumptions about the e-commerce market and adoption in that just didn't play out. Is that fundamentally what changed for Shopify?
Sanmeet Deo: It's interesting because they made this big strategic bet, like he said, and one of their biggest mistake and one of the mistakes a lot of companies have made during the pandemic that was at its industry growth to the extent for a long period of time and possibly even be a permanent shift and so they grew their headcount expenses a scale up to kind of anticipate that growth. Of course, they didn't take into consideration the effects on e-commerce, Shopify here, from a reopening of the economy and shifting consumer shopping habits once that occurs. This ultimately lead to a rapid ascent expense growth followed by slowing revenue and decline in margins. Now the company has got to play defense, laying off staff, cutting operating expenses to meet those lower revenue levels. While investors should be happy, Shopify is acknowledging this mistake and rightsizing. Big problem I see is a company may need to be more aggressive with implementing strategies to grow revenues and gross profits. But because of what's happened they're playing defense and catching back up.
Ricky Mulvey: In your view, are they playing smart defense?
Sanmeet Deo: It's interesting because I read an interesting take about how their take rates are much lower than the competitors of Amazon, eBay. It's almost like when I read this analysis, they're almost under earning and maybe it's time to close that gap and earn more and take more offense because you can only cut expenses for so long until you really need to ramp that revenue growth.
Ricky Mulvey: Let's talk about some of the companies going on offense right now. That's not just an idea, that's a good idea in and of itself. But when liquidity dries up, the market's down relative to all-time highs. That's when some companies are really able to grab market share. Any companies you follow that you see going on offense right now.
Sanmeet Deo: One company comes to mind is Axon. They make Tasers and body cameras. CEO Rick Smith, recently told The Wall Street Journal ""right now I smell opportunity,"" he said, ""yes, winter's coming now let's embrace it."" He's buckling down on expenses for business travel and company swag, but he's also encouraging an aggressive mindset in terms of playing offense in their business.
Ricky Mulvey: There's a good Wall Street Journal article about it and he's got a swag czar and he lamented to the reporter that not every single event needs a T-shirt. While the labor market is hot, you're still seeing a lot of these tech companies implement layoffs and Axon is very much, in some ways, welcoming that, saying, ""Cool. More computer engineers, that's good for us. Let's go find some talented ones for a company.""
Sanmeet Deo: There's a lot of shifts happening in the marketplace with companies, maybe people, employees leaving companies or things happening. Now is the time when you can take advantage of those opportunities.
Ricky Mulvey: Trade Desk also had a blockbuster quarter recently. That's another company that seems to be going on offense in a challenging environment.
Sanmeet Deo: Trade Desk is, they had great earnings report recently, raised guidance in this environment, which is very, very impressive raising guidance when some companies are pulling back or not giving guidance. Many adtech companies, ad companies like [Meta's] Facebook and ad platform companies are feeling the pinch from advertisers pulling back on spend and some of those advertisers will pull back on the low-hanging fruit, stuff that they don't really need to do, with things like [Alphabet's] Google advertising is a much more prominent and impactful for them. But with companies pulling ad spend, Apple IDFA privacy changes continue to ripple through the industry, Trade Desk is playing the offense and they have been for a while with their new UID2 ad platform, which is gaining tractions, gaining partnerships and integrations with companies like Disney and AWS. It's showing the results and they're very bullish on connected TV advertising and where they play in the market and how they can capture share.
Ricky Mulvey: Speaking of companies playing offense. I think one frame to use is you look at a growing industry, take a little bit of a macro view, and then you look at the specific companies that are poised to take market share. A few months ago we looked at a company called Xponential Fitness. You see, a lot of fitness companies that are able to use COVID as an excuse or you see some companies kind of shrinking their footprint. This is one that has CEO Anthony Geisler has really never leaned on COVID as an excuse and he's also very much leaning into an international expansion for Xponential.
Sanmeet Deo: When COVID hit, he was very aggressive and thought very hard for his franchisees when it came to rent abatements, fighting the government to get COVID relief and pausing royalties for his franchisees and launching online platforms and digital platform for his franchise, he did a very good job of, instead of blaming COVID, going on the offense. That's continued especially now with them signing more international agreements, master franchise agreements in Japan and all across the world. One interesting story that recently came out that was very impressive to me was, on July 26th of 2022, it's competitor, F45 Holdings, came out with some rough news announcing a departure of CEO, reduction in global workforce, sharp cut in its full-year guidance for revenue and earnings and removal of financing facility for its franchisees, stock pulling over 60 percent in a day and usually this would be a not such a great read through for the boutique fitness industry. The next day in the morning, Xponential announced, ""We expects to deliver strong results for the second quarter of 2022, has continued to reinforce his position as a leading provider boutique fitness globally, additionally, 'is on track to meet or exceed guidance metrics for the year.'"" So in that press release as well they announced her preliminary Second-quarter results, strong member growth, store visits, sales, AUVs, your average unit volume growth for the stores. Very offensive move after F45's disaster, reassuring investors that were OK. I'm an investor in it myself and I was very pleased by it as well.
Ricky Mulvey: I earn shares as well. The only way you can play offense in a tough environment is if you have the balance sheet to back it up. Some of the companies we've talked about, Axon, Xponential, Trade Desk, any balance sheets there, stand out to you as for companies that could continue to play offense in a tough environment.
Sanmeet Deo: Yeah, absolutely. Trade Desk, which we were talking about earlier offline about how you and think like tech companies or some of these kinds of companies might have super strong balance sheets, but they have 1.2 billion of cash on their balance sheet and no debt so they're well positioned to continue to play offense like they've been doing. Axon as well, no debt on their balance sheet, $377 million in cash. Again, strong balance sheets that put them in a position to take the offensive maneuvers. Xponential's balance sheet has some debt and it's OK, but the main advantage for Xponential is, is a franchisor, so launching in international markets, growing their stores. As a franchisor, those costs are typically on the franchisees to open up stores so they can grow and expand in an environment without taking on too much heavy costs in this kind of environment.
Ricky Mulvey: We've talked about some of the companies with strong balance sheets playing offense. Which companies would you like to see off play offense? But maybe their balance sheet is holding them back. They don't have the ability now to go out and make smart acquisitions or really expand into new territories.
Sanmeet Deo: The first thing that came to mind is Netflix. They're in a very competitive space, they're looking to find their next leg of growth. They've done very well on stream, but now there's a lot of competitors out there. You saw Disney recently reported that they have in combination more streaming subscribers that Netflix, they have plenty of cash on their balance sheet, but they have about $14 billion of debt and they have a large content spend annually of about $17 billion. That's been management recently said that that's kind of where they're going to tap out at and they're not going to continue to go higher. But I feel like the obligations that they have is going to keep them from making any big splash on the acquisition front to build as ad platform or growths gaming business. They're working with Microsoft for their advertising platform and that's probably going to be good. In fact, Trade Desk actually mentioned that that would be a good move for them. But the gaming business, they've made some small acquisitions, but to make a bigger acquisition, to really drive home their position in that industry. They might be held back a little bit and they'd have to grow it more organically than otherwise.
Ricky Mulvey: Sanmeet Deo, thank you for your time.

2022-08-15 00:00:00+00:00,"Down 48%, Should Investors Buy and Hold PayPal for 5 Years?",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/down-48-should-investors-buy-and-hold-paypal-for-5-years,,,"Mobile payment pioneer PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) has returned to earth after surging to all-time highs in the thick of the pandemic. Its stock price has slumped 48% since the start of 2022 in light of a slowdown in growth and added turbulence from high inflation and the Fed's interest rate hikes. But given that the financial technology (fintech) juggernaut commands 50.3% of the global online payment processing industry according to one report citing metrics from Statista, now may be a good time to give the company a firm look.
The war on cash, which refers to the shift away from physical currency in favor of digital payments, is well under way, and PayPal is advantageously positioned to significantly benefit from the secular trend. According to Grand View Research, the global digital payment market is forecast to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.5% through 2030. Knowing that, investors with lengthy time horizons should be unmoved by short-term headwinds and zero in on the long-term trajectory of PayPal's business.
On that note, let's examine PayPal's current situation to help investors decide if it's a stock worth adding to their portfolios today.
Image source: Getty Images.
Dissecting PayPal's business
On Aug. 2, the fintech leader posted a second-quarter earnings update that mitigated many investors' concerns about the company's future, sparking a much-needed boost in its stock price. Its total revenue increased 9.1% year-over-year to $6.8 billion, concluding in-line with Wall Street estimates, and its adjusted earnings per share declined 19.1% to $0.93, but easily beat consensus forecasts by 6.6%. The company also added 35 million active accounts to bring its total up to 429 million, and its total payment volume (TPV) grew 9.3% to $339.8 billion.
The slowdown in growth can be attributed to a variety of different factors. Not only is eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) transition away from PayPal exerting pressure on the fintech giant's top line, but high inflation and an overall softness in e-commerce compared to a year ago are causing temporary growing pains. For the full year, Wall Street analysts expect total revenue to climb 9.8% year-over-year to $27.9 billion, and its earnings per share to drop 14.8% to $3.92. In fiscal 2023, which is when year-over-year comparable metrics will normalize, the Street is calling for top- and bottom-line growth of 14.3% and 22.7%, respectively.
Over the long run, the fintech leader should be in great shape. If it can expand its top line at a CAGR of 10% from fiscal 2021 through 2025, it'll generate roughly $41.0 billion in annual revenue. At an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin of 21%, which is on par with last year, PayPal's EBITDA figure would amount to $8.6 billion. Assuming an enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiple of 30, which is below its 5-year average of 42.4, the company's enterprise value would be $258.3 billion, or 124% higher than its $115.5 billion right now.
Is it time to purchase shares of PayPal?
PayPal's pullback so far in 2022 has created an excellent buying opportunity for investors, especially when taking into account the rising fintech arena. Growth may be patchy for the foreseeable future, but most of the challenges that the company is facing today are short-term in nature. Going forward, I feel confident that the fintech leader will experience a healthy bounce back and continue to reward shareholders with robust gains. At current valuation levels, PayPal appears like a no-brainer buy for patient, long-term investors.

2022-08-15 00:00:00+00:00,Will Used Merchandise Fly at Walmart?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-used-merchandise-fly-at-walmart,,,"Everything old is new again, or maybe it's everything refurbished is new again.
Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is getting into the refurbished consumer electronics game, and it's a smart move as it meshes well with its price-sensitive consumers. While just about everyone is price-sensitive in this time of high inflation, elevated energy costs, and rising interest rates, the like-new refurbished market seems right in the retailer's wheelhouse.
Image source: Walmart.
Just like new
Walmart recently launched Walmart Restored as part of its website, where it lists consumer electronics and appliances from its preferred third-party sellers and suppliers that have been refurbished to like-new condition. The prices are reportedly ""a fraction of typical costs,"" and after the products have been inspected, tested, and cleaned, they will also not have any visible imperfections when viewed at a short distance. They also come with a 90-day free return guarantee.
The program will initially only be on the walmart.com website, but will move into select stores later this fall. Among the brands included in the program are Apple, HP, KitchenAid, and Samsung.
Although Walmart is not alone in offering refurbished goods, the inflationary era people are enduring means it's a timely introduction of the program. It's the back-to-school season, which is a good time to pick up laptops, tablets, TVs, mobile devices, and other consumer electronics -- and it launched sufficiently before the start of holiday shopping, which gives an opportunity to get a head start on the rush of goods.
A growing need to offload goods
Walmart is the largest retailer in the world, but it has been hit by slowing sales and recently announced it needed to unload a boatload of merchandise at discounted prices to clear inventory that wasn't moving.
It also provided a business update that indicated profits would be materially hurt by rising prices and expenses, and more recently announced it would be laying off hundreds of employees at its corporate offices.
The Walmart Restored program was likely an outgrowth of this developing financial reality. Although apparel is where the retailer is experiencing a build-up of inventory that it needs to work down, its sellers and suppliers are obviously inundated with a lot of product returns that they need to move as well.
A sea of refurbished goods
It's not the first time Walmart has experimented with resale items. A few years ago, the retailer partnered with returns company goTRG to sell refurbished Apple products on its website. goTRG works with a number of major retailers, including Home Depot, Lowe's, and Amazon.
Amazon actually started its own refurbishing program, Amazon Renewed, to sell pre-owned goods that have been restored, as have others such as Apple, Best Buy, and eBay.
Although it took refurbished consumer products a while to gain market acceptance as people feared they were getting damaged goods, the entire secondhand market has taken on a life of its own, particularly during the early days of the pandemic.
Customers now have selections of used clothes, sneakers, consumer electronics, and appliances to choose from. In many instances there has not been any appreciable upgrade in design or innovation of the products, but prices have continued to spiral upwards. So consumers are more willing to purchase refurbished goods. And with retailers standing behind the used products they're selling, it's given customers confidence to buy them.
A good start
The program won't do anything to help Walmart's margins in the short term, but it could increase website traffic, which could eventually lead to greater sales elsewhere.
It's a realization that buyers are under more pressure today than they've been in years. Because Walmart is associated with everyday low pricing already, the program should be successful in moving merchandise. That can save its customers a lot of money, while increasing website traffic and customer loyalty.

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At eBay
Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, Robert Swan, for US$2.9m worth of shares, at about US$73.15 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$49.44. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.
Insiders in eBay didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!

Does eBay Boast High Insider Ownership?
For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own 0.3% of eBay shares, worth about US$73m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.
So What Does This Data Suggest About eBay Insiders?
An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for eBay (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.

2022-08-12 00:00:00+00:00,Could a Deal Between Pinterest and PayPal Still Happen?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/could-a-deal-between-pinterest-and-paypal-still-happen,,,"Remember when PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) was reportedly interested in acquiring Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) late last year? Good thing that didn't work out. The two stocks have both tanked since then during the bear market of 2022, with each down about 70% from all-time highs reached during the previous summer. At the time, Pinterest was valued at upwards of $40 billion, so PayPal would have ended up egregiously overpaying given everything that has ensued since news of a potential deal first leaked. Pinterest is now just a $15 billion company.
However, both stocks rallied following second-quarter 2022 earnings after it was revealed that private equity firm Elliott Management has taken a large equity stake in PayPal and Pinterest. Will a merger deal be back on the table soon?
Don't rule some sort of deal out
Elliott Management is no stranger to mergers and acquisitions. For example, the private-equity company made headlines back in 2019 when it took credit for getting AT&T to cut spending to refocus on its mobile network. It offloaded shares in late 2020, only to buy again in early 2021 ahead of AT&T formalizing a merger between its Time Warner subsidiary with Discovery -- a business now called Warner Bros Discovery. Elliott has made some coin off these deals, but neither stock has fared well for buy-and-hold shareholders.
Data by YCharts.
Even closer to a PayPal-Pinterest combination is Elliott's work with eBay. In early 2019, Elliott Management sent a letter to the e-commerce marketplace recommending a refocus on its core business. Included in eBay's overhaul in recent years has been a parting of ways with none other than PayPal (announced in 2020), giving eBay room to work on its own digital payments system instead (via a partnership with Adyen). Elliott made a tidy profit on eBay thanks to these moves. There are other examples of Elliott's activist activity in recent years, to mixed results.
What will Elliott's role be in this go-around with PayPal and Pinterest? PayPal is highly reliant on e-commerce activity for its digital payments apps, and getting more online shopping activity into its pipeline will be key to its continued expansion. Its revenue is expected to increase a modest 10% this year to about $27.85 billion.
As for Pinterest, it's no secret the company is trying to become a much more robust e-commerce platform rather than a simple social media and visual search brand. Increasing functionality for merchants with advertising and video content tools will be key, but adding a way to sell products and collect payment directly on Pinterest could be part of the plan as well. Perhaps some sort of partnership with PayPal will be forthcoming, and new CEO Bill Ready (a former PayPal executive) no doubt has some ideas too.
Pinterest currently expects third-quarter 2022 revenue to increase by just a mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2021.
How friendly would M&A be to shareholders?
Mega-mergers, especially those between companies that don't have a lot in common, can get messy. If Elliott pushes for some sort of deal between Pinterest and PayPal, I'd expect it to be one that is beneficial to both stocks in the short term. That would give the private-equity firm time to offload one (or both) stocks for a quick profit and then move its capital on to greener pastures.
Best-case scenario, though, is for PayPal and Pinterest to forge some sort of partnership that would create value for shareholders of both companies over time. An outright acquisition of Pinterest by PayPal could work. PayPal had $15.6 billion in cash and equivalents and $10.6 billion in debt as of the end of June, so a deal could be made by using a combination of cash and new debt, or cash and new PayPal stock. But merging the two could get dicey, and it would take years to fully realize any value from combining the two businesses. Based on recent history, owning positions for many years doesn't appear to be Elliott Management's style when it comes to its activist investor habits.
Given the heightened uncertainty right now, I'm not so sure PayPal is such a great long-term buy-and-hold anymore if it decides to shell out cash and stock to acquire Pinterest. I'm inclined to say PayPal would be better off as is right now. It's working through the slowdown from the early pandemic e-commerce shopping boom, and it's still highly profitable. The company has generated free-cash-flow margins of nearly 20% over the last year.
On the other hand, Pinterest is smaller, and its problems could thus be easier to fix to get revenue back in growth mode. Pinterest also boasts an even higher free-cash flow-margin of 25%. Perhaps as part of PayPal, it could generate even higher rates of cash, but that path is fraught with uncertainty. Either way, Pinterest and PayPal shareholders are now in an interesting wait-and-see scenario. Stay tuned for any announced proposals from Elliott Management on a path forward for these two beleaguered stocks.

Further, at its current price of $282 per share, it is trading 16% below its fair value of $337 – Trefis’ estimate for Microsoft’s valuation. The technology giant missed the consensus estimates in the fourth quarter of FY2022 (FY July-June). However, it still posted a 12% y-o-y increase in total revenues to $51.9 billion. The growth was driven by a 13% rise in productivity and business processes, a 20% jump in the intelligent cloud, and a modest 2% increase in the more personal computing revenues. The more personal computing segment suffered due to negative growth in Windows OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and lower Xbox content and services revenues. Overall, the firm reported a 2% rise in net income to $16.7 billion. It was because of a drop in operating margin from 41.4% to 39.6% due to the higher cost of revenues.
The company’s total revenues increased 18% y-o-y to $198.3 billion in FY 2022 driven by growth in each of the three segments. The productivity and business process segment grew 18% y-o-y, followed by a 25% rise in the intelligent cloud unit. Further, more personal computing revenues rose by 10% in the year. All in all, the above growth in the top-line translated into a net income of $72.7 billion – up 19% y-o-y.
Microsoft is likely to continue its growth momentum in the subsequent quarters. Notably, consensus estimates for Q1 FY2023 revenues and earnings are $49.91 billion and $2.34 respectively. Overall, Microsoft revenues are expected to touch $220.7 billion in FY2023. Additionally, MSFT’s net income margin is likely to remain around the same level as the last year. It will likely result in a net income of $80.8 billion and an annual EPS of $10.87. This coupled with a P/E multiple of 31x will lead to the valuation of $337.
With inflation rising and the Fed raising interest rates, Microsoft has fallen 16% this year. Can it drop more? See how low can Microsoft stock go by comparing its decline in previous market crashes. Here is a performance summary of all stocks in previous market crashes.

2022-08-11 00:00:00+00:00,Should You Buy eBay as the Buyer Pool Shrinks?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-ebay-as-the-buyer-pool-shrinks,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is still suffering a growth hangover right now, but the worst might be over. The online platform recently announced Q2 earnings results that beat expectations and implied stabilizing sales and earnings trends on the way.
While some of eBay's metrics are still shrinking at a double-digit rate, the speed of that decline slowed in Q2. Let's take a closer look at the results and why investors should feel a bit more confident about fiscal 2022.
Negative sales trends are moderating
eBay's core marketplace business is still feeling the impact of a demand pullback compared to soaring e-commerce sales in the lockdown phases of the pandemic. The company's buyer pool shrank by 12% year over year, and sales volumes were down 18%. These results seem weak, both on their own and in comparison to those of industry peers like Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY), which in late July reported a 4% uptick in its buyer pool.
But eBay's losses moderated compared to the prior quarter, allowing the business to outperform management's early-May forecast. Sales fell 6% (after currency exchange swings are accounted for), while executives had predicted losses of between 9% and 7%. ""Our focus category strategy is working, and payments and advertising are driving further growth,"" CEO Jamie Iannone said in a press release.
Cash and profits
eBay also overperformed on the financial side of the ledger. The company's take rate, or the fee rate that it charges sellers for its services, rose to 12.4% of sales compared to 11.1% a year ago. That rate has been rising for more than a year, in part to reflect new services like payment processing and first-party advertising. Etsy's rate, by comparison, sits at 19% of sales.
Thanks to those gains, eBay's non-GAAP (adjusted) operating profit was 28.7% of sales, down compared to the prior year but significantly above management's forecast. Executives said they are ""on track"" to deliver on their wider 2022 targets despite volatility in Europe, supply chain and inflation challenges, and currency exchange shifts.
The outlook for investors
Management predicted another quarter of decelerating losses ahead. Organic sales in Q3 should fall by between 5% and 2%, it said, compared to this past quarter's 6% drop. The company still sees that core growth metric landing at between a 6% loss and a 3% loss for the full 2022 year.
Adjusted earnings will still land at roughly $4 per share, and cash flow is set to be ample, although lower than shareholders have seen in the last few years. eBay is still sending much of that cash back to investors through stock buybacks and a modest dividend payment.
It might be a few more quarters before the company returns to steady growth in core metrics like the buyer pool and marketplace sales volumes. But the Q2 results and Q3 forecast shows that eBay is taking big strides in that direction.
Once growth returns, the business should start setting impressive profit records thanks to its higher take-rate and the lift provided by the advertising and payments segments. In the meantime, investors can patiently collect those capital returns, which are approaching $3 billion through just the first half of 2022.

2022-08-10 00:00:00+00:00,3 of the S&P 500's Top-Performing Stocks in July,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-of-the-sp-500s-top-performing-stocks-in-july,,,"As well as the S&P 500 did in July, rising by more than 9%, there were a few stocks that did far better. Shares of HCA Healthcare (NYSE: HCA), Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) jumped by more than 25%. They were among the top-performing stocks in the S&P last month.
Let's have a look at what drove those strong results and whether these stocks can build off their impressive gains.
1. HCA Healthcare
HCA Healthcare operates healthcare facilities across the U.S. and can be a great way to gain exposure to the industry. Last month, the company released strong second-quarter earnings numbers, which gave the stock a boost, sending it up 26%.
In Q2, the company's revenue was largely unchanged at $14.8 billion (versus $14.4 billion a year ago). And even though the net income of less than $1.4 billion was down 17% from the prior-year period, it was still a solid performance by the business that was better than what analysts were expecting. Its adjusted per-share profit of $4.21 was higher than Wall Street estimates of $3.70.
The company is optimistic that it can continue improving on profitability as management noted that contract labor was high in the first quarter as a result of COVID-19. Those costs came down in Q2, and it expects to see even less of a need for temporary labor (e.g., nurses) as the year progresses, so investors were likely bullish on the news.
Year to date, shares of HCA are still down 17%, which is worse than the S&P 500's decline of 13%. However, with a modest price-to-earnings multiple of 10, there's definitely potential for the stock to rise higher, especially as hospitals resume normal day-to-day operations and if COVID doesn't weigh them down. HCA could make for an underrated buy as the year progresses.
2. Etsy
E-commerce company Etsy has endured a challenging year in 2022 (its shares have fallen 50%) as investors have been anticipating less traffic on its platform, given a return to normal in the economy. Plus, Etsy isn't a cheap stock -- it trades at more than 45 times its future profits (by comparison, the S&P 500 averages a multiple of just 18).
But Etsy has proven to be resilient, reporting 11% revenue growth for the period ended June 30, with sales topping $585 million. Net income, unfortunately, fell by 26% to $73 million as the company's operating expenses grew at a faster rate than the top line.
It was a positive development nonetheless that helped lift the stock by more than 40% in July (tops on this list). It gives investors hope that Etsy may succeed even amid inflation and concerns of a recession. However, this is not a trend I would expect to last the whole year as Etsy is known for being a more expensive option for shoppers than eBay, and that could start to hurt its business.
It may be safer to keep this stock on a watchlist rather than buy it right now as Etsy is still a risky growth stock to own, given its high valuation and the volatility it has shown this year.
3. Tesla
Electric vehicle maker Tesla also had a strong month in July, rising by 32%. Tesla released its quarterly numbers last month, with adjusted earnings per share of $2.27 for the three-month period ended June 30, beating analyst expectations of $1.81. Revenue of $16.9 billion, however, fell slightly short of the $17.1 billion that Wall Street was estimating.
Overall, it was still positive news at a time when many growth stocks have been struggling and battling the effects of inflation. The company's gross margins did worsen, and profits were down from the previous period. But on a year-over-year basis, Tesla still netted a profit of around $2.3 billion -- roughly double what it earned a year ago.
Tesla also announced that on Aug. 25, it will split its shares on a three-for-one basis. Although that won't change an investor's overall position in the company, it could make the near-$900 stock more accessible to investors who can't buy fractional shares.
Year to date, Tesla's stock is down 18% and still trades at close to 80 times its future earnings. Despite the strong month, this isn't a stock I'd be loading up on right now since its valuation could put it under pressure as the year goes on and as investors continue to flock to more value-oriented investments.

This video was recorded on August 5, 2022.
Chris Hill: We've got a hot jobs report, the rise of the machines and a whole lot of earnings. Motley Fool Money starts now.
It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Chris Hill, joining me Motley Fool senior analyst Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger. Good to see you as always gentlemen.
Jason Moser: Howdy.
Chris Hill: It's another big week of earnings. We will dip into the Fool mailbag to answer your questions. As always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar. But we begin with the big macro. The US economy added 528,000 jobs in the month of July. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent. This makes nearly six million private sector jobs that have been added in the last year. Jason, let me start with you. The last two recessions saw a huge job losses month after month. If we're in a recession right now, this is unlike any recession I've ever seen or even heard of.
Jason Moser: Well, you said if and I think that really is what kicks off this conversation here because I feel like the biggest lesson we can learn from all of this, of course will not actually be put into action, is that we need to come up with an objective definition for what a recession is. Because at this point now, this just becomes a political football. Aren't we? I don't know that it really matters. At the end of the day this jobs report is good news. But it is good news in a world where there are signs that there may be some small cracks forming that we need to pay attention to. It's weird because when you look at what led the way here in leisure and hospitality, leisure hospitality sector saw the most jobs growth. Close to 100,000 payrolls added in July. As a consumer, you don't feel that way sometimes. You go places, there are long lines or canceled flights. It feels like the service industry, the hospitality industry, is hurting a little bit, is lacking a little bit. It's weird to see that, but it's good to see wage growth. It's not quite keeping up with inflation, but that's something. By the same token, you've got this interesting dichotomy of businesses wanting to do more with less. We're seeing a lot of companies out there cutting workforces. Good news, but still makes you scratch your head a little bit.
Chris Hill: I was just going to say Matt, the backdrop of some of the comments of CEOs of the biggest tech companies out there, Alphabet Meta Platforms, talking very openly about not only freezing hiring, but also they may be cutting some positions here or there.
Matthew Argersinger: I think a lot of analysts would argue that, this number was fantastic, but it doesn't reflect what you just said, Chris, which is you have these tech companies who have announced hiring freezes or at least slowing down their hiring. That slowness isn't really reflected here. But I do want to go back to GMOs comment about the hospitality and leisure industries because I think that's a key point and I think Steve Leseman said it almost best this morning. He said the difficulty of finding labor is overwhelming the fear of the actual slowdown. In other words, and I think the hospitality industry is perfect for that, which is everything I read, looking at hospitality reads or looking at even individual hospitality landlords and developers, they can't find labor. They can't hire fast enough, and they're offering bonuses, big wages, incentives, and it just can't hire and that's why you have those long lines. I think the job number is outstanding in that industry, is they're still looking for a million jobs. It's a weird economy we're in. In certain industries, there's so many job openings they can't fill them in certain places like Big Tech, as you mentioned, Chris, we're seeing a slowdown. We're seeing too much capacity. But overall, I think it's really hard to argue. I don't know where the football lands on this, but it's really hard to argue that we're in a recession with these numbers.
Chris Hill: Let's get to some of the big companies reporting earnings this week. Starbucks same-store sales in China fell 44 percent, but US demand for cold beverages in the third-quarter helped make up for lower results overseas. Interim CEO, Howard Schultz said Starbucks' pricing power helped push the average ticket higher Matty.
Matthew Argersinger: Yeah, Chris. I don't know how you feel about ice coffee, but I like mine hot.
Chris Hill: Not a fan. But as a Starbucks shareholder, I appreciate the people who are out there buying the cold beverages.
Matthew Argersinger: That's right. Well, I think my takeaway is thank goodness Starbucks is still mostly a US story. Because if you look at the US comparable stock sales they were up nine percent, really strong. The international comparable stock sales down 18 percent, and that's because of our 44 percent drop in sales in China. Obviously the COVID lockdowns playing a big role there. Starbucks still has roughly tripled the number of stores in the US than they do in China. Meanwhile, profit side earnings per share were down 15 percent. Coffee prices are higher, wages are higher, and Starbucks is raising prices, but not enough to offset those increases. You got operating margin come down, came in at about 16.9 percent versus 19.9 percent a year ago. But even if you think things will level out on the inflationary front, and maybe China's starts to reopen the economy, those sales come back to those stores. I'd still worry about having roughly 16 percent of my stores in China. I think going back a few years, we would look at Starbucks China position, say that's a position of strength, its position of growth, and that's where the growth is going to come from for years ahead. Howard Schultz, Starbucks executives, they built these long-term relationships in the country. But I think China-US relations aren't exactly great at the moment. I'm a Starbucks shareholder just like you, and I'm looking at North America comps that were great. I'm looking at actual Starbucks Reward memberships that were up 13 percent. But I'm not banking on making money in Starbucks, if I think China is going to be the growth story going forward, I think there's just a lot of risks there. It really does have to come from the domestic business, the North American business, and it is, which is great. I think their core reflects that.
Chris Hill: Three months from now when we get the next quarterly report, do you think part of that is going to include an announcement of who the new CEO is going to be or do you think it gets pushed off a little bit further?
Matthew Argersinger: I think given the current situation, I'd say it gets pushed off. I think Howard Schultz is in this top spot for at least the remainder of this year, if not maybe into next year by a meaningful amount. I think they recognize that his 10 years at the company have been really great for shareholders, really great for the business. For whatever reason, they just haven't been able to find that great successor and he's always been had to come back. I think he sticks around a little longer.
Chris Hill: Shares of PayPal up 10 percent this week after second-quarter results were better-than-expected. An activist investor, Elliott Management has taken $2 billion stake in the company. Jason, it seems like PayPal is getting back to basics.
Jason Moser: Yeah. That's good news. It does feel like the good news here for investors as far as PayPal's consumers, that Management perhaps has some self-awareness of the unforced errors they've committed over the last several quarters. Ultimately they're doing what they said they would do to rectify the situation. If you remember back in April, CEO Dan Schulman said on call that they needed to get back to, like you said, basics and focus on three things. Reassessing the thought process behind forecasting ultimately, don't get out over your skis. It's better to under-promise and over-deliver. Do fewer things and do them well. PayPal started spreading itself a little thin and then ultimately getting the teams room to run and innovate and own the successes in the business. We saw signs that the business is getting back to good order here with revenue of $6.8 billion. That was up 10 percent on a currency-neutral basis. Earnings per share down a little bit from the year-ago, 93 cents versus a dollar and 15 the previous year. But they are starting to talk about whittling down the cost structure, becoming more efficient. To that end, we should see as investors, $900 million in cost savings that should be realized this year. I think what was encouraging with the Elliott Management side of things is that's helping management and get their eyes back on the ball. They announced $15 billion share repurchase authorization and they should execute around four billion dollars this year, and they will continue to work with Eliot there in finding the best ways to return value to shareholders. It did seem on the call. If you listen to it, there was a level of contrition in Dan Schulman's voice that he felt like, listen, we're going to own up to some mistakes and get this thing back in order here. The priority is going forward, are going to be on checkout. Venmo and PayPal digital wallets in the Braintree operations there. Good example, there are no longer going to be sinking money into that stock trading capability they were talking about building out. That was just one small part of it. But to me there's no reason to ever do that. If they're million brokerages out there already, there's nothing that really differentiates them. It's just nothing but pure expense, risks and opportunity cost involved with that. It's nice to see them focusing backup and I expect we'll see that continue.
Chris Hill: Another blow-out quarter for MercadoLibre. Second-quarter revenue for the Latin American e-commerce company rose 57 percent. Their gross profit margin expanded and shares of MercadoLibre up nearly 30 percent this week, Matt.
Matthew Argersinger: Yeah, gangbusters there, right? I think the story here is that most e-commerce companies reported really extraordinary results in 2020, 2021, yet a result of the pandemic surge in online shopping. Now that we're in 2022, things have reopened, people are shopping a bit less online. Those year-over-year comparisons have gotten lot harder. If you look at results from Etsy, eBay, Shopify, even Amazon to certain extent, looking at their retail business marketplace businesses growth has slowed way down this year as you'd expect, not the case for MercadoLibre, which is incredible. If you look just at their commerce business, gross merchandise volume was up 22 percent in US dollar terms. Their biggest market, Brazil was up 28 percent, Mexico up 30 percent, and they reached a record 40.8 million unique buyers in the second-quarter. That breaks the record in Q4, 2021, which of course is the seasonal holiday shopping season where you have a lot of people shopping. Really incredible results. Of course, millions a lot different today than when I was talking about it a long time ago on the show, it's not just a marketplace business anymore. It's got a fast-growing advertising business. It's got third-party fulfillment business. Most importantly, it's got a payments business that saw volumes reach over 30 billion, 72 percent growth year-over-year. You've got point-of-sale transactions, money-transfer credit offerings. I think in a region like Latin America where you have different currencies, many of them very volatile, customers and businesses that don't often have access to traditional banks, MercadoLibre is filling that role, and looks like they're executing really well. I think when in the US and other places where shoppers have that brick-and-mortar infrastructure to go back to, they don't necessarily have that in a lot of places. I think a lot of sellers, especially who joined the MercadoLibre marketplace and their payment system over the last couple of years, they're sticking to it and using it even more.
Chris Hill: After the break, we've got the latest in cybersecurity and we will check in on the homebuying market. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here with Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger, shares of Cloudflare up 25 percent on Friday after the cybersecurity firm's second-quarter revenue came in higher-than-expected. Maybe Wall Street should start adjusting their expectations, Jason, because this was the eighth-quarter in a row, that Cloudflare's revenue grew by more than 50 percent.
Jason Moser: Yeah, it's been a tough year for Cloudflare and companies like it, growth stories that are still working their way to profitability and perhaps Cloudflare, the share price got a little bit ahead of itself earlier on in the story there, but you can make the same argument that the pessimism is a little bit overdone as well. To your point there, 54 percent revenue growth is just nothing to sneeze at. Now, it's worth noting they did make a small acquisition of a company called Area 1 recently and that did contribute a little bit, but not much. This was mostly organic growth, which is really encouraging. I think one of the big parts of the story here really is large customers. The customers that spend more than $100,000 a year with the company. That's a nice indicator for Cloudflare. It says that they're doing something right because they're bringing these big customers and in growing the relationships with them, that becomes very sticky over time. But the numbers there, they now have 1,749 total large customers, that's up from 1,888 a year ago. They represent 60 percent of total revenue now versus just over 50 percent a year ago. Ultimately that results in a dollar-based net expansion rate of 126 percent versus 124 percent a year ago. Again, it speaks to growing that relationship with meaningful spenders, and as a business that's what you want. They are continuing to win versus their competitors and zero-trust, and they're relatively new to that zero-trust security games, so that's really encouraging as well. Some modest improvement gross margins. They're guiding for 48 percent revenue growth for the full year. This is a really strong business doing a lot of great things. Back to the big macro and just the conditions on the ground in regard to the economy. I will say the noted enough call and I quote, ""In Q1, our pipeline generation slowed, sales cycles extended and customers took longer to pay their bills. We've watched those metrics closely throughout Q2 and saw them at least stabilized. They're not where we throw parade yet, but the metrics are trending in the right direction.
Chris Hill: Well, and we've talked on this show about companies looking to pull different levers to save money, and one of the big ways that a lot of companies do that is by pulling back on marketing. I have a hard time believing companies are going to be ramping, really pulling back on their cybersecurity.
Jason Moser: I fully agree. It's a top priority of any and every business out there today.
Chris Hill: Zillow second-quarter results took a back seat to its lower guidance for the third-quarter and the fact that after getting out of the iBuying business, Zillow announced a multiyear partnership with Opendoor Technologies, which meant really seems like a way to get back into the business of iBuying.
Matthew Argersinger: That's right. I think the market hated when they got out of it last fall. I thought that was the right move. I'm pretty skeptical of the iBuying business in general, the model, and I thought Zillow stepping away from it, probably proved fairly smart considering what we've seen happened to the iBuying industry this year. But it's big news and I think you're marrying Zillow of course, which is the biggest brand, biggest website, biggest mobile app in real estate, certainly in the US, 234 million average unique users, and Opendoor, which is the leading iBuyer by volume, now that Zillow's exit the business. There were many details on the conference call about the deal, but it's an exclusive deal, goes for many years apparently, and I think at the base level what it does if you're Zillow customer, you now have the ability to get a cash offer on your home through Zillow, or you at least have another potential buyer in the marketplace for your home even if you do the traditional way of using a listing agent. I liked the idea of Zillow using its reach, its brand and going back into iBuying, but in a capital-light way, they're not going to be in the business of actually buying and selling homes like they were, they're going let Opendoor handle that. I feel like it's a win from both, but I think for Zillow, it's a great capital-light way to get back into it. I'll have to say, even though Zillow's business is hurting right now, their premier agent revenue, which is their largest revenue item line now was down five percent. As you mentioned, Chris, they gave bad guidance for the quarter, but you do have a business that has almost two billion in net cash. Pretty big with a market cap of just nine billion dollars now, and you're shifting the business to more of a capital-light business model which worked really well in the past. I can't say whether Zillow is going down the tubes, which it has been going for a year now, but it's a right step in the direction of the business. I liked the deal with Opendoor.
Chris Hill: Twilio, second-quarter revenue grew by more than 40 percent, but guidance for Q3 was weaker than Wall Street was hoping for, and shares of Twilio down 15 percent on Friday, Jason.
Jason Moser: Yeah, sell-off not withstanding. I think you need to look at the bigger picture and note that management still remains very confident in their growth trajectory and profitability goals for 2023 and beyond. The stock is certainly feeling the impact of at least one big downgraded today. That happens. It's much more short-term in nature, so for investors like us that take the longer view you need to get used to that stuff happening. It's not a testament to the business into that point, organic revenue up 33 percent from a year ago, easily surpass their own internal guidance and second-quarter, revenue dollar-based net expansion rate 123 percent. That was down a good bit from 135 percent a year ago. That is due to a few things, a little softness here and there with some customers and also bringing in some new business, so nothing terribly concerning there. They did sign their largest Flex deal ever in the second-quarter, an eight figure deal with a Fortune 100 retailer, and Twilio Flex is a cloud-based context center, it essentially enables our customers to create the omnichannel contact center experience they want. That's encouraging. Modest gross margin weakness as they take on new business. Still calling for organic revenue growth here around 30 percent for the current quarters. I think you need to be optimistic about this business for a number of reasons, but I'd put the market it serves right there at the top. It's in communication, like security. Communication is just essential and Twilio does it really well. I think that again, so I've notwithstanding yet I feel pretty good about this.
Chris Hill: We are one step closer to the rise of the machines and right after the break will explain why. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here with Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger. Amazon is buying iRobot, the parent company of Roomba, the robot vacuum cleaner. It's an all-cash deal to the tune of $1.7 billion. Shares of Amazon down a bit on Friday, while shares of iRobot up nearly 20 percent, close to the buyout price of $61 a share. Jason, we were talking before the show, you're not a fan of this deal?
Jason Moser: Well, I'm not. It's like the Larry David, that gif, Larry David, like, maybe. I'm not sure. Listen, I've been an Amazon shareholder for years. It's been a tremendously rewarding investment. Their acquisitions always leave me just on the fence, I guess. I'm still there with this one. This is clearly another shot at the grander vision of owning the smart home. I get that. I think this is the best outcome for iRobot shareholders. Absolutely. Which is a shame really for those who bought it as it was on its way close to $140 per share, just about a year-and-a-half ago, but their growth has hit a wall. It could be argued that they've not really delivered on innovating beyond the vacuum cleaner. Now with that said, going back to the smart home, earlier this spring, I will quote myself because I needed to make sure I check myself on this, I called the smart home a cluttered, incoherent mess. It turns out the light switch and just a modicum of accountability are a bit tougher to disrupt than people thought. Part of that just comes from my frustrations of telling Alexa to turn on my light and it didn't work and I'm like, what's your point? What are you even here for other than to play podcasts? Now, you fast forward to what they're going to try to do with Roomba, with iRobot, you feel like they're going to incorporate this into their Amazon ecosystem. They'll probably connect Alexa to it.
You can control your vacuum cleaner with your voice. It sounds great until it doesn't work, which is probably going to be the case. I think you need to get your expectations in order here. I think the other thing to keep in mind too, there are competitors out there in this space that I think produce better products, and I can speak from personal experience. We have a DEEBOT robo vac at our house, and that's made by Ecovacs. I view these vacuum cleaners as not necessary and not essential. They're nice to have. If you have pets, they can help keep ahead of the mess, but I dug up some reviews online here that they really supported my experience. It's just that DEEBOT is a far superior vacuum cleaner to the Roomba for a number of reasons. I just wonder, maybe this is something where they can play a little bit on the pricing and really start selling a lot of these vacuum cleaners. Perhaps there's some IP there where they can innovate and expand that product line. Again, probably the best-case scenario for iRobot shareholders, but for Amazon, at least for them, it's just a drop in the bucket.
Chris Hill: Lost in all this, Matty, is, you go back to last year, Amazon comes out with Astro, the $1,500 robot, which I just looked at and I thought this looks like Alexa on wheels, but to Jason's point, it does seem like another move by Amazon toward the smart home.
Matthew Argersinger: Well, it just occurred to me as you said that that wasn't Astro, The Jetsons' dog.
Chris Hill: Yes.
Matthew Argersinger: I have, like Jason, trouble wrapping my head around this except on the idea of what you said, your last point, Jason, which is just it is a fairly well-known brand. It's popular. There are a lot of people with smaller apartments where they love their iRobot, they set it to go. I'm wondering if this is just a way for Amazon to enter that market in a more direct way, get some patents, some technologies, and some expertise, and then maybe flood the market with cheaper products. Although the Astros certainly isn't a cheap products. I have trouble seeing, with Amazon, I think every acquisition they make, we think it's this grand vision that they might have. What are they building toward five or 10 years from now and this is one of those key stepping stones? I have trouble seeing that this is a stepping stone other than maybe they feel like they can do a little better job on the marketing and product and cost side of things and really grab a lot of market share in what they still think is this emerging market of automated tools and cleaning supplies and things like that.
Chris Hill: Just to wrap up, Jason, as you indicated, Amazon is not buying this business at its peak. [laughs] They are arguably getting a nice discount if this is something they've been looking at for a while. I don't know, it's not going to shock me if a year or two from now, they come out with an upgraded version of Astro and it's like, hey, now Astro is also going to vacuum your home for you.
Jason Moser: They're getting this thing for essentially one-time sales. It is a business that it needs Amazon more than the other way around. Again, this is a nice bailout for iRobot shareholders. I'm sure that given Amazon's expertise in this space, they'll be able to do something with it and they'll be able to attract I think more customers on the pricing side, but I don't think it's going to be anything meaningful to the business.
Chris Hill: From robots, we go to commercial real estate. Simon Property Group's second-quarter profits came in higher than expected, and guidance for the full fiscal year was increased, but even with that, Matt, shares of Simon Property Group down a little bit this week.
Matthew Argersinger: Down a little bit, but I think what's not down and not dead by any stretch, Chris, is the mall. The mall is not dead. I know the stock price is down, but I think it was an impressive quarter by Simon. Net operating income across their entire portfolio was up seven percent year-over-year. Occupancy across its properties was 93.9 percent as of June 30th. That's up from 91.8 percent a year ago. That might seem like a small number, but you're talking hundreds of millions of square feet, and to see an uptick in occupancy, especially for primarily a mall owner is really impressive. You mentioned they raised guidance for funds from operations per share for the year. They increased their dividend, by the way, by three percent and you now get a nice six-and-a-half percent yield on the stock. Stock is down, but you're certainly getting a nice dividend payment, which is more than sustainable. I think investors might want to start thinking a little bit differently about Simon. Yes, most of its properties are traditional shopping malls, outlets, but they are far away the highest end and most profitable malls on a square foot basis in the country. There's just no second to Simon. These are a lot of malls that people still want to go to. I think on the newer development side, it's much more of a mixed-used a variety of properties are going for. It's not just retail shopping that Simon is buying or developing, but you've got properties and that will now have residences, hotels, experiential properties, so where people can live, work and play. I think this is one real estate company just, I was really doubting, especially after the pandemic, but now coming out of it, I think it's their competitors that have gotten a lot weaker. I think Simon is now in a position of strength just with a great portfolio of assets. They can now develop those assets now really targeting more of experience services angle with a lot of their properties. I think things look pretty good from here.
Chris Hill: Based on the size, as you said, they have so many properties across the country, do you get the sense that they are also somewhat nimble? Because it seems like they could test different concepts in different areas, see if they work, and then start to accelerate them in other parts of the country.
Matthew Argersinger: I think that's a good point. I wouldn't say they're probably the most nimble of companies when it comes to real estate development because to move the needle, their properties have to be fairly large. They take years of planning, it takes years of permitting and zoning, and then construction of course is a process as well, but I think Simon, their management team is really smart. They've proven that they can know how to maximize the profitability of any given development and target those markets where their properties are going to do the best. I think if there's one retail REIT out there that you want to bet on, I think Simon is probably the one.
Chris Hill: Uber posted record revenue in the second-quarter, and despite losing money on its investments, shares of Uber up 35 percent this week. Jason, is this company actually on its way to becoming profitable? [laughs]
Jason Moser: Well, they are free-cash-flow positive asterisk if that makes any sense. I'll get to that in a minute. What says Uber part to me, from its competition at least? Its ability to piece together multiple complimentary business lines which make the entire business stronger. As the world becomes more digital and more connected, this basically opens up Uber's market opportunity on all fronts. Ultimately, they're playing a big role in helping transform transportation, so it's a big deal. To the numbers, revenue, $8.1 billion, gross bookings up 36 percent, and constant currency to $29.1 billion. Now operating on an annualized run rate of $116 billion. Now, a lot of that growth is coming from mobility gross bookings. That's what we like to see. That was up 57 percent from a year ago. Delivery gross bookings, up 12 percent. Trips during the quarter grew 24 percent to 1.87 billion. Now, going to the actual business at hand, yes, still losing money. No question there. Working toward that profitability target, but they are on their way. Free cash flow is really a metric you want to target with a business like this because as you noted, the investment side of the business really does play out on that net income even when you talk about the actual losses this business chokes up, net loss of $2.6 billion. That includes $1.7 billion in the form of headwinds relating to their equity investments in companies like Aurora, Grab, and Zomato. I don't know about all those names. [laughs] Maybe they deserve.
Chris Hill: What are those companies do? [laughs]
Jason Moser: Because I'm not sure. But when I said free cash flow positive asterisk, it is worth remembering that stock-based compensation does play into that metric. If you account for that, they're still working their way to it. Free cash flow is a good metric to judge this business by and stock-based compensation is something that continues to come down as a percentage of revenue, albeit slowly. I'd like to see that speed up a little bit. One last thing to watch this business is membership. A lot of people don't think about this, but if it's successful, this could be a very nice long-term driver. They're at about 10 million members now. They've got this Uber One program. It's been launched in seven markets globally. About 23 percent of their overall gross booking come from members, and it's around 32 percent for delivery. Ultimately, members have about 2.7 times more gross bookings on Uber than non-members. I think that's an interesting lever they can continue to pull, but all in all, a business that keeps on progressing. It's nice to see.
Chris Hill: eBay's second-quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected, but growth is slowing for the online marketplace. Matt, when you look at eBay's business, what leaps out at you?
Matthew Argersinger: Well, I think with eBay, it's not so much about the top-line growth anymore really. They'll be able to grow, and they've made, I think some smart acquisitions that'll pay off down the road, but I think what eBay it's really about, you've got a high-margin capital-light business, generates a ton of cash, on a normalized basis, they expect to earn roughly four dollars a share in earnings this year. That's an incredible earnings power and that makes the stock traded for about 12 times forward earnings, which is just seems like a bargain to me. We spoke about MercadoLibre earlier, where they're not seeing those year-over-year down comparisons that a lot of e-commerce companies are. Well, eBay is, the revenue was down nine percent, gross merchandise volume was down 18 percent. Active buyers still strong at a 138 million, eBay is still a pretty big marketplace, but that number was also down about 12 percent. It's a business that's not growing. It's not going to be near the market share champion in e-commerce that we thought they might have been in the previous decade. But it generates a ton of cash, pays a growing dividend, which I like to see. I think that is probably as investor which you want to focus on the most with eBay going forward. After the break, we will dip into the Fool mailbag, plus we've got a couple of stocks on our radar. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money.
As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here with Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger. You can email us a question about stocks podcasts@fool.com is the email address, or you can call them Motley Fool Money hotline 703-254-1445. Let me go to our man behind-the-glass, Dan Boyd. Dan, we've got a question.
Kyle: This is Kyle from Minneapolis. My question is, they always talk about inflation as being transitory and I feel like everything has been played out on that. We all get that point. But my question is, when you see a company raise it's prices, is there ever a chance in the future, even given all other supply chain issues, is there a chance that they'll lower those prices in the future? My thinking is that they wouldn't, but I'm curious to see what your guys take it. Thank you.
Chris Hill: Thank you, Kyle. Jason, what do you think?
Jason Moser: I love the way of a Motley Fool Money hotline. That's like the coolest thing ever. Kyle, great question. I think that you're thinking about this the right way. Now it does depend on the company and the nature of what they're selling. Generally speaking, no, you're not going to see those prices come back down. For example, I mean, if you look at consumer-facing businesses and I'll just use Chipotle and Starbucks as easy examples, they've passed along some price increases here recently for obvious reasons, they are not likely to bring those prices back down in the future, even though the commodity inputs for the products they're ultimately producing might come down over time. Because you've got to think of everything that's tied to those price increases. Primarily, you look at something like raising wages along the way too. They're paying their employees more. Well, you definitely can't take that back. But one thing these companies do, they're very clever, they give them room to pull levers on offers. You look at Starbucks, they've done things with like the treat receipt or Chipotle's free Queso or BOGO offers, so the consumer at some point or another, they feel like they're getting something, we're very quick to forget those price increases that they pass through. Jason and Kyle hit it, which is on the commodity side. If you're shopping for gas or maybe you're at the home depot buying lumber, you're going to see prices come down there because those prices will adjust, and they're not based on value-add activities that companies like Starbucks and Chipotle are doing with products and services. You'll see that the commodity level, it's really rare to see it at the consumer retail level if you're buying something.

Jason Moser: Yes, sir. A stock that my colleague, Tom King and I reasonably recommended to members really proud of this one, and I've talked about it here before. Dan, you may remember Procore ticker, PCOR, construction management software earnings came out this week on Wednesday aftermarket close, very positive reaction to what was a good quarter. One hundred a million dollars in revenue that represented organic growth of 34 percent well above what they guided for a quarter ago. They ended the quarter with 13,403 customers, that was up 20 percent from a year ago. They did see some increases while these are pressures on the cost side, I think it's nice to see at least increases in business travel. Chris, people are getting back out their, I love to see it. Some increases in cloud hosting expenses as well that give them a little pause. I think they try to be a little conservative as far as the guidance goes into a material financing program that I've mentioned is still in the very early stages that are learning from that. But expecting revenue between $690 and $694 million for the full year business that is on its way, I think.
Chris Hill: Dan, question about Procore.
Dan Boyd: We're heading back to Carpinteria, California with this one. [laughs] Can't wait to visit. Jason, I don't know anything about this industry. Software for construction companies, what does this even look like? Or you know Carpinteria, Dan? That's just where we got to leave it, I think. Now hats off to you if forgetting that one. Matt Argersinger, what are you looking at this week?
Matthew Argersinger: Dan, I think this one you'll understand a little better. I'm going with Stanley Black & Decker tickers SWK, they make tools for customers and various industries. You probably know some of the brands like Stanley Black & Decker craftsmen, BOSTITCH. If you've renovated home like I've done in the past. Dividend Aristocrat, 55 years of consecutive dividend increases, they've actually paid a dividend for 146 consecutive years. It's remarkable dividends, 3.4 percent. They recently slashed guidance, stocks came way down. I think it might be a bargain, so that's on my radar right now.
Chris Hill: Dan, question about Stanley Black & Decker.
Dan Boyd: Stanley tools are pretty expensive, Chris. You'd think that the stock would be pretty expensive too, but with the recent dip it might be at a discount right now.
Chris Hill: Hey, I love that, Dan. I love that thinking. What do you want to add to your watch list, Dan.
Dan Boyd: I'll tell you, Chris. Again, I don't know anything about Procore. That's seems [laughs] like a complete black hole of an industry domain. But I do know a thing or two about power tools, so I think I'm going to go with Stanley Black & Decker this time.
Chris Hill: We'll leave it there then. Jason Moser, Matt Argersinger, guys, thanks so much for being here.
Jason Moser: Thank you.
Dan Boyd: Thanks, Chris.
Chris Hill: That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money radio show. The show is mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Chris Hill, thanks for listening. We'll see you next time.

2022-08-09 00:00:00+00:00,2 Mistakes Shopify Has to Fix,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-mistakes-shopify-has-to-fix,,,"Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) has had a great growth story over the years. From less than $1.1 billion in revenue in 2018, the tech company more than quadrupled that tally, hitting $4.6 billion last year. However, for investors, the focus is now on its slowing growth rate and the challenges ahead for the company. Shares of Shopify are down 70% this year (versus just 13% losses for the S&P 500) in what looks to be an endless tailspin.
There are two particular mistakes the company has made in recent years that are causing its investors misery these days.
Shopify was too focused on growth and neglected costs
One of the things I always questioned about the tech company's growth was all the different avenues it was pursuing. It has a successful e-commerce platform that makes it easy for anyone to become a merchant and integrate with a website. But building on that success hasn't been enough -- in 2019, for instance, it went on a tangent and launched Shopify Studios, which is aimed at film and TV production.
In 2020, it also announced plans to spend $1 billion to build a distribution network across the U.S. that would put it on a collision course with online retail giant Amazon, threatening to lure away its merchants. It's a risky (and costly) move to take. Last month, it furthered that strategy with the completion of its $2.1 billion acquisition of fulfillment technology company Deliverr, as it aims to provide Shopify merchants with an easy-to-use logistics platform.
The problem with this is that Shopify probably should have been a bit more conservative with these expansion efforts as its operations aren't consistently profitable and margins are generally thin at best. Compared to other platforms, it just isn't generating strong numbers.
Data by YCharts.
Focusing too much on growth at a time when the business is still struggling with profitability may only exacerbate the company's problems. In July, the company announced it would be laying off 10% of its staff. However, more drastic cost reductions may be necessary in order to improve its margins.
The company was too bullish on its future
One of the startling admissions in announcing the layoffs was that Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke acknowledged he was wrong in projecting that trends stemming from the pandemic would become permanent. In the press release announcing the layoffs, Shopify stated: ""We bet that the channel mix -- the share of dollars that travel through e-commerce rather than physical retail -- would permanently leap ahead by five or even 10 years.""
That rosy outlook led the company to hire over-specialized and duplicate roles. Shopify also admits it had groups that were ""convenient to have but too far removed from building products."" In essence, the company allowed itself to get bloated with staff and expenses on an extremely optimistic forecast.
It's a rude awakening for a company that thought it could get away with non-stop spending, because the growth was there. When the growth slowed (revenue was up just 16% in the second quarter), everything came to a grinding halt.
Adding some conservatism to future forecasts and planning could save the company a lot of headaches going forward. It would also prevent the company from adding overhead and headcount it doesn't really need.
Has Shopify fallen low enough that it's worth investing in?
Shopify is trading around levels last seen in 2019. It's still not a cheap stock -- with a price-to-sales multiple of 10, it is pricier than Etsy (seven times sales) and well above Amazon, eBay, and Wix (each around three times sales). It has generally traded at a premium to those stocks in the past, but whether it still deserves that significant premium is the big question mark.
However, with the company focusing more on managing costs and improving its operations, it could still make for a good buy at its beaten down price. Shopify has the ability to come out stronger if it learns from its recent mistakes. If you're a long-term investor, buying Shopify now could prove to be a good move. There's already plenty of bearishness baked into the growth stock, making it an appealing contrarian buy.

*Stock Advisor returns as of July 27, 2022
This video was recorded on August 2, 2022.
Chris Hill: We've got the latest in heavy equipment, cybersecurity, and social media. Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Chris Hill, joined in studio by Motley Fool senior analyst, Bill Mann.
Bill Mann: How sweet does that sound?
Chris Hill: It certainly feels good to say.
Bill Mann: I mean, not the Bill Mann part, but the in studio part.
Chris Hill: It's pretty darn sweet. I got to tell you. Let's start with Caterpillar, shall we? Second quarter revenue lower than Wall Street was expecting due to supply chain issues and the company exiting Russia. This can't be a surprise. That was overwhelmingly my thought when I was reading through how Caterpillar did, and it's not terrible. The stock's down three percent about what you would expect for a company of their size and scope. But we're not really surprised by any of this, are we?
Bill Mann: We really shouldn't be. They had a miss. Their biggest miss came in the construction industry, which you could easily see why that would be the case. As you've said, there are supply chain issues, they've had a huge issue. One of Caterpillar's largest markets is China and things have ground to a stop in China in terms of housing construction, in terms of infrastructure construction. I guess to me, the surprise is that the consensus was as high as it was. This was a great quarter for Caterpillar, given that backdrop.
Chris Hill: Shares are outperforming the S&P 500 year to date, which is to say it's down but just not down as much as the overall market. I think of Caterpillar as being in the category of stocks that are big blue chip. They pay a dividend, they're not going to go anywhere. Am I missing something or is that how people should think about a company like Caterpillar? Like, hey, if you're looking to build out the dividend part of your portfolio, kick the tires on this one.
Bill Mann: Was that a joke?
Chris Hill: I didn't. [laughs] I really didn't mean it to be, I really didn't.
Bill Mann: Well done, though. Yes. Caterpillar is one of those companies that should behave about at the same level as global GDP growth, maybe a little bit ahead of it. It's a fine company. There are not that many competitors in most of Caterpillar's businesses at its size. But because it is so defined by how the economy is going, if the economy is not going well, for example, now their cost structures are really not going very well for them. As I said earlier, China's not going very well for them. They have supply chain issues. Yes. I mean, it is a great company to own. You are very unlikely to find yourself waking up one morning and Caterpillar has rugged you. But at the same time, it's not going to be a massive, massive grower.
Chris Hill: Thank you for using rug as a verb. Arista Networks, the cloud networking cybersecurity company posted second quarter profits and revenue that were higher than expected. They had upbeat guidance for the current quarter and yet shares are flat. Are we not entertained?
Bill Mann: We should be entertained. In fact, it's started this morning of up about 6.5 percent. By the time we actually end today, the trading day, it could be anywhere, was a great quarter for them. I mean, you could see why. Arista Networks is an absolutely necessary component in cloud computing and enterprise. They've grown very, very quickly, 49 percent revenue growth, which is if there was described as a little oasis of positivity in a market that doesn't show very much of it. They also talked about a supply chain environment that is troubling for them. Their quarter may have even been better, but their CEO, Jayshree Ullal, is one of the best in America. I mean, full stop. She is absolutely fantastic and managing their business at not getting too far ahead of their skis, and this is a company that is running on as many cylinders as you can be in the current environment.
Chris Hill: If you step back from Arista Networks, I don't want to say every company is going to be able to say this, but I feel like they're going to be a lot of companies this earnings season that we're going to have that to say about them like, hey, this was good and if they're doing this level of performance in this environment, the bull case is obviously, gosh, when things get better on a macro level, they're just going to tear the roof off of things.
Bill Mann: Have you ever seen one of those like word clouds?
Chris Hill: Yes.
Bill Mann: I think if you do a word cloud for earnings reports this time, the one that's going to be at the very center, gosh, it's two words, not one. One is supply chains. Supply chain is one that nearly every company will be able to credibly point to and say that this has been an impact on how they have done over the last quarter. Some of them will be using that as an excuse. But in a lot of cases it makes a ton of sense. Yes, for Arista to have come out and have been, as I said, this little oasis of positivity, I think that it's very credible to say that in a normal operating environment, whenever we got one of those, but in a normal operating environment, their results would have been even better.
Chris Hill: Jayshree Ullal, as Bill mentioned, the CEO of Arista Networks, she has been a guest of ours at Motley Fool investing conferences in the past. She is not going to be at this year's Fool Fest, which is our annual investing conference. It's a two-day event on August 29th and 30th, and there'll be breakout sessions featuring different investing strategies. We have a great lineup of speakers, including Trex CEO, Bryan Fairbanks, Motley Fool Co-founder, David Gardner, our friend Morgan Housel, Michael Mauboussin.
Bill Mann: Yes.
Chris Hill: Investor extraordinary Michael Mauboussin, who you're going to be interviewing on the main stage.
Bill Mann: I will and I can't wait. I'm glad that you actually got around to saying who was going to be there as opposed to who was because that's not good marketing. [laughs]
Chris Hill: I'm doing my best.
Bill Mann: I cannot wait.
Chris Hill: Yeah, it's going to be great. Fool Fest is free for Motley Fool members so. If you are not yet a member, that's easy to remedy. You can sign up for our Stock Advisor service and get a complimentary digital pass to the event. Just go to fool.com/foolfest. All one word for the details. I'll put the link in the show notes. That's fool.com/foolfest. The stock of the day is Pinterest. I don't even remember the last time I said that second-quarter results weren't great, guidance wasn't great, but shares are up more than 10 percent today after Pinterest user numbers showed some promise and activist investor Elliott Management confirmed that it is the company's biggest shareholder and has, ""Conviction in the value creation opportunity that it sees,"" which I think is a fancy way of saying.
Bill Mann: It's cheap. [laughs]
Chris Hill: The stock is cheap and when these people get their monetization house in order, we think it can start ringing the cash register.
Bill Mann: Elliott Investment, they are no joke and they are specifically no joke within the social media segment. They've done great things at eBay. They were on their board, they've been on the board at Twitter. Maybe that's still a little bit of a work in progress, but they're not coming in. When you think of activist investors, you think of someone who's coming in and it's the Gordon Gekko, we're going to shake things up. They don't really have that opportunity to do so at Pinterest because the founder, Ben Silbermann, has the lion's share of the vote. He's got 37 percent of the total votes so they can't come in and push him around. Ben Silbermann decided to step away in June. Bill Ready is the new CEO, ex-[Alphabet's] Google guy. I would suspect that Elliott had a hand in having him come. It's going to be really interesting to see what they have to say as things progress at Pinterest. Pinterest is really the largest dataset that's out there for consumers that are not aligned with one of the big companies with [Meta's] Facebook, with Google, with Apple, so it's a great resource.
Chris Hill: It's going to be really interesting to see how this plays out because to this point, Bill Ready, who as you said, has been CEO for about an hour-and-a-half, nothing he has said and nothing that we've heard from Elliott Management points to pie in the sky aspirations both in terms of future guidance or in terms of levers that they can pull. They're talking about some pretty basic blocking and tackling ways to monetize the platform in a way that seems like it would be additive to the experience for people who use Pinterest and wouldn't drive them away. My hunch is that they are keenly observant of the language around Instagram and how people who have been on Instagram for a long time are talking about how the platform has changed and changed in a way that they don't really like. There is an opportunity here and you want to say, good luck. There's a way for you to do this without blowing it.
Bill Mann: Yeah, and so one of the things that they've pointed to was their international markets where on a per user basis they're only making a dime to about $0.15 per user. It should not be hard if you are at that level, and just to level set, Twitter makes a couple of dollars per user. Twitter again, is not even close to the best participant in this market. Pinterest has not done a great job in monetizing a huge amount of its members who show up and create their own material. They create their own content. They have a partnership with Shopify that they signed in 2020 that I think that they can lean on more, so you are not talking about an experience that should be that markedly different for its user base, which is always a risk. If you come in and you turn it, you go from being, this is something that is as helpful as possible to, it is as profitable as possible. Well, that's great, but you're going to be profiting off of a low or smaller user base by virtue of pushing people out. Pinterest, it's good news and bad news. They don't have to do much to be a much more profitable company.
Chris Hill: Let me ask you something about activist investors because you said, the image of Gordon Gekko coming in, we're going to shake things up. That's true in some cases. Is Elliott Management an activist investor that when you see they are involved in this company, the image, the reaction you have is positive, and if not, are there ones out there that you think, ""Okay, this activist is getting involved all right, I'm going to pay a little bit more attention to this situation because these are serious people, these are not rabble-rousers?""
Bill Mann: It's a really good question and I would put Elliott at the top of the list along with Gotham Partners, with Bill Ackman, and Jana Partners, which are activists who aren't coming in looking for that quick hit. That's always the thought. Again, I brought up Gordon Gekko earlier, obviously in Wall Street, that's what he was trying to do to break up the company in profit anyway that he possibly could. These folks are long term investors now, they do come in with smiles but they are capable of going more hostile if they need to, but that's not their MO.
Chris Hill: As you said in the case of Pinterest, that's not going to work.
Bill Mann: Well, it could work. Yes.
Chris Hill: It's not going to work in the way that it would work with other companies where the founder is not there with the lion share votes.
Bill Mann: They can't vote anybody out by themselves. A proxy battle is not going to work out for them very well because at least 37 percent of the votes are already against them. But there are other levers that they could pull. You've seen it, you saw it with Uber where basically they embarrass Travis Kalanick out of the building. There are things that they could do, but I would not expect that to be the case with Elliott and Pinterest.
Chris Hill: Bill Mann, great talking to you as always, thanks for being here.
Bill Mann: Thanks, Chris.
Chris Hill: Are we in a recession right now? Are we headed toward one? Apparently, it's a little more debatable than we all thought. Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp discuss the indicators commonly associated with recessions and which ones they're watching.
Alison Southwick: Here's something you're probably hearing in the news a lot lately. Key indicator falls fueling recession fears. Yes, the GDP decline for the second quarter in a row, and that is a big one. But what about the VIX, the Jolts, and someone named Sahm, who is making rules? As we've briefly explained before, recessions are officially declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which defines them as, ""A significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months."" While NBER is the final word, they tend to be more backwards looking like someone assessing a car accident, you know your car has been damaged, but you don't know the extent until you get an expert opinion. Today, we thought we'd talk about some of those numbers to watch that are perhaps a little bit more forward-looking, what they mean, and if they really are Harbingers of dark times ahead.
Robert Brokamp: We're going to take a look at four things that may or may not give you a hint about what the economy and the stock market is going to do. What's first up, Alison?
Alison Southwick: The VIX. What is it? Well, bro, the VIX is created by the Chicago Board Options Exchange or CBOE, and it's the Volatility Index or the VIX as it's efficiently and affectionately called. It's also known as the fear gauge, super not-for boating at all. It's a forward-looking benchmark for volatility over the coming 30 days. How? Well, they look at the prices of S&P 500 Index options with near-term expiration dates. Apparently, it's quite a complicated formula and you're welcome to google it yourself. Well, not always true, typically the VIX rises when stocks fall and declines when stocks rise. The higher the VIX, the more furiousness and uncertainty ahead. The highest the VIX has closed at has been in the low eighties, and that was back in March of 2020. The lowest it has closed is around nine and that was in November of 2017. Currently, the VIX is hanging out in the low twenties.
Robert Brokamp: It is right now at 21, which is the historical average. That's down from above 30 in mid-June. It came down because as you pointed out, it goes in the opposite direction of stocks and stocks went up. In fact, in July, the S&P 500 returned nine percent, and the NASDAQ returned 12 percent. Last July actually was the best month for stocks since 2020, so stocks went up, the VIX came down. You might ask, does any of this matter? I would say on most days, actually not really. I think the VIX is most interesting in the extreme. You probably have all heard that old Warren Buffett adage, ""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."" Readings in the low teens or even lower for the VIX, it could mean that investors have gotten greedy and maybe complacent. It generally happens after a few good years.
You pointed out the lowest rating was in 2017, another time when it got almost at low was 2007, and in both of those years, the following year, the market drops. We're not market timers at the Fool, so now saying that if the VIX is low, you should sell, but if the VIX gets real low, especially after a string of several good years, you might want to think about rebalancing your portfolio. Now, what about the other direction when the VIX has shot up? After all, there's another adage, ""When the VIX is high, it's time to buy."" According to Hartford Funds, there have been eight times when the VIX has been above 40 since 1990, and that was the year the VIX was launched.
There usually have been times when the market has either hit a blip or was in a full-blown bear market, so was that a good time to buy? While the S&P 500 posted a positive return a year later in six of those eight times. Basically a 75 percent success rate. That's actually about right in line with the historical average of stocks making money in three out of every four years since the 1920s. But I calculated the average one-year returns of the S&P 500 after the VIX hit 40, and I got 17 percent and that's well above the long-term average of 10 percent, though again, that did include a couple of down years. Three years after the VIX hit 40, the market was in positive territory every time. The jury is still out on the last time, which was during the pandemic panic of 2020, but we'll get the verdict on that in early 2023. There might be something to buying when the VIX is high, but during times when the VIX is just mosing around, not particularly high, not particularly low, like right now, I don't usually pay too much attention to it.
Alison Southwick: Let's move on to our next number to watch. The New York Times calls it Wall Street's most talked about recession indicator, and it's sounding, its loudest alarm in two decades. It's the yield curve. Yes, the yield curve compares the interest rates of various US government bonds, notably Three-month bills and two-year and 10-year treasury notes. Typically, investors expect to earn higher interest when their money is tied up longer. The 10-year pays more than the two-year and the two-year pay more than the bills that mature in three months. If you plot them on a chart with maturity time on the X-axis and the rate of return on the y-axis it makes a curve up to the right, just how we like our charts here at The Motley Fool.
But every now and then things get inverted and the interest rates for shorter-term US bonds are higher than the rates for longer-term bonds, and the curve bends the other way, and that way is down and we like grafts that go up. When the yield curve is inverted, it reflects the feelings of investors that the economy is going to tank and it's got some predictive power so you may be wondering, what is the yield curve up these days? But apparently the signal it is sending hasn't been this dire since late 2000, when the bubble in tech stocks have begun to burst and recession took hold. This is what I'm seeing in the headlines, Bro, is it really that dire?
Robert Brokamp: I would say this is actually one that I do pay attention to, so according to a reserve study published in 2018, the yield curve has inverted before every recession since 1955. That said, the timing is rather variable. The recessions have come within six months to as much as three years after the inversion, so it doesn't mean you have to panic immediately. According to Anu Gaggar of the Commonwealth Financial Network, the spread between the two year and 10 year notes has inverted 28 times since 1900 and 22 of these instances, a recession followed. There happens six false alarms over the 120 past years. But still, it's a pretty remarkable record, so where are we now? So the two year 10 year yield is inverted, the two year is yielding 2.9 percent, the 10 year is 2.6 percent. That 10 years come down pretty significantly since above 3.5 percent in June, so that's been a big drop. But the three-month and 10 year is not inverted in many people think that's the one you should pay most attention to, including Fed chair Jerome Powell. But the bottom line is, regardless of whether or not we enter a tactical recession, the yield curve is telling us to expect that the economy is going to be sluggish for awhile.
Alison Southwick: Next number to watch. The housing starts track how much residential housing was, started. It's a weird little phrase, but somehow it works. The census bureau releases the figures on the 12th business day of the month, they estimate housing starts from building permits issued by a sample of local permitting offices and then track those projects through completion and sale. Buying a new house is a big ticket item and then of course you have to fill it with stuff. If there are a lot of houses being built in response to demand, then that's a leading indicator of the health of the economy and future spending. It reflects the level of America's optimism and ability to even afford a house and all the things that go in it. How are we feeling America? Are we ready to go buy a house? New US homebuilding activity fell to a nine-month low in June. Not great, but with all the supply chain issues and rising interest rates, you're probably not too surprised to hear that.
Robert Brokamp: Because if we were to think about like all the parts of labour that go into building a house. There are all the materials and then there're all the workers, the plumbers, electricians, to turn it into a house and not to mention all of the sales team that gets together and sells the place. That's a lot of economic activity under one roof. A lot less activity when fewer walls and roofs get constructed and that's what's happening now, to new homes and also to existing homes but it's the decline in housing starts that can really weigh on the economy. Lance Lambert wrote a good article for Fortune.com in which he argues that this is what the Fed wants because it'll bring down inflation and here's one of the early paragraphs. ""Historically speaking, the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting playbook always starts with housing, it goes like this.
The Central Bank begins playing upward pressure on mortgage rates, not long afterwards, home sales sink and existing home inventory spikes then homebuilders begin to cut back. That causes demand for both commodities like lumber and steel and durable goods like windows or refrigerators to fall. Those economic contractions then quickly spread throughout the rest of the economy and in theory, helped to rein in runaway inflation."" Frankly, so far it's working, sales are down inventory is up and an increasing number of people are cancelling their housing contracts. Housing starts or something to keep an eye on and right now they're not looking too good.
Alison Southwick: We talked about housing starts and then of course before that the yield curve and both of those seem to suggest that a recession is common around the mountain. But there's a reason why Harry Truman once said, ""Give me a one-handed economist. All of my economists say 'on the one hand, but 'then on the other."" These days the other hand is unemployment. Many experts argue that it's hard to say we're in or near a recession when unemployment is at 3.6 percent, the second lowest rate over the last 50 years. They're almost two openings for each person looking for a job which is historically very high. How will we know when things begin to change? You could look at the job openings and labour turnover survey, AKA the jolts put out every month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Job openings are indeed starting to fall as of the main numbers. But if you're looking for how we'll know if the job market is indicating we're in a recession, have you considered the Sahm rule developed by the former Federal Reserve and White House economist, Claudia Sahm. According to this indicator, when the three-month moving average of the national unemployment rate rises by 0.5 percent or more relative to its low during the previous 12 months, we're likely in a recession.
Robert Brokamp: The Sahm rules are relatively recent development. It was just announced to the world in 2019 and by the way, Sahm is spelt S-A-H-M in case you want to look it up. According to the original research paper, since 1970, there were no false alarms. Thus, it seems like a pretty good recession indicator from the job market. What is it saying today, while the current unemployment rate of 3.6 percent is the lowest we've seen over the past year. The Sahm rule would be triggered if the three-month average rose to 4.1 percent. Given how the job market looks, it seems like it would take several months to get to that point, but we'll keep an eye on it.
Alison Southwick: Now Bloomberg, they also do a monthly survey of economists, and they found that the probability of a downturn over the next 12 months stands at 47.5 percent and that's up from 30 percent odds in June. Bro, after we've finished talking about all these numbers in all the fields, the question is, does the fear of going into a recession, should that change how you invest and save today?
Robert Brokamp: It certainly makes sense to keep an eye on these things and if you are in or near retirement, once things start looking a little dicier, it might make sense to play it somewhat safer, maybe rebalance your portfolio, maybe have a little bit, but we're cash on the side. Of course, the market is already down, some of these indicators, like the flattening of the yield curve for giving a warning at the end of last year and if you paid attention, then that would have been a good time. If you're still working, the number one risk of a recession is job loss or maybe a pay cut. What you should be doing is really taking a look at your job and making sure you're demonstrating as much value as possible to your employers and your customers to ensure that you'll still be able to earn a paycheck regardless of what happens to the economy.

2022-08-07 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Stocks We're Buying In August,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-stocks-were-buying-in-august,,,"It's too soon to say if the bear market of 2022 is over or not, but July was a good month for the stock market. After an absolute drubbing in the first half of the year, many beaten-down stocks rallied to kick off the summer. With company earnings rolling in and showing resilience in the face of economic problems, now looks like a good time to be a buyer for investors with a long-term mindset.
Three Fool.com contributors are scooping up shares of an adtech, a fintech, and a top consumer brands company in August. Here's why they think The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD), PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), and RH (NYSE: RH) are on their buy lists right now.
Digital advertising is the future
Anders Bylund (The Trade Desk): I'm keeping a close eye on The Trade Desk nowadays. Whenever The Fool's ironclad disclosure rules allow it, I intend to double down on my investment in this digital marketing services expert.
The stock has fallen 59% below last November's all-time peak prices. The price cuts had little to do with The Trade Desk's business results or future prospects, as the company has delivered nothing but positive earnings and revenue surprises in the last three years. Instead, investors saw this stock as a high-flying market darling that required a price correction in this inflationary and unpredictable economy.
The stock isn't exactly cheap, trading at 59 times free cash flows and 48 times forward earnings estimates. However, that's actually a bargain in the context of this company's skyrocketing sales. Many companies in the digital advertising sector are talking about low demand for their ad services, but The Trade Desk's revenue line didn't get that memo. Sales jumped 43% higher in the first quarter, compared to the 2021 result. On top of that robust top-line trend, The Trade Desk is an efficient cash machine that converts roughly 30% of every revenue dollar into free cash flows:
TTD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
This company is going places in the long run, generating tons of cash profits along the way. So I'll gladly invest more cash in my The Trade Desk holdings at these lower prices -- whenever I might be allowed to do so.
Consumer activity is still strong, inflation or not
Nicholas Rossolillo (PayPal): PayPal has been a terrible stock to own for the last year or so. Even after some reprieve last month, shares are down over 70% from their all-time high reached in mid-2021.
But recent earnings from top digital payment network companies Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA) indicate the global consumer is hanging in there in spite of inflation issues. With basic living expenses rising far too fast, households are cutting spend on everything but household basics in the consumer goods department. Travel, on the other hand, is going strong -- especially in the U.S.
That's great news for PayPal. Though its apps are often used on e-commerce sites, a category that has cooled off big-time, Venmo in particular is doing well as people increasingly rely on it to move money around. Venmo is also gaining ground as a payment option for merchants and small businesses, with many of those micro-businesses benefiting from consumer travel and experience trends. Its second-quarter 2022 earnings report was far from perfect, but revenue grew 9% year over year (or up 14% when excluding eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), which parted ways with PayPal to develop its own digital payments platform).
PayPal is also highly profitable. Free cash flow jumped 22% year over year in Q2 to $1.3 billion. The company also announced a $15 billion share repurchase program to be executed over time, representing a big return of excess cash to shareholders.
As of this writing, PayPal trades for 22 times trailing-12-month free cash flow. This company's days of super-fast growth are likely in the rearview mirror, but I think it trades for an attractive price given its steady expansion and cash-generating potential.
Buying a luxury brand at a bargain multiple
Billy Duberstein (RH): When the market is focused on the short term, investors should look long-term. That's why I've been adding to my stake in high-end furniture retailer RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware.
RH has been bouncing around the mid-$200s, down from a 52-week high of $744 per share last year, and its price-to-earnings (PE) ratio has fallen to 9, as the housing and consumer spending boom went bust. On June 29, RH management pre-announced a lowering of its full-year estimates. The company now expects a revenue decline of 2% to 5%, but to maintain healthy adjusted (non-GAAP) operating margins between 21% to 22%.
Not only is RH's sector going through tough times, but RH CEO Gary Friedman is also repositioning the business, with an ambitious plan to become the premier luxury brand of the furniture business. The company is increasing quality, raising prices, and converting its legacy mall stores into massive design galleries, which look like museums.
The transition has caused RH to lose some of its low-end customer base, but the bet is that it will make more overall profit dollars by segmenting upwards. Given its resilient margins, that transition appears to be going well.
As you can see, traditional luxury brands in other consumer categories tend to garner a much higher PE ratio:
Data by YCharts.
2022 also marks a critical turning point in RH's transition, as the company will be opening its first European Design Gallery, The Gallery at the Historic Aynho Park, a ""magical 17th-century, 73-acre estate in the English countryside that will introduce RH to the UK in a dramatic and unforgettable fashion.""
In addition to international expansion, RH is also extending its brand to things besides furniture. This year will see the opening of RH Guesthouse hotels, an RH live fire restaurant and RH champagne and caviar bar concept, and RH-branded charter planes and yachts.
So not only are investors buying RH today at a low valuation based on its ""old"" self, but they are also buying the brand at a meaningful inflection point. If Friedman's strategy works, RH could see both a recovery in growth and a large rerating in its valuation to a ""luxury"" multiple, leading to massive potential upside.
While the economy is definitely looking precarious at the moment, the wealthy tend to spend even through economic downturns, as long as they don't turn into a massive recession. RH has a solid balance sheet and high margins, so it should be able to survive this and thrive on the other side. It's a contrarian bet to make in this down market for consumer discretionary names.

2022-08-06 00:00:00+00:00,Is PayPal Holdings Stock a Buy Now?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-paypal-holdings-stock-a-buy-now,,,"PayPal Holdings' (NASDAQ: PYPL) stock price popped 9% on Aug. 3 after the digital payments company posted its second-quarter results. Its revenue rose 9% year over year (10% in constant currency terms) to $6.81 billion, beating analysts' expectations by $20 million. Its adjusted net income fell 21% to $1.08 billion, or $0.93 per share, which still topped estimates by six cents.
PayPal cleared those low bars, but has its stock finally bottomed out after losing nearly two-thirds of its value over the past 12 months? Let's review the key numbers to see if this stock is worth buying again.
Image source: PayPal.
What happened to PayPal?
PayPal made two big mistakes over the past year. First, it experienced robust growth during the pandemic as more people made online purchases, but it failed to prepare for the subsequent post-pandemic slowdown, which was exacerbated by the loss of its longtime partner (and former parent company) eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) to its European rival Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y). eBay signed on with Adyen in 2018 and finished moving most of its sellers to its platform last year.
Second, PayPal overpromised and underdelivered. During an investor day presentation last February, PayPal claimed it could nearly double its active accounts from 377 million in 2020 to 750 million in 2025. But this February, it abandoned that goal and said it would focus on boosting its average revenues per user with new features instead.
The abrupt departure of its longtime CFO John Rainey in May raised additional red flags, and investors grew increasingly concerned about PayPal's ability to keep growing as inflation throttled consumer spending. Rising interest rates also made its high-flying stock -- which traded at nearly 70 times its adjusted earnings in 2021 last July -- a lot less appealing.
Its growth is still decelerating
PayPal's number of active accounts rose 6% year over year to 429 million in the second quarter. Its total payment volume (TPV) grew 13% to $339.8 billion, and its total transactions increased 16% to 5.51 billion. However, all three key growth rates have decelerated significantly over the past year.

On the bright side, PayPal's year-over-year revenue growth accelerated for the first time in five quarters as the expansion of its peer-to-peer payments app Venmo offset the slower growth of its namesake services. Venmo ended the second quarter with nearly 90 million active accounts, compared to 52 million active accounts at the end of 2019. Lapping the stimulus-induced spending last year and almost completely decoupling from eBay -- which only accounted for 2.5% of its revenue in the second quarter -- also contributed to the stabilization of PayPal's top-line growth.
PayPal's guidance suggests that stabilization will continue. On a constant currency basis, it expects its third-quarter revenue to rise 12% year over year and for its full-year revenue to increase 11% to $27.85 billion. It also expects to add 10 million new active accounts for the full year.
Its margins are still being squeezed
PayPal's top-line growth is stabilizing, but its adjusted operating margin declined both sequentially and year over year to 19.1% in the second quarter.

Part of that year-over-year decline can be attributed to tough comparisons to its release of credit reserves throughout 2021, but it was also exacerbated by higher investments in its digital wallet, e-commerce, cryptocurrency, and buy now, pay later (BNPL) services.
PayPal expects its adjusted EPS to decline 14% to 15% year over year in the third quarter and to fall 14% to 16% for the full year. That outlook seems grim, but PayPal expects its operating margins to expand again in the fourth quarter of 2022 and throughout 2023 as it reins in its spending and prioritizes its ""highest conviction growth opportunities"" (checkout services, digital wallets, and its Braintree backend software). It also hired a new CFO, Blake Jorgensen, to lead those cost-cutting efforts.
PayPal also authorized a fresh $15 billion stock buyback, including about $4 billion to be deployed this year, to back up its confident outlook. During the conference call, CEO Dan Schulman said he expects the pace of its buybacks to ""remain aggressive"" because he believes ""there's currently a unique and attractive opportunity to return capital to our shareholders.""
Is it finally safe to buy PayPal?
At $100 per share, PayPal trades at about 26 times this year's adjusted earnings. That's a reasonable valuation, but it's not a screaming bargain yet. I believe PayPal's taking a few steps in the right direction, but I'd like to see a few quarters of solid progress -- instead of more ambitious promises -- before I consider betting on its long-term turnaround.

2022-08-06 00:00:00+00:00,"Got $5,000? Buy This World-Class Fintech Stock While It's Down 49%",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/got-%245000-buy-this-world-class-fintech-stock-while-its-down-49,,,"Shares of mobile payment leader PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) have surrendered 49% of their value year to date, thanks to a broader sell-off linked to stubbornly high inflation and rising interest rates. Macro headwinds, in addition to company-related issues like eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) transition to a different payments platform, has led to less-than-ideal growth for the financial technology (fintech) giant of late.
But I expect PayPal's business to spring back in a major way. Not only does the company hold 50.3% of the online payments processing market, but it also continues to broaden its business with service offerings such as Venmo -- a leading peer-to-peer payment platform -- and buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), an up-and-coming concept that allows consumers to pay for items in an equal number of installments over a set period of time.
With all that in mind, let's have a look at PayPal's present state to help investors gauge whether the stock is worth their time today.
Image source: Getty Images.
Let's focus on the fundamentals
PayPal delivered its second-quarter earnings digest after hours on Aug. 2, sparking a much-needed rebound in its stock price. The company's total sales rose 9.1% year over year to $6.8 billion, finishing in-line with Wall Street estimates, and its adjusted earnings per share declined 19.1% to $0.93 but managed to top consensus forecasts by 6.6%.
Meanwhile, its total payment volume (TPV) was $339.8 billion, growing 9.3% from a year ago. The company also added 400,000 new accounts to bring its total up to 429 million.
PayPal's growth in the quarter was fine, but it certainly wasn't flawless. During theearnings call Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman stated that eBay payment transition caused a 400-basis-point drag on top-line growth in Q2. But on the bright side, he also noted that the effect should fall to 100 basis points next quarter and be negligible from there on out.
eBay previously signed an agreement with Adyen, a global payment processor, to serve as its primary payments processing partner, seizing the position from PayPal. As a result, the digital payments company is currently facing growing pains, but it should be in good shape once eBay is fully out of the picture. Ex-eBay revenue growth has been consistently north of 20%.
Schulman also discussed the company's aim to reduce its cost structure through leveraging its massive scale to drive cost reductions across its supplier base. In 2022, it expects to reduce costs by $900 million across operating and transaction expense categories, and in 2023, it's forecasting an additional $1.3 billion in savings.
That's not to say PayPal isn't in a healthy financial position already -- the company has $8.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, and it generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in Q2 alone. That translates to 21.9% growth year over year. Even after its fresh surge, PayPal still trades at 29 times earnings, representing a major discount from its five-year average price-to-earnings multiple of 57.2. In other words, investors shouldn't feel like they're too late to the game to buy shares.
Should investors shell out for PayPal today?
PayPal is a steadfast investment right now for patient, long-term investors. In many ways, I can understand the steady fallback we've been seeing with fintech companies, as it's very common for investors to dump speculative stocks during times of economic uncertainty.
But PayPal is different -- the fintech juggernaut not only commands a large chunk of the budding mobile payments market, but it's also highly profitable and consistently generates FCF. That doesn't sound like a speculative investment to me, yet investors continue to punish the company in such a manner. Pair that with its all-time low valuation, and PayPal appears like a fantastic investment opportunity today.

Further, the same trend was observed over the last ten days (19% vs 4%) and one month (31% vs 7%).
The company offers an online marketplace for unique and creative goods. It released the second-quarter results last week, outperforming the consensus estimates of revenues and earnings. Despite the tough macroeconomic outlook, the total revenues increased 11% y-o-y to $585.1 million. It was driven by an 11% growth in the marketplace segment and a 9% rise in services revenues. The marketplace segment primarily benefited from an increase in the seller transaction fee, partially offset by lower gross merchandise sales (GMS). Further, the key metrics – active buyers and active sellers, witnessed a 4% and 41.5% growth on a year-on-year basis. That said, the firm’s net income reduced 26% y-o-y to $73 million, mainly due to higher product development costs. Overall, the better-than-expected earnings were the main reason behind positive investor sentiment toward the stock.

2022-08-04 00:00:00+00:00,Is Etsy Stock a Buy after Q2 Earnings?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-etsy-stock-a-buy-after-q2-earnings,,,"Investors were worried heading into the second-quarter earnings update from Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY), but it turns out those concerns were overblown.
Sure, the e-commerce platform posted a rare sales decline compared to soaring results a year ago. And management cautioned about a wide range of potential growth paths through the rest of 2022. But Etsy is still attracting new buyers and finding ways to raise the fees it charges sellers. These factors imply solid profitability through this volatile fiscal year.
Let's dive in and see if this stock is a buy based on the latest earnings.
Sales trended lower in comparison to a strong 2021
As expected, Etsy endured weaker sales trends than investors have seen in recent quarters. Sales volume fell by less than 1% but was up nearly 3% after accounting for currency exchange rate swings.
Investors had been worried that a weakening consumer spending environment would hurt the business, but Etsy avoided that fate. Instead, the company attracted 6 million new buyers to protect the positive momentum from earlier phases of the pandemic. ""Etsy has maintained most of our pandemic gains,"" CEO Josh Silverman said in a press release. Etsy's core marketplace segment has been up 141% since the same period in mid-2019.
Raising fees
The company's rising transaction fees, which it charges sellers for its middleman services, helped offset the impact of higher expenses. Adjusted profit margin rose to 28% of sales from 26% a year ago. Many industry peers, including eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), have been posting weaker profit results on this basis as growth slows.
Etsy's net income declined mainly because management is still investing aggressively in its growth initiatives. These include improvements to the shopping and selling experiences, which have helped the company continue attracting buyers and sellers even as the wider e-commerce market slows.
Sliverman and his team said the Q2 profits demonstrate that Etsy can deliver strong earnings even as the company focuses on growth.
Looking ahead
The best news for investors might have come from Etsy's new outlook. Management sees sales volume landing between $2.8 billion and $3 billion in the third quarter as reported revenue lands as high as $575 million. That result would mark a quick return to accelerating sales growth for the business and would help set Etsy apart from many of its e-commerce peers who are struggling to keep expanding.
The consumer discretionary business will still take a hit if consumer spending slows further or if a recession pushes unemployment higher. But Etsy today can reasonably target another year of solid growth. Investors can also take solace in the fact that the platform is attracting more buyers at a time when peers are struggling on this score.
Those market share gains imply that the business has a strong value proposition to many customers, even as they return to more normal shopping patterns around their homes.
Etsy's competitive advantage relies in part on its ability to market unique products to buyers. The growth trends through the first half of 2022 suggest that the business is finding plenty of ways to lean on that asset to push sales and earnings higher.

2022-08-04 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting EBAY Put And Call Options For September 23rd,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-ebay-put-and-call-options-for-september-23rd,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options begin trading today, for the September 23rd expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new September 23rd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $47.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.95. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $47.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $45.05 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $47.26/share today.
Because the $47.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.15% return on the cash commitment, or 30.29% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $47.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $48.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.90. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $47.26/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $48.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.59% if the stock gets called away at the September 23rd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $48.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $48.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.02% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.35% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $47.26) to be 37%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-08-04 00:00:00+00:00,"eBay (EBAY) Q2 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Dip Y/Y",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-ebay-q2-earnings-beat-estimates-revenues-dip-y-y,,,"eBay Inc. EBAY reported second-quarter 2022 non-GAAP earnings of 99 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10%. Notably, the bottom line remained flat year over year.

Net revenues of $2.42 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.37 billion. However, the figure decreased 9% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis and 6% on a FX-neutral basis.

This was attributed to the softness in transactional activities on eBay’s platform and sluggish marketing services. The company witnessed a year-over-year decline of 12% in the active buyer base, which stood at 138 million at the end of the second quarter.

eBay witnessed declining gross merchandise volume (“GMV”) in the second quarter, which remained an overhang.

Weakening momentum in online shopping, as a result of normalization to the pre-pandemic levels, remained a major headwind.

Nevertheless, strengthening momentum across advertising offerings of the company was a tailwind.

Notably, eBay’s Promoted Listings generated revenues of $232 million, which was up 2% on a reported and 6% on a FX-neutral basis from the prior-year quarter. This remained a positive.
