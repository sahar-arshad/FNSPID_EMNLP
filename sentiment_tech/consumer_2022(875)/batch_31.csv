2022-04-19 00:00:00+00:00,Former eBay executive to plead guilty to cyberstalking campaign targeting couple,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/former-ebay-executive-to-plead-guilty-to-cyberstalking-campaign-targeting-couple-0,,,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON, April 19 (Reuters) - A former eBay Inc EBAY.O security executive intends to plead guilty to federal charges that he planned a cyberstalking campaign that targeted a Massachusetts couple whose online newsletter was seen as critical of the e-commerce company.
James Baugh, eBay's former senior director of safety and security, had been awaiting trial in Boston with another ex-executive accused of helping harass the couple through Twitter and with disturbing deliveries like a bloody Halloween pig mask and live cockroaches.
At the request of Baugh's lawyers, a federal judge on Tuesday scheduled a hearing for him to instead plead guilty on Friday. A May 31 trial remains scheduled for his co-defendant, David Harville, eBay's former director of global resiliency.
William Fick, a lawyer for Baugh, declined to comment.
Baugh is one of seven former eBay workers who were charged in 2020 with harassing the married couple in Natick, Massachusetts, behind the newsletter EcommerceBytes.
They did so after two top executives, including former Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig, expressed frustration with the newsletter, according to prosecutors and a lawsuit the couple, David and Ina Steiner, filed against eBay.
Prosecutors said the Steiners in August 2019 began receiving anonymous, harassing private messages on Twitter and disturbing deliveries to their home that also included fly larvae, spiders and a funeral wreath.
Prosecutors said Baugh planned the threatening messages and deliveries with employees and contractors who reported to him and traveled with some to Massachusetts to surveil the couple.
After learning that Natick police were investigating, Baugh and others deleted messages from their social media accounts, and he lied to eBay investigators by denying that its employees were involved, prosecutors said.
Five other former eBay workers have pleaded guilty. Wenig was not charged and has denied knowing about the scheme. eBay has said it is in settlement talks with the couple.

2022-04-18 00:00:00+00:00,4 Supercharged Tech Stocks to Buy Without Any Hesitation,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-supercharged-tech-stocks-to-buy-without-any-hesitation,,,"Consistent sales growth has proven to be a hallmark for some of the best-performing stocks in recent investing history. This typically stems from the fact that investors feel safe with companies that can show positive results in the form of money, always looking for the best bang for their buck.
Sometimes, in that same vein, many high-growth stocks get ignored due to ""expensive"" valuations compared to their slower-growing yet ""cheaper"" peers. Today, however, we will look at four companies that offer investors high-growth potential at recently reduced prices, making them supercharged growth stocks to consider immediately.
Image source: Getty Images.
Roblox
Operating as one of the few pure-plays already generating free cash flow in the increasingly buzzworthy metaverse, Roblox (NYSE: RBLX) feels like a stodgy veteran in the nascent industry, despite only going public last year.
With over 54 million daily active users (DAUs) exploring the virtual worlds on its namesake platform, Roblox recorded nearly $2 billion in revenue, equaling 108% growth in 2021. In addition, these sales created over $550 million in free cash flow, which rose 36% in 2021.
Due to this increasing cash generation and lowered share price, Roblox has reached one of the lowest price to free cash flow (P/FCF) ratios in its history.
RBLX Price to Free Cash Flow data by YCharts
With analysts expecting an average of 59% revenue growth for 2022, this P/FCF of 38 looks particularly promising. Anytime a stock's projected growth rate is higher than its P/FCF, it catches my eye, representing growth at a fair price.
Best yet for investors, Roblox is beginning to tap into large-scale brand partnerships with some of the most well-known companies in the world. As these partnerships grow and Roblox attracts brands to its platform, this new revenue stream should pair beautifully with its current subscription plans and sales of Robux (its virtual currency).
Thanks to this optionality and relatively cheap growth prospects, Roblox offers supercharged potential to any risk-tolerant portfolio.
CrowdStrike
Operating through its beautifully simple mission, ""We stop breaches,"" CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) has quickly become the market leader among endpoint detection and response (EDR) providers -- currently owning a 14% share of the market.
Led by its artificial intelligence-driven cybersecurity platform -- and its growing number of modules -- CrowdStrike's offerings are used by 65 Fortune 100 companies and 254 of the Fortune 500. With this rapid uptake from the larger enterprise market, CrowdStrike's share price has nearly quadrupled in less than three years since going public.
Despite this large base of enterprise customers, its growth prospects look more robust than ever -- especially considering its dollar-based net retention (DBNR) of 124%. DBNR measures how much more existing customers spend with the company from one year to the next (including customer churn).
With a DBNR above 120% displaying healthy growth, CrowdStrike's 16 consecutive quarters above this mark are encouraging. Best yet for investors, these strong retention figures pair well with CrowdStrike's 69% sales growth and 30% free cash flow margins in 2022.
As management guides for at least $5 billion in annual recurring revenue by 2026, CrowdStrike could be a bargain at today's prices, especially considering its tremendous cash-generating ability.
Airbnb
Driven by its goal ""to create a world where anyone can belong anywhere,"" Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) is quickly becoming an integral component of today's work-from-anywhere landscape.
Posting a record $46.9 billion in gross booking volume and $6 billion in revenue during 2021, Airbnb grew these figures by 23% and 25%, respectively, over pre-pandemic levels in 2019. To go along with this promising top-line growth, the company generated $2.1 billion in free cash flow during 2021 -- a marked improvement over 2020's negative $667 million.
Despite displaying this massive cash-generating prowess, shares of Airbnb are only slightly up from their initial public offering price.
Now trading at 49 times free cash flow, management's guidance for 60% growth year over year for its upcoming first quarter highlights an intriguing valuation for its expected growth -- much like Roblox.
Adding to this good news for investors, the company announced that its ""Made Possible by Hosts"" marketing campaign paid immediate dividends. In countries that saw the ads, Airbnb experienced a 20% increase in customer traffic compared to Q4 2019, along with a 40% increase in traffic to its hosting landing page over the same time.
Thanks to the world's voracious appetite to live and work from anywhere, look for Airbnb's ability to grow its 4 million hosts to be a key driver to long-term growth for investors.
MercadoLibre
Following a 30% drop in price over the last year, shares of Latin American e-commerce and fintech specialist MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) are beginning to look attractive to growth-focused investors.
Posting revenue growth of 74% year over year for Q4 2021, MercadoLibre has experienced a massive drawdown in its price to sales (P/S) ratio.
MELI PS Ratio data by YCharts
Now trading at a P/S it hasn't seen for over five years, the company's blistering growth looks like an excellent opportunity for investors with a decades-long time horizon.
On top of this, MercadoLibre's gross profits continue to grow while free cash flow has remained positive -- meaning that the business is cheaper than it was a year ago and has also become more powerful.
MELI Free Cash Flow data by YCharts
Leading this charge for MercadoLibre is its popular e-commerce operations that boast over 40 million users, and its fintech business (Mercado Pago), which has now grown to 34 million users of its own. Looking like a Latin American version of eBay and PayPal in 2014 before their separation, MercadoLibre is building out a complete ecosystem for its 82 million total members.
As Mercado Pago continues to mature, one needs to only look at PayPal's success over the last five years to become excited about MercadoLibre's optionality going forward.
Now looks like a great time to consider buying and holding MercadoLibre for the long term, thanks to its double-pronged growth attack and declining P/S.

2022-04-13 00:00:00+00:00,Airbnb Retains Strong Customer Loyalty Despite Its Hidden Fees,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/airbnb-retains-strong-customer-loyalty-despite-its-hidden-fees,,,"Instead of itemizing additional fees at the time of checkout, Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) customers are voicing their preference to have all inclusive fees shown from the start. In this clip from ""Ask Us Anything"" on Motley Fool Live, recorded on March 23, Motley Fool contributors Jon Quast and Matt Frankel discuss why the popular booking platform should address the issue of separated, surprise fees for customers.

{% sfr %}
Jon Quast: Jose, I believe that this is the most likely risk that takes down Airbnb right here. First and foremost, we've talked about how this is a top-of-mind brand. If you lose your brand image, you lose the top-of-mind presence and, all of a sudden, what was a competitive advantage is no longer there. Unless they have updated in the last couple of weeks, what this question is referring to is, when you use the Airbnb app and you're scrolling through looking for a place to book, there is a nightly rate posted on the posting. When you actually go to book it, all of a sudden, things are tacked on, such as cleaning fees, taxes and, all of a sudden, the price that you saw when you started this process is no longer what the price is. Now, I think that there is an aspect that, if it was close, nobody would care. But some times, maybe even most times, the price is wildly divergent, sometimes double the price that you originally saw because the cleaning fees are so high. Airbnb does not have a policy on what a person can charge for cleaning fees. In many ways, it reminds me of an old problem that eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) used to have. On eBay, people with listings for a penny would then charge $200 shipping or something ridiculous. You're going in there on eBay, you're finding something, ""Oh wow, a penny,"" and you go to buy it and, all of a sudden, they make it up in shipping. Part of the reason that they would do this too, was to circumvent eBay's take rate. But there was also an issue of, you're this far along in the buying process, now you're going to go through with it. It feels like you're being nickel-ed and dime-d. It feels like you are not getting good value. It creates an experience where, in the end, the user is no longer content. What they thought they were getting and what they actually end up paying is wildly different and it creates a souring among the consumer in my opinion. Jamie just referenced earlier when Brian Chesky went on social media and said, if we could do anything in 2022, tell me what we should do as a company. Of the 6,000 responses that he got, in the top six, No. 2 was clear pricing displays. No. 4 was updated cleaning fees. This is something that is very much on people's minds. But fortunately, Brian Chesky, the CEO, and the company are listening and they are actually working to address this. I think they really do need to address it. It's a big deal in my opinion. I think that Airbnb needs to standardize a policy when it comes to cleaning fees or [laughs] this is extreme. Don't even allow cleaning fees. You just need to figure this out as a host, like what is it going to cost to run your Airbnb, put that in your nightly rate, and you're just going to have to calculate this. If you wanted to charge $100 and $20 for the cleaning fee, just charge $120 for your nightly rate. Nickel and dime is what it feels like.
Matt Frankel: Real quick. This is how I feel about resort fees at hotels. It's the same thing. If the room costs $100 a night, don't charge me $50 and then a $50 resort fee. Charge me $100. I don't mind paying the cleaning fee. I think most of us would agree that Airbnb are still generally a good value, including the cleaning fee. But if something's worth $500 and you're going to sell it to me for $200, don't tell me it's $400 when I go to checkout. You're still getting value, but you got to be upfront about it. They do offer our host-only fee structure. The problem is very few hosts opt into that, where all their cleaning fees and stuff are deducted right from what the host gets. I think it is a problem they need to address.

2022-04-13 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia and Other Semiconductor Companies Keep Getting Downgraded,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-and-other-semiconductor-companies-keep-getting-downgraded,,,"In the past few weeks, investors have seen an increase in downgrades or reductions of price targets in the semiconductor industry by different analysts. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has not been immune to these downgrades; in the past few days, Truist Securities and Baird have downgraded or reduced their price target for the stock. One of the biggest concerns from most analysts is the risk of consumer spending decreasing.
On Monday, Baird downgraded Nvidia to neutral and reduced its price target from $360 to $225. Nvidia's stock price was down over 5% when the market closed Monday afternoon. Some of the risks cited are the slowdown in consumer spending, especially in China's consumer market, and headwinds caused by the Russian embargo.
Numerous online reports mention that graphics card prices are decreasing from peaks in third-party markets. A quick look at eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) completed listings shows that graphics cards are still selling way above the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). As third-party prices are still above MSRP, it might be too early to tell what will happen to the graphics consumer market.
Unlike many analysts, long-term investors focus on how a stock will do in the next few years and not in the next few months. While consumer spending might be slowing down, which could cause more downtrends for the semiconductor industry, there are also numerous growth opportunities. One of those opportunities is cloud providers and enterprises' increased spending to improve their digital solutions.

2022-04-13 00:00:00+00:00,PayPal Stock: Bull vs. Bear,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paypal-stock%3A-bull-vs.-bear-1,,,"It's tempting to think of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) as something of an upstart. After all, it was spun off from parent company eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) only seven years ago in 2015. But PayPal is already a giant. Its market cap of $129 billion makes it the 64th largest American public corporation -- sandwiched between industrial-sector mainstays Honeywell and Deere.
There's no doubt that it has come a long way in a short time. But will PayPal be able to maintain its place? Let's examine the bull and the bear case for the company.
Image source: Getty Images.
The bull case: Solid cash flow supports substantial share buybacks.
Since its spin-off from eBay, PayPal has been a growth stock. In 2021, the company reported revenue of $25.4 billion, up from $21.5 billion in 2020 for a year-over-year increase of 18%. What's more, PayPal generated $5.4 billion of free cash flow (FCF) in 2021, allowing it to repurchase $3.4 billion of stock last year alone.
PYPL free cash flow. Data by YCharts.
The company is already sitting on $18 billion in cash, and Wall Street analysts expect PayPal to grow FCF to between $7 billion and $8 billion in 2022. Flush with cash, it can expand its share repurchases and increase its stock price.
The bear case: Slowing growth and shrinking market share begin to bite.
PayPal is still growing revenue, but the growth rate is shrinking. Last year's 18% rate is down from 21% in 2020. Moreover, one of PayPal's most important products is losing steam.
TOTAL PAYMENT VOLUME (TPV) OF VENMO FROM 1ST QUARTER 2021 THROUGH 4TH QUARTER 2021 IN BILLION U.S. DOLLARS
Q1 2021 Q2 2021 Q3 2021 Q4 2021
Venmo TPV 51 58 60 60.6
The above table shows the total payment volume (TPV) at Venmo, PayPal's signature peer-to-peer payment app. As you can see, after surging in the first half of 2021, momentum stalled in the second half of last year.
Moreover, a recent survey of teens by Piper Sandler revealed some trouble for PayPal. It showed that they ranked Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) Apple Pay ahead of Venmo as their preferred digital payment method. Furthermore, teens ranked Block's Cash App in third place, with PayPal fourth.
There's no need to buy PayPal today
PayPal still has many strengths it can rely on. It has over 426 million active accounts, including 34 million vendor accounts. It is by far the most accepted digital wallet, with more than 76% acceptance among the top 1,500 retailers in North America and Europe (Apple Pay is second with 27%).
But its slowing growth rate is a concern. For existing holders, I see no reason to add more PayPal right now. For those without a position, I would sit tight until PayPal can demonstrate that it can boost its growth rate.

2022-04-09 00:00:00+00:00,Will PayPal Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2030?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-paypal-be-a-trillion-dollar-stock-by-2030,,,"PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) has prospered since its spinoff from eBay. It has grown to a market cap of $133 billion, and its value is more than four times the size of its former parent. This increase has given PayPal stockholders a return of over 200% since then.
However, growing to a $1 trillion market cap by 2030 would mean it needs to double almost three times over the next eight years. Whether PayPal will achieve this feat is unknowable now, but looking more closely at the fintech stock and its growth rate could give stockholders some indication if that is possible.

Calculating the possibilities
With its current market cap, PayPal's stock would have to grow at almost 29% per year over the next eight years. At its recent price of around $114 per share, this would imply an average annual increase of approximately 18% since the July 2015 IPO. This would fall short of a rate to get to $1 trillion by the end of the decade.
Still, when compared to last summer's high of $310 per share, PayPal grew at a rate of more than 42% on average in the six years between the return of PayPal and its summer high. Such a growth rate implies that the $1 trillion market value by 2030 is possible.
PayPal's expanding fintech ecosystem
Indeed 2021 brought a trillion-dollar milestone as payment volumes reached $1.3 trillion, 33% higher than year-ago levels. Most of that volume came through its original payment-processing business. However, other apps, such as its Venmo social payments platform, continue to grow in popularity. Venmo now claims more than 83 million users in the U.S. The company also started PayPal Ventures to invest in both fintech and related industries.
Moreover, it continues to add functionality. One way is through Honey, an app that offers discounts from more than 30,000 retailers. Another added feature is a buy now, pay later option, a feature that the majority of consumers in the U.S. and China have used in some form in the past, either from PayPal or a competitor. Such popularity should bode well for this business.

PayPal by the numbers
Such moves have significantly boosted revenue. In 2021, PayPal reported revenue of $25.4 billion, rising 18% from the previous year. Still, net income came in at just under $4.2 billion, falling 2% from year-ago levels. The company earned nearly $1.8 billion in strategic investments in 2020, compared with $163 million in strategic losses in 2021. Nevertheless, net income has risen 72% compared with 2019 levels, indicating the drop in income is likely a one-time anomaly.
The company also forecasts a 15% increase in revenue for 2022. If this forecast holds, it would mean a slight drop compared to 2021 earnings.
Despite continuing double-digit revenue growth, investors tested the bull vs. bear case for PayPal. Its stock suffered as it lost just over half of its value since peaking last summer. Investors have soured on PayPal as its former parent eBay completed its separation from the fintech giant. Stockholders also did not like its emphasis on monetizing the current customer base rather than growing customer counts, even though the company expects accounts to grow by between 15 million and 20 million this year.
Nonetheless, this takes the price-to-earnings ratio down to 32. This is down from 75 last fall but remains a small fraction of Block's earnings multiple, which has returned to levels above 400. This also returns the company to the earnings multiple where it stood back in 2016, indicating that it may have become a comparative bargain.
PayPal in 2030
PayPal faces an uphill battle in making it to a $1 trillion market cap by 2030. Its first six years of growth show the goal is possible. Still, with the recent drop, it lags behind this goal and will need to resume its massive growth to achieve that milestone.
However, PayPal has leveraged its first-mover advantage in fintech to build a recognizable and widely used payments ecosystem. Even if it does not make it to $1 trillion by 2030, PayPal should continue to beat the market for years to come.

This video was recorded on April 6, 2022.
Deidre Woollard: I'm Deidre Woollard sitting in for Chris Hill and I am joined by Motley Fool senior analyst Asit Sharma. Today, we're going to talk about the battle of low-cost airlines, Amazon's fixed satellite move, and restaurant brands in the metaverse. [MUSIC] Let's begin with the big story which is JetBlue's move yesterday, they are announcing a proposal to acquire Spirit Airlines for $33 per share in cash, works out to a total of 3.6 billion. There was already a planned merger between Spirit and Frontier that was announced in February. This is really interesting because JetBlue thinks it's offering a better deal than the offer from Frontier, which is true from a monetary perspective. Frontier's bid would give Spirit shareholders a share of the combined airline as well as some cash per share. Really interesting because these are two very different types of airlines whereas Frontier and Spirit are more aligned. Asit, I'm wondering what you think could happen next and what this means for consumers?
Asit Sharma: Well, I'm going to be totally honest with you Deidre, I don't know what's going to happen [laughs] next because this counteroffer is going to have some regulatory scrutiny around it, but let's hypothesize that the deal goes through. I think this means that for consumers, costs are going up. The reason is JetBlue has a choice to become more like Spirit or to make Spirit become more like itself, and I think the odds are that JetBlue tries to mold Spirit in its own form. You've got an airline here which has been pretty successful in JetBlue at offering some premium perks, it's not quite the large carrier like those it wants to compete with, the Uniteds, American Airlines, and Deltas of the world. It's an up-and-coming airline, it's slightly smaller than a great regional airline, Alaska Airlines. If the merger goes through with Spirit, it will leapfrog that to become the next big carrier. I think what JetBlue is trying to do here is to really compete with these bigger carriers, it can't recreate the whole hub and spoke network that the legacy carriers have, but what it can do is to really hone in on route density, which is what it gets in Spirit because both are East Coast Airlines and the thing that I like about this for JetBlue, not for myself and I travel, if my costs are going up, but what I liked for JetBlue is that in buying Spirit, it gets a really beautiful route density into Latin America, into Central America, into the Caribbean, routes it doesn't have. Those are very lucrative routes, the travel in this area from Latin America to the US back-and-forth has been steadily increasing, took a hit during COVID, but long-term, that's a great place to be. You buy, Spirit you get into a bunch of big cities in the East Coast and some other hub cities, you compete with the bigger carriers, you get great route additions. It'll take some time. You can make the Spirit part of your business more like JetBlue which is not, again, a premium airline but think of it as a lower-cost carrier with some perks, not an ultra-low-cost carrier, just one or two steps above that.
Deidre Woollard: Interesting. I like what you said there about ultra-low-cost versus low-cost because that's Frontier's argument is that JetBlue is, in fact, prestige and so that it's not a natural match. The other thing I think is interesting is JetBlue has tried some acquisitions before, they haven't worked out, there's certainly an antitrust concern here. Do you think that that's going to be a concern? How are the regulators going to look at these two deals?
Asit Sharma: I want to say it is a shot from left field. If you've read any of the new stories around the story, many airline analysts, and I'm not an airline analyst, but I totally get this, they're scratching their heads just because of the regulatory aspect. This is a move that is the opposite of a Frontier-Spirit merger in which costs could stay level for consumers. You got two ultra-low-cost carriers that would be merging. Here, how does this benefit the end-user? It doesn't. Now, JetBlue can make the argument that in becoming a bigger airline, not quite as big as these huge competitors I mentioned before, we make that part of the airline segment more competitive, we come in and compete with bigger carriers. I think that's a bit of a stretch but there is some logic there. I don't know where regulators will land. I think this is indicative of a company in JetBlue that is really looking to grow but doesn't have a great organic path to do it. They're not grasping at straws here, but they're going after propositions which aren't natural fits. This is what happens in an industry like the airline industry where you have just decades of consolidations, just a few players on the big end. To get bigger in this industry is not so easy.
Deidre Woollard: Very good point. Just to wrap up, what are you thinking about the energy costs and airlines, prices seem to be going up for airlines, looks like we're going to have a big travel summer. What are you thinking that we're going to see on that front?
Asit Sharma: It's so interesting, Deidre. The two biggest costs for an airline are labor, of course, and fuel. We've seen over time that airlines will go for utilization, they want to fill seats. They will deal with higher fuel prices in a number of ways. The best way, I think, over time to counter the effect of rising fuel costs is to add on ancillary services. This is something that JetBlue excels at. I don't think that there is much that any airline can do in the industry just now, they're going to have to absorb some of these costs, the rest, you and I are going to be paying more when we board. I will tell you one thing, I'm traveling this summer. [laughs] Please world, please universe, please cosmos, no more exogenous shocks, give me just even a couple of weeks of a window in which I can have some fun travel; I will get on a plane this summer.
Deidre Woollard: [laughs] I think you are not alone in that. Let's move on from airlines to space. Amazon has announced ramping up Project Kuiper, which is its satellite operations. This is really ambitious, they are planning 83 launches over the next five years, they're putting more than 3,000 satellites in orbit. Why? Because they're going to try to provide broadband Internet for consumers, businesses, government agencies, some massive project. Really interesting to see, and I'm wondering what this means for Amazon's core businesses for Prime, AWS, things like that.
Asit Sharma: This is a multi-year effort and it sounds like it won't have much impact on Amazon's business for a while because they've got to get the satellites into space. I believe that Amazon does have a little bit of an impetus to start putting it satellites into space because of some licensing requirements. They received licenses from the Federal Communications Commission in 2020, they've got to start putting up satellites within the next couple of years to keep those initial license grants. There's nothing on the surface or in the immediate future that's going to impact the other businesses. But, Deidre, I remember that Morgan Stanley had a projection, I don't know, a couple of years ago which they said that this total space business, putting satellites into space and having consumer services is going to be potentially a trillion-dollar business for lucky few companies over the next 10 years. Now, who on earth has the capital to put thousands of satellites in space? Only a very few private companies or public companies can do this. While we look at this large opportunity that is going to cost, by Amazon's own estimates, $10 billion of its capital, potentially they get a fraction of this market, say five or 10 percent, that starts to impact the other business lines. Let's fast-forward, I don't know, six or seven years in the future, and that's where you start to get some incremental gravy that's flowing to Amazon's bottom line, it makes them better able to compete with that additional cash flow, to lower their infrastructure costs for stuff that we order here on earth. In that sense, it will potentially have an impact on those other businesses, it's just not going to happen overnight.
Deidre Woollard: Yeah, I think there's so much potential. One of the things I've heard about is the potential for data centers in space and things like that. There's all sorts of interesting applications. You mentioned big companies. Well, the other one in this is, of course, Elon Musk and Starlink. There's been a lot of talk, a lot of back-and-forth between the two, a bit of one upmanship about Blue Origin versus SpaceX. Is Amazon too far behind Starlink to catch up at this point? Starlink has already launched about 1,900 satellites, they've got a quarter of a million subscribers. Does this mean Elon's got the jump on basis or what?
Asit Sharma: Yeah, you know Deidre, this is a G-rated shows. They don't mean any innuendo here. But I was wondering seven years old, I walked into a friend's garage and there was a sign that my friend's mom had put in the garage and it was a common saying. This is just to think back to the early '80s here, late '70s. The only difference between men and boys is the size of their toys. The picture was of two boats; a little boat and, and a big boat in the water. This is what it's boiling down to with all these billions of excess capital that Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk have created. They want bigger toys. They are in the never ending contest to see who can win here on the planet and in space. It's a great question. I mean, has Elon just, in this part of the competition, just gotten the head-start and Bezos can't compete? Actually don't think so. Again, going back to the point I was discussing earlier about the capital required to put all these satellites, thousand satellites into space. If only a few companies can do this, it means that there's not going to be a monopoly business in space. It's probably going to be like a duopoly or oligopoly, is that right? We have more than a couple. There's always time to catch up, especially if you're relying on a consumer model. At the end of the day, these are consumers that are going to propel this. It could get into corporate business later, as you mentioned with say, data centers in space. But with a consumer centric monopoly regulators, just the idea of competing lent itself to another company, even if it takes a couple or three years more entering that. Now, do Amazon and Starlink between them have a business model that's probably airtight, they don't have to worry about much more competition? Yeah, I don't see many more companies coming into the scale.
Deidre Woollard: One last thing on this subject, I am a little bit concerned about the potential for things being crowded. There's already been talk of not necessarily space junk, but when these things, when they exceed their usefulness, they have to be disposed at some way. They can come to earth and burn up in the atmosphere. We haven't seen a lot of crashes or things like that yet. But do you think going forward when we have thousands of satellites in orbit, is that a potential risk?
Asit Sharma: I'm worried. I'm no expert on objects in orbit, but we noticed from reading the news that the number of satellites which have been put up ever since the first one launched into space in the '50s, just that tiny number of satellites creates its own ecosystem of space debris. So you think about multiplying that even if these are much smaller satellites. We should think about multiplying the number of objects by so many magnitudes. It just begs the question, that this potentially isn't that great an idea in terms of efficiency? So yeah, I think me and so many other people who are watching this story evolve or worried and you as, well, hopefully the technology that's being invested, will be able to anticipate this, but I have my doubts. I'm a little skeptical on that front.
Deidre Woollard: Well, I think it may create a new business in the future. But let's move on from space. I feel like we're getting gradually further and further out. Let's go into the metaverse. Wanted to talk a little bit about a Wall Street Journal article about Restaurant Brands setting up shop in the metaverse, Wendy's and Chipotle. We've already seen McDonald's talk about ordering your food in the metaverse through so much excitement from brands. But the interesting thing in the article was that there was a study from Forrester that showed 43 percent of adults would avoid a brand sponsored experience in the metaverse. That's not great news. Is this a smart move for brands to get started in the metaverse? Is this where we're headed?
Asit Sharma: It depends on the brand and what your objective is and who your customers are. Thinking in some cases it makes a lot of sense. My typical example is Nike creating an experience on Roblox, which is good for its culture, for its fans, they can go and experience Nike land. So this is an example and I know, Deidre, you have some thoughts here. I'm really interested to hear your thoughts on these. I want to just finish this short opinion by saying, in some cases short, it makes a lot of sense and in others. It's like that song. We're not going to take it. We're not going to take it anymore. Brands try to sell to us in every conceivable location and we're used to this, but they are selling to us on social media. They are selling to us in the subways. So do I really want to be sold to in the metaverse? Maybe more pertinently, if your quick service brands, like do I want to be dragged into the metaverse just to place an order for delivery? Not me personally. I don't think it makes as much sense for brands that have a quick service model in the restaurant industry. These two examples of McDonald's, especially with Wendy's and Chipotle is in there as well. But, yeah it can be valuable to some companies. Now, I've tried to stay a little neutral there, but you've got thoughts and opinions. I know on this. What's your take on this, Deidre?
Deidre Woollard: Well, I've been studying the way that luxury brands are getting in. Specifically, they had the first metaverse Fashion week recently in Decentraland. Part of it was that Dolce and Gabbana had this $300,000 metaverse tiara. Neiman Marcus recently announced that they're working on NFT. So I find it fascinating from the luxury perspective and I think that may be more of a natural fit for the metaverse at this point than some of the more mid-market brands. Just because really the people that are interested in the metaverse, it's a small group, but it may be a more sophisticated group of consumers. So I've been fascinated by seeing just how many luxury brands are getting in, makes me think a little bit of second-life for those who remember that happened. What was that about a decade ago and all brands rushed in. Second-life is still out there. Their CEO recently came back, but Second-life never became what we thought it was going to be. So there's a little bit of concern there.
Asit Sharma: Yes. There's another arguments that younger consumers, the digitally native consumers, are going to embrace the metaverse, and so you need to your expression of the metaverse in now because it's only a matter of time before, let's say someone in their teens grows up for few years and they have their own spending money and they're going to spend it. They'll be the people going into the metaverse to order from McDonald's, but I'm not so sure. I mean, there's part of the metaverse that's still seems very much like a transient thing. We're always trying to pin the next technological innovation and say, this is how the world is going to work. We were talking about 3D just before the show, Deidre. We were talking about visual 3D, but I was also thinking about 3D printing. I remember just a few years ago, we were going to print everything we needed from our homes. Like if if something broken your house, you just go to your 3D printer, print it up and put it, let's say replace a couch like that really never came to fruition. Although 3D printing is in various parts of the economy in it's more serious expression of additive manufacturing is there, it exists, but it hasn't overtaken our lives. I have my suspicion that even for younger people, the metaverse will be the dominant place that we exist, interact and transact in the future.
Deidre Woollard: Coming up next, Jim Gillies and Brian Feroldi are going to take a bull versus bear approach to a company that Amazon was supposed to knockout years ago. Best Buy, Ricky Mulvey moderates and you get to decide who made the better argument by voting in our poll on Motley Fool Money on Twitter.
Ricky Mulvey: We got Bull versus Bear on Best Buy today. You know the electronics retailer, it is within 10 miles of 70 percent of the US population. They sell computers, games, whatever you want, Best Buy's got it. Taking the bear case, we got Brian Feroldi. Brian, you got a book out just came out yesterday. It's called Why Does The Stock Market Go Up? But looking at the risks to a company that's not unfamiliar to you, you like putting stocks through the gauntlet all the time.
Brian Feroldi: Yeah, I've made plenty of mistakes with investing and I've learned the hard way that you need to know the bull case for a business just as well as you know the bear case for a business if you want to make an informed decision.
Ricky Mulvey: We've got the returning champion, the Canuck Jim Gillies. Jim, you also have a book that came out a few years ago that you'd like to plug.
Jim Gillies: It's my masters thesis on bringing environmental aspects to a chromium plating shop. There are four copies in existence, no one should read it.
Ricky Mulvey: Books are available on Amazon but let's get right to it on Best Buy starting with the bull case. Jim, you've got three minutes.
Jim Gillies: Cool. Well, I know that Brian, my esteemed opponent, likes company mission statements and so I thought I would start with one of his favorite tricks and I'm going to call out with Best Buy's purposes, they state their purpose is to enrich lives through technology. Now the important thing here is this is an adaptable company. This is a service company that sells hardware technology, yes, you can go to Amazon or eBay or wherever you buy your electronic and online stuff but their customer service model that Best Buy offers is essentially impossible for Amazon to copy. Amazon is for people who know exactly what they want, want it at a better price for example and will implement their own technology solutions for themselves and God bless them. People think of hardware and technology as something of a commodity, the reality is it's more nuanced. Sometimes people don't know what they want, sometimes they would choose differently or might want something completely different if they had a better understanding, there's different fulfillment or installation options, sometimes my parents want someone to hold their hand when they're getting their technology setup or what have you and that is the service that Best Buy provides in the guys of a big box store. You can get in-person consultations online, on the phone, pickup and delivery, curbside pickup, home visits delivery, the point is its flexibility and adaptability to customer needs and it has worked.
Best Buy is one of my favorite types of retail company stories because people, including my esteemed opponent, have been writing this one off for well over a decade. Would you like to take a guess as to what the best year in company history was in terms of free cash flow generation for Best Buy? If you guessed fiscal 21, the year ending in January 2021, aka the year stricken by shutdowns for the pandemic, you are right. Of course no one is going to guess, the pandemic year was the best year free cash flow production in Best Buy's history, they made $4.2 billion. If you want to guess the second best year in the company's history, it's in the year that's just ended where they produced $2.5 billion in free cash flow. Now, true, I think fiscal 2012 was about $25 million more or $12 million more but that was a 53-week fiscal year, there's some calendar chicanery so still last year's second best year. Over the past decade, Best Buy has averaged a return on capital of 19-and-a-half percent as per CapIQ well above their cost of capital and I will argue that the return on capital numbers for Cap IQ and Best Buy is actually too low because they put operating leases into the capital that's an argument for another time. We'll let it stand. Return on capital has also been increasing over the past decade. Also over the past decade margins are resilient and rising, gross margin has averaged 23 percent over the last decade, operating margin averaged 4.9 percent over the last decade and 5.8 percent in the last fiscal year. They have produced $17 billion in free cash flow over this decade, returning 14.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Their dividend is up 5.5 fold over that decade, going from $0.64 a year to $3.52 a year and it's a 3.7 percent yield today.
Their buybacks have reduced our shares outstanding by a third, the rest of the cash regenerated went to shore up their balance sheet, they went from a-half billion in net debt a decade ago, today have $1.75 billion in net cash today, this is a capital allocation success story and poky Best Buy that everyone knows is Amazon showroom. That's going to go away just like GameStop. How did that work out? Best Buy, 10 year annual return with dividends reinvested 18.6 percent annually a market smasher, oh and by the way if you happen to pick it up at its low in December of 2012, a time that I'm sure Brian remembers, you are sitting on a 26.8 percent annual return. That's not bad for Amazon's showroom and the final point is, no one today is surprised by, oh Amazon is going to eat their lunch. That argument has been around for over a decade, it's priced into the stock and here's this thing trading at 10 times earnings with I think blue skies and clear sailing ahead of them going forward.
Ricky Mulvey: We are a minute and 26 seconds over, but a strong [laughs] bull case for Best Buy.
Jim Gillies: That's pretty good for me. [laughs]
Ricky Mulvey: Shocker. Jim Gillies goes a little bit over the title of it.
Jim Gillies: Brian, feel free. [laughs]
Ricky Mulvey: Who could've predicted it? Brian Feroldi, you've got the risks, the bear case for the company whenever you're ready.
Brian Feroldi: Well, as Jim pointed out, this is a stock that I have been precisely wrong about having, giving it the red thumbs up, the thumbs down in caps, pretty much at the low which was a 10 bagger ago. Now why was I bearish on them about a decade ago? Jim hit the nail on the head and then ordered Amazon and Best Buy was becoming a showroom for Amazon's shoppers. People would go into Best Buy, look at the items, check the price online, buy it online, and Best Buy all but admitted that this was a major problem when about 10 years ago they offered a price match guarantee. If you showed them the price you could buy it online they will be forced to match it there. Now, how could Best Buy compete? Amazon doesn't have any of the overhead of the showrooms that Best Buy does. Amazon has counter positioning against Best Buy and they could offer the exact same products at a lower price. Moreover at the same time we've seen a lot of other companies, the device manufacturers themselves increased their director consumer preferences, me, the consumer can go to apple.com, samsung.com, sony.com, whatever and buy the items directly from the companies. Why go through a retailer? Now, is that still a problem today? Well, how's this stat? Last year, five suppliers, Apple, Samsung, HP, LG, and Sony, were more than 56 percent of this company's total sales and just 20 suppliers accounted for almost 80 percent of total sales. When you combine those things together I figured it was a matter of time before Best Buy joined the likes of Circuit City, Twitter, Crazy Eddie, Fredder, The Whiz, HA Creg, etc., in the retail graveyard. Now, as Jim pointed out, my thesis for this company was precisely wrong. This has been a fantastic investment over the last 10 years. But I think a lot of the things that I was worried about actually have come true. Best Buy has been modifying its store layouts. It's been forced to cut prices to match those of Internet retailers and this is a company that had almost 1,800 stores in 2013, currently they have 980 stores. The number of stores that this company has, has been falling, sinking like a stone. That's a big problem if you're going to be investing in a retailer because that's one of the major ways that a company grows, is by opening new stores that's no longer on the table. Moreover, over the last 10 years, while returns on capital have been good, this company's same-store sales, a key metric haven't exactly been barn-burning, they were negative from 2012-2014, barely positive to 2015-2017 and they've been hugely positive over the last couple of years. Why is that? In a word, COVID.
People have been scrambling to build out their home offices and to make themselves electronically savvy at home. I asked this, is that something that's going to repeat? I mean once my home office was set up, why don't I have to buy any of the same items again? Make no mistake, this company even today, despite having a strong service business, 75 percent of sales come from computing, mobile phones and consumer electronics. The services business at this company that bowls are pounding the table on that was just wait for it, five percent of revenue last year, five percent of revenue. Now the company does have a couple of growth initiatives in place, they have a subscription plan growing out, they're getting into the telehealth business because when I think Best Buy what I think is healthcare, of course. I think by myself as a consumer, when I go in there and shop at Best Buy, the only thing that they want to do is talk to you about signing up for a credit card and selling me a protection plan. No thanks, I will just shop on Amazon myself. Now, if we look at the most recent quarterly results, we see a topline declining. Same-store sales are declining, gross margin down, sales and advertising expense up, and adjusted earnings-per-share down 21 percent, management all but admitted that they should expect exactly that over the next two years. Yes, this stock is cheap today but when I think of the long-term no store openings, challenging same-store sales. COVID is now a headwind supplier, concentration the retail landscape is changing, margins are going to be under pressure, and services are just five percent of sales, it's a hard pass for me.

Chris Hill: OneCloud business is ready for its close up and two CEOs are in the spotlight. It's a busy Monday, so let's get to work, Motley Fool Money starts now. [MUSIC] I'm Chris Hill. Joining me today from Motley Fool Canada, it's Jim Gillies. Good to see you.
Jim Gillies: Good to be seen, Chris.
Chris Hill: Here at The Motley Fool, we focus on businesses, but we also pay attention to the people who are leading the businesses that we are shareholders of, and we have two longtime business leaders that we need to talk about today. We're going to start with Howard Schultz because today is his first day on the job as interim CEO of Starbucks. If he's scoring at home, this is the third time in the corner office, and he is not waiting. Unlike most interim CEOs, his first active business is to suspend the share buyback plan that Starbucks had announced, I believe it was last year, to the tune of $20 billion that they had allocated, and Schultz and the executive team saying, we're going to suspend this buyback plan. This frees up money to invest in future growth of the business. You and I were chatting earlier today. I get the sense, do you think this is a good move?
Jim Gillies: I do. I'm going to commend you on being able to say interim CEO of Starbucks with a straight face. I am someone who remembers the last time Howard came back as interim CEO of Starbucks and lasted for nearly a decade, I believe. I thought as interim CEO, his job is to find the next leader of the business. I suspect he finds that leader of the business every time he looks in the mirror. Just putting it out there. I think Howard's around for a while but I also happen to think that's a good thing. If he is, and I hope he's around for a while because Howard Schultz has demonstrated in two tenures of multiyear, if not decade, 10-years, with Starbucks, that this man knows how to grow this business. If Howard Schultz says, we are going to cut. I'm going to point out that that $20 billion buyback on the table is about 20 percent of Starbucks [laughs] market cap, so it was a potentially seriously large buyback. Now, I note that if you have been on, and I know, Chris you are a shareholder as am I. I know you were a shareholder three-years ago as am I or as was I, I suppose. I know that all we have made from our Starbucks over these past three years is basically the two percent dividend yield. This is in spite of Starbucks spending about eight billion dollars in share buybacks over that time. I understand we had the pandemic through that but they've not done a lot of buybacks. They've only done about eight billion over the past three years, roughly, so since the end of June 2019. So almost three years. That's maybe money that was wasted a little bit but I've to quote a couple of our colleagues, because it was purchased at higher valuations.
I am a fan of Starbucks investing in themselves, investing in their stores, not necessarily new store growth, but in systems and their existing stores as well. Updating and improving their stores, improving benefits for their service providers, their members, the team members, the staff, the people who work there. I've always thought of Starbucks as a fairly good employer. I'd like to see better for the employees there because then it leads to happier members, happier customers, happier shareholders eventually. While I'm giving Howard a bit of a hard time, like he cares what I think. While I give Howard a bit of a hard time, I don't think buybacks here were large enough amount to really worry about. They've spent just slightly more on buybacks than they have on dividends and we know they like to raise their dividend every year. I suspect they're going to keep on doing that. That's a return. I also note that over the past three years, the buybacks have taken at about 4.5 percent of the stock count, which is a meaningful buyback, and that's a good thing. We talk about companies as cannibals that eat themselves over time so Apple's one, Home Depot's another one, eBay is another one. Companies that buyback meaningful and shrink their share counts. So if you still hold the shares, you are comparatively larger percentage owner. I think Starbucks will eventually come back to buybacks but for now, if Howard thinks this is the best course of action, I feel like I'm just a Howard homer here. If Howard thinks this is the best course of action, and to me that suggests more that he is going to be sticking around for a while to guide his baby. I am fine with taking my dividends, seeing what he does, because they're making lots of cash. That's not the issue. The issue is, let's get this thing rated and we'll come back to buybacks in a few years.
Chris Hill: I appreciate you pointing out, because it's true there are companies that do a very effective job of buybacks, that it is a meaningful way to reward shareholders and I say this as someone who has owned shares of Starbucks for more than 20 years. This is my least favorite way. The company allocates [laughs] money historically. I wouldn't bet against them doing it effectively in the future but I saw this news this morning. By the way, the stock is down five percent on this news. I'm not entirely sure that move is warranted. In a few minutes, we'll get to another stock moving in the opposite direction that I also wonder if it's really warranted. But when you look at the stock down five percent, I know it's not a huge drop, but I looked at that and I thought, boy, for people who wanted to get shares of Starbucks at a five percent discount, congratulations, today's your day.
Jim Gillies: Yes. It's funny, you say that about buybacks, you impugn buybacks in that fashion.
Chris Hill: Did I impugn? Wait a minute.
Jim Gillies: You impugned.
Chris Hill: Wait a minute. I don't think I impugned it.
Jim Gillies: You chastised.
Chris Hill: I impugned Starbucks track record with this every other way with the exception of the investments they've made in food over the year. Every other way Starbucks has spent money has been better spent money than the money on buybacks.
Jim Gillies: The food they never get right.
Chris Hill: Exactly.
Jim Gillies: Look, I quite like buybacks. They are in some aspects a more tax efficient means of returning capital to shareholders, presuming the share count goes down. I'll give you a long list of companies where they're blowing every penny of free cash flow, and the share count's going up, that's sub-optimal but I note that if you throw out the couple of months in like the March of 2020, really the end of February 2020 to say going into May 2020. There was something happened in the world at that point, the depths of the COVID, initial pandemic panic. You're buying Starbucks at its lowest valuation on an enterprise value to EBITDA in the past decade. It was about 13 times EBITDA heading into today, as you say, it's down five percent already. That's the low over the past decade, aside from that chunk of time when the pandemic was spooling up and no one knew what was going on. The other aspect, of course, as I said, I believe the dividends they have a history or track record of raising them annually. They're currently paying $0.49 a quarter. They paid three quarters of $0.49 so they'll probably pay one more. Then I would not be surprised by a hike. I think they brought out the dividend in 2010 and have pretty much raised every year since. I still think investors will get their take. Like you, I think today's valuation is interesting. It's been a while since I've added to my Starbucks holdings, but I'm onboard with this one.
Chris Hill: An SEC filing shows that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has taken a nine percent passive stake in Twitter. This news has sent shares of Twitter up more than 25 percent today. Before we dig into this, because you did this for me earlier today, can you, for the dozens of listeners, the difference between an SEC filing a passive stake versus an active stake.
Jim Gillies: It's funny because I actually recommended a company last week in the service that I run, Hidden Gems Canada, where I had to literally go through this exact differential. I'm going to pretty much read from what I wrote. There are two primary types of form 13s that we will see filed with the SEC. Both denote that the filing party has accumulated at least a five percent stake in the underlying company. That is a level of ownership that is deemed significant enough that it must be disclosed to the public. However, the suffix, the letter suffix is what differentiates. A 13G as in gold, a 13G, don't impugn it, just coming in with gold there. 13G is one that denotes a passive stance. The filing entity has simply bought and is holding shares that amount to five percent of the total outstanding but has no designs on control of the company. I'm going to apologize for my dog making noise. When you say like an ETF kingpin type company like Vanguard or BlackRock, practically every February they file a 13G or 13G/A, which is an amendment to a 13G, on practically every large company in America. When you see that it's because they run trillions of dollars in index funds, passive index. The index says, thou shall hold three percent of Starbucks so they buy a three percent of Starbucks. That's what a passive listing is. So they have no designs on controlling the company. A 13D also signals a five plus percent position, but comes with added requirements of disclosure, primarily concerning the purpose of the transaction. When you see a 13D, as in dog, it's generally an active or some other interested party looking to force some change, influence the business itself. Musk filed a 13G.
Chris Hill: Musk files this document. He says, I've got nine percent of Twitter, but it's a passive stake. Why are all of these other people piling into shares of Twitter? Because I could see it. If they thought he's going to ride the ship, he's going to push for a subscription business model. This is going to change the business of Twitter but if it's a passive stake, why is everyone reading into this seemingly that he is going to change the business?
Jim Gillies: Isn't that the question?
Chris Hill: Yes.
Jim Gillies: The problem with that is that I did Musk file the wrong filing. Is this a stunt? Long time Fools know I'm not the biggest Elon Musk fan, so I'm going to try to not let that trip over here. But I think he's going to have to be very careful, because if he is seeing, he has to be very careful if you believe the SEC will have any teeth to it, which might be another topic. But if he is seen to be engaging in practices that are perceived to be looking to exert control over the business over the course of the company, then he's filed an incorrect filing and you're going to get slapped with that. He should have put into 13D. I'm a little shocked that his lawyers didn't tell him to put in a 13D anyway but then that would send a whole other message that here's Elon Musk who is regardless of my personal feelings about the man, I think he is an absolute master user of Twitter. He is an absolute master of seizing and controlling, creating a narrative. I note with some sarcasm, some sardonic viewpoint. I note that this past weekend, Tesla, Elon Musk's primary vehicle, no pun intended to talk with the public on. Tesla released their car deliveries for the first, quarter. They release those numbers. They were mildly disappointing. As well as they change the definition of what they call it, a delivery. Are these delivery numbers directly comparable to a year ago or the prior-quarter? We don't know. They changed the verbiage of what defines delivery. I noticed that both of those new stories, which I thought were reasonably things we should be talking about or that people should be looking at. They're both gone because all people can talk about is Musk buys 9.2 percent of Twitter. About a couple of weeks ago, he was publicly speculating on whether Twitter was a force for good in terms of free speech. He publicly speculated on Twitter about starting his own competing offering, which sure, whatever. As I said, I think Musk is an absolute master at seizing the narrative and defining where the narrative is going to go and this would be a good example of that.
Chris Hill: Last thing and then I'll let you go. With this move with shares of Twitter up 27 percent today. That means that in the past 12 months, shares of Twitter are now down only 22 percent [laughs] but I want to go back to Tesla. We can end here. That was another one of my thoughts this morning that if you're Twitter shareholder, great, you are having a wonderful day. I'm not a Tesla shareholder. Do you think the average Tesla shareholder is happy about this? Wouldn't they rather he'd be spending more time on Tesla? [laughs]
Jim Gillies: Yes. The concept of score-carding, that stock price is the only thing that matters, I think is probably what's driving the average Tesla shareholder right now, because the stock price over the past few years is up substantially. It's not really gone anywhere for much of the last year, but I think it's an eight or 10 bagger over the past three or four. As I am someone who has been both long and short, Tesla in the past, I am currently longer today via index funds and look-through exposure to Tesla than I've ever been. I suppose I have a vested interest in saying, hey, Tesla go. I think the average Tesla shareholder looks at share price and says, go get them Elon. I don't think the nuance between a 13G and 13D filing is entering anybody's thought process aside from poor folks like us who do this for a living. I think it'll be interesting to see what, if Tesla's share price were to drop 50 percent. I just pull a number of thin air. If Tesla's share price were to drop 50 percent over the next quarter, I think that's when you'd see people complaining, oh it's distracted by Twitter. Until then, I don't think it matters. We know that he got sanctioned in 2018 for the 420 funding secured thing, which some folks would consider to be securities fraud. We know we paid a fine, $20 million fine for both himself and on behalf of Twitter. On behalf of Tesla, he is supposed to have a so-called Twitter sitter to oversee his tweets, which I don't think that's the most lenient Twitter sitter in history. We know right now he is currently engaged with the SEC on that prior settlement. I know he's trying to maybe loosen some of the strings there. With the scrutiny that he has attracted to himself, I think it's in his best interest to be real careful about his filings and about real careful what he does. Hopefully, he says nothing about his stake in Twitter, just he has it. It's there. He says nothing and we hear nothing. Then at that point, he's got the money, and how about it man? There's nothing to say. They had to both start with a T. I hope for the sake of Tesla shareholders that he does that, that he does in good faith, keep it passive because there's nothing that says you can't do this, and Twitter just goes on its merry way. Hopefully Twitter then under the new CEO, starts to make some real progress on monetizing the business because [MUSIC] as you say Chris, until today, you're basically buying Twitter at the IPO price on Friday, and since the IPO was in 2013, I believe that's not a compliment.
Chris Hill: Jim Gillies, always great talking to you. Thanks for being here.
Jim Gillies: Thank you. [MUSIC]
Chris Hill: One question investors have had for years about Twitter, Tesla, and Starbucks, has to do with just how big their market opportunities are. Social media, electric vehicles, and coffee, are about as different a set of businesses as you can find but the underlying question is both common and important. To Cloud Storage for example, it's a huge market opportunities, but it can be difficult to figure out how competing businesses are unique from one another. Today, Asit Sharma and Brian Stoffel take a closer look at Cloud infrastructure company, DigitalOcean, through the lens of its competition and how DigitalOcean is serving its customers differently than Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
Asit Sharma: Brian, investors have been hearing for years, how competitive the Cloud computing and storage market is. But outside of very familiar Cloud titans, which seem to completely dominate this industry, like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud infrastructure, you get the picture. Are there any other companies that can even compete in this space?
Brian Stoffel: Well, Asit, I think it depends on what we mean when we say can they compete in this space. Because there is this market that you don't hear about that often unless you're directly involved in this business. That is meeting the Cloud infrastructure needs for small and medium-sized businesses. That's why the company we're talking about today, DigitalOcean comes in. Now, it's hardly the only player in its field but what makes this company unique is that they are really geared toward your small companies that need some type of Cloud presence. But working with Amazon or Azure just doesn't make sense. I was a little bit surprised to find out myself. Now I'm a former teacher, so I've been a teacher and I've worked for the Motley Fool, you don't want me touching your Cloud anything. But when I researched it, what was interesting to me, was just how difficult it can be to use AWS in Azure and how it really requires a company to have a team of IT professionals to make it work. Now obviously, your big companies like Netflix uses these guys, they've got the people to do that, so that's not a concern. But if you have like a small start-up, say architecture firm, you can't hire five people just to handle your Cloud infrastructure because you might be a two or three person organization, and there's a lot more of these two or three-person organizations out there than we might think. Add all that together and that's what DigitalOcean is after.
Asit Sharma: Yeah Brian, what's really interesting to me is how DigitalOcean has positioned itself to this extremely crucial segment of Cloud purchasers. CEO Yancey Spruill of DigitalOcean was recently talking about the sheer numbers associated with this market in both a recentearnings calland an investors conference. He said that by the end of this decade, there are going to be some 100 million small and medium-sized businesses around the world, and there are in addition, 50 million individual software developers that are associated with these businesses that will be working on project by the end of this decade. When you take this big group together, what do you think the spend is? It's big. The estimates are, according to Yancey Spruill, that there will be a $100 billion spent annually over the next several years just for Cloud infrastructure that relates to small and medium-sized businesses. To me, this is almost a niche space, but it's really hard to gain traction, and the way that DigitalOcean has gone about this is to just cast a wide net. They've got some 600,000 customers, they got a very wide marketing funnel. You can start with free tutorials on the site and the company will follow you along for years, potentially before you maybe join a start-up firm and spend the first penny. But having this niche focus and concentration on small start-ups growing customers, is great because it's a space that Amazon Web Services and Microsoft, Azure work, etc. it's not really profitable for them to touch because it doesn't really move the needle for their huge operations. One last thing I'll say on this point is Yancey Spruill had a really nice case study example he's been citing. There was a company in Tel Aviv, a start-up, just the type we're talking about Brian, they had eight people. When the company started, they were spending 20 bucks a month, fast-forward eight years, they're spending a $170,000 a month. Now, not every customer is going to grow like this, but the idea is to scale with these customers, even if that spend goes from 10- 20 bucks a month to the 100s, give a nice business here.
Brian Stoffel: Yeah. You know, I like that story Asit. The one thing I just want to say with that is it reminds me of Shopify, and here's what I mean by that. I always argue that there's a lot of detractors, you said Shopify is two million merchants, like most of those are just garbage. The fact of the matter is that's probably true but the point is is they just need to catch the Black Swan. What I mean by that is, it's almost impossible to know what's the small start-up today that's going to be a big important company organization tomorrow. We might think that we can predict that looking back, but we can't, because if you could, you'd be a genius. So instead, I said, Shopify just needs to cast a wide net, get a whole bunch of potential customers, and then grow alongside them. In fact, there are three different companies. I know Oatly is one of them that started their business on Shopify and are now publicly traded companies. It's the same dynamics with DigitalOcean, and one of the things Asit I talked about is the company needs to make sure that as those customers get bigger and bigger, that they continue spending on DigitalOcean and don't leave wholesale for an Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure.
Asit Sharma: Very true. Brian, I wanted to ask you, we've talked about the whales in this industry. Some call them cloud titans, some call them HyperCloud providers but DigitalOcean, if it's swimming below those, does it have to worry about any small competitors? Does it have this space all to itself?
Brian Stoffel: No, it doesn't have the space all to itself, but it still has a unique position. For instance, there's one provider, Heroku that was bought out and is now a subsidiary of Salesforce, and they are more of a high-end service. When you look at the stats for DigitalOcean, they tell you about customer spending or you can just go on their webpage and look at their prices, and it's like five dollars for this product per month, $10, it truly is cheap and your average revenue per user is below a $100. We're talking about some very simple things that people are buying. Whereas for Roku, they started about $250 if you go on their website, so they are tailoring to get the different ones. The two that stick out to me one is Linode, which is a subsidiary of Akamai, and then there's another one, Vulture that's privately owned, that just released that it has about a 125 million in annual recurring revenue. To put that in perspective, that puts it at about a quarter the size of DigitalOcean. DigitalOcean is much bigger. Linode, we can't really get a beat on how big their business is because they are a subsidiary of a much larger company and doesn't need to be broken out like that. That being said, I still think that we can follow the numbers to see how it's doing, and this is not a one winner take all category. If it was, then Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud wouldn't exist because Amazon Web Services had a seven year head-start and they still understandably, not a knock against them, don't have a 100 percent of the market for those enterprise customers.
Asit Sharma: You mentioned numbers. Let's talk about a few numbers and then I've got a couple of big picture questions for both of us. These numbers look pretty decent to me. DigitalOcean is a company that's growing between 30 and 40 percent on annualized basis. In the last quarter that they reported this was in February, their fourth-quarter of 2021, their top line increased about 37 percent to roughly a 120 million bucks. They have, as you mentioned, what they call an annual run-rate revenue, it's pretty similar to annualized recurring revenue of almost $0.5 billion. They are running at a loss, but this company is getting closer and closer to break evens, negative operating margin of about eight percent. Turned cash flow positive this year, and in fact, gross profit has been growing in some quarters at a rate that's faster than the sales acceleration. So improving gross margin, profitability. I think this is a company that looks interesting simply because it's not a hyper-growth company that's loss-making. It's established its niche. It's got some pretty decent metrics when you compare them to other software-as-a-service or platform-as-a-service type companies. The leadership team I should mention, which is not only made up of Yancey Spruill, but Carly Brands who is chief marketing officer came from a company called SendGrid, which this team scaled up and sold to another public company, Twilio. A lot of elements here are of a successful company but given that Brian, I wanted to ask you, is this a company that you'd invest in, why or why not?
Brian Stoffel: Right now, I don't own shares. I don't plan on owning them anytime soon either, but it's not because there aren't a lot of compelling things going on here. Part of it just has to do with the fact that it's much harder for me to gauge how wide the motives around DigitalOcean's business, and that's because I'm not involved in Cloud infrastructure. Personally, I don't work on that. It's easier for me to understand the net dollar retention rate of some other tools because I can see why switching would be so hard but Asit, I don't think it's uncommon for us to hear about a large company switching from for instance, Azure to AWS, like that happens. So I don't know how big are these switching costs. Is it a real moat or is it not? I will say that their dollar-based net retention has gone up significantly. It used to hover at about a 100 percent, and a lot of people might think a 100 percent for a SaaS company, that's not very good but you need to look at this in the same way that we look at a HubSpot. By that what I mean is HubSpot focuses on companies that have between two and 200 or two and 2,000 employees, small companies. If you focus on those, most small companies are going to go out of business and that's OK. That's no fault of HubSpot, no-fault of DigitalOcean, so that keeps that dollar-based net retention much lower, but it's up over a 115 percent now, that is a really important increase. That's more impressive than what HubSpot has been able to do, and I'll just throw another number that you really want to watch is the average revenue per user. It's gone up from mid 40s to mid 60s over just the last year and that again is a really impressive increase. Those are some of the things that I think you need to watch but again, I'm sitting on the sidelines, not because I don't like the company, but because as an investor you got to be super picky. There's 4,000 stocks for you to pick from a portfolio of 20-30 is good. So it's one of those things where you shouldn't knock accompany for not being included, just focus on what is included.
Asit Sharma: Brian, you just sold me on investing in this company the last couple of minutes talking about their great customer retention metrics, despite the fact that they probably see a lot of churn in that base because of the nature of having small customers. Our investing styles are different in that your portfolio is much more concentrated than mine, I'm not really ashamed to say this, but I say I have like 65 different companies [laughs] that I invest in. So I could see myself taking a small position in DigitalOcean to follow it along, maybe invest some more as they keep growing, and the strength of that moat becomes more apparent. This is a company I can definitely consider putting some money behind. Maybe not bet the firm here but I love the fact that it has a solid financial profile. This has been so much fun as always to chat with you. I look forward to next time.
Brian Stoffel: Thanks Asit. [MUSIC]

2022-04-07 00:00:00+00:00,May 27th Options Now Available For eBay,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/may-27th-options-now-available-for-ebay,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options begin trading today, for the May 27th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new May 27th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $53.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $53.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $50.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $53.66/share today.
Because the $53.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.91% return on the cash commitment, or 35.81% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $53.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.84. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $53.66/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $55.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.93% if the stock gets called away at the May 27th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $55.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.43% boost of extra return to the investor, or 25.03% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 254 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $53.66) to be 33%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-04-05 00:00:00+00:00,3 Robinhood Stocks to Buy in April,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-robinhood-stocks-to-buy-in-april,,,"Students of Warren Buffett's ways likely know one of his most powerful nuggets of investing wisdom: ""You can't buy what is popular and do well."" In other words, you shouldn't plow into the same stocks as the crowd. You're better-served by coming up with your own picks, even if nobody else seems interested in them at the time.
Except the crowd's become a lot savvier since Buffett first uttered those words. Even the typically new and typically small investors using Robinhood's (NASDAQ: HOOD) commission-free trading app are making some surprisingly smart picks. Here's a closer look at three of their favorites that are especially compelling prospects right now, in the wake of sizable sell-offs that may be about to reverse course.
Penn National Gaming
Since it's down 60% from last March's high, it would be easy to assume the worst of casino name Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ: PENN) and its peers. Don't be fooled, though. Casino-laden Nevada enjoyed record-breaking gaming revenue last year, and the state's industry has continued its hot streak through February of this year. While Penn isn't particularly well-represented in Las Vegas, what's happening there is a good proxy for what's happening in other parts of the U.S. (and the world).
That's not the only reason the stock's prolonged pullback makes it a juicy buy this month, however. Penn National Gaming is also operating at the intersection of two other hot trends apt to pay off big soon: online gambling and betting on post-pandemic resumption of professional sports.
Image source: Getty Images.
Penn also owns a controlling interest in sports-media brand Barstool Sports. Although Barstool isn't a gambling platform, the brand name is being leveraged to promote Penn's nascent sports-gambling efforts. Melding it with last year's acquisitions of Score Media and Gaming, the company says it's now ""North America's leading digital, entertainment, sports content, gaming and technology company.""
This is no small matter. Market research outfit Technavio estimates the global sports gambling market will grow at an annualized clip of 10% between 2020 and 2025.
fuboTV
Speaking of sports and gambling, put fuboTV (NYSE: FUBO) on your radar -- if not in your portfolio -- following the near-80% slide since November that, like Penn National Gaming, still has it within sight of 52-week lows.
If you're not familiar with it, there are a couple of reasons. It's a relatively small outfit, sporting a market cap of just over $1 billion. That prevents it from being found by a fair number of investors. The other reason is, it's a fairly young company, only coming into existence as the sports-oriented, publicly traded streaming cable television company we know it to be today in 2020.
Don't let its young age or small size fool you, though. This upstart is successfully stealing customers from the cable TV industry's stalwarts, ending last year with 1.13 million paying subscribers, up 106% from its headcount just a year earlier. What's more, fuboTV anticipates its top line exceeding $1 billion this year vs. 2021's revenue of $638 million.
The next growth frontier isn't just the addition of more customers growing tired of paying too much for conventional cable service, though. fuboTV is betting on growth specifically at the intersection of gambling on sports through television-based apps.
By leveraging recent acquisitions of companies like Balto Sports and Vigtory, it's already been able to launch sportsbooks in states where doing so is legal. More are on the way, too. In the meantime, fuboTV has also made agreements with teams like the Cleveland Cavaliers and the New York Jets to offer exclusive access to team-specific content, gambling, and related offerings. More such partnerships are also in the works.
That's a big deal simply because, according to Nielsen, about half the nation's professional sports fans also say they'd be interested in wagering on those games. That's one of the top reasons Technavio believes the sports-betting market is set to grow at an average of 10% per year through 2025.
PayPal
Finally, add PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) to your list of stocks to consider that Robinhood's investors are highly committed to following.
If you're familiar with PayPal at all, then you know the past few months have been rough on shareholders. The stock's down more than 60% from last July's peak, even with March's rebound effort, as new competition of all sorts has entered the digital payments arena.
It's arguable that shares also came down from their pandemic-prompted high, with consumers diverting at least some of their ramped-up online spending back to more traditional, in-person purchases made with cash and conventional credit cards. Also bear in mind that we're just starting to see the full effect of PayPal's somewhat-severed partnership with online auction platform eBay.
The sellers, however, may have overshot their target.
The fact is, while PayPal's clearly got a lot of work to do if it wants to maintain its lead within the direct online payment and digital wallet space, it's better-positioned to do so than any of its rivals, new or old. Slintel estimates PayPal still controls nearly 31% of the payment management market, with the next-nearest name being Adyen, but only with 22.5% market share. When just talking about payment gateways that facilitate a credit card-based purchase for shopping websites, Maruti Techlabs believes PayPal controls a whopping 91% of the market.
In short, PayPal has become a habit... the go-to payment platform that most of its 400+ million regular users trust so much that they utilize the service without a second thought. This habit is a key reason that revenue is still expected to grow 16% this year and then reaccelerate to a growth pace of nearly 20% next year.
Given all of this, the stock's big pullback is making less and less sense.

2022-04-04 00:00:00+00:00,Here's My Top Growth Stock to Buy Right Now,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-my-top-growth-stock-to-buy-right-now-1,,,"Over the past four months, inflation, rising interest rates, and other macro and geopolitical shocks have crushed many growth stocks. Some of those stocks deserved to fall because they traded at unsustainable valuations, but others were babies that were tossed out with the bathwater.
One of those growing babies was the Latin American e-commerce leader MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), which saw its stock plummet to its lowest levels in nearly two years this February. It subsequently rebounded more than 40%, but remains nearly 40% below its 52-week high.
Image source: Getty Images.
MercadoLibre's stock is undeniably volatile, but I'll explain why it's still my top growth stock to buy in this challenging market.
A market leader with a first-mover's advantage
MercadoLibre operates in 18 Latin American countries, and it's the leader in terms of unique visitors and pageviews across all of its major markets. It generates most of its revenue in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico.
MercadoLibre was founded in 1999 and established a first-mover's advantage in Latin America with the support of major investors like eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY). Its development of a diversified logistics network with drop shipping, cross-docking, flex, and first-party fulfillment options enabled it to establish a much broader reach than its smaller competitors.
That first-mover's advantage made MercadoLibre's brand synonymous with e-commerce across Latin America and enabled it to benefit from rising internet penetration rates and income levels across the region, and helped it fend off formidable overseas challengers like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).
MercadoLibre also tightly tethered shoppers to its ecosystem with Mercado Pago, a digital payments platform that was initially launched in 2003 and subsequently expanded to include off-site transactions. So in addition to being Latin America's leading e-commerce play, MercadoLibre also represents a smart long-term investment on the region's growing fintech market.
Explosive past and future growth rates
Between 2011 and 2021, MercadoLibre's annual revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.2% to $7.07 billion.
During that decade, its gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew at a CAGR of 19.4% to $28.4 billion as its total payment volume (TPV) increased by a CAGR of 69.2% to $77.4 billion. Investors have been paying attention: MercadoLibre's stock has soared 1,160% over the past 10 years.
It could be tough for MercadoLibre to replicate those multibagger gains over the next few years, but it's still well-poised to benefit from several secular tailwinds.
First and foremost, the Latin American e-commerce market is still underpenetrated after all these years. Morgan Stanley expects the region's e-commerce penetration rate to nearly double from just 9% in 2021 to 16% in 2025, then gradually increase to 50% over the next few decades. By comparison, China currently has an e-commerce penetration rate of about 30%.
The total GMV of Latin America's e-commerce market could also grow 29% between 2020 and 2024, according to Americas Market Intelligence (AMI), with 30% growth in Brazil, 32% growth in Argentina, and 27% growth in Mexico. That's why analysts expect MercadoLibre's revenue to rise to $16.5 billion in 2024, which would represent a CAGR of 32.6% over the next three years. They also expect its operating margin to expand from 6.2% to 9.5% as its net income grows at a CAGR of 135.9%.
We should take those analysts' long-term estimates with a grain of salt, but they strongly suggest that MercadoLibre still has plenty of room to grow, even as new competitors like Sea Limited's (NYSE: SE) Shopee enter its backyard.
The stock has gotten too cheap to ignore
MercadoLibre trades at just six times this year's sales, which is very reasonable relative to analysts' expectations of more than 30% revenue growth. Sea, which is also expected to generate more than 30% top-line growth over the next two years, trades at five times this year's sales.
Both emerging market e-commerce stocks traded at much higher valuations last year -- but they were both torpedoed by concerns about a post-lockdown slowdown and the broader downturn in high-growth tech stocks.
However, I think the market's view is myopic and neglects MercadoLibre's long-term strengths. With a market cap of just over $60 billion, I believe the Latin American e-commerce and fintech leader still has plenty of upside potential and should remain a top holding for growth-oriented investors.

2022-04-03 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Time to Buy the S&P 500's 4 Worst-Performing Stocks?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-time-to-buy-the-sp-500s-4-worst-performing-stocks-1,,,"Warren Buffett said to never try to time stock picks perfectly, but if you do, attempt to ""be greedy when others are fearful, and be fearful when others are greedy.""
After the worst quarter for the S&P 500 since the first quarter of 2020, many top stocks are down significantly. And the four worst-performing stocks last quarter included some very popular names, including Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), and Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY). On top of these well-known consumer discretionary stocks, technology consulting firm EPAM Systems (NYSE: EPAM) took the crown for the worst-performing stock in the index.
So should you buy these stocks while the fear is high?
Pandemic tailwinds are turning into headwinds for Netflix, PayPal, and Etsy
In the first quarter, Netflix was down 37.8%, PayPal was down 38.7%, and Etsy was down 43.2%. These stay-at-home growth stocks buoyed by the pandemic reversed course in a big way in 2022, as they were hit by a double-whammy. Not only is growth decelerating as the pandemic pulled forward demand for these stocks, but inflation has spiked. That's led to rising interest rates, which lowers the value of earnings further out into the future. Future earnings make up the bulk of the intrinsic value of growth stocks, so pandemic beneficiaries have been doubly punished.
All three companies reported decent fourth quarters, but the problem was guidance. Netflix guided to lower-than-expected subscriber growth, with CEO Reed Hastings saying, ""We're just, like, staying calm and trying to figure out."" Not exactly encouraging. With the streaming industry becoming more competitive as other services have launched, some are now questioning how many subscribers Netflix will be able to add and ultimately keep -- especially as it recently raised prices.
Meanwhile, the move away from purchasing goods during the pandemic to more experiential services could also hurt Etsy's results. Etsy's growth decelerated to 16.2% in the fourth quarter, versus 35% for the full year 2021. Even worse, the company only guided to only 4.9% growth in the current quarter, with even lower margins on an EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) basis.
Like Netflix, Etsy has raised prices to maintain revenue growth, but it's having some blowback. Last week, 8,000 Etsy sellers signed a petition protesting Etsy's new take rate increases, which are set to rise from 5% to 6.5% in April. Adding fuel to the fire, Loop Capital analyst Laura Champine downgraded the stock in recent days on yet another headwind: inflation in online advertising, which Etsy uses to acquire customers. Overall, it's been an ugly quarter for Etsy, which is facing multiple difficulties.

Finally, PayPal is suffering from some of the same headwinds as Etsy and Netflix, although it has some company-specific headwinds as well. Most notably, it's losing revenue from its largest customer in eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), which used to be PayPal's parent company and exclusive partner. eBay is transitioning to another payment provider, which has lowered revenue to PayPal and hit PayPal's growth in recent quarters. Meanwhile, the omicron variant and geopolitical tensions are threatening PayPal's profitable cross-border revenue. On top of that, management admitted it was abandoning its long-term user goals, as PayPal is now pulling back on advertising to low-usage new customers to focus on keeping higher-frequency users more engaged.
Yet of these three, PayPal would actually be my pick for the best buy at this current moment, even though Netflix is the only of the three I own -- a small position I've held for a long time.
PayPal is still generating enough free cash flow to buy back a significant amount of stock, and its forward P/E ratio is the lowest of the three. Furthermore, PayPal could reaccelerate revenue in the back half of this year, as the effect of the eBay revenue declines should be over by midyear. That catalyst could certainly help the stock, while I don't see a distinct catalyst for the other two.

EPAM Systems is interesting here as well
Finally, EPAM Systems may be worth a look, as it was down the most of any stock in the S&P 500, plunging 57.1% in the first quarter. Similar to the other three, the company has been a beneficiary of rapid digital transformation, but on the enterprise side. A mixture of consulting, engineering, and design, EPAM helps companies design, build, and implement new technology systems and train employees.
Obviously, digital transformation was a hot topic during the pandemic, and EPAM's stock soared as a result, entering the S&P 500 index last year.
EPAM data by YCharts
EPAM, like many other highly valued stocks, took its lumps as the interest rate and inflation outlook changed. However, the stock took yet another leg down at the end of February, after management pulled its first-quarter guidance immediately following the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. EPAM also announced it was pulling out of Russia, where it served some businesses -- but not the government. EPAM also committed $100 million to help employees in Ukraine and their families.
EPAM is profitable and had initially guided for adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share to rise 27.3% this year at the midpoint, to $11.52 per share. That's a deceleration after last year's scorching 42.7% EPS growth, but it's still pretty darn good.
While I'm not as familiar with EPAM, this sell-off could be an opportunity. Technology consulting is an asset-light growth business, and with the stock down so much, it's worth a look. It's true that the company may not hit its earnings target this year, but Russia was probably only a small part of its business. Russia's GDP is tiny, and EPAM operates in more than 40 countries. While European tech projects may be put on hold, digital transformation will continue to march forward. After losing more than half its value already this year, EPAM is a tech stock I'll be following going forward, and maybe buying in the near future.

2022-04-03 00:00:00+00:00,Crazy Market Got You Spooked? Consider These 3 Tech Stocks We Just Bought,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/crazy-market-got-you-spooked-consider-these-3-tech-stocks-we-just-bought,,,"The market has thrashed investors lately, especially those in tech. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index hit all-time highs in November, then dropped precipitously over the next several months, only to bounce back a bit recently. Even though stocks seem to be trading all over the place, savvy investors know that buying stocks through any market conditions is a winning strategy.
Given that backdrop, we asked three longtime Fool.com contributors what stock they've bought recently. They bought or added positions in MongoDB (NASDAQ: MDB), Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), and Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA). Let's check out why.
Image source: Getty Images.
MongoDB: The database on steroids
Danny Vena (MongoDB): Once upon a time, the ability of the database to organize data into rows and columns was a revolutionary way to store, organize, and search information. Decades later, however, the standard structured query language (SQL) database is getting a bit long in the tooth.
These days, data is messy, and it's impossible to squeeze everything into neat little columns and rows. That's where MongoDB comes in. The company offers a full-featured, cloud-centric database that can store and arrange data of all types, including photos, video, social media posts, audio clips, and even full documents, while still providing the search abilities of its predecessor plus the aforementioned rows and columns.
MongoDB operates a freemium service that lets developers download and use the most basic version of its product, which has now been downloaded more than 240 million times since its introduction in 2009. Once developers experience the ease of using this modern database in the cloud, many sign up for the Atlas, MongoDB's fully managed, database-as-a-service (DBaaS) product.
The company's customer list includes many of technology's most recognizable names, including Adobe, eBay, Alphabet, and Cisco, to name just a few.
MongoDB's popularity shows in its financial results. For fiscal 2021 (ended Jan. 31, 2022), revenue grew 48% year over year, increasing to 56% in the fourth quarter. Atlas continues to shine, with 85% growth in Q4, representing 58% of MongoDB's total revenue and surpassing $1 billion in annualized revenue.
Its rapidly increasing customer count is driving this robust performance. MongoDB added more than 2,000 customers in Q4, bringing the total customer count to 33,000, up 33% year over year. But even that doesn't tell the whole story as the company's most valuable clients are growing more quickly.
Customers spending at least $100,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR) increased 34%, while those spending $1 million or more jumped 67%. Additionally, the company's net ARR expansion rate, which reflects increased spending by existing customers, stayed above 120%, a metric it has achieved each and every quarter going back more than 3 years.
The digital transformation is ongoing, and data storage needs will continue to grow exponentially. The database software market topped out at $71 billion in 2020, and management estimates it will grow to $97 billion by 2023. MongoDB's revenue grew to $874 million last year, helping illustrate the magnitude of the opportunity that remains.
MongoDB was crushed by the recent downturn. When I bought the stock roughly two weeks ago, it was 45% off its recent high. Even after the drop, it isn't cheap in terms of traditional valuation metrics, with a price-to-sales ratio of 32. That said, given its consistent above-average growth and massive total addressable market, it was a bargain I couldn't pass up.

Roku: The ad stock that I finally had to add
Will Healy (Roku): After long singing its praises, I finally got off the sofa and streamed some Roku stock into my portfolio.
The main reason is that I see Roku as the future of television -- at least in North America. Streamers want a central operating system (OS) that aggregates streaming channels, while advertisers seek a platform to show television ads to an audience that has steadily abandoned broadcast and cable TV outlets.
Roku addresses both of these challenges through its Roku OS and low-cost streaming devices. Consequently, it claimed 60 million active accounts in Q4, a net increase of 9 million from year-ago levels. Also, Roku's OS is now the No. 1 television ad platform in North America, according to Conviva.
Another reason I bought Roku is that it continues to dispel my doubts. When I first heard of Roku, I saw it as an equipment company with no competitive moat. However, it later leveraged its audience to launch an advertising business, giving it the competitive advantage that drives Roku today. I also doubted the strategy of abandoning its neutrality among channels and launching the Roku Channel. Nonetheless, the Roku Channel has become a top-five channel on the platform without detracting from its appeal, reinforcing the vision of Roku's leadership.
Admittedly, some concerns remain on the international front. Popular channels such as Netflix and Disney's Disney+ have expanded across the world faster than Roku. This has created an opportunity for ad platforms created by Amazon, Samsung, and others. Still, expansions into Europe and South America could bring significant market share.
Investors have also worried that supply chain constraints and the end to pandemic lockdowns will slow Roku's growth. Indeed, the company forecasts 35% revenue growth in 2022, down from 55% in 2021. Still, these headwinds should prove temporary, keeping Roku on a growth trajectory.
Additionally, investors can buy Roku at a massive discount, primarily due to these challenges. The current price is more than 70% below its 52-week high. Moreover, the price-to-sales ratio of seven is near a three-year low. These metrics and the company's ad business made Roku an opportunity too compelling for me to miss.

Okta: The identity management specialist with a huge growth runway ahead
Brian Withers (Okta): Okta has been in the news lately but not for a reason investors are excited about. The company suffered a data breach and didn't do a great job of communicating to customers and shareholders. Additionally, the company seemed to be late and lacking in its approach to handling the issue.
I think the company will learn from this event, and management will take the necessary actions to be more responsive and responsible in the future. The stock has taken a hit, and despite everything, I think now is a great time to get in on this identity management leader. In fact, I recently added more to my personal portfolio. Let's look at why.
The company is growing like crazy and winning with customers, but its recent acquisition of a key competitor, Auth0, is driving costs up. Revenue over the last two years has more than doubled, including the revenue from Auth0 in the most recent quarter. Customers are flocking to the platform and expanding their use of the critical infrastructure software. Customers spending more than $100,000 has more than doubled in the past two years. There are a whopping 197 customers that spend more than $1 million annually, which is up 137% over the past two years.

Despite all of the good news on the top line, the company is losing money at a faster rate. The company's net loss of $241 million is 63% of revenue, meaning it spent 163% of all the money it took in. This is double the loss rate from the last two Q4 periods. This has spooked investors. The key reason for cost increases is related to its recent acquisition of a key competitor. Integrating two companies is hard, and it hasn't even been a year since the acquisition closed last May. It's likely this additional spending will temper over time as management works through the integration process. Given its $2.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, the company has plenty of fuel to continue to invest in growth and allow it to finish the integration work.
I've been an Okta user in two different companies. I can't imagine going back to the old way of having to manage numerous individual log-in passwords versus Okta's simple, single sign-on process. The situation is even worse for the information tech team trying to manage all-user access across a massive enterprise without a centralized platform to do so. As companies move their workloads to the cloud, Okta is becoming the critical front end to manage identity and access rights for large organizations.
Given the company's long runway of growth ahead, I recently added to my position. If you join me in picking up some shares today, I imagine that five years from now, you'll be looking back at this move as a smart one.

*Stock Advisor returns as of March 3, 2022
Jason Hall: So, for MercadoLibre, two things, right? It has been around for more than two decades and is the dominant e-commerce platform in Latin America. In terms of operating fulfillment centers, owning the goods, selling the goods to people, getting the goods delivered, doing that same fulfillment for other merchants, and built its own payment platform, Pago Mercado, or is it Mercado Pago?
Frankel: Mercado Pago.
Hall: Mercado Pago. That actually does more payment volume now off of MercadoLibre than people use it to buy things on the MercadoLibre e-commerce platform. You've seen it become this dominant e-commerce business and also now this dominant payments business in Latin America and I think the payments business alone gives it such an enormous upside in terms of its ability to grow in an area of the world that is still largely paper money. That is still largely real money exchanging hands versus digital currency.
Marcos Galperin, the CEO founder, is on a mission to transition Latin America to digital currency into a digital economy. I think it's very powerful, very visionary leader who's got a long history of demonstrating his ability to lead the company, and they are still just scratching the surface by the way, in that e-commerce business.
Then you take some of the things that a Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) does really well and MercadoLibre is also doing those things. You think about it has a lending platform for merchants and it's starting to leverage that as a way to grow and a way to fund its own growth by helping its merchants with financial strength, so then they can sell more goods on the MercadoLibre platform.
It's like a virtuous cycle that I think is really feeding itself and maybe we don't give the business enough credit for that two decades of data that they've built up. About merchants and different industries and their ability to be successful and grow profits and shopping history and shopper data and consumer trends and taste and that thing.
I think you take all of those things, put them together, and look at how beaten down this stock is right now. I believe this is one of two or three stocks out there that I believe in 15 years, this could be a trillion-dollar company as the market opportunity in Latin America continues to grow, modernization continues, the middle-class continues to expand than its core markets. This could really be one of the most valuable companies in the world in 15 years.
Frankel: I couldn't agree more and Jason and I have joked, and I said I am going to tell my grandparents or my grandkids that I paid $1,000 dollars a share for MercadoLibre one day. [laughs] I believe in the stock that much. I think the management is doing a fantastic job. I think there's some big markets that they have a presence in that it's just starting to scratch the surface.
I think it's like investing in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), Shopify, maybe even FedEx (NYSE: FDX) earlier in their growth cycles because they have all of those businesses, Square [now called Block (NYSE: SQ)] even.

2022-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,PayPal Stock: Bull vs. Bear,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paypal-stock%3A-bull-vs.-bear-0,,,"Shares of digital payments leader PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) are down mightily over the last nine months, now more than 60% below the all-time high reached last summer.
Of course, there are valid reasons for the decline, including losing a major exclusive contract with a large customer, pandemic-era tailwinds fading, and the threat of higher interest rates pulling down the value of growth stocks.
On the other hand, with the stock and valuation down so much, others may see a big opportunity in this former fintech darling. So which side will prevail?
What the bears will say about PayPal
Not much has gone right for PayPal in recent months, and bears will be quick to tell you that. Most notably, the stock took a plunge after its recent conference call, in which management revised down net new active members (NNAs) and revenue projections for the year. Notably, the company abandoned several growth targets outlined just one quarter before. Not only was that disappointing, but it also dinged management's credibility, making even the more modest projections dubious.
Management guided for just 15 million to 20 million net new actives this year, after amassing 120 million new active members over the past two. That's a significant deceleration, and below prior guidance of 30 million to 40 million NNAs. Additionally, management abandoned its medium-term target of 750 million active members altogether. Currently, the company has 426 million active accounts. Management said it was having more success converting regular users to frequent users, but marketing aimed at infrequent or new customers wasn't effective, so it's pulling back.
Management also gave somewhat lackluster revenue guidance of 15% to 17% growth for 2022, below the 18% growth projection given as recently as November.
Furthermore, PayPal's margins seem to be on a downtrend, with adjusted (non-GAAP) operating margins falling from 24.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020 to just 21.8% last quarter, as average take rates continue to tick down. Management also projects just 0% to 3% earnings-per-share growth in 2022, despite higher revenue growth and share buybacks. That could suggest PayPal may be feeling some heat on competitive or regulatory fronts, or both.
In any case, it's clear PayPal's business is slowing down in 2022. Digital payments and e-commerce received huge adoption increases during the pandemic, but now that the pandemic tailwinds are fading, business appears to be slowing.

What the bulls say about PayPal
All of those bearish points look valid and concerning for PayPal. But PayPal bulls would probably point to not one but several one-time elements that will weigh on the first half of 2022, but should fade later on in the year. That could lead to growth accelerating in the second half and into 2023. Off a multi-year low valuation, accelerating revenue could lead to better things for the stock.

What are these one-time elements holding back 2022 results? First, PayPal's revenue from former parent and large customer eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) will decline for the first half of the year. PayPal used to be the exclusive payment option on eBay, but eBay didn't extend its agreement with PayPal, instead choosing European processor Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y).
PayPal will still be a payment option on eBay, as it is on other sites, but the loss of the exclusivity is causing revenue from its largest customer to decline. The transition just began over the past couple of years, but management expects a ""new normal"" in eBay baseline volume will be reached by mid-2022.
While revenue came in at 18% last year, PayPal's revenue outside of eBay grew 29%, which is magnitudes better. In the fourth quarter, eBay's payments volume was less than 3% of total payments volume, down from 6% for all of 2021 and 13% in 2020. So PayPal's growth should accelerate after eBay revenue reaches a steady state. The eBay contract is also higher-margin, which is why PayPal's overall operating margin has been sliding over the past several quarters as eBay revenue declined. But that should stop too, and perhaps move in the other direction, once the eBay decline is over.
Second, PayPal's earnings benefited strongly from reserve releases it took in 2021 on its loan portfolio. Though it shares the economics with partners, PayPal does have credit exposure. In 2020, the company took reserves on expected losses as COVID-19 broke out. But as the economy bounced back strongly, those extra reserves were released in 2021, benefiting margins by 125 basis points.
As the economy has now swung back to concern over inflation and recession fears, PayPal is reserving normally once again. So going from reserve releases to a reserve build will affect its bottom line -- but again, this appears to be a one-time phenomenon due to the extraordinary bounce-back of the economy from COVID-19.
Finally, the delta and omicron variants and associated supply chain issues hurt PayPal's cross-border revenue, which also carries a higher fee and margins than the average PayPal application. But as the world hopefully emerges from COVID-19 and supply chains improve, that high-margin revenue should come back as well this year.
Oh, 2022 will also see Amazon adopt a ""Pay with Venmo"" button on its site, which could certainly lead to increased volumes throughout the year.
The verdict
PayPal has been punished severely, down as much as many profit-less growth stocks amid the rise in interest rates. But PayPal generates a healthy amount of free cash flow, with management projecting $6 billion this year, which would be an 11% increase over 2021.
At 20 times this year's cash flow estimates, and with financials potentially accelerating through 2022, shares seem reasonably priced here. PayPal is still a leader in digital payments, which are taking market share from traditional methods. With a first-mover position, PayPal also has the resources to buy back stock and make acquisitions to bolster growth in the years ahead.
I don't own the stock yet, but I'd lean toward the bulls at these levels.

2022-03-30 00:00:00+00:00,3 of the Best Value Stocks to Buy Heading Into April,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-of-the-best-value-stocks-to-buy-heading-into-april,,,"Three months into 2022, the markets are in turmoil, and highly priced stocks are falling fast. Investors can look for safety in value-oriented investments that are less vulnerable to sharp declines. The businesses listed here are all profitable and trading at incredibly cheap future earnings multiples.
Among the best value buys out there today are Organon (NYSE: OGN), Citigroup (NYSE: C), and FedEx (NYSE: FDX). Collectively, they can add some stability and diversification to your portfolio.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Organon
Organon was spun off from Merck last year, and its operations are focused on women's health, established medicines, and biosimilars. Although this isn't much for a growth stock right now, Organon could make for a stable buy over the long term. The business generates solid gross margins (north of 60%) and has been consistently profitable.
Last month, it reported sales of $1.6 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, down 1% against the prior-year period. However, it did report 6% growth in its women's health division. Unfortunately, established brands, which is its largest segment, declined by 2% due to competition and losses in exclusivity.
The company is investing in its growth, announcing in December the completed acquisition of Forendo Pharma, a clinical-stage company that is developing treatments for endometriosis (a condition that affects up to 170 million women) and polycystic ovarian syndrome.
Although the recent results are lackluster, there's potential for Organon. And the shares are heavily discounted, giving investors a bit of an extra incentive to take a chance on this relatively new stock. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 6.4, this is incredibly cheap; Merck, which is already a fairly inexpensive stock, is trading at just 11 times its future earnings. Plus, Organon pays an above-average dividend yield of 3.2%, which is more than double the S&P 500 average's yield of 1.3%.
Investors are starting to see the value of this fairly stable business. So far in 2022, the shares are up 15%, which is better than the S&P 500's losses of 4% over the same period. Although there's some risk with Organon since its operations aren't showing much growth, given the discounted earnings multiple and strong margins and fundamentals, it could make for an underrated buy right now.
2. Citigroup
Bank stocks can offer investors some good value, and Citigroup is no exception. And now that interest rates are on the rise, there could be some extra motivation for investors to add a top bank stock to their portfolios. With higher interest rates, there's more of an opportunity for banks to profit on the difference between the rate they pay depositors and what they charge on loans.
Last year, Citigroup's profits doubled -- at least in part, because it was able to free up provisions for credit losses amid a stronger economic outlook. However, the company's loan-interest revenue fell 12% to $35.4 million. And 2020's figure was already down 16% from the year earlier.
A strong economy this year combined with higher interest rates could lead to a resurgence in loan interest revenue for Citigroup, resulting in a strong performance for the business in 2022. But even if that doesn't happen and inflation and geopolitical issues derail the economy, it's generally a safe long-term bet to expect the economy to do well.
And that's why buying this bank stock right now could be an advantageous move for investors. Year to date, it is down 7% and its forward P/E is right around 8, while rival banks JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America trade at multiples of around 13. Citigroup is also the only one of the three that trades below its book value -- a dirt-cheap ratio of just 0.6. Throw in its high-yielding dividend that pays 3.7%, and this looks like a value investor's dream.
3. FedEx
A positive, long-term outlook for the economy is also a reason FedEx might be worth buying on the dip. Down 11% in 2022, it has been declining amid geopolitical issues. And it's probable that the company will have some challenging quarters ahead due to a slowdown in online shopping.
Consumers are likely to make more in-store purchases as the economy returns to normal. Many of the top e-commerce stocks are already struggling this year in anticipation of that, with Shopify down around 50% year to date and eBay falling by 12%. The mighty Amazon remains resilient with gains of just over 1%, but even that is a mortal return for the high-powered business.
However, FedEx still looks strong today. In its most recent quarterly results, for the period ended Feb. 28, its sales were up 10% to $23.6 billion, and net income totaled $1.1 billion, up 25% from the same period last year. FedEx says the results could have been even stronger if not for the emergence of omicron, which disrupted its operations.
With shares of the stock on the dip, now could be an excellent time to load up on the logistics company. Trading at just 11 times its future earnings, the stock looks like a bargain compared to rival United Parcel Service, where investors are paying a multiple of 17. Even though 2022 might be a challenging year for FedEx, the long-term trajectory remains promising, and that's why it's a great buy. It also pays a dividend yield of 1.3%.

At times of volatility, investors in the stock market may be reconsidering their risk appetite. They might even rotate into more defensive stocks. And quite possibly, they could shy away from fast-growing sectors such as e-commerce stocks. This is understandable, as many e-commerce companies do not necessarily have a strong track record of profitability. Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that the industry has seen rising adoption even before the pandemic. And chances are, consumers who are used to the convenience of shopping online from the comforts of their home will not be fully reverting to their old ways anytime soon.
The e-commerce industry also does not lack exciting developments. For instance, eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) hosted its investor day earlier this month which outlines the long-term strategy of the company. It introduced the eBay Vault, a secure storage facility and digital marketplace for trading collectibles, with plans to expand into luxury goods. On top of that, eBay also introduced its first digital wallet where customers can proceed from their sales to conveniently purchase their next item. 
Meanwhile, Chinese e-commerce giants such as Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) have seen their share prices heavily beaten down over the past year. This is despite their generally stable financials. Nevertheless, there are hopes that China may be easing off its crackdown on large internet companies. Besides, Alibaba appears to be showing confidence in its own stock as it ramped up its share buyback program to $25 billion. With all said and done, the e-commerce industry is one that will likely thrive over the long term as consumer habits evolve. If you share the same sentiments, then here are some of the top e-commerce stocks in thestock market today 
E-commerce Stocks To Watch This Week
Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT)
Chewy Inc (NYSE: CHWY)
MercadoLibre Inc (NASDAQ: MELI )
Sea Ltd (NYSE: SE)
Walmart
To kick start the list, we have the retail giant that needs no introduction, Walmart. Over the past few years, the company has been ramping up its e-commerce presence. It now offers shopping opportunities in both retail stores and through e-commerce platforms. Customers can find an assortment of merchandise and services at everyday low prices. Thus, as more buyers are now stepping outdoors again, Walmart can capitalize on both the rising e-commerce trends while maintaining its retail presence. 
Earlier this month, the company announced plans of hiring more than 5,000 technology associates globally this year. This will be part of its expansion plan of Walmart Global Tech. It appears that Toronto, Ontario, and Atlanta, Georgia will be the two new Walmart Global Tech hubs. Well, these locations have a growing tech presence and the company believes that there is an untapped pool of diverse local talent within these areas. Overall, these technology investments would hopefully make the online and in-store experience better for its customers. With that in mind, would you consider buying WMT stock?

Chewy
Unlike Walmart, Chewy is a pure-play e-commerce company that caters to the pet community. In detail, its brands include A Pet Hub, A&E Cage Company, A Pet’s Life, ABO Gear, and many more. Pet enthusiasts can access the company’s products through its e-commerce platform at amazing prices, every day. With more than 2,000 brands available, Chewy promises to help its customers to find the perfect item for their pets. Thus, shopping for pets has never been easier. That said, sentiment around CHWY stock has not been the best lately, with the stock falling by 20% this year. 
So, could its upcoming fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 earnings report turn things around? During the company’s third quarter, its net sales grew to $2.21 billion, up 24.1% year-over-year. Meanwhile, its gross margin of 26.4% expanded 90 basis points year-over-year. This sustained growth shows the soundness of Chewy’s strategies while reflecting the durability of the pet category. As such, it should not be surprising that investors will be on the lookout for CHWY stock ahead of its earnings on March 29, 2022.

MercadoLibre
Following that, we will be looking at the e-commerce giant, MercadoLibre. The company’s presence is largely in Latin America. For those unaware, MercadoLibre enables commerce through its marketplace platform that is designed to provide users with a portfolio of services for commercial transactions. Investors should note that Latin America is a region with more than 635 million people and has one of the fastest-growing Internet penetration rates in the world. 
With more than two decades of dominance in the e-commerce industry within the region, MercadoLibre continues to grow despite increasing competition over the years. In February, the company announced its fourth-quarter financial results. Impressively, its unique active users have now reached 82.2 million. Notably, its gross merchandise volume improved to $8.0 billion, representing an increase of 21.2% compared to the prior year’s quarter. Besides, its net revenue continues to increase to $2.1 billion, up 60.5% year-over-year. All in all, MercadoLibre remains a force to be reckoned with in a fast-growing region. Keeping this in mind, is MELI stock a buy right now?

Sea
As aforementioned, there is increasing competition within the e-commerce space in Latin America. And, one of the main contenders would be Sea’s Shopee. Since its launch in Brazil back in 2019, it has taken the region by storm. Just within two years, Shopee has become the most downloaded shopping app in Brazil. Besides that, Sea also operates a digital payments segment and digital entertainment segment. The company’s Garena platform offers mobile and personal computer online games. Meanwhile, its SeaMoney is seeing increasing adoption among consumers by the day. 
Sea started the month of March by announcing its fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial results. Its total GAAP revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, up 105.7% year-over-year. Out of which, its e-commerce business contributed $1.6 billion, representing an increase of 89.4% compared to the same period last year. Earlier today, Sea said that it will be shutting down Shopee in India, citingglobal marketuncertainties. This came just months after the e-commerce service debuted there. As the company streamlines its operations, should SE stock have a place in your portfolio?

2022-03-26 00:00:00+00:00,Lofty Valuations and Inflation: Why eBay Might Be My Favorite Stock Right Now,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lofty-valuations-and-inflation%3A-why-ebay-might-be-my-favorite-stock-right-now,,,"E-commerce pioneer eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is one of the most underappreciated investment opportunities in the market today. Not only is it a good value, but it also provides a margin of safety from macro-economic issues.
Moreover, eBay is sitting on a whopping $8 billion investment portfolio that's often overlooked by investors sifting through stock metrics, meaning eBay stock is an even better value than it appears at first glance.
Why eBay is a great value stock
eBay had its initial public offering (IPO) in 1998, meaning it's one of the few early internet companies to survive the dot-com bubble. And it survived for good reason. The company has done well at churning out net profits for over two decades, as the chart below shows.
EBAY Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts
Over 20 years of net income and high operating margin create confidence that this will continue to be a profitable company going forward. And right now, you can buy eBay stock at a relatively attractive valuation.
According to Yardeni Research, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio average for the S&P 500 is 22.1, well above its historical average of 15.5. With eBay, a little context is needed before revealing its P/E because the company got a $13 billion boost in 2021 from selling off some non-core assets. This boost temporarily inflates its net income and artificially brings its P/E ratio down to an absurd value of just 3.
For this reason, it may be better to consider eBay's cash from operations (what the business itself produced), which was just over $3 billion in 2021. Considering it has a market capitalization of almost $34 billion as of this writing, eBay stock trades at a paltry 11 times its cash from operations, well below the current and historical average P/E valuation of the S&P 500.
Going back to that $13 billion boost, eBay management used it to reward shareholders. In 2021, it bought back $7 billion in stock, which lowers the overall outstanding shares and increases shareholders' piece of the pie.
Right now, eBay is sitting on $8 billion more in long-term investments in e-commerce companies like Adevinta and fintech companies like Adyen. Management could simply continue holding these positions and let them appreciate in value -- not a bad option. Or it could choose to sell these as well, providing it with another pile of cash to reward shareholders.
eBay management is also rewarding shareholders through a dividend. Its yield is low now at 1.6%. However, it only paid out $466 million in 2021 -- a small percentage of its overall earnings. It's been steadily increasing dividend payouts and there's plenty of room to continue doing so.

Why eBay offers protection from inflation
Ever wonder why gas station prices instantly spike when the price of crude oil is going up? It's because operators need to sell their current supply of gas at a price that's high enough to replace it.
Inflation is problematic for capital-intensive businesses. Profits today may not adequately cover future expenses. And with inflation at a 40-year high, I don't believe it's a macro-economic issue that investors can ignore. That's another reason to like eBay right now.
eBay is a marketplace business that simply connects buyers and sellers -- it doesn't carry inventory. So eBay is insulated somewhat from inflationary risks. Moreover, it can actually benefit from inflation. As product prices increase, eBay processes higher sales volume, allowing its revenue to increase because its transaction fees are a percentage of the transaction cost. If the cost rises, the fee goes up as well.
And speaking of high gas prices, consumers are likely to tighten their belts in the coming months as they grapple with rising prices. This could also be to eBay's advantage because of its reputation for bargains. History favors this perspective. The Great Recession in the U.S. was in 2008 and 2009, and eBay grew revenue 11% and 2% respectively in those years, despite the pullback in consumer spending overall.
Don't sleep on eBay's growth potential
Below-average valuations are typically given to dying businesses with zero growth prospects. That doesn't describe eBay. Management is projecting 0% to 3% year-over-year top-line growth in 2022, 5% to 6% in 2023, and 7% to 8% in 2024. While it's not high growth, eBay is far from dead.
eBay's newer initiatives should drive this growth. Advertising revenue is expected to double by 2025 and payment-processing revenue is also padding the top line. And these revenue streams also come with improved profit margins.
The stock market has been volatile lately. If you're looking to get off the roller coaster, consider eBay. Its valuation is dirt cheap, its management is rewarding shareholders, and it's prepared for whatever comes next. This encapsulates why eBay is one of my favorite stocks to buy right now.

And with the recent geopolitical turmoil of the past few weeks, stocks are going through a rough start to the year.
Fintech stocks have been getting particularly hammered. Chief among them is payments giant PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), which is down almost 40% in 2022. The business has increased sales, profit, and active accounts at a rapid pace over the past few years, and its stock price has followed.
But with a cheaper valuation today, is PayPal a buy right now? Let's take a closer look.
Image source: Getty Images.
What's hurting the stock?
Along with the broader sell-off of high-growth, high-multiple stocks, PayPal is facing a number of headwinds. Soaring inflation, as well as the fading effect of massive government stimulus to boost the economy during the pandemic, discourages users from shopping as much. That hurts the company's transaction revenue. Additionally, PayPal's 34 million merchant accounts are dealing with congested supply chains, constraining their ability to sell more goods.
A development that has received a lot of attention is eBay's transition away from PayPal and to its own payments system. This move reduced PayPal's top line by $600 million (primarily in Q1 and Q2) in 2021, although the effect will be minimal this year and beyond. Nonetheless, losing a big e-commerce partner like this is a huge worry for shareholders.
In 2020 and 2021, PayPal added 122 million net new active accounts to its platform, bringing the total to 426 million as of Dec. 31. However, only 15 million to 20 million accounts are expected to be added in 2022, a sharp deceleration from what investors have recently been accustomed to. Management has also walked back its earlier goal of reaching 750 million users by 2025, citing a new focus on growing revenue per account by getting its customers to engage with PayPal's services more.
PayPal makes money when accounts holders do transactions on the platform (92% of revenue in Q4 2021 came from transaction fees), so to have users who sign up and don't use the services is not really valuable to the business. But I can see how investors could view management's new focus as a sign that PayPal's growth prospects are limited.
Since closing at an all-time high of $308.53 on July 23 last year, PayPal's shares are down 63%. However, since spinning off from eBay and going public in 2015, the stock has returned 211%. If investors place their attention on the bigger picture, now might be an opportune time to buy this beaten-down, but market-beating, fintech company.
Zoom out and focus on the long term
I firmly believe that investors would benefit by staying focused on the next five years. Then, everything happening in the short term will seem like a blip on the radar. Using this mindset when analyzing PayPal provides some key insights about the quality of this business.
First of all, the company possesses undeniably stellar financial metrics. In 2022, PayPal increased sales 18% year over year. What stood out, though, was the annual free cash flow of $5.4 billion. Not only has the business historically been a fast grower, but it is extremely profitable. That's because capital expenditures account for just 4% of revenue in any given quarter.
Despite the expectation of slowing user growth, PayPal's network is absolutely massive, processing $1.25 trillion in total payment volume (TPV) in 2021, up 33% from the prior year. And management sees this figure approaching $1.5 trillion this year. Being an available payment option at 76% of the top 1,500 retailers in North America and Europe, much more than any other digital wallet, demonstrates PayPal's importance for consumers and merchants.
eBay's migration away from PayPal is certainly not the best news, but the announced Venmo partnership with Amazon can help alleviate any investor worries. Outside of debit and credit cards, the e-commerce behemoth doesn't accept payment from third parties, so this is a major stamp of approval for PayPal's dominance. Venmo just boosted its ability to better monetize its user base.
With a more attractive valuation today, at a price-to-earnings ratio of 33, PayPal shares might make for a worthwhile investment in the fintech market.

2022-03-23 00:00:00+00:00,Prediction: These Will Be the 10 Largest Stocks by 2035,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/prediction%3A-these-will-be-the-10-largest-stocks-by-2035-0,,,"Today, it takes a market cap of just over $550 billion to earn a spot on the top 10 list. And this is likely to rise in the future. If the stock market averages 9% annualized returns between now and 2035, that implies that the 10 largest companies will have market caps of about $1.7 trillion or greater, and some will likely be several times larger than this threshold. With that in mind, here are 10 companies (in no particular order) that I think have an excellent shot of being on the list when 2035 arrives.
The 10 largest stocks by 2035?
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)
This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. With a market cap of about $2.7 trillion today, Apple would likely be firmly in the top 10 in 2035 even if it doesn't appreciate in value at all. But with an extremely loyal customer base, tremendous pricing power, and the ability to generate over $100 billion in free cash flow annually, I wouldn't be shocked to see Apple become the first $5 trillion company, and well before 2035.
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)
With a market cap of about $1.63 trillion, Amazon is one of the largest companies today, but don't make the mistake of thinking it has maxed out its potential. After all, e-commerce is still less than 15% of total U.S. retail sales, its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has a rapidly growing addressable market, and there are several other areas Amazon could expand into over the next decade or so.

MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI)
MercadoLibre often gets referred to as the Amazon of Latin America, but it is so much more than that. It's like the Amazon, Block (NYSE: SQ), eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), and maybe even the Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) of Latin America, all in one stock, and at much earlier stages of their respective growth cycles. With a $57 billion market cap, MercadoLibre is one of the smaller companies on this list, but it definitely has trillion-dollar potential if it can realize its true potential.
PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL)
PayPal's stock has been beaten down recently, and to be fair, its customer base isn't growing as fast as investors had been expecting. However, this is still the dominant leader in payment processing, especially for e-commerce, with over 400 million active users and operations all over the world. There are still some unanswered questions regarding future growth strategy and the ability to effectively monetize all of its users, but there's trillion-dollar potential here.
Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)
Alphabet is best known for its Google platform, which has a dominant share of the internet search market. With a $1.8 trillion market cap, and several other businesses that could end up being needle-movers, Alphabet is likely to still be one of the 10 largest companies in the market by 2035.
Block (Square)
Block, formerly known as Square, has evolved from a niche payment processing hardware company into a full-featured financial ecosystem in its first 13 years of existence. And with the company just scratching the surface of its long-term opportunities, it will be fun to watch the next 13 years of Block's evolution. If it can be half as innovative as it has been so far, it could certainly earn a spot in the top 10.
Shopify
As mentioned in the context of Amazon, fewer than 15% of retail sales take place by e-commerce. And this is in the U.S. -- in many international markets, e-commerce penetration is even lower. Shopify has grown into a leader in enabling e-commerce for businesses of all sizes, and it could multiply its business many times over as the industry continues to evolve.
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)
Microsoft isn't going to deliver jaw-dropping returns between now and 2035, but it doesn't need to. With a $2.24 trillion market cap and a largely predictable and growing revenue stream, it's difficult to imagine a world where Microsoft wasn't near the top of the list for the foreseeable future.
Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB)
It's tough to imagine a ""lodging stock"" with a trillion-dollar market value, but it wouldn't be shocking to see Airbnb achieve it. The company's addressable market is literally every short-term and long-term rental property in the world, as well as every adjacent experience that can be booked through the platform. Airbnb estimates that the current opportunity is roughly $4 trillion in annual bookings, and if Airbnb can grow into a dominant force, it could reach the top 10 list.
Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B)
Berkshire Hathaway is designed to produce returns that are consistently market-beating, and with a nearly 60-year track record of doing just that, there's no reason to believe this will change. And this is even true if Warren Buffett is no longer at the helm. Buffett would turn 105 years old in 2035, so it's unlikely he'll still be calling the shots at Berkshire, but this is a long-term compounding machine that should keep doing what it's designed to do.
There are many others that could end up on the list
As I mentioned, nobody can predict the future, and I certainly am not an exception. And it's important to mention that this isn't an exhaustive list of stocks that have multitrillion-dollar market cap potential between now and 2035. Just to name a few examples, chipmaker NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) was No. 11 on my list, and there are several companies in the payments industry, especially Visa (NYSE: V), Mastercard (NYSE: MA), and Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y), that could certainly grow to several times their current size.
The electric vehicle space remains a massive opportunity. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) could certainly land in the top 10 if it ends up dominating the industry, and General Motors (NYSE: GM) is an example of a company that has lots of potential in both electric and autonomous vehicles.
I know I missed some other high-potential companies here, including some that are currently on the top 10 list by market cap. But the point is that I could go on and on with companies that could be the next trillion-dollar businesses. But the 10 in this list are those I feel have the best chance to end up on top.

2022-03-21 00:00:00+00:00,Reasons to Bet on Paypal Stock’s V-Shaped Rebound,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/reasons-to-bet-on-paypal-stocks-v-shaped-rebound,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Although PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) is trading far below its $310 high, 2022 is a rough market for technology stocks. PYPL stock plunged after posting a slowdown in the latest quarter.
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com
It is not alone in the group of stocks falling after weak earnings. Investors will not put up with companies facing a sharp deceleration in growth. Last week, the stock regained some ground due to Nasdaq’s rebound.
PayPal joins Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) as former momentum stocks that face strong selling pressure.
PYPL Stock Due for a V-Shaped Rebound
Since peaking at over $300 last summer, bottom-fishing investors in PayPal tried but failed to re-start a rally. PayPal’s valuations are almost three-fold higher than financial institutions. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) of 30 times would sound cheap if it were 2019 – 2021. The macroeconomic environment for 2022 is completely different.
The central bank will remove money from the stock market and raise interest rates. PayPal’s soft first-quarter results and light guidance for 2022 will limit the chances of a v-shaped rebound. Still, PayPal posted a solid fourth quarter/2021 finish. Total payment volume grew by 23% year-over-year (YOY) to $339.5 billion. Net revenue grew by 13% YOY to $6.9 billion. The GAAP earnings per share (EPS) was 68 cents.
9 Gold Stocks to Buy as Global Fears Rise
For fiscal 2022, total payment volume will grow in the range of 19% to 22%. Revenue is forecasted to grow at between 15% to 17%. GAAP EPS will be in the range of $2.97 to $3.15. On a Non-GAAP EPS measure, it will report $4.60 to $4.75. The forward P/E of below 25 times gives PayPal investors a decent level of safety.
PayPal posted an operating cash flow of $6.3 billion last quarter. It has many options ahead in reaccelerating growth. It could acquire companies to increase its presence in the e-commerce space. For instance, last year, markets floated the idea of PayPal buying Pinterest (NYSE:PINS). While it has the cash to buy the company, Pinterest will not increase investor returns.
PayPal acquired Happy Returns to anchor its post-purchase process. Customers may return goods with ease and at affordable levels. This will drive user engagement. In the back half of the quarter, it pared customer acquisition efforts.
Cutting Costs
PayPal recently pared incentive-led campaigns. It disqualified certain accounts from its campaigns. This hurt its net new active number. Algorithmic traders that picked up the weaker customer count failed to recognize the meaning. PayPal needed to remove accounts that it found were not legitimate and needs to retain good accounts for future campaigns. For its future incentive campaigns, PayPal will not reward accounts that are taking advantage of its platform.
In the fourth quarter, PayPal counted an immaterial 4.5 million account creations out of its overall 426 million customer accounts. From now on, it may confidently launch aggressive customer engagement campaigns in 2022.
Growth Opportunity
PayPal reset investor expectations when it set a revenue growth guidance of 15% to 17%. A few months ago, it expected 18% growth. The company has a more conservative forecast. It is seeing spending weakness from its lower-income group.
Venmo could drive transaction volumes this year. As businesses navigate through supply chain issues and inflationary pressures, customers may increase their Venmo use at checkout. In the fourth quarter, Venmo accounted for $250 million of revenue, up by 80% YOY. PayPal is in the early phases of monetizing it. It began implementing Venmo on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which should increase transaction volumes this year.
Risks for PYPL Stock
PayPal’s business separation from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is a headwind. Total payment volume fell by 45% YOY. Fortunately, eBay volumes represented only 2.7% of total volumes. Last year, eBay accounted for 6% of the total volume.
Last year’s stimulus money helped eBay’s business, which benefited PayPal. PayPal will grow revenue by 13% without eBay’s support. It has many initiatives ahead that will offset the lost eBay business in 2022 and beyond.
Macroeconomic headwinds will persist in 2022. The government is no longer stimulating the economy in the post-pandemic world. Inflation is so high that the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) is in panic mode. The Fed will raise rates several times this year to slow the economy. This will hurt PayPal’s transaction volumes. The fintech giant will need to control expenses without hurting customer service levels.
It could pull it off.
PayPal has a consistent history of beating investor expectations. Analysts are bullish on PayPal stock. Per Tipranks, the price target ranges from $107 to $245. The average price target is $182.36.
Your Takeaway on PYPL Stock
PayPal is one of the few fintech giants that current investors should consider as a core holding. The stock may underperform for a while. Conversely, it may continue its v-shaped rebound that began on the week of Mar. 14, 2022. In that week, the Nasdaq rose by over 8%. To sustain a rally, PayPal needs market sentiment to remain positive.
Rational investors cannot time the market by predicting sentiment. Similarly, traders may speculate on a sharp rebound by guessing. Instead of doing either of those things, establish a price zone at the right P/E multiple. Wait for the stock to trade at a P/E to growth (PEG) multiple that suits your risk tolerance. From there, start a position.

In this clip from ""The Virtual Opportunities Show"" on Motley Fool Live, recorded on March 15, Motley Fool contributor Jose Najarro discusses the reasons why investors should keep an eye on the fintech stock.

{% sfr %}
Jose Najarro: PayPal, right now, is down 60% from all-time highs. I think this is insane how the market is right now. But, we can see it's down big. Another thing, I'm not huge into metrics, but I just like to see how things are. It's not, at the end of the day, a huge part in my investment thesis, but we can see PayPal's price-to-sales ratio is at 4.6. These are values seen in 2016, 2017. This is a company that has Venmo and other digital wallets, so they have increased their overall user base. Some other things I wanted to show, trailing 12 months, company's gross profits continue to see a nice uptrend here. Next, I wanted to show their fundamentally right balance sheet. They have plenty of cash in their balance sheet. They do have a nice amount of debt, but trailing 12 months, they have about $6.4 billion in cash flow from operations. At the moment, just from looking obviously at the top end, things don't look too bad for PayPal. I know PayPal recently has revamped their application to create the new PayPal app, which is pretty cool to have things like buy now, pay later. Not something I'm a fan of, but I know we're seeing a nice amount of user growth using applications like that. They've also provided a little bit more crypto solutions. For example, if you buy crypto with PayPal, you can pay through it. It's pretty much just changing your crypto to your current fiat and then making the transaction there. Another few things I wanted to mention is, even though growth is not as big as it was in 2020, and obviously 2020 is going to be a very hard comp, we can see this most recent year of 2021. They just finished their fiscal year. They grew new active accounts by over 48.9 million. Most of that was actually organic growth. The other thing that I thought was super interesting was that total payment volume continuing to grow. Again, we're still seeing improvements in operating cash flow and free cash flow. This company has been impacted somewhat from eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY). If you're just looking at top value stills, number growth don't seem as strong, but if you exclude eBay, this is a company that's continuing, in my opinion, to show strong market fundamentals. I want to say, at the end of the day, there are numerous other fintech solutions. The overall increase of other competition can also be hurting this company. But, to me, this is definitely one to keep an eye on, especially with the growth that we're seeing right now.

MercadoLibre -- Down 46%
Danny Vena (MercadoLibre): There's been a significant correction that has plagued tech stocks since mid-November, with the Nasdaq Composite Index slipping briefly into bear market territory this week. As a result, Wall Street is offering a long list of top-notch tech companies at a discount. History suggests that this could represent a massive opportunity for savvy investors, assuming they have the courage and resources to act.
MercadoLibre is one such stock. While the company isn't a household name in the U.S., you'd be hard-pressed to find online shoppers who aren't familiar with MercadoLibre's industry-leading, e-commerce, and fintech platform in its home market of Latin America.
Since the stock has lost nearly half its value in just a few months, you might suspect there are underlying problems with the company's business model or its growth, but nothing could be further from the truth. In the fourth quarter, MercadoLibre reported net revenue of $2.1 billion, up 74% year over year in local currencies. While that's impressive in its own right, consider this: That growth is on top of 149% gains in the prior-year quarter.
Revenue from the company's e-commerce business climbed 67% year over year, an impressive feat in the face of record-setting comps. Growth within the fintech business was even more robust, with revenue that surged 81% on top of triple-digit gains in the prior-year quarter. Contributing to those impressive gains were gross merchandise volume (GMV) and gross payment volume (GPV) that set quarterly records for the company.
While sales growth is tamer than this time last year, it's impressive considering MercadoLibre doesn't have the pandemic-related tailwinds driving its growth. Rather, it's the company's sticky ecosystem that is fueling the current results.
While e-commerce and payments are MercadoLibre's bread and butter, a large and growing list of ancillary services keep customers and merchants coming back for more. This includes website creation and maintenance, fulfillment and logistics, shipping and cross-docking, working capital loans, consumer credit, digital wallet, cryptocurrency transactions, and more.
One of MercadoLibre's biggest growth engines going forward is that of payments. Mercado Pago, the company's digital payments solution, was so successful on its platform that other online merchants began to adopt it for their own customers. It then made the leap to brick-and-mortar establishments and never looked back. In Q4, off-platform payments surged 97% year over year, bringing more physical retailers into the fold.
Finally, MercadoLibre has never been cheap using traditional valuation metrics. That said, the stock is currently selling for a price-to-sales ratio of less than 8. To give that context, MercadoLibre stock hasn't been this deeply discounted since early 2016, marking its lowest valuation in six years.
Investors would do well to pick up shares of this Latin American e-commerce and fintech powerhouse while they're on sale. History suggests that the opportunity to get MercadoLibre at this price won't last long.

PayPal -- Down 65%
Will Healy (PayPal): Fintech pioneer PayPal has struggled over the last year. Aside from a generalized sell-off in tech growth stocks, the end of its favored relationship with former parent eBay weighed heavily on profits. Also, a shift in emphasis from growing customer numbers to better monetizing its current customer base appeared to unsettle investors.
However, the separation from eBay has become a huge benefit to PayPal. Despite PayPal's drop, its market cap is nearly four times as large as its former parent's. Moreover, despite an emphasis on its current customers, it still expects to add between 15 million and 20 million new users to its active customer count of 426 million this year.
Also, PayPal has positioned itself to better monetize its current customer base. The Venmo app has grown to a user base of over 83 million, and it has made deals to allow Amazon and Roku customers to pay with Venmo, increasing the app's usability. Additionally, its integration of Honey into both PayPal and Venmo could help to further monetize the user base by offering customer discounts.
Such moves boost revenue, which came in at $25.4 billion in 2021, an 18% increase from year-ago levels. Also, net income fell by under 1% over the same period to just under $4.2 billion as lower net gains on strategic expenses weighed on earnings.
But despite stagnant income, financial projections offer hope for a recovery. The company projects 15% to 17% higher revenue in 2022, and analysts forecast double-digit earnings growth to return in 2023. Additionally, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has fallen to 30, down from the 75 range in July. That drop likely prices in the near-term challenges for the stock, helping to make PayPal stock a buy.

DocuSign -- Down 74%
Brian Withers (DOCU): It's been two years since the U.S. started shutting down due to early COVID-19 cases. As companies scrambled to enable their employees to work remotely, DocuSign was being adopted to ensure business processes could continue without in-person physical signatures on paper.
A lot has happened since then. The company has more than doubled its revenue and its enterprise and commercial customers, and nearly doubled customers paying more than $300,000 in annual contract value (ACV). It has gotten significantly more efficient, and operating cash flow has more than quadrupled. Despite all of these incredible gains, the stock is trading 74% off its high and at levels near where it was in March 2020.

With this share price, one can only assume that these incredible results are being ignored and the stock is being dragged down by world events and an overweight emphasis on its 18% year-over-year growth projection for the coming year. This gives investors a great opportunity to buy into a critical enabler for today's enterprise operations. Let me explain why.
The company has more than doubled its large enterprise and commercial customers, which account for 88% of its revenue. These 95,000 new customers over the past two years are just getting started with this e-signature platform and have only begun to tap into the full capability of the software. With net-dollar retention ranging from 117% to 125% over the last nine quarters, it's clear that existing customers find more opportunities to use the e-signature capability more often in more functions across the enterprise.
These strong net-dollar retention numbers don't even account for DocuSign's expansive Agreement Cloud suite of products that cover all phases of the agreement process: prepare, sign, act, and manage. The company has barely tapped the additional $25 billion of the market opportunity for the other phases of the agreement process outside of the e-signature business.
This stock will not stay down forever as the market will eventually realize that DocuSign's customers are never going back to pen-and-paper signatures. It's not too late to pick up a few shares of this software specialist that's become a critical part of everyday business.

2022-03-18 00:00:00+00:00,Is Now the Time to Buy Unity Stock?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-now-the-time-to-buy-unity-stock,,,"Since going public in 2020 at $52 per share, Unity Software's (NYSE: U) stock has been on a roller-coaster ride. After hitting a 52-week high of $210 last November, shares now trade for nearly a third of that at the time of this writing.
The stock declined in December following the company's acquisition of special effects company Weta Digital for a hefty $1.6 billion. Shares dropped further as tech stocks took a hit in recent weeks.
Given Unity stock's volatility, does its price drop present a buying opportunity? Good companies persevere over short-term volatility. Unity certainly has the qualities to prosper over the long run.
Let's dig into the company to understand its prospects for long-term success. From there, we can gauge whether Unity is a worthwhile investment.

The key to Unity's success
Unity has been successful growing its business. The company's 2021 full-year revenue was $1.1 billion, a 44% year-over-year increase, and the first time Unity exceeded $1 billion in sales.
Unity's business model is the key to its success. When the company was founded in 2004, it went after independent gaming creators, offering affordable software tools to create 2D and 3D digital content for video games. At the time, global video game sales in 2004 had reached $26.3 billion.
Unity's strategy proved prescient. Mobile gaming exploded in the years since Unity's founding, helping independent creators to flourish, such as Rovio with its Angry Birds mobile game, and driving the global video game market to $180.3 billion in 2021.
Unity boasts that last year over half the video games created for mobile, PC, and console devices used its software. The company's business model maintains its effectiveness because Unity helps content creators achieve success by providing end-to-end solutions, from the tools to build digital content to solutions that assist creators with income generation.
As part of this model, the company established two major business segments. Its ""create solutions"" division focuses on content creation tools. This includes the ability for creators to build their content once, then deploy it to multiple platforms across mobile devices, PCs, virtual reality platforms, and more.
Unity's second major business segment, ""operate solutions,"" gives creators the means to raise awareness of their content through advertising, and to charge for it, such as providing in-app purchasing capabilities. Operate solutions typically takes a percentage of sales from creators, so as creators achieve revenue growth, so does Unity. This model made the division Unity's biggest, comprising 64% of 2021 revenue.
How are Unity's financials?
The success of Unity's business model enabled the company to consistently increase income by more than 40% year over year for the past three years.
YEAR ENDED REVENUE GROWTH (YOY)
2021 $1.1 billion 44%
2020 $772.4 million 43%
2019 $541.8 million 42%
Data source: Unity Software. YOY = year over year.
Unity expects revenue growth to continue. It forecasts full-year 2022 revenue to come in around $1.5 billion.
However, Unity's revenue growth didn't translate into profits. The company had a net loss of $532.6 million last year, but net losses are common among tech companies pursuing growth over profitability.
The company also ended 2021 with negative free cash flow of $153.4 million, an increase from the prior year's negative free cash flow of $20.2 million. But this year, Unity anticipates achieving positive free cash flow.
Moreover, Unity's balance sheet is strong. It exited 2021 with total assets of $4.8 billion, with $1.1 billion in cash and equivalents, compared to total liabilities of $2.4 billion.
To buy or not to buy Unity stock
Unity's future growth will be helped by the company's push into industries beyond video games. Its Weta Digital acquisition was part of this strategy, and Unity's 3D creation tools offer myriad applications, including the construction of metaverse content.
In fact, Unity's products are already being adopted across a number of industries, from film and television to architecture and transportation. In 2021, the company's non-gaming business increased by more than 70% year over year. Some of Unity's non-gaming clients include Hyundai and eBay.
Unity's revenue growth will be further helped by the video game industry's expanding global sales. Forecasts estimate an annual growth rate of 8.2%, enabling the industry to reach $239.7 billion by 2026.
With gaming's multi-year sales expansion serving as a tailwind combined with Unity's successful business model and foray into new industries, the company is well positioned to continue its track record of growth in the years ahead. These factors make Unity a worthwhile stock to buy.
