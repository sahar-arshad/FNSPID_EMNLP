2022-04-06 00:00:00+00:00,4 Retail Discount Stocks Worth a Look Despite Industry Woes,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-retail-discount-stocks-worth-a-look-despite-industry-woes,,,"Product cost inflation, tight labor market and supply-chain bottlenecks are some of the headwinds that players in the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry have been encountering of late. Also, the lack of stimulus checks this year could result in a drop in demand.

That said, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investment to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corporation COST, Target Corporation TGT, Dollar General Corporation DG and Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR.
About the Industry
The Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, arts and crafts supplies, toys, and seasonal décor products. These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both. Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.
3 Key Retail-Discount Stores Industry Trends
Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled a number of players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, any deleverage in SG&A rate, higher labor and occupancy costs, and increased marketing and other store-related expenses might build pressure on margins. Meanwhile, the impact of additional employee payments and benefits along with investments undertaken to preserve the safety and health of customers and team members amid the coronavirus crisis cannot be ruled out. For now, the industry is dealing with supply-chain bottlenecks, rising freight charges and labor shortages.
Consumers Seek Better Bargains Amid Inflation: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices. Under the current circumstances, people in the low-to-middle income groups have been showing a preference for discount stores to get quality products at reasonable prices. Industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Clearly, companies are leaving no stone unturned to tap any surge in demand unless derailed by elevated inflation and looming COVID-19 impacts. We also believe that failure to restock inventory at fair prices or delay getting the products delivered to consumers’ doorsteps could compound retailers’ woes.
Digitization is Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Apart from upgrading digitally, companies are coming up with unique products and better deals. Initiatives such as building omni-channel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.
Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak Prospects
The Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #174, which places it in the bottom 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of January 2022, the industry’s earnings estimate has declined 0.3%.

Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.

2022-04-04 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Too Late to Buy Realty Income?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-too-late-to-buy-realty-income,,,"After a slump caused by the shutdowns and stay-ins of the coronavirus pandemic, the retail sector is coming back. As it does, bellwether retail real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income (NYSE: O) is riding alongside it. The company's stock has generally appreciated over the past year or so, to the point where it's only a few dollars short of its five-year high.
That's a very lofty perch. Despite its many advantages as a company, Realty Income's stock is not cheap. Let's take a closer look at the state of the company to see if it's still worth buying at this relatively pricey level.
The reality of Realty
As clever businesses do, Realty Income took advantage of a down period to do some shopping. It struck a deal to acquire retail REIT peer Vereit in the coronavirus-plagued month of April 2021, in a transaction with an enterprise value of roughly $50 billion. The deal closed last November.
Image source: Getty Images.
At a stroke, it made the already sizable Realty Income a titanic retail REIT. Vereit's properties in its portfolio gave it a total of over 11,000 pieces of real estate, located in every U.S. state and abroad in Spain and the U.K.
Realty Income's client list includes some of the top names in chain stores, and it's quite diverse in terms of retail segments.
For example The Dollar General and Dollar Tree/Family Dollar discount store tag team is one of the major clients, with a combined (and dizzying) 2,288 leases with the REIT as of Dec. 31, 2021. CVS, with 183 leases, is also a frequent flyer, as is AMC Entertainment with 35 cinemas in Realty Income facilities. Ditto for FedEx and its 80 leases.
One notable element of all these businesses is their resistance to the retail apocalypse -- the dreaded, and somewhat mythological, end of brick-and-mortar shopping due to the rise of e-commerce. While there is some justification for this fear, Realty Income's portfolio is nicely defensive in that respect.
Yes, some aspects of these businesses can be transacted online -- we can always watch movies streamed at home, for instance. But these companies offer either experiences that are substantially different and better when done in person (like movie watching or dining out) or are more convenient/attractive (picking up a prescription as soon as you need it from a CVS).
So with that absorption of Vereit behind it and a nice retail recovery tailwind at its back, Realty Income has done extremely well lately. Across the entirety of 2021 revenue shot 26% higher on a year-over-year basis. Meanwhile, advancing at a similar rate was the company's adjusted funds from operations (AFFO, a standard profitability metric for REITs, in this case tweaked to exclude one-offs and the costs of the Vereit deal).
Doling out a dependable dividend
That substantial improvement in the fundamentals gives Realty Income plenty of room to do one of the things it really enjoys -- raising its dividend. The company's unusual policy of handing out a distribution every month (as opposed to the standard quarterly) provides the scope to adjust the dividend policy quickly if need be.
Since mid-2021, when we all became hopeful the worst of the coronavirus pandemic was behind us, Realty Income has declared four bumps to the dividend. Now these aren't exactly monster raises -- the biggest one was a princely $0.01, to just under $0.25 per share -- but they've really added up over time. If we zoom out and look at the last ten years, Realty Income's payout has risen by nearly 70%.
In recent months, it's likely the stock price appreciation was a factor in the series of bumps, as the company benefits from keeping its dividend yield competitive with peers. The result is that, while its yield isn't a standout, it's substantial enough and broadly in line with the equity REIT sector as a whole, at 4.2%.
A fine play on retail's future
I feel the retail sector's recovery still has a good runway, since there are some consumers who are still hesitant to go out while the coronavirus remains somewhat of a threat. The global economy continues to motor along, meaning that many of those folks have dosh to spend whenever they start popping around to stores again.
And if the retail sector as a whole benefits, you can be darn sure Realty Income will be one of its top beneficiaries. I don't worry at all about the future of this company, and I think it's a solid operator and a solid stock to own.

Seasoned investors regularly research strong mutual funds to buy. In terms of total assets, mutual funds remain the most popular investment tool stateside, especially in retirement saving accounts, such as 401(k) plans.
Total net assets in mutual funds were about $23.9 trillion in 2020. Equity funds typically account for well over half of that value. Moreover, recent research forecasts that total assets in mutual funds could reach $26.8 trillion in 2025.
Mutual funds are inherently diversified, investing in a portfolio of stocks and bonds, as well as hybrid assets. Meanwhile, mutual funds are used by a broad spectrum of investors. They include long-term investors, active-management seekers, or systematic investors saving for later years.
In fact, mutual funds are widely regarded as the keystone of buy-and-hold and retirement investment strategies. We should note that it is wiser to think in terms of years or even decades when investing in mutual funds.
7 Stocks Hit Hardest by Supply Chain Issues
With that information, here are three mutual funds to buy that could gain traction in the coming months:
FDVLX Fidelity Value Fund $14.78
PRDGX T Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund $70.32
VEIPX Vanguard Equity-Income Fund Investor Shares $44.25
Mutual Funds to Buy: Fidelity Value Fund (FDVLX)

52-week range: $13.73 – $16.29
Dividend Yield: .75%
Expense ratio: 0.79% per year
Our first mutual fund is the Fidelity Value Fund (NASDAQ:FDVLX). It offers exposure to stocks considered undervalued in terms of assets, earnings, or growth potential. This mutual fund skews toward smaller-capitalization (cap) stocks instead of chasing more high-profile names that are typically efficiently priced.
FDVLX, which started trading in December 1978, currently has 246 holdings. With regards to sectors, we see industrials at 20.86%, followed by consumer discretionary at 12.95%, financials at 12.30%, and materials at 10.57%, among others.
Meanwhile, the top 10 holdings account for almost 10% of net assets of around $9.6 billion. Among the leading holdings on the roster are the data analytics company Nielsen Holdings (NYSE:NLSN); building products supplier Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR); discount variety stores operator Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR); natural gas exploration and production company Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES); and energy services provider Edison International (NYSE:EIX).
FDVLX is up 4% over the past 12 months and almost 1% since the start of the year. I like the diversity of the focus. Readers who want to buy smaller businesses that offer value could consider a mutual fund like FDVLX.
T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund (PRDGX)

52-week range: $62.84 – $74.24
Dividend yield: 0.89%
Expense ratio: 0.63% per year
Next up on our list of mutual funds to buy is the T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund (NASDAQ:PRDGX). It invests in high-quality, large companies with strong track records of paying dividends. Many of these businesses also increase their dividends over time. The fund started trading in December 1992.
PRDGX has 98 holdings, where the leading 10 comprise more than a quarter of $20.9 billion in net assets. Information technology shares have the highest slice with 21%. Next is health care with 16.79%, financials at 14.27%, industrials and business services at 12.74%, and consumer staples at 7.4%.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT); Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL); diversified healthcare insurer UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH); Danaher (NYSE:DHR), which provides medical and industrial products and services; and payments giant Visa (NYSE:V) are among the leading shares in the portfolio.

52-week range: $41.39 – $46.21

Our final fund, the Vanguard Equity-Income Fund Investor Shares (NASDAQ:VEIPX), could appeal to long-term investors seeking current income. This mutual fund invests in high-yield dividend stocks with solid balance sheets and stable earnings growth. It also focuses on businesses that can sustain and increase their payouts.
VEIPX, which started trading in March 1988, has 188 holdings. In terms of sectors, financials have the top spot at 21%, followed by health care with 16%, consumer staples with 14.20%, and industrials with 10%, among others.

2022-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks to Buy During a Recession,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-buy-during-a-recession-1,,,"With some degree of confidence, we can tell what the weather will be today, tomorrow, and even later in the week. But a recession? Projecting when the economy will suffer contraction is a little more challenging. Fortunately for investors, it's not necessary to their success that they predict when a recession comes. Instead, they need to remember Hamlet's wisdom: The readiness is all.
One preparation investors can make for an economic downturn is to fortify their portfolios with resilient stocks that are likely to succeed -- stocks like Advance Auto Parts (NYSE: AAP), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR), and Royal Gold (NASDAQ: RGLD).
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Advance Auto Parts
When the economy turns south and a recession emerges, consumers will often change their habits. For some, that means brewing coffee themselves instead of visiting the neighborhood cafe, while others may pinch their purse strings and put a large home purchase on the back-burner. Similarly, many drivers will start taking auto repairs into their own hands, eschewing trips to the local mechanic. Consequently, Advance Auto Parts, a business with more than 4,700 stores throughout the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico that provides aftermarket parts to customers, is a worthy consideration.
Don't think Advance Auto Parts can rev up the engines of investors who are looking to buttress their portfolios? Consider the stock's performance during the Great Recession. Throughout this period, December 2007 to June 2009, the S&P 500 sank 38%, while shares of Advance Auto Parts rose 15.4%.
Illustrating how motivated car owners can be to perform their own repairs, revenue rose steadily during the period of the Great Recession; similarly, Advance Auto Parts also reported comparable earnings-per-share growth.

2. Dollar Tree
Another effective way consumers will try to stretch their budgets during a recession is by shopping at discount stores. And when it comes to leading discount stores, Dollar Tree is one of the most recognizable names. Operating more than 15,500 stores in 48 states and five Canadian provinces, Dollar Tree also runs stores under the Family Dollar and Dollar Tree Canada brands. The company plans on expanding its footprint in 2022. In addition to opening 190 Dollar Tree stores and 400 Family Dollar stores, it expects to renovate 800 Family Dollar stores.
Along with opening more locations, Dollar Tree seeks to drive sales growth through an initiative to revise its pricing strategy with the introduction of a $1.25 price point to the majority of Dollar Tree's products. The company implemented it in all Dollar Tree stores in the U.S. two months ahead of schedule. On Dollar Tree's fourth-quarter 2021 earnings conference call, CEO Mike Witynski articulated three benefits to the $1.25 price point, stating that it ""enhances our ability to materially expand our assortments, introduce new products and sizes and provide families with more of their daily essentials at a great value.""
3. Royal Gold
Lastly, those wary of a recession's onset may want to forego retail stocks and consider a more traditional approach: gold. Long heralded as a safe harbor investment, gold, in the eyes of many conservative investors, represents a solid way to hedge against a weaker dollar.
Instead of rushing to purchase the yellow metal in bullion form, gold bugs would be better served to consider a royalty and streaming company like Royal Gold. Unlike gold mining companies that dig the yellow stuff out of the ground, royalty and streaming companies provide upfront capital to miners, receiving a portion of the mined minerals or the ability to purchase the minerals at a preset price -- often at a discount to the market price. This affords them plenty of reward, but with a lesser degree of risk since they don't incur the risks inherent with operating and developing the mining operations.
Royal Gold has interests in a variety of minerals, but it's gold that represents the company's bread and butter. In 2021, for example, gold accounted for 74% of its revenue. Think Royal Gold's stock is no more advantageous than buying gold coins and bars? Think again.
Over the past 10 years, the price of gold has risen nearly 20%, while Royal Gold's stock has climbed more than twice that.

The recession-ready takeaway
Of course, there's no single solution to girding your portfolio against a recession; ask a bunch of investors what their approaches are and you'll likely hear a bunch of different responses. Advance Auto Parts, Dollar Tree, and Royal Gold all offer compelling approaches to strengthening a portfolio. Currently, however, I'm particular to shares of Advance Auto Parts since they're on the discount rack. Trading at 12.5 times operating cash flow, Advance Auto Parts' stock is changing hands at a discount to its five-year average cash flow multiple of 13.9.

After pandemic-related challenges shook the real estate industry, both companies have made a huge comeback, outperforming the S&P 500 over the past year.

Federal Realty Trust
Federal Realty Trust is one of the oldest publicly traded REITs. Established in 1962, it has a long track record of adding value for its shareholders by increasing dividends for 54 consecutive years. Its primary investment niche is retail, but really, Federal Realty Trust is morphing into a diversified REIT thanks to the growing number of mixed-use properties in its portfolio. In addition to retail, office, and hotel space, the company owns and leases about 3,400 residential units with 22% of its annual base rents coming from residential and office space combined.
The company is hyper focused on its asset locations, owning mixed-use centers and open-air shopping centers in top-tier suburban markets in nine of the most populous metro areas: Silicon Valley; Southern California; Phoenix; Miami; Washington, D.C.; Philadelphia; New York; Boston; and Chicago. While its performance isn't quite up to pre-pandemic levels, the company is seeing positive and notable improvement year over year.
In 2021, funds from operation (FFO), an important metric used for assessing the profitability of a REIT, rose 27% and net operating income (NOI) grew by 101%. The company leased 2.2 million square feet of leasing space for roughly $2.48 more per square foot than the year prior and occupancy is at 91.1% for its entire portfolio.
Residential housing is experiencing record demand, which is certainly helping the company recover at a much faster rate than some of its competitors. Currently, it has six redevelopment projects underway and several future projects to be completed in 2022 and beyond, two of which include residential elements.
Realty Income
Realty Income also ranks as one of the oldest REITs, established in 1969, and going public in 1994. Like Federal Realty Trust, the company is first and foremost a retail REIT, but recent acquisitions are turning it into more of a diversified REIT focused on sale-leaseback agreements and long-term net lease commercial real estate. Instead of paying quarterly dividends like Federal Realty Trust, Realty Income pays monthly dividends, with a track record of 114 dividend increases since its IPO.
In 2021, the company spent $6.1 billion to nearly double the number of properties in its portfolio, adding things like industrial real estate to its retail portfolio, which serves 60 diverse industries within the retail sector. Today it has 11,136 properties across 50 states, Puerto Rico, the U.K., and Spain for a total of 210 million leasable square feet. For comparison, Federal Realty Trust has 104 properties with 25 million square feet.
The company is continuing to expand through acquisitions and it recently announced the sale-leaseback purchase of the Encore Boston Harbor Casino and Resort for $1.7 billion, which has an existing long-term net lease with Wynn Resorts. The deal is expected to close at the end of 2022. While it would be a huge pivot for the company, furthering its standing as a diversified REIT, it could enhance its portfolio's performance in the long term.
Walgreens, Dollar General, 7-Eleven, FedEx, Dollar Tree, and Family Dollar are Realty Income's top five tenants by annual base rent (ABR), but its massive portfolio is leased to many Fortune 500 companies. Portfolio occupancy is incredibly strong at 98.5% with 99.5% of its total portfolio rents being collected at year-end. Clearly, the company has not just rebounded but exceeded pre-pandemic levels, with revenue, FFO, and net operating income up across the board.

Which is the better buy?
While long-term demand for in-store shopping is waning thanks to the rise of e-commerce -- retail is far from dead. Both companies are finding ways to pivot and adapt their existing retail portfolios to meet the changing demand while diversifying income to achieve growth. It really comes down to which pivot you think will lead to the greatest payoff. Both REITS clearly are long-term winners and strong buys at today's discounted prices.
FRT Total Return Level data by YCharts.
Realty Income has provided the greater return for investors over the past 10 years and offers a slightly higher dividend yield for investors today, but it is valued slightly higher than Federal Realty Trust. And investors should always remember that past results don't always guarantee future results. Being so large could make growth in the future challenging for Realty Income. Federal Realty Trust certainly has more room to grow, but Realty Income's current portfolio performance and diversification make it the winner in my book.

2022-03-28 00:00:00+00:00,This High-Yield REIT Could Be One to Hold Forever,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-high-yield-reit-could-be-one-to-hold-forever,,,"Dividend investors love investing in real estate investment trusts (REIT) because they typically offer high yields. But there are different kinds of REITs, such as mortgage REITs and retail REITs, and they're not all equally reliable.
Realty Income (NYSE: O) is a retail REIT that easily weathered the early stages of the pandemic when other retail REITs were dealing with rent defaults. It's also doing great compared with mortgage REITs, which are dealing with fluctuating interest rates. The stock yields 4.4% at the current price of about $68, and you might want to consider adding shares of this forever stock to your portfolio.

A strong portfolio of properties
REITs are great dividend stocks because they have to pay out 90% of their earnings as dividends. Their stocks aren't high gainers, and investors buy them for the passive income. REITs own properties, and Realty operates on a triple net lease model, which means the tenant is responsible for most of property expenses. This is beneficial for the owner, who doesn't need to get involved in the details of the operation, and beneficial for the tenant, who has greater flexibility and a more competitive rental price.
Realty works with a varied group of large, established brands, many of which were open throughout the pandemic as essentials retailers. Its top four tenants are Walgreens, Dollar General, 7-Eleven, and Dollar Tree. Its portfolio is 77% composed of what it calls ""Non-discretionary, Low Price Point and/or Service-oriented Retail."" This gives it an edge, both in the reliability of its tenants to pay the rent and in its likelihood to remain in a strong position regardless of the economic environment.
It recently completed a merger with fellow REIT, VEREIT, adding more than 3,000 properties to its portfolio, for a total of more than 11,000, and putting it in a very dominant position. This makes it the sixth-largest global REIT. It has more than 1,000 tenants in 60 industries with a 98.8% occupancy rate. It's now working with casino company Wynn Resorts in a sale-leaseback arrangement for growth opportunities in what it calls ""prudent diversification."" It sees an addressable market of $12 trillion in the U.S. and Europe, of which net lease peers account for less than 1% of the market in the U.S. and 4% of the market in Europe.
Revenue increased 27% year over year in 2021 to more than $2 billion, and normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share, which is a metric used by REITs that's similar to earnings per share (adjusted for the VEREIT merger) increased from $0.83 in 2020 to $0.89 in 2021.
A reliable and growing dividend
Realty Income's dividend doesn't offer the highest yield of the REITs. But anything above 4% is very competitive, and its dividend, as well as its business, is as stable as they come. The company issues a monthly dividend, which is also attractive for passive-income seekers, especially retirees. It has issued 620 consecutive dividends and has raised the dividend for 98 consecutive quarters.
The stock trades at 77 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is pricey compared to other REITs. That probably because investors are willing to pay a premium for a dividend stock that's as reliable as Realty Income. The stock price has increased 9% over the past year. Including dividends, it has returned a 15.5% average annual total return since its initial public offering in 1994.
When the market is volatile, and now would certainly qualify, investors often move their funds into rock-solid dividend stocks such as Realty Income. It's a great stock to buy, set, and forget for any time, providing a stable passive income stream.

2022-03-28 00:00:00+00:00,Five Below (FIVE) to Post Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/five-below-five-to-post-q4-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-cards,,,"Five Below, Inc. FIVE is likely to register an increase in the top and the bottom line when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 results on Mar 30. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1,012 million, suggesting an improvement of 17.1% from the prior fiscal year’s quarterly reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share in the fiscal fourth quarter has been stable over the past 30 days at $2.48. The figure indicates an increase of 12.7% from the prior fiscal year’s quarterly tally.

For fiscal 2021, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.86 billion, suggesting an improvement of 45.6% from the prior fiscal year’s quarterly reported figure. The consensus mark for the full-fiscal earnings stands at $4.95 per share, implying an increase from $2.12 earned last fiscal year.

The bottom line of this extreme-value retailer for tweens, teens and beyond surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 48.3% in the last reported quarter. Five Below has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 22.4%, on average.
Factors to Note
Five Below has been benefiting for a while from its focus on providing trend-right products, strengthening digital capabilities and delivering better WOW products. FIVE’s favorable pricing strategy, and commitment to improvise merchandise assortment and achieve an efficient cost structure have been commendable so far. Management constantly digitizes vendor transactions, implements the core merchandizing platform and applies cloud-based data and analytics to analyze demand and accordingly, manage inventory.

All the aforesaid factors are most likely to have contributed to the results for the fiscal fourth quarter. On Jan 10, 2022, Five Below reported sturdy holiday sales results despite a challenging supply-chain backdrop. FIVE efficiently managed the product flow and remained proactive in meeting consumer demand. Net sales for the holiday period — from Oct 31, 2021 through Jan 1, 2022 — surged 20.6% to $870.9 million from $722.3 million reported in the comparable nine-week period from Nov 1, 2020 through Jan 2, 2021. Comparable sales for the holiday shopping season rose 7.7%.

Five Below had projected net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter in the range of $985-$1,005 million, hinting at growth from $858.5 million reported in the last fiscal year’s comparable quarter. FIVE had expected a 2-4% increase in comparable sales. Management had forecast earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter between $2.36 and $2.48 per share, indicating growth from $2.20 recorded in the prior fiscal year’s corresponding period. Management had projected fiscal 2021 net sales in the band of $2,837-$2,857 million, implying an increase of 45.6% from the last fiscal year’s reading. FIVE had anticipated a 30% jump in comparable sales. Management had forecast earnings between $4.82 and $4.94 per share, including benefit from share-based accounting of approximately 8 cents.

Clearly, the aforementioned factors raise optimism about the results. However, margins remain an area to watch out. Five Below had earlier anticipated its gross margin to delever slightly from the prior fiscal year’s quarterly level as some of the costs associated with the handling of delayed inventory receipts shifted from the third quarter to the fourth. Also, FIVE has been witnessing higher SG&A expenses for a while now.

2022-03-25 00:00:00+00:00,7 Retail Stocks Worth a Buy Now,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-retail-stocks-worth-a-buy-now,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
At a time of high inflation, you may be wondering why I’m talking about retail stocks. After all, isn’t inflation bad news for the sector? In general, yes. It’s bad in two ways.
First, inflationary pressures in turn put pressure on profit margins for retailers. Not all rising costs can be passed on to the consumer. Second, the rising cost of energy, food, housing and other mandatory expenses is a negative for consumer spending.
Putting the two together, it seems counter-intuitive to run out and buy shares in retailers right now. Or is it? Many names in the sector are well-equipped to handle today’s challenges.
6 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Survive Any Bubble Burst
Better yet, due to the high uncertainty looming over the stock market, for the most part they’ve been held down in recent months. In short, it’s not too late to add these seven retail stocks to your portfolio:
AutoNation (NYSE:AN)
BJ’s Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ)
Costco (NASDAQ:COST)
Dillard’s Inc (NYSE:DDS)
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR)
Kroger (NYSE:KR)
O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY)
Retail Stocks: AutoNation (AN)
Source: RYO Alexandre / Shutterstock.com
Based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, AutoNation is America’s largest automotive retailer. With over 300 locations from coast-to-coast, the company’s dealerships sell new and used vehicles across many makes and models.
AN stock has been on a tear since 2020. With the automobile shortage driving up new and used car prices, it’s no surprise why. During 2021, operating income was nearly double what it was in the prior year and around 128% above what it was in 2019.
Trading for just four times this year’s projected earnings, the market is pre-emptively pricing-in a reversal of current trends. Yes, the run-up in used car prices may have already peaked.
But as supply chain disruptions continue, limiting the production of new cars, investors may be overestimating how quickly things will normalize. With upside in the near-term (as it remains a “dealer’s market” for automotive sales) and in the long-term (as the company puts its profits to work buying back shares and expanding the business), AN stock is a buy.
This stock has an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.
BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ)

BJ’s may be a small fry compared to rival Costco. Yet I wouldn’t hold its relatively small size against it.
Even as it has just a fraction of the membership base, revenue and earnings of its better-known discount club peer, the company has similar profit margins. It’s also benefiting from the same tailwinds, resulting in solid operating performance both during the pandemic and during the pandemic recovery.
As soaring consumer prices drive households to buy in bulk, inflation at levels not seen since the early 1980s is more a boon than a challenge for this wholesale club operator.  Well-positioned to pass on rising costs to its members (as its prices beat that of general merchandisers and supermarkets), expect it to continue steadily growing its revenue and earnings.
7 Healthcare Stocks to Buy for the Long Term
Best of all? BJ stock is reasonably-priced, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.
This stock has an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Retail Stocks: Costco (COST)

Earlier this month, enthusiasm for COST stock, one of the top-performing retail stocks of the past decade, cooled off temporarily. Despite beating estimates, the market wasn’t impressed with its most recent quarterly earnings report due to a slowdown in growth with its e-commerce segment.
However, this pullback didn’t last long. Costco shares today trade for above where they were ahead of earnings. As it’s still yet to get back to its high-water mark (hit late last year), now’s the perfect time to accumulate a position in this discount club leader.
Again, like with its smaller competitor BJ’s, inflation works more in Costco’s favor than out of it. Rising prices means more households will buy memberships (the price of which goes up with inflation) and make more shopping trips to the company’s 829 (and counting) warehouses.
Performing well in good times and bad times, the party is far from over here. COST stock is on its way back to its all-time high, then on to new highs, in the years ahead.
This stock has an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Dillard’s Inc (DDS)

Breaking out in price over the past eighteen months, you may think it’s too late to buy DDS stock. But while shares in this retailer, with operations primarily in the Southern and Southwestern United States, is up nearly 10x since late 2020, that doesn’t mean it’s set to head lower from here.
Trading at a low multiple to last year’s earnings, many are expecting the company to report less impressive results in the coming year. Supply chain disruptions did play a big role in its operating performance during 2021.
For the year, the company earned $862.5 million on $6.62 billion in sales, versus reporting $71.7 million in net losses on $4.43 billion in sales during 2020. Still, as the market may be assuming the environment will normalize much sooner than it actually will, I wouldn’t discount the chance this retailer again delivers results ahead of expectations.
7 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now if You Have $100 to Spend
Add in its plans to buy back $500 million worth of shares (representing around 9% of its market capitalization), and there’s still plenty in play to give DDS stock additional runway.
This stock has an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Retail Stocks: Dollar Tree (DLTR)
Source: shutterstock.com/Jonathan Weiss
Most of the retail stocks discussed above have held steady through the market downturn so far in 2022. Yet by comparison, DLTR stock has been on a tear. Up 11% year-to-date, investors are piling in, as high inflation drives households to seek lower-cost substitutes for life’s necessities.
That’s exactly what Dollar Tree offers through its more than 8,000 stores (under the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands) in the U.S. and Canada. A purveyor of food and other everyday consumables plus other popular everyday household items, the company is helping consumers deal with the shrinking purchasing power of the dollar.
That’s all while improving its margins, through efforts like raising prices at its Dollar Tree locations (from $1 to $1.25 per item). Expected to earn around $7.95 per share this fiscal year (versus $5.68 per share last fiscal year), shares have already moved higher ahead of stronger results.
Even so, that doesn’t mean the factors on its side are already priced-in. Reasonably priced (at 20 times earnings) relative to its prospects, DLTR stock is another retailer to add to your shopping list.
This stock has an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Kroger (KR)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
A few months back, investors were concerned that supermarket operator Kroger would struggle keeping ahead of inflation. Since then, however, sentiment has reversed in a big way.
Why? Following its latest earnings report, it’s clear that inflationary pressures are a big threat to its gross margins. In response to strong results and guidance, investors have dived back into KR stock. As a result, it has spiked more than 27% in the past month.
If you already own this, you may see its latest run-up as a reason to take the money and run. If you don’t own it yet, you may see it as a reason to stay away. However, if you choose to do so, this could prove to be a short-sighted move.
7 Recession-Proof Stocks for Nervous Investors to Buy in 2022
Between the strong chance it continues to deliver strong results, plus possible upside if more investors cycle into it as a “safe harbor” defensive play, don’t assume KR stock’s move to prices above $50 per share will be a short-lived one.
This stock has an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.
Retail Stocks: O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
The vehicle shortage isn’t just a boon for automotive retailers like AutoNation. It’s a boon for auto parts retailers like O’Reilly Automotive as well.
As the price of purchasing a new or used vehicle remains sky-high, U.S. households will continue holding onto their vehicles much longer than seen in previous generations. In 2021, the average age of a car on the road was 12.1 years.
This number will likely continue to rise as more vehicle last more than 200,000 miles and repairing an aging car, truck, or SUV becomes even more economical than replacing one. In turn, this points to continued strong revenue and earnings growth for this company and its more than 5,750 stores in the U.S. and Mexico.
Trading for around 21 times expected 2022 earnings, this is yet another retail stock where valuation hasn’t gotten ahead of itself. With strong performance likely leading it to higher prices, ORLY stock is a worthwhile buy today.
This stock has an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.

2022-03-25 00:00:00+00:00,Are You a Growth Investor? This 1 Stock Could Be the Perfect Pick,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-you-a-growth-investor-this-1-stock-could-be-the-perfect-pick-19,,,"Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors, and Zacks Premium offers many different ways to do both.
The popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.
It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.
What are the Zacks Style Scores?
The Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.
Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:
Value Score
For value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.
Growth Score
While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.
Momentum Score
Momentum investors, who live by the saying ""the trend is your friend,"" are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.
VGM Score
If you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank
A proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.
#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.
With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.
That's where the Style Scores come in.
You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.
Since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.
Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.
Stock to Watch: Dollar Tree (DLTR)
Founded in 1986 and headquartered in Chesapeake, VA, Dollar Tree Inc. is an operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise and other assortments. Its stores successfully operate in major metropolitan areas, mid-sized cities and small towns. The company offers a wide range of quality everyday general merchandise in many categories, including housewares, seasonal goods, candy and food, toys, health and beauty care, gifts, party goods, stationery, books, personal accessories, and other consumer items. Its stores are supported by a nationwide logistics network and distribution centers.
DLTR is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.
Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. DLTR has a Growth Style Score of B, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 35.2% for the current fiscal year.
Eight analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2023, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.54 to $7.84 per share. DLTR also boasts an average earnings surprise of 11.8%.
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, DLTR should be on investors' short list.

2022-03-23 00:00:00+00:00,Chewy (CHWY) Lined Up for Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chewy-chwy-lined-up-for-q4-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-cards,,,"Chewy, Inc. CHWY is expected to report top-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 results on Mar 29, after the market closes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly sales stands at $2,431 million, indicating an increase of 18.7% from the last fiscal-year quarter’s reported figure.

However, Chewy’s bottom line is expected to decline from the last fiscal-year quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for loss in the fiscal fourth quarter has been stable over the past 30 days at 7 cents a share. However, CHWY reported earnings of 11 cents a share in the earlier fiscal year’s quarter.

For fiscal 2021, the consensus estimate for sales is pinned at $8.93 billion, implying an increase of about 25% from the last fiscal year’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same fiscal year’s loss stands at 8 cents a share. However, Chewy delivered earnings of 9 cents in fiscal 2020.

This pet food and other pet-related supplier delivered an earnings surprise of 253.1%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, Chewy recorded an earnings surprise of 40%.
Key Factors to Note
Chewy’s sales performance for the fiscal fourth quarter is most likely to have been benefited by its e-commerce channels, product assortments and innovative services. To drive online sales, management has been making technology upgrades for its website and online platforms for sometime now. Higher product demand, robust consumer engagement and growth in the active customers are steadily contributing to results. Boosting customer base and enhancing their wallet share are key components of CHWY’s growth strategy. Additionally, CHWY’s pharmacy business bodes well.

On Chewy’s lastearnings call management had projected net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter to be $2.40-$2.44 billion, indicating growth of 17-19% from the prior fiscal-year quarter’s tally. For fiscal 2021, net sales are likely to fall in the band of $8.90-$8.94 billion, suggesting an increase of 25% from the last fiscal year’s level.

On the flip side, the global supply-chain disruptions, elevated inbound freight costs and product cost inflation remain major deterrents. These factors have been weighing on Chewy’s gross margin for a while now. Inflationary pressures, product shortages and labor constraints are hurting CHWY’s performance. In addition, higher operating expenses, including SG&A and significant labor cost pressures, are concerns. All these headwinds might have dampened the bottom-line performance in the quarter under review.
What the Zacks Model Unveils
Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Chewy this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here as explained below. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings per share of $1.95 suggests a rise of 21.9% from the last fiscal-year quarter’s reported figure.

DRI is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Mar 24, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 3.5%.
Q3 Estimates
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.11 per share, indicating a whopping growth of 115.3% year over year. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $2.54 billion, suggesting an increase of 46.3% from the year-ago quarter.
Factors to Note
Darden’s fiscal third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from improvement in same-restaurant sales across its brands, business model enhancements and menu simplifications. The company has been gaining from technological enhancements with reference to online ordering, the introduction of To Go capacity management and Curbside I'm Here notification. Robust off-premise sales might have contributed to the to-be-reported quarter performance.

The company’s fiscal third-quarter results are likely to reflect the robust performance of Olive Garden, Fine Dining, and LongHorn Steakhouse. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at Olive Garden, Fine Dining, and LongHorn Steakhouse is pegged at $1,216 million, $197 million and $598 million, suggesting year-over-year growth of 39.4%, 89.4% and 31.7%, respectively. In addition, the same for Other business stands at $499 million, indicating an increase of 65.2% from the prior-year quarter.

Despite solid cost management, higher labor costs due to increased wages may have weighed on profits in the quarter to be reported. The company is also apprehensive that inflationary costs might persist for the remainder of the year.

10 stocks we like better than Realty Income
When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*
They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of March 3, 2022
Matt Frankel: They are a net lease REIT. What that means is they buy primarily freestanding properties that are leased to tenants using so-called net lease agreements. A net lease means that the tenant generally signs a long-term lease, say 10-15 years for the initial term. Annual rent increases built-in, these are called escalators, and the tenants agree to pay most of the variable costs of property ownership, specifically property taxes, building insurance, and most maintenance expenses.
In other words, a net lease landlord has to get a tenant in place and they know what their income is going to be for the next 10 or 15 years. It's a really steady income business model, and there's a lot of upside potential because it's backed by these underlying real estate assets that tend to increase in value over time as well.
Real estate companies use a little bit of leverage, not a ton. It's similar to buying a house with a mortgage is the concept behind it. Then they issue equity and things like that that grow over time. Realty Income started in 1969 with one Taco Bell [a part of Yum! Brands (NYSE: YUM)]. They owned a Taco Bell building that Taco Bell operated in. Since that time they have built their portfolio. Look at some of these numbers and I'll go through each real quick.
Over 11,000 properties under long-term lease agreements in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom, and Spain. They're in 60 different industries, primarily different forms of retail. But I'll get to that in a second why I think that's still safe. Look on the left side of your screen. Remember, this stock's historical beta was about 0.5 meaning it was about half as volatile as the S&P 500.
Since it listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994, it's generated an average annualized return of more than 15%. They have paid 619 consecutive monthly dividends, dating back to their early days in the late 60s, early 70s. Since listing, they've increased that dividend for 97 consecutive quarters. This company is built to produce steady income like clockwork.
I just want to hit on a few points of why I think this is safe, and why I think it's a great risk-reward ratio. For one, it's generated positive earnings growth 25 out of 26 years it's been a publicly traded company. I want to say it was 2008 was the only year it didn't. It has a great top-notch credit rating, it's really rare for a REIT to have grade A credit. Its beta is very low. It's one of the largest REITs, and 94% of its rent comes from resilient types of properties.
Think of discount stores, Costco (NASDAQ: COST) is a big tenant of theirs. Things like the major dollar stores are big tenants of theirs. Non-discretionary retail, things that people need, not that they want, CVS (NYSE: CVS) and Walgreens [a part of Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA)] are both big tenants of theirs, and service-based retail big restaurants. I mentioned Taco Bell was their first tenant. Things that don't depend on E-commerce specifically, and things that are not prone to recessions.
During a recession, CVS and Walgreens are going to be just fine. Dollar stores are going to do even better than they do now during recessions. It's not a typical retail stock. This is the first stock I ever bought when I became a serious investor. I've never sold a single share and I have added many times. I've called this the best overall dividend stock in the market, and I could make a solid case for this to be my No. 1. Guys, any thoughts on Realty Income?
Jason Hall: Yeah. I just think this hits home. You were talking about their tenant list. I think this is a big reason why the credit agency is rated so highly is because its counter-parties on its properties are bulletproof. Walgreens is its largest tenant, 4.1% of its net operating income. Then you got Dollar General (NYSE: DG), 7-Eleven [a part of Seven & I Holdings (OTC: SVNDY)], Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR), and Family Dollar, those are about as recession-resistant as they get. I think its biggest recession by consumer discretionary business is LA Fitness, and that's 2.5%. It's just a rock steady, wonderful business. It really is.
Tyler Crowe: I'm sorry, I'm coming way out of left field on this one [laughs] because everything you guys said is great, and one thing, I think we've been talking about this a little bit with some of the services we work on with Winners, Trailblazers and things like that is we're seeing a lot of places in the real estate market where repositioning and multi-use development is becoming a huge thing.
A lot of the property types that are in Realty Income's portfolio are the kind of ones that would be right for those multi-use redevelopments. There's a similar grocery store-anchored retail REIT, Kimco Realty (NYSE: KIM), that's pushing really hard into the multi-use tenant. I'm curious to see if a big player like Realty Income would be willing to make that splash. They're so good at what they do, they don't have to.
Hall: Yeah.
Crowe: But I feel like the potential of returns and growth on an existing portfolio could go incredible with that kind of deployment.
Frankel: They're really showing their willingness to branch out right now. You mentioned they're really, really good at what they do and there's no denying that.
Crowe: It's mainly the single tenant is their core. That's what they do overall.
Frankel: They focus on single tenant, that's their big differentiator. They have some industrial and office portfolios. What was really interesting about their office properties before they spun them off, they only owned single-tenant office buildings, which is a rarity in the space. The reason being that net lease model doesn't work as well in, say, a mall where you have a bunch of different tenants. You have to split up the property taxes, you have to split up the insurance costs, things like that.

2022-03-18 00:00:00+00:00,Dollar Tree Reaches Analyst Target Price,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-reaches-analyst-target-price,,,"In recent trading, shares of Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $153.76, changing hands for $155.13/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 17 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Dollar Tree Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $115.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $200.00. The standard deviation is $27.323.
But the whole reason to look at the average DLTR price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with DLTR crossing above that average target price of $153.76/share, investors in DLTR have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $153.76 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Dollar Tree Inc:

2022-03-18 00:00:00+00:00,Are You a Momentum Investor? This 1 Stock Could Be the Perfect Pick,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-you-a-momentum-investor-this-1-stock-could-be-the-perfect-pick-26,,,"It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.
The research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, more confident investor.
Zacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.
What are the Zacks Style Scores?
Developed alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.
Based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:
Value Score
Finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.
Growth Score
While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.
Momentum Score
Momentum investors, who live by the saying ""the trend is your friend,"" are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.
VGM Score
What if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank
The Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier.
#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.
But it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.
That's where the Style Scores come in.
You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.
As mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.
Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.

2022-03-18 00:00:00+00:00,First Week of DLTR November 18th Options Trading,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/first-week-of-dltr-november-18th-options-trading,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options become available this week, for the November 18th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 245 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new November 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $15.15. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $150.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $134.85 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $153.80/share today.
Because the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 10.10% return on the cash commitment, or 15.04% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $150.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $155.00 strike price has a current bid of $17.55. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $153.80/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $155.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 12.19% if the stock gets called away at the November 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $155.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $155.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 44%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 11.41% boost of extra return to the investor, or 17.00% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 37%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $153.80) to be 36%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2022-03-15 00:00:00+00:00,Signet (SIG) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/signet-sig-to-report-q4-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-offing,,,"Signet Jewelers Limited SIG is likely to register both top- and bottom-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings on Mar 17, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2,771 million, indicating growth of 26.6% from the prior fiscal-year quarter’s reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has been stable in the past 30 days at $4.91 per share, implying growth of about 18% from the prior fiscal-year quarter’s tally. In the last reported quarter, Signet’s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 113.4%. This renowned jewelry and accessories retailer has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 77.2%, on average.

For fiscal 2022, the consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $7.78 billion, suggesting growth of 49% from the year-ago fiscal tally. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current fiscal year’s earnings stands at $12.15, indicating a sharp rise from $2.11 earned last fiscal year.
Key Aspects to Note
Signet’s top line for the fiscal fourth quarter is likely to have gained from growth in e-commerce sales and the Inspiring Brilliance strategy. SIG is focused on enhancing the online shopping experience through in-store consultations and services like buy online pickup in-store and curbside options. SIG’s connected-commerce capabilities are consistently yielding results. This concept helps combine customer experiences with mobile and delivery by leveraging in store and online capabilities. The aforesaid factors have most likely aided the company’s results in the quarter under review.

Solid gains from growth initiatives like unique banner value propositions and advanced connected-commerce capabilities drove the holiday performance. SIG’s innovation efforts also bode well. Signet’s preliminary total same-store sales (SSS) for the nine-week period ended Jan 1, 2022, or the holiday season increased 30.4% to $2.4 billion. Preliminary SSS rose 25.2% year over year and 35.1% on a two-year basis. Broad-based sales across all the banners and merchandise categories grew in double digits.  E-commerce sales were up $52.1 million year over year while brick-and-mortar sales soared $499.9 million.

Segment wise, same store sales in North America improved 30.2% year over year and the division’s SSS, including physical store sales and e-commerce sales, rose 24.8%. Revenues at the International segment increased 30.5% year over year and the unit’s SSS climbed 31.3% from last fiscal -year levels.

As a result, Signet projected total revenues of $2.77 billion and SSS of 22% for the fiscal fourth quarter. SIG expected an adjusted operating income of $388 million. For fiscal 2022, management anticipated revenues of $7.78 billion, indicating a rise from $5.23 billion generated last fiscal year. It predicts an SSS of 48% and an adjusted operating income of $885 million for the full fiscal.

In a rising cost environment, deep discount chains tend to fare well because consumers want to stretch their dollars as far as possible. Leading dollar store operator Dollar General (NYSE: DG) is looking to capitalize on the opportunity by opening 1,100 stores this year and hiring 10,000 workers at the new locations, its distribution centers, and as drivers for its private delivery fleet.
While Dollar General has long had big expansion plans on the books for a while, the addition of its new pOpshelf concept store that it wants to build out to 1,000 stores by 2025 is helping provide a new tailwind. Its footprint growth could keep it ahead of rival Dollar Tree and other discount chains, but there is a big question mark handing over the plans: Where will it get the new employees?

Coming up short
The labor shortage is real and persistent. Tied to the so-called Great Resignation that began in earnest during the lockdown phase of the pandemic, workers have quit their jobs and showed no signs of being in a hurry to return.
It was believed the generous unemployment benefits state and federal governments doled out to people displaced from their jobs kept many people from returning to the labor force. Why work when the government is paying you more to stay home?
Yet those programs have mostly ended -- and still, there are more jobs available than people willing to fill them.
Although the official unemployment rate is 3.8%, that ignores the vast numbers of people the government no longer counts as unemployed because they have simply given up looking for work. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data shows the civilian labor force participation rate -- or the number of people actually working is just 62.3% of the population. Over 37% are not included.
For context, it was already at a historically low 63.4% before the pandemic struck, and it dropped as low as 60% when the government forced all but essential businesses to close. The differences seem small, but it represents millions of workers.
So while the participation rate bounced off its lows, it hasn't reached its pre-pandemic threshold yet, and you have to go all the way back to 1977 to find a rate as low as it is today.
Labor stagflation
That spells trouble for Dollar General and any retailer or business that wants to grow. In February, BLS found the retail industry had one of the lowest gains in new jobs on record, with only 37,000 positions created, a third of which were in building materials and garden supplies stores.
It estimates that between 2020 and 2030, there will be a need for over 557,000 workers to fill new positions, but the number of workers in the field will actually stagnate over that time.
Dollar General could find it difficult to bring in 10,000 new workers at a time when almost every other retailer has positions available that go unfilled. While the discounter can still build out its stores and have minimal staffing, the consumer experience then begins to suffer.
Image source: Dollar General.
The high cost of doing business
Beyond just filling positions, the labor shortage also forces wage rates to rise. The $15 per hour minimum wage is a reality in many places, even for unskilled employment like retail, and President Biden called on Congress to pass a national $15 per hour minimum wage during his State of the Union address.
In its last quarterly filing, Dollar General noted that rising labor costs due to a lack of workers available to fill positions has caused its operating expenses to rise over the past few years and has also caused shipping delays.
The retailer said rising labor costs were the leading cause of selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses rising by 105 basis points last quarter. Operating profits tumbled 14% year over year, something that can only be exacerbated by opening 1,100 new stores and adding 10,000 new jobs to the queue.
While inflation's ongoing impact on consumers has led Dollar General's stock to fall 12% so far in 2022 -- with no end in sight to rising prices and a big expansion plan in the works that could raise costs even further -- the deep discounter may have a harder time than expected in growing its business this year.

2022-03-10 00:00:00+00:00,Best Stocks To Invest In Right Now? 4 Consumer Staples Stocks For Your List,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/best-stocks-to-invest-in-right-now-4-consumer-staples-stocks-for-your-list,,,"Check Out These Consumer Staples Stocks In The Stock Market Today
Given the current headwinds in the stock market, consumer staples stocks could be the go-to for investors looking to invest in stocks that offer more stability. This is because the consumer staples industry mainly consists of companies that produce or sell essential goods for everyday use. For instance, household goods, personal hygiene products, food, beverages, and other necessities. Therefore, even during an economic downturn, demand will still remain for staple goods. Hence, given the market volatility amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, some investors may be keen on consumer staples stocks right now.
For instance, investors could be watching agriculture companies such as Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE: ADM). Since the start of the year, ADM stock has risen over 20%. Furthermore, it also recently announced the successful pricing of its first sustainable bond. ADM intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to finance projects that meet certain criteria outlined in its Sustainable Financing Framework. Elsewhere, we have food company Kraft Heinz (NYSE: KHC) which reported financials that beat Wall Street expectations. Namely, it delivered earnings per share of $0.79 against the $0.63 analysts were expecting. And with that being said, here are four other consumer staples stocks to watch in the stock market today.
Consumer Staples Stocks To Watch Right Now

Dollar Tree Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR)

Dollar General
Starting us off today is Dollar General. For the most part, it operates a chain of variety stores spanning across the U.S. With over 80 years of delivering value for its consumers, the company offers everyday products that range from food to health and cleaning supplies. Today, Dollar General has over 18,000 stores and sells products from some of the country’s most-trusted manufacturers. Yesterday, the company announced a series of new financial services. Evidently, these services are aimed at increasing access to banking options and providing customers with alternative payment methods. 
Namely, the new services include Dollar General’s exclusive Spendwell banking platform and a buy-now, pay-later test program with Sezzle (OTCMKTS: SEZNL). In addition, the company is introducing a new FIS Worldpay card reward points payment option, all of which help bring more convenience to its customers. Apart from this, it is also planning to hire another 10,000 employees by the end of this year as it continues expanding. Dollar General announced last Friday that filling these new positions will mean a 6% boost to its current workforce as it plans to open another 1,110 locations. With that being said, would you invest in DG stock?

Dollar Tree
Dollar Tree is a leading operator of discount variety stores. It has over 16,000 stores across North America and is supported by a coast-to-coast logistics network and more than 193,000 associates. The company is also one of the fastest-growing retailers in the U.S. and offers an assortment of merchandise for the whole family. This would range from household items to health and brand-name foods. In the past year, DLTR stock has risen by over 35%. 
Yesterday, Dollar Tree announced that it is reconstituting its board of directors. The board members will include former Dollar General chief executive Richard Dreiling and Paul Hilal, CEO of investment firm Mantle Ridge. Aside from this, Dollar Tree reported its quarterly earnings last week. Notably, the company brought its net sales of $7.08 billion, up by 4.6% from $6.77 billion a year ago. Additionally, diluted earnings per share were $2.01 for the quarter, beating consensus estimates of $1.79 per share.

BJ’s Wholesale Club
Following that, we have BJ’s Wholesale Club. It is a membership-only warehouse club chain that operates across the U.S. The company operates over 200 clubs and over 150 BJ’s gas locations in 17 states. It continues to deliver significant value to its members, consistently offering 25% or more savings on a representative basket of manufacturer-branded groceries compared to traditional supermarket competitors. On top of that, BJ’s has over 6 million members and over $15.1 billion in annual sales.
Last week, it was found that BJ’s is piloting a smaller concept store named BJ’s Market. It aims to serve as an innovation lab and potentially become an expansion vehicle. BJ’s Market will allow for testing out new assortments, displays, product demonstrations, and other new initiatives. According to CEO Bob Eddy, the company is looking to promote a culture of growth. Thus, BJ’s Market is the exact place to do so as it provides freedom to test out innovative approaches to their existing model. Eddy also said, “All sorts of different things that we’d like to try out, see what works, and then take what works and port it back to the mothership.” Given this exciting news, will you be watching BJ stock?

Walmart
As the world’s largest retailer, Walmart brings plenty to the table with its massive portfolio. From discount department stores to hypermarkets and grocery stores, the company does it all. For a sense of scale, the company currently operates a network of 10,500 stores spanning 24 countries. This alongside its e-commerce services continues to make Walmart a major shopping destination for consumers. Last week, the retailer launched a new virtual fitting room service called Choose My Model (CMM). 
This service is the company’s first implementation of Zeekit, a company that Walmart acquired last year. Through CMM, shoppers have access to a high-end software solution that helps them with picking out clothes. It accomplishes this by letting them choose models with similar body structures wearing clothes in Walmart’s catalog. Ideally, this would help consumers make better choices when shopping for clothing online. Furthermore, Walmart has been dipping its toes further into fashion lately. Notably, it launched a series of new private labels and added a number of national brands to its website. As such, do you think WMT stock is worth adding to your portfolio?

There is no question that the S&P 500 has gotten off to a slow start in 2022. Down 8.94% year-to-date (YTD), investors are worried geopolitical issues along with rampant inflation will bring the economy to its knees. As a result, there are fewer S&P 500 stocks to buy that are headed in the right direction. 
According to Finviz.com, approximately 345 out of the 505 stocks in the index are down YTD. Of those 345 companies, 210 are down double digits through the first two months in 2022. 
It is fair to say that momentum stocks are in the doghouse at the moment. Nowhere is that more true than in the technology sector. Of the 71 tech stocks in the index, 62 are down YTD. Over the past 52 weeks, things are a lot better with only 20 down out of 71. 
Despite the appearance that momentum stocks have lost their way, the reality is that 78 stocks are trading within 5% of their 52-week highs.

S&P 500 Stocks to Buy: Nucor Corporation (NUE)
Source: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock
As I write this, the North Carolina-based steel producer is coming down from a 52-week high of $140.25. It currently sits at $131.89. It is up 15.5% YTD and 109.5% over the past year. Commodity stocks have been hot in 2022. That is a side effect of geopolitical conflict. 
In Sep. 2021, I recommended 10 stocks to buy that were down, but not out. One of them was Nucor. At the time, it had a relative stock index (RSI) of 18.6. Stocks with an RSI below 30 are considered oversold by investors. Since my article, NUE stock is up 38% in the five months since. 
When I recommended Nucor in September, it had a trailing-12-month (TTM) free cash flow (FCF) of $1.76 billion. Today, it is $4.61 billion. So, despite the fact that NUE stock has gained 38%, its FCF yield is 12.5%, almost double what it was in September. 
It is safe to say this business is on fire.

The retailer of aftermarket automotive parts has a 52-week high of $710.86. It is actually down 5.7% YTD, but up 42.8% over the past year. Over the past five years, it is up 147.21% on a cumulative basis. It is definitely a stock to buy and hold forever. 
In October 2021, I included it in a list of companies making billion-dollar stock buybacks. Since 2011, it has repurchased more than $15.5 billion of its stock, delivering a compound annual growth rate of 12.7%. Not all buybacks are nearly as successful. 
While I’m often dismayed by how poorly companies execute share repurchase programs, when done right, they can be effective. More importantly, buybacks are a sign of an outsized FCF generation. 
7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever
There is not much else to say about O’Reilly except that if you own the stock for the long haul, you are not likely to be disappointed. It is a five-star stock in my opinion.

The discount retailer has a 52-week high of $149.37. It is up 1.44% YTD and up 36.9% over the past year. The company continues to try to turn the page on its nearly $9 billion acquisition of Family Dollar Stores in 2015. It seems no matter what it does, bad luck seems to follow the chain. 
The most recent problem is a potential boycott because of the unsanitary conditions found at many of its Family Dollar locations in six southern states. The company was forced to close more than 400 locations in late February because of the situation.
Dollar Tree has responded to consumer complaints by temporarily closing the stores, removing recalled products, and sanitizing the shelves, floors, etc. I’m sure this problem will pass. 
In the meantime, the company rolled out its new baseline pricing of $1.25 to a warm response from customers. 
“Our shoppers have been very supportive of the change, confirming that consumers continue to choose Dollar Tree for the extreme value our products offer compared to other retailers,” said Michael Witynski, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Dollar Tree.
In addition, its Dollar Tree Plus stores, which sell items as high as $5, are also doing well. Look for the company’s FCF generation to ramp up in the coming quarters. 
The Hershey Company (HSY)

The chocolate and candy manufacturer has a 52-week high of $216.33. It is up 10.7% YTD and up 40.3% over the past year.
In May 2021, I included Hershey in an article covering winning and losing stocks from the previous week. Hershey was one of the names on the winner’s list, up 2.3% at the time. Admittedly, that wasn’t a lot, but CEO Michelle Buck does such a good job running the iconic business, I just had to include it. It is up 59% since. 
More recently, I included Hershey in a list of consumer brands ready to hit customers with higher prices. It expects sales and earnings to grow between 8% to 11% in 2022 despite the price increases. 
Consumers might have a tough time paying more at the gas pump, but they’ll gladly absorb higher prices for their favorite candy bar.

The company known for spices, seasonings, and hot sauce has a 52-week high of $107.34. It is up 8.82% YTD and up 24.5% over the past year. If you are looking for a fast mover, MKC probably isn’t your cup of tea. It is one of those stocks you stick in a drawer and forget about. 
In October 2020, I picked a group of 10 consumer stocks that I felt could provide investors with a nice mix of defensive positions, like McCormick, with more growth-oriented businesses, such as Nike (NYSE:NKE). 
Unfortunately, it was close to its all-time high. As a result, it has gone sideways over the past 16 months. However, I think it is ready to blow through $100.  
In January, it reported record sales in 2021. Sales grew 11%, excluding currency, while adjusted earnings per share rose 8%. In 2022, sales, excluding currency, are expected to rise 5% at the midpoint of its guidance. Earnings are also expected to increase 5% in 2022.
It is not a fast grower, but it gets the job done. MKC stock is an excellent stock to own in volatile times.   
EOG Resources (EOG)

Like most oil and gas companies, 2022 is turning out to be a bonanza for shareholders. EOG Resources has a 52-week high of $121.77. It is up 32.9% YTD and 73.9% over the past year. 
The company’s fourth-quarter 2021 presentation states the following:
“EOG is focused on being among the lowest cost, highest return and lowest emissions producers, playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy.”
I’m not a big oil and gas fan, but it is hard not to like this kind of approach in an industry that is not necessarily known for forward-thinking.
One thing in particular really jumps out at me from its presentation. First, it generated a record FCF of $5.5 billion in 2021, $2.7 billion of which it returned to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases, and even a $1 special dividend. In 2022, it expects $6.4 billion FCF, including the $1 special dividend in March.

S&P 500 Stocks to Buy: Loews Corporation (L)
Source: Hayk_Shalunts / Shutterstock.com
This holding company run by the Tisch family has a 52-week high of $63.19. It is up 3.86% YTD and up 19.8% over the past year. 
Many would argue that Loews’ best days are long behind it. Co-founder Laurence Tisch acquired 25% of CBS for $800 million in 1986, running the network until 1995. Tisch built a conglomerate that included hotels, cinemas, insurance, tobacco, and offshore drilling. 
Capital allocation was Tisch’s specialty. His son, James, is now the CEO. He has been with the company since 1977. He hasn’t been nearly as successful as his father at growing L stock. In 1998, the year Laurence and his brother Preston stepped down as co-CEOs, the company’s shares traded close to $100. 
Today, the holding company’s assets include 89.6% of CNA Financial (NYSE:CNA), 100% of Boardwalk Pipelines, 100% of Loews Hotels, 53% of Altium Packaging, and $3.4 billion in cash and investments.  
It is a mini Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) in the best sense.
Henry Schein (HSIC)

The dental, physician, and alternate care distributor has a 52-week high of $88.38. It is up 13.8% YTD and up 33.8% over the past year. 
In April 2019, I put HSIC stock at the top of a list of seven dental stocks to buy that would make you smile. At the time, I felt like it had entered into value territory, trading perilously close to $55, a level it had sunk to on only three occasions between 2014 and 2019. 
It didn’t drop to $55 in 2019. However, during the big market correction of March 2020, it fell all the way to $45, its lowest point since 2014. It has almost doubled since then.   
Business in 2021 was excellent with sales of $12.4 billion — which were 23% higher year-over-year; 16.9% organic — and operating income of $851.7 million, which was up 59%. It expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth of 5% to 9% in 2022.

S&P 500 Stocks to Buy: Deere & Company (DE)
Source: JCLobo / Shutterstock
The manufacturer of agriculture and other heavy equipment has a 52-week high of $405.49. It is up 9.45% YTD and up 7.28% over the past year. 
It is actually trading 5.8% below its 52-week high as I write this, but it is such a good long-term buy, I just had to make an exception. Over the past five years, it is up around 243%. 
When you think of John Deere, you think of the big green combines that cut hay. However, it has more than 25 brands under its roof that accomplish all kinds of tasks in the fields and elsewhere.   
The company’s fiscal 2022 presentation explains its focus:
“John Deere will deliver intelligent, connected machines and applications that will revolutionize production systems in agriculture and construction to unlock customer economic value across the lifecycle in ways that are sustainable for all.”
Its capital allocation policies are second to none. Between 2004 and 2021, it generated $54.6 billion in cash from its operations. It allocated $4.6 billion to acquisitions, $456 million in net debt reduction, $14.3 billion in capital expenditures, and a $1.4 billion investment into its financial services business. 
With its $40.3 billion in FCF, it paid out $11.6 billion in dividends and $18.5 billion in share repurchases. Over 17 years, it paid out 55% of its cash flow to shareholders while adding more than $3 billion in cash to its balance sheet. 
This company is as solid as they come.

Who says that owning office buildings is a bad idea? The real estate investment trust owns 201 Class A office buildings in the U.S. It is the largest publicly-traded developer, owner, and manager of Class A properties in America.
BXP stock has a 52-week high of $128. It, too, is slightly outside of the 5% criteria, but it is too good a business to be excluded. It is up 5.4% YTD and up 18.8% over the past year.
Since 1997, BXP has delivered a cumulative total return of 1,208%, 1.6x the S&P 500, and 1.3x the FTSE Nareit All REITs Index.
The REITs top 20 tenants account for just 28.44% of its annualized rental obligations. These tenants have an average lease term of 10.6%. It currently is developing 2.8 million square feet of new office space. These developments are 56% pre-leased. It also has 1.2 million square feet of life sciences buildings under development. Those are 33% pre-leased.

2022-03-08 00:00:00+00:00,Funds Added To DLTR Positions,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/funds-added-to-dltr-positions,,,"At Holdings Channel, we have reviewed 6,636 13F filings for the 12/31/2021 reporting period, and looked at the various S&P 500 components held by each of these reporting hedge funds and other 13F filers. For each component, we totaled the number of shares held across all of these funds. Next, we went back to the 09/30/2021 period, and went through the same exercise for each of those 6,636 funds. By comparing the same group across the two periods, we can see which S&P 500 components, in the aggregate, these particular funds have been buying and selling.
One of the components that stands out with notable buying, is Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR). We should point out before going any further, that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.
However, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be an interesting exercise, especially when comparing one holding period to another. So, let's take a look at the change in DLTR positions across that group of 6,636 funds we have looked at that have filed for the 12/31/2021 period, versus back at their 09/30/2021 report. We found that between these two periods, funds increased their holdings by 21,419,452 shares in the aggregate, from 197,947,463 up to 219,366,915 for a share count increase of approximately 10.82%.

March 8 (Reuters) - Dollar Tree DLTR.O on Tuesday named Mantle Ridge founder Paul Hilal as a director and revamped its board, months after the activist investor pushed for an overhaul at the discount store chain.
The retailer also named rival Dollar General's DG.N former chief executive, Richard Dreiling, as executive chairman and added five independent directors to the board.
Dollar Tree said in December it offered to explore a settlement with Mantle Ridge and hand a board seat to a former chief executive of a rival retailer, calling the firm's decision to seek control of the company's board ""unwarrantedly aggressive"".
Mantle Ridge, which owns a $1.8 billion stake in the retailer, had nominated 11 directors in December to replace the entire board at Dollar Tree.
