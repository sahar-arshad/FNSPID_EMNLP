2021-01-21 00:00:00+00:00,Intel floats possibility of licensing deals but would TSMC and Samsung be interested?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-floats-possibility-of-licensing-deals-but-would-tsmc-and-samsung-be-interested-2021,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Jan 21 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O executives have raised the possibility of licensing chipmaking technology from outside firms, a move that could see it exchanging manufacturing secrets with rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW or Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS.
Intel is one of the few remaining semiconductor firms that both designs and manufactures its own chips, but the business model has come into question in recent years as the company lost its manufacturing lead to the Taiwanese and Korean companies.
One option urged by some investors would be to outsource manufacturing. The company said, however, on Thursday that while it plans to increase its use of outside factories, the majority of its 2023 products would be made internally.
But licensing technology could help Intel avoid major investments in rivals' factories that outsourcing deals would likely entail.
""Broadly speaking, that may mean sharing technologies that we have that they could use or leveraging technologies that others have developed that we can use as well,"" outgoing Chief Executive Bob Swan told an earnings call.
That said, questions remain over how much a licensing deal would cost and whether a rival firm would even be interested.
Intel did not name companies it might license from but TSMC and Samsung are its only competitors for high-end chips.
""It seems a little weird to me that TSMC would give away to the keys to the kindgom unless there's a sizeable payment that went with it,"" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein.

Jan 21 (Reuters) - Electric passenger aircraft developer Joby Aero Inc is exploring a deal to go public through a merger with a blank-check acquisition firm at a valuation of around $5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
Joby has hired investment banks to solicit interest from so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) about a potential deal, the sources said.
The sources requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential and cautioned that no deal is certain. Joby declined to comment.
Joby is developing an all-electric, zero-emissions vertical aircraft which it is aiming to deploy as an air taxi service by 2023 at the earliest. The Santa Cruz, California-based company last month agreed to take over Uber Technologies Inc's UBER.N flying taxi unit Elevate. Uber took a stake in Joby as part of the deal.
Joby has raised more than $800 million in private funding since it was founded in 2009 and in 2020 was valued at $2.6 billion, according to PitchBook, which tracks private fundraisings. Joby's backers include Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Intel Corp INTC.O.
A SPAC is a shell company that raises funds in an initial public offering (IPO) with the aim of acquiring a private company, which then becomes public as result of the merger. For the company being acquired, the merger is an alternative way to go public over a traditional IPO.
SPACs emerged last year as one of the most popular investment vehicles on Wall Street.
A deal for Joby would come on the heels of another SPAC deal in the sector. Air taxi company Blade Urban Air Mobility agreed to merge last month with Blade, Experience Investment Corp EXPC.O, driving up the latter's shares by 50%.

2021-01-21 00:00:00+00:00,Chinese phone maker Honor partners with key chip suppliers after Huawei split,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chinese-phone-maker-honor-partners-with-key-chip-suppliers-after-huawei-split-2021-01-21-0,,,"By David Kirton
SHENZHEN, China, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Chinese budget phone maker Honor has signed partnerships with major chip suppliers such as Intel INTC.O and Qualcomm QCOM.O after being spun off from under-fire parent Huawei Technologies in a bid to save it last year, it said on Friday.
Huawei had sold Honor to a consortium of 30 of the sub-brand's agents and dealers in November to help it resume sourcing components restricted by U.S. sanctions.
As Chief Executive George Zhao launched the View40, Honor's first phone model since the split, Honor said in a statement it now had its own deals with some tech firms.
These include AMD AMD.O, MediaTek 2454.TW, Micron Technology MU.O, Microsoft MSFT.O, Samsung 005930.KS, SK Hynix 000660.KS, and Sony 6758.T.
""The last five months have been an extremely difficult but meaningful time for Honor,"" Zhao said. ""We feel the weight of expectation from industry partners and consumers.""
Under Huawei, Honor focused on the budget end of the phone spectrum, but it will aim to move into the middle and higher tier market and expand overseas, Zhao said.
The company also would pursue the 'internet of things' market, using Huawei's terminology for connected smart devices controlled by mobile phones.
""They wanted to show they are Huawei reborn so that customers can trust them to have the same quality Huawei was aiming for,"" said Nicole Peng, VP of Mobility at Canalys, a consultancy.
Honor shipped 13.3 million phones in the third quarter of last year, making up just over a quarter of Huawei's total shipments, according to Canalys.
Honor's roughly 8,000 staff have moved out of Huawei's offices to a new headquarters also in the southern city of Shenzhen. Around 50% were involved in R&D, Zhao said.
Tightening rounds of U.S. restrictions have choked off Huawei's access to advanced U.S. chip technology, damaging its phone business. The United States alleges that Huawei's equipment poses a security risk, a charge the company denies.

Momentum strategies have worked extraordinarily well over the past year, and investors still seem to be quite happy with what they're familiar with. Market leadership has come from the technology sector for a long time, and today, gains in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) played the biggest role in pushing the Nasdaq higher and keeping stocks at or near record levels.
Apple stays healthy
Shares of Apple were higher by nearly 4% on Thursday, stretching its market-leading market capitalization to $2.3 trillion. The tech giant has more than doubled since last March and shows no signs of slowing down.
There's always some news surrounding Apple, and today was no exception. Stock analysts had a number of positive things to say, including that the company's first line of 5G-enabled smartphones appears to be selling well and that its planned foray into the electric vehicle arena might best be accomplished through a partnership rather than through in-house production. Morgan Stanley made a small price-target boost of $8 to $152 per share, and reports of a virtual reality headset stoked interest in Apple.

Many investors are increasingly worried about the pace of Apple's ascent. The iPhone maker has managed to outpace most of its large technology stock rivals even as revenue growth has slowed considerably. Without fundamental business growth, they argue, Apple could easily give up its gains.
There will therefore be a lot on the line next week when Apple reports its earnings. At that time, investors will get a better sense of whether the iPhone 12 is doing as well as hoped. Disappointment could send the stock lower, but further good news would leave Apple with more room to rise.
A good day for semiconductor stocks
Elsewhere, NVIDIA shares climbed nearly 5%, while Intel had a 6% boost. Strong sentiment in the semiconductor space helped lift these giants of the industry.
Intel's rise was a bit odd in that it came after a premature release of its fourth-quarter earnings results mere minutes before the end of trading. The chipmaker reported sales that were down 1% from year-ago levels but crushed the company's previous guidance. Earnings per share similarly were better than expected, coming in flat on an adjusted basis. Intel also gave encouraging guidance for the first quarter of 2021. Investors have high hopes that new CEO Pat Gelsinger will accomplish what his predecessor hasn't in fully restoring Intel to its former glory.
Yet gains for NVIDIA and other semiconductor stocks show that investors are generally enthusiastic about the entire tech industry. With strong demand for electronic devices, chipmakers can be assured of consistent order activity. Even though NVIDIA, Intel, and others are fighting for supremacy, there's enough of an appetite for semiconductors right now that every company can thrive.
Tech can keep climbing
As long as people want the most up-to-date electronic devices available, there'll be room for Apple and semiconductor stocks to keep rising. Valuation concerns are justified, but it's impossible to predict when markets might decide to correct from their recent bull run. Until then, these three stocks could be instrumental in continuing to push the market higher in 2021.

Jan 21 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O on Thursday forecast first-quarter revenue and profit above Wall Street expectations, continuing to benefit from high demand for laptops, PCs and servers that have powered the shift to working and playing from home.
Intel said fourth-quarter sales from its PC chip business were $10.9 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $9.57 billion, according to FactSet data. Data center group sales, which powered Intel's growth over the past several years, were $6.1 billion compared with analyst estimates of $5.48 billion, according to FactSet data.
Intel, for decades the biggest maker of computing chips for data centers and PCs, is grappling with technology delays in its manufacturing operations and said in July it was debating whether to outsource more of its 2023 product lineup. Executives are expected to give details of the decision on a conference call at 5 p.m. ET today.
The company last week named Pat Gelsinger of VMware Inc VMW.N as its incoming chief executive effective Feb. 15 and on Thursday did not give a full-year sales forecast as it has in years past.
Intel is one of the few remaining semiconductor companies that both designs and manufactures its products, with rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O long ago having turned to outside contract factories such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW to make their chips.
After struggling with delays with its 10-nanometer chipmaking technology, Intel lost its lead in making the smallest most power efficient chips to TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS. Analysts believe setbacks to Intel's next generation of 7-nanometer chipmaking technology disclosed in July all but ensured the gap could persist for years to come.
Intel regained some momentum in the PC market, with volumes of PC chips rising 33%, a greater increase than the overall PC market shipment rise of 26% in the same quarter, according to data from IDC.
The chipmaker said it expects adjusted sales of $17.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.10, compared with analysts' average estimates of $16.06 billion and 93 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $20 billion, beating estimates of $17.5 billion.

2021-01-21 00:00:00+00:00,7 Cheap Tech Stocks For 2021 That Are a Bargain For Their Growth Potential,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-cheap-tech-stocks-for-2021-that-are-a-bargain-for-their-growth-potential-2021-01-21,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Market followers may believe the words “cheap” and “tech stocks” do not go together. But that’s not necessarily the truth. Investors simply need to know where to look to find cheap stocks. And investors can find stocks that are cheap in terms of price or with low valuations with relative ease.
But the real trick is to find stocks which are cheap but won’t likely stay that way. 
Just a few weeks into 2021 and it looks like tech stocks should continue their strong performance. Market outlooks regarding tech performance vary, but generally look strong moving into 2021. Late last year, Yardeni Research stated that it expected 8% growth in the S&P 500 index technology sector for 2021. The same report anticipated 13.6% earnings growth stemming from that 8% overall growth. 
Still, Yardeni offered a word of caution regarding current valuations. Based on the forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P’s tech sector at 27, the tenor of the article was one of cautious optimism. Forward P/E ratios during the tech bubble hovered around 40, and sunk to the single digits in 2008. So, at 27 the bubble popping doesn’t appear imminent.
7 Stocks To Buy As The Biden Presidency Begins
I would say. though. that investors are likely to move toward better valued, cheaper tech stocks this year. Tech is still strong but a lot of money is in the major names. They’re still attractive, but becoming less so. That means cheaper tech should get a bump in 2021. Here are some names to consider. 
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK)
Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)
Aspen Technology (NASDAQ:AZPN) 
Leidos Holdings (NYSE:LDOS)
Xperi Holding (NASDAQ:XPER)
LG Display (NYSE:LPL)

Intel recently appointed a new CEO in Pat Gelsinger on Jan. 13. INTC stock rose more than 10% on the news. But even before that positive news, Intel looked to be on the right track despite a tumultuous 2020. 
The overarching narrative on Intel was that because it ceded its place as the largest semiconductor manufacturer to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in July, it was finished. I’ve maintained that this is little more than a temporary bump in the road for the company as it moves past its missteps. 
Nvidia overtook Intel, and then it also purchased ARM for $40 billion in September which left some believing Intel had been dealt a death blow. And while it was a strong move which allows Nvidia to strengthen its position in artificial intelligence, it wasn’t the end of Intel. Nor was Nvidia the only company to supposedly supplant Intel in 2020. AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) also grabbed many more headlines in 2020 than Intel. 
The result was that both AMD and Nvidia skyrocketed, while Intel plunged. The oft-cited P/E ratio as a measure of value told a valuable story. While Intel’s P/E ratio sits at around 11 currently, AMD and Nvidia sit near 122 and 84, respectively. Investors should take note that Intel looks very cheap. 
Markets criticize Intel’s strategy of tightly bundling design and manufacturing in-house while AMD, Nvidia and many other semiconductor firms choose to outsource manufacturing to Asian giants Taiwan, China, and South Korea. Intel will likely outsource some of its manufacturing soon. I fully expect it to jump soon.
NortonLifeLock (NLOK)
NLOK) software"" width=""300"" height=""169"">Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Consumers are growing increasingly concerned as more and more of our lives becomes digitized. Cyberthreats are rising. This is part of the reason that considering an investment in NortonLifeLock makes sense.
There are many concerns for which consumers feel vulnerable: identity, online, while using connected devices, and in our homes. NLOK stock covers all of those concerns and gives investors a play at each. 
NortonLifeLock was formerly the consumer arm of Symantec’s security business. When Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) purchased that business in late 2019, it did so primarily for Symantec’s enterprise security assets. The result was that NortonLifeLock sprung out as the remnant consumer security business under a rebranding. 
NortonLifeLock is heading into the consumer security realm full force, acquiring Avira in December. The result is that the company expands its presence in Europe and emerging markets and is expected to be accretive within a year. 
The company is very cheap now, both in terms of its $20 share price, and its P/E ratio of 5.21.
Salesforce (CRM)
CRM) sticker."" width=""300"" height=""169"">Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com
Salesforce is a leader in customer relationship management. So much so that its stock ticker lends its initials to the business practice itself. That business practice is rife with strong competition. 
And yes, Salesforce should be considered, as Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin put it, a hungry hippo after its acquisition of Tableau (2019) and the pending deal to buy Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK). Logically Salesforce will deal with issues as it integrates both, with margins in particular remaining an issue. 
But the fact is that despite Salesforce’s outsized position in the industry, it may well be a bargain right now. As of this writing it carries a P/E ratio of 55.68. That isn’t exactly great — it’s in the lower third of industry peers — but CRM stock has already shed 24% of its value since early September.
With its definitive agreement to purchase Slack and its leading position it has a good chance to rise. Salesforce is the grandaddy in the industry, Slack is much younger and perhaps more relevant. Although the deal won’t close until second quarter of 2022, it should still bode well for CRM stock. 
That stock isn’t cheap by the most often-used P/E ratio, but it is on a bit of a dip now. As the leader in the crowded CRM niche, Salesforce makes sense as a buy-and-hold that should rise soon.
Aspen Technology (AZPN)
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com
Aspen Technology is a company that focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and industrial manufacturing. The company serves industries including oil and gas and engineering making it a stock with less media exposure than more everyday tech names. 
AZPN stock’s Q4 EPS beat probably led to higher expectations going into its fiscal Q1 which were somewhat unattainable in this environment. The company exceeded expectation  in fiscal Q4 and importantly posted an EPS of $1.54, well eclipsing its $1.18 guidance. Q1 EPS results were disappointing in that they failed to announce earnings on time.  
One of the focal points of Aspen Technology is the self-optimizing plant. The company has several decades of experience in plant optimization and experience in the burgeoning AI field to enable new solutions. The company’s solutions intend to allow “autonomous processes that enable industrial facilities to instantly react and adapt to changes across the value chain, thereby driving new levels of safety, sustainability and profitability.”
AZPN stock carries a forward P/E ratio better than nearly 60% of the industry. That means investors can get a piece of this burgeoning subsector of AI relatively cheap. The company has a history of value creation as well and has proven that it wisely allocates capital for efficient returns. 
Leidos Holdings (LDOS)
LDOS) logo on the side of an office building"" width=""300"" height=""169"">Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com
Leidos Holdings is an IT firm in the government space with a lot going for it. Wall Street loves it right now: 11 of the analysts covering it give it a “buy” while there are two “holds” and no ratings lower. That means there’s probably going to be a flood of positive sentiment given the sway of analyst ratings. 
LDOS stock looks to be a no-brainer given its strong recent quarters. Leidos posted a Q2 earnings beat with an EPS of $1.55 on $1.11 guidance. Then the firm posted another beat in Q3 of $1.47 EPS, besting guidance of $1.23. 
Q3 top-line revenues were $3.24 billion, besting the previous year’s revenues by 14.4%. The company also managed to increase operating margins at the same time. 
The company also recently improved its position in cloud with a $215 million purchase of 1901 Group. The company’s recent results in a strongly relationship-based federal sector makes it a solid choice. And the stock is cheap relative to other software peers based on traditional P/E, and forward P/E ratios.
Xperi Holding (XPER)

Xperi Holding is a consumer entertainment licensing company. It has a portfolio of media and semiconductor IP totaling over 11,000 patents.
The company is divided into a product business and an IP licensing business. Its product business includes company developed assets revolving around user experience. It licenses these assets across the media and semiconductor industries. Xperi also leverages its other IP for similar purposes. 
The company’s Q3 earnings release highlights the reasons that four out of five analysts covering XPER stock have it as a “buy.” The company settled intellectual property litigation with Comcast which extends into 2031, and announced many new deals with IMAX and TiVo licensing assets.
As a result, the company was able to revise upward its outlook for the second half by roughly 50% and it posted $202.8 million in Q3 revenues. XPER shares are a cheap play on content and IP rights and look worthwhile given market trends. 
LG Display (LPL)
Source: Daniel Pieterson / Shutterstock.com
LG Display manufactures and sells thin film transistors and organic light emitting diodes, better known as OLEDs. LPL stock can currently be had for less than $10 per share. It increased by 41% over the past year 
The company experienced a decline from 2018 to 2019. Although top-line revenues were nearly identical in the two years, LG Display went from operation profitability in 2018 to significant operational losses in 2019. In 2020 operational losses, though still significant, were turning in the right direction. 
LG Display has experienced a trend toward increasing prices for its displays over the past two years but also a decreasing market share of the global display market. LG Display is consistently at the leading edge of display technology, and with LPL stock at under $10 per share there’s a lot to like about it.

ntel (INTC) is set to report third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. The main topic on the call will likely be about the change in leadership — something the chip giant opted to do only a week before releasing its numbers.
Announcing the decision in this manner makes sense for a lot of reasons. Not the least of which is to give the market time to assess the move (and choice) on its own merit, without also having to dissect the quarterly numbers which might not be that impressive. So far, the market has applauded the decision. Intel shares have since soared more than 10% once it was confirmed that CEO Bob Swan will step down on February 15, to be replaced by Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO of VMWare (VMW).
This news comes on the heels of Swan, earlier this month, holding a call with activist investor Dan Loeb of Third Point Capital. When activists are engaged, it’s typically a signal that a company is under pressure. Execution has been a major issue at Intel over the past several quarters, including it delaying products such as its 7nm-based chip by 18 months to two years. This move seemingly gave Intel’s rivals, namely Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a strong lead which would be hard for Intel to regain.
As it stands, Intel now trails its rivals AMD and Nvidia (NVDA) in several important chip developments. But can Gelsinger quickly turn these things around? Analysts at Needham upgraded Intel stock to a Buy from Hold and raised the price target to $70 which suggests a premium of more than 20%. Fundamentally, Intel offers tons of value, trading a forward P/E of just 12.52. And Gelsinger’s appointment is one more catalyst. But the company on Thursday must say all the right things to support that level of confidence.
For the quarter that ended December, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is expected to earn $1.10 per share on revenue of $17.48 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $1.52 per share on revenue of $20.21 billion. For the full year, earnings are expected to increase 0.61% year over year to $4.90 per share, while full-year revenue of $75.39 billion would rise about 4.8% year over year.
The semiconductor giant has plenty of atoning to do. Its shares were clobbered more than 10% following its third quarter announcement which missed on the bottom line by 2 cents. Q3 revenues of $18.33 billion did beat street estimates by roughly $70 million, though this number was down by 4% on a year-over-year basis, driven by declines in a majority of the company's business segments. On the bright side, the figures were above the management’s guidance. Investors were not impressed, however.
Analysts raised concerns about revenue in the Data Center Group which missed estimates by roughly $300 million. Q3 Operating margins also missed estimates by roughly 60 basis points on an adjusted basis. As such, the quality of the bottom line beat came into question as it appeared it was helped, in part, by the company’s sizable accelerated buyback program.
All told, the quarter wasn’t as bad as expected, but it could have been much better from an execution perspective. And it would seem, as evidenced by the change in leadership, that is what the Intel board is looking to improve upon. The question is, how patient will the market be to allow Intel and Gelsinger to execute?

2021-01-21 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-Air taxi start-up Joby explores deal to go public - sources,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-air-taxi-start-up-joby-explores-deal-to-go-public-sources-2021-01-21,,,"By Joshua Franklin and Anirban Sen
Jan 21 (Reuters) - Electric passenger aircraft developer Joby Aero Inc is exploring a deal to go public through a merger with a blank-check acquisition firm at a valuation of around $5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
Joby has hired investment banks to solicit interest from so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) about a potential deal, the sources said.
The sources requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential and cautioned that no deal is certain. Joby did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Joby is developing an all-electric, zero-emissions vertical aircraft which it is aiming to deploy as an air taxi service by 2023 at the earliest. The Santa Cruz, California-based company last month agreed to take over Uber Technologies Inc's UBER.N flying taxi unit Elevate. Uber took a stake in Joby as part of the deal.
Joby has raised more than $800 million in private funding since it was founded in 2009 and in 2020 was valued at $2.6 billion, according to PitchBook, which tracks private fundraisings. Joby's backers include Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Intel Corp INTC.O.
A SPAC is a shell company that raises funds in an initial public offering (IPO) with the aim of acquiring a private company, which then becomes public as result of the merger. For the company being acquired, the merger is an alternative way to go public over a traditional IPO.
SPACs emerged last year as one of the most popular investment vehicles on Wall Street.
A deal for Joby would come on the heels of another SPAC deal in the sector. Air taxi company Blade Urban Air Mobility agreed to merge last month with Blade, Experience Investment Corp EXPC.O, driving up the latter's shares by 50%.

Tech stocks have been one of the hottest sectors to watch in the last couple of months. One thing for certain is the fact that the coronavirus pandemic has fuelled the growth of technology. With concepts like work-from-home and distant learning becoming the norm for many people, there has been a rise in demand for laptops, data centers, and e-commerce. In order to cope with rising demand, tech companies ramped up their services and capacity to capitalize on this opportunity. This could be the trend for the months that come as many countries are still coping with vaccination rollout.
The tech sector is also always in the limelight these days. For instance, Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) co-founder Jack Ma has finally made an appearance for the first time since China’s government began clamping down on his business empire nearly three months ago. The news has sent the tech stock up by over 5% as of 10:27 a.m. ET. Elsewhere in tech, space tech company, Maxar Technologies (NYSE: MAXR) has been up by over 40% year-to-date. This shows how quickly these stocks can explode in growth in a relatively short time.
With so much happening in the tech sector, it can be a grueling task to pick top tech stocks in anticipation of huge gains. It is, however, worthwhile to pay attention to tech stocks as they are fundamentally strong with good earnings visibility. All things said, here is a list of top tech stocks to consider adding to your portfolio.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM)
BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB)
Intel Corporation
Intel is a tech titan that is based in Silicon Valley. It is the world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturer based on revenue. The company is the brains behind the x86 series of microprocessors that are used on most personal computers. Intel will announce its fourth-quarter earnings tomorrow and has recently enjoyed a 25% stock price increase in the last month.
Despite being outperformed by its competitor Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) in the last few years, the company has been taking meaningful steps to turn its business around. Last week, Pat Gelsinger was announced as the company’s new CEO. Gelsinger has been with the company for over 30 years. He is a proven technology leader with a distinguished track record for innovation and deep knowledge of Intel. In the same announcement, the company also expects to beat its fourth-quarter 2020 revenue and earnings per share.
Late last year, the company’s shares surged after it was reported that hedge fund Third Point had acquired a significant stake in the chipmaker. The hedge fund has also been pushing Intel to streamline its operations, which includes moving away from manufacturing. Intel also notes that it has made strong progress on its 7nm process technology and plans to provide an update tomorrow as well. With such exciting developments surrounding the company, will you consider buying INTC stock?

International Business Machines Corporation
IBM is a technology and consulting company based in New York. The company has over 350,000 employees in 170 countries. The company has been investing in its blockchain and hybrid cloud platforms and could reap its benefits of these next-generation technologies in its fourth-quarter earnings scheduled for tomorrow. The company’s shares are currently traded at $130.08 a share at the close of Wednesday’s trading session.
How has the company been doing financially so far? In its third-quarter fiscal posted in October, the company reported a revenue of $17.6 billion. A bulk of that revenue came from its cloud segment, at $6 billion, and was a 19% increase to a year earlier.  Its global business services brought revenues of $4 billion and its systems segment brought in a revenue of $1.3 billion. The company also had $10.8 billion in cash and reported operating earnings per share of $2.58.
“The strong performance of our cloud business, led by Red Hat, underscores the growing client adoption of our open hybrid cloud platform,” said Arvind Krishna, IBM chief executive officer. “Separating the managed infrastructure services business creates a market-leading standalone company and further sharpens our focus on IBM’s open hybrid cloud platform and AI capabilities. This will accelerate our growth strategy and better position IBM to seize the $1 trillion hybrid-cloud opportunity.” The company is certainly making its way back to its heydays based on its solid financials. All things considered, do you think IBM stock is a top tech stock to buy?

BlackBerry Limited
BlackBerry is a multinational company that specializes in enterprise software and the Internet of Things (IoT). The company’s shares today hit a three-year high and have doubled year-to-date. There are a few reasons for this incredible climb. Last month, the company announced that it will be joining forces with Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) Amazon Web Services to accelerate its Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data.
In the company’s latest quarter financials in December, it reported total revenue of $224 million. Its software and services segments brought in a revenue of $168 million. BlackBerry also reported a gross margin of 70% and net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million. The company also launched its new AI-powered Mobile Threat Defense solution to protect against mobile malware and phishing attacks.
Recently, the company sold some 30 mobile phone patents to telecom giant Huawei. Getting rid of BlackBerry’s legacy business would allow the company to focus on its core businesses. Investors seem to have responded positively to this news based on the spike in its share price when the news first broke. The company has also been rebranding itself in the last few years as a software company and an IoT market leader. Boasting over 38,000 patents and having its software installed in over 175 million cars across 45 automakers certainly helps position the company well. Could 2021 be the year BB stock return to its former glory?

Thankfully for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) investors, the impact of the novel coronavirus did not slow its momentum. In fact, in 2020, AMD stock saw a near-90% return. That’s nothing short of marvelous. But will this success continue in 2021?
AMD) logo on blue background with Ryzen and Radeon brands"" width=""300"" height=""169"">

The stock hit a new high of $97.98 last month and it seems like there is still no stopping it. There are several key reasons why the stock should stay on your radar.
For example, AMD has strong financials backed by significant delivery numbers. There is a significant rise in the number of CPUs it delivered in 2020 compared to last year. And as the work-from-home trend continues, demand for CPUs will continue to grow. The company is also growing with rising demand from the cryptocurrency industry.
Let’s take a closer look at some of these catalysts to determine what investors should expect from AMD stock in 2021.
An Extensive Line Up of Products
At the CES 2021 technology trade show, the company announced the World’s Best Mobile Processors. Laptops with Ryzen 5000 Series Mobile processors will be available in Q1 2021. The AMD Ryzen PRO 5000 series mobile processors deliver high-grade security and quick manageability to commercial users. These new chips use the same 7nm manufacturing process. The company expects a portfolio of more than 150 commercial and consumer notebooks based on the Mobile Processors. For games, there is the HX Series processors that provide gamers with strong performance and HS processors for H-series in lighter and thinner form factors. 
Developments to Ryzen processors should be on any AMD stock investor’s mind, as the market for Ryzen CPUs is heating up. For example, there were chip shortages at the end of the year with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) requesting AMD to increase production to satiate rising demand for its Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, both of which use AMD chips.
Another potential indicator of the great success ahead for AMD is its recent price-hike for the latest generation of Ryzen 9 products.
The Ryzen 9 3600X, 3800X and Ryzen 3900X sold like hotcakes and were largely affordable options. This time, however, AMD advantaged its superior performance over Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) products by increasing the cost of the Ryzen 9 5600X and 5900X by 50% and 10%, respectively, compared to the cost of the 3600X and 3900X. And this hasn’t hampered sales.
In fact, the company has already reached an all-time high in terms of sales in December 2020. The company hit the 40,000 units mark — a 14% increase from the 35,000 units sold in November. According to TechRadar, AMD’s bestselling chips — Ryzen 5000 models and Ryzen 3000 processors — account for more than 50% of the CPUs sold in December. And the Ryzen 9 5900X is currently the “best CPU” for gaming.
The 7 Best Stocks To Buy In The Dow Jones Today
The company’s strength in the CPU market isn’t the only reason the hype will continue in 2021. Another reason to get bullish about AMD stock is a recent deal with Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Samsung confirmed that it will work with AMD on a custom mobile GPU. Both companies have been working together for two years, but Samsung revealed more about it at the Exynos On 2021 event. The chips will be used for its next flagship product, but the company did not talk more about the type of product. Samsung is moving away from the custom CPU core for the Exynos chips and it threw light on a powerful GPU that might be in progress.
The Bottom Line on AMD Stock
The company is clearly a strong player in the CPU market and that should remain true throughout 2021 as the overwhelming demand for its CPUs continues and it introduces new technologies to the market.
But there’s yet another strong reason AMD stock should remain strong: The recent CEO transition in Intel. Specifically, Pat Gelsinger will replace CEO Bob Swan in February. AMD is already scooping plenty of market share from Intel. The challenges presented by Intel’s CEO transition should help AMD to continue to overpower its rival.
When you put all of these points together, you really do not need to worry much about the long-term prospects for AMD. That’s part of what makes it a perfect growth stock. The company is healthy and efficiently run with strong financials. AMD stock has been a powerhouse over the past few years, but there’s no real reason to expect that strength to end anytime soon.
That makes it a solid addition to any investor’s portfolio, and the recent dip a promising buying opportunity.

2021-01-20 00:00:00+00:00,These 2 Nasdaq SPACs Have Doubled Since September -- and They're Still Rising,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-2-nasdaq-spacs-have-doubled-since-september-and-theyre-still-rising-2021-01-20,,,"2021 has started out well for those who invest in the stocks in the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC). The benchmark has kept rising even after an amazing 2020, and on Wednesday at noon EST, the Nasdaq was up another 1.75%. That was enough to set another all-time record high for the index.
One of the factors helping stoke enthusiasm about the stock market has been the spate of new companies coming public. Increasingly, privately held businesses are choosing to bring their shares to the investing community through special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. In anticipation of finding candidate companies to bring public, SPAC shares often jump once the SPAC identifies a solid target.
That helped shares of Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ: OPEN) and Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ: LAZR) gain ground quickly, with both stocks more than doubling since last September. Yet even now, these two powerhouses are still on the move higher. Let's take a look at what's helping Opendoor and Luminar gain ground and what's ahead for both of the former SPACs.
Opening the door to big gains
Shares of Opendoor Technologies were up 10% at midday on Wednesday. The innovative real estate technology company is changing the way the industry functions, and many investors are excited about the company's potential.
Image source: Getty Images.
Opendoor offers an alternative to the painful home-buying process that hundreds of millions of Americans have gone through over the years. Rather than forcing sellers to fix up their homes, list them with a real estate agent, and go through a months-long process of finding prospective buyers who can successfully navigate purchase contingencies and get financing, Opendoor makes quick offers on homes in several of the biggest real estate markets in the nation.
Opendoor isn't the only player in what's become known as the iBuyer industry. Older companies like Zillow (NASDAQ: Z) and Redfin (NASDAQ: RDFN) have staked their own claims. However, Opendoor maintains that it has advantages even over its competitors. Moreover, the multi-trillion-dollar real estate industry is more than large enough to give multiple companies a chance at strong growth.
Shooting to win
Meanwhile, Luminar Technologies is up almost 7% on Wednesday. The laser company has become an important player in the self-driving automobile industry, and its innovations could play a big role in helping make autonomous driving a reality.
Luminar's lidar technology uses pulsed laser beams to help autonomous driving systems measure distances between vehicles, obstacles, traffic signals, and other things that are important to detect. The company got a boost when news surfaced that it would work with a subsidiary of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) toward creating a solution for self-driving vehicles.
The big question is whether Luminar can stand up to rising competition. Velodyne Lidar (NASDAQ: VLDR) has a considerable lead in lidar-based systems, while other small companies are also looking to take advantage of the healthy appetite among investors for self-driving vehicle stocks by coming public themselves.
In this fast-moving industry, Luminar can't afford to coast on its past success. Only by coming out with state-of-the-art technology and systems will the stock be able to keep advancing.

Reuters


LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - ASML’s share price swells when computer chips shrink. It’s been a fairly reliable relationship in recent years, sending the semiconductor equipment manufacturer’s market value to 191 billion euros. Yet the Dutch company may struggle to live up to the resulting puffed up valuation.
The Veldhoven-based group sells lithography machines to chipmakers like Intel and TSMC. These bits of kit, which can cost over 100 million euros each, allow the manufacturers to print tiny designs onto the surface of chips using projected light patterns. ASML’s so-called extreme ultraviolet machines, which are at the vanguard of making semiconductors smaller and faster, helped revenue grow by 18% last year. Chief Executive Peter Wennink is expecting “double-digit” growth this year as well, according to full year results released on Wednesday.
The question is whether that’s enough to satisfy investors’ heady expectations. ASML trades at 38.5 times next year’s earnings, using the median Refinitiv estimate. That’s well above the average of 30 times for European semiconductor peers, and is roughly the same as the valuations of U.S. sector stars like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.
ASML’s multiple could look less heady over time, as its earnings grow. Assume that, by 2025, it warrants a 25 times earnings multiple - the current median for semiconductor groups, according to Refinitiv. To keep his market capitalisation the same as it is now, Wennink would have to increase the company’s earnings at an annual rate of 17%, according to a Breakingviews calculation. That’s a high bar to clear.
A continuing trade war between China and the United States would make Wennink‘s job even harder. Chief Financial Officer Roger Dassen on Wednesday mentioned export controls as a risk. For example, ASML could need to require a licence from the U.S. government to send any parts directly from America to Chinese customer SMIC. China accounted for 18% of sales by shipping destination last year.
ASML’s equipment will continue to play a crucial role in making computer chips faster and smaller. But its valuation may also need to shrink a little.

*Stock Advisor returns as of November 20, 2020
This video was recorded on January 15, 2021.
Chris Hill: Twilio CEO, Jeff Lawson, is our guest this week. As always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar. But we begin with the big banks, Citigroup (NYSE: C), Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), and JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), all out with earnings reports on Friday morning. Jason, you host the Financials episode of our Industry Focus podcast every Monday, am I wrong or was JP Morgan's fourth quarter the most impressive of this group?
Jason Moser: No, you're definitely not wrong. I would agree with that. I mean, to me, there are the big banks and then there is JP Morgan, and it's the bank that stands out among the rest. I think that's for a few reasons. I think when you look at the banks in total, JP Morgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, they were all pretty good reports, relatively speaking. I think JP Morgan is the bank that has performed the best throughout the past several years because of leadership primarily. I think that Jamie Dimon, he's been the CEO of the company since 2006. He has always taken this philosophy of making sure that they are never caught essentially asleep at the wheel, so to speak.
There's a section on their earnings report called fortress principles. I mean, that just goes back to the idea that they're creating a balance sheet that will let them withstand any type of economic crisis. Clearly, they've been through a couple, at least. Wells Fargo, clearly a story of turnaround still. I think that going into this quarter, the thing that I was watching most was the status of all of the reserves that these banks have been putting aside here over the past several quarters based on the pandemic, the economic conditions that have come from what we've been going through. Going into this quarter, JP Morgan, for example, had set aside about $34 billion in reserves. So during this core, they were actually able to release close to $3 billion of those reserves and that's good. That's a sign that they believe things are getting better. I think they'll continue to slowly but surely release those reserves. Citigroup, very similar story. They're able to release $1.5 billion in reserves. Wells Fargo, this is still a turnaround story. I think they're doing the right things, but Mr. Scharf there has certainly been dealt a tougher deck. Anytime you get a turnaround of a company, it's difficult. Particularly when that turnaround is related to a relatively toxic culture. I think we could say that culture was toxic for a while. A lot of respect for what they're doing at Wells Fargo. They've still got a little ways to go, but all in all, I think these results portend a pretty good year for these banks to come here in 2021.
Hill: On our year-end review show a few weeks ago, Ron Gross said that 2020 was the year that the blockbuster IPO returned to Wall Street. That trend appears to have spilled over into 2021. Because this week, we saw a bunch of splashy IPOs, including shares of Poshmark rising more than 130% on its opening day, and Petco shares up 60% on its opening day. Emily, there were other IPOs, I'm curious. Based on what you've seen so far, what stands out to you?
Emily Flippen: It's funny because as an investor, I really didn't have a lot of fear about frothy IPOs until this week. I've made it through the entirety of 2020, but what really instilled fear into me as an investor is looking at Petco's IPO. Mostly because I looked at their S-1 when they filed it in late 2019, and it was amazing to me what a bad company this was. Sure. [laughs] Not to sugarcoat it, they are a turnaround story. [laughs] But even in fiscal year 2019, so pre-pandemic, this was a business that still produced more than $100 million in net losses. So, not a sustainably profitable business. It was a business that's highly indebted, owned by a PE firm, and has margins that are worse than their peers. By no means was this a business that I was particularly excited about. When I heard that Petco is going public, I chuckled to myself as an investor in Chewy, which is partly owned by PetSmart, thinking this is a business that is trying to capitalize on the hype and excitement around pets during the pandemic. It's smart of them to try to get some value out of the equity during this time, but I think investors are smart enough not to buy it. When I see shares up nearly 60% on opening day, it occurred to me, maybe not all investors. [laughs]
Hill: Jason, another IPO we saw was Affirm, which is a fintech company, looking to disrupt the credit card industry. Shares of Affirm doubled on its opening day. What do you make of that business?
Moser: Fintech and SaaS, I mean, if you want to really garner some support from the market, just classify yourself as a fintech or SaaS. Hey, you put those two together, the possibilities are limitless. I think in Affirm's case, this is a company that's focused now on this burgeoning ""buy now, pay later"" market. It's this market that is just really starting to come into the consumer's mindset here and that you could buy something now and you can pay for it incrementally over time. That really is what Affirm is all about. They make their money a couple of different ways. From merchant customers, they earn a fee when they help them actually convert that sale. Then from consumers, they earn a little bit of interest income on those loans essentially when they're doing those ""buy now, pay later"" deals. You believe that in today's environment, that's not the most attractive line of business in that interest income, given where rates are today. But part of the enthusiasm behind this company is something that, I think I noted this on Monday's MarketFoolery, there's this notion now that consumers are really happy to turn to technology companies they trust in order for financial services.
There was a survey conducted by the Harris Poll back in 2020, where 64% of Americans would consider purchasing or applying for financial products through a technology company's platform instead of a traditional financial services provider. Then that sentiment actually rises to 81% for Americans aged between 18 and 34 years, and that really is the target demographic for Affirm's customers. I'm not saying the valuation makes sense, but I do understand the enthusiasm. Something to keep an eye on, their top merchant partner is Peloton, responsible for about 30% of the company's revenue right now. I would rather see them diversify away and not be so levered at one particular company. I suspect that'll come in time.
Hill: In addition to IPOs, it was also a week of notable secondary offerings. Zoom Video announced it's going to raise $1.5 billion through a secondary stock offering. Lemonade announced a three million share secondary stock offering that they are planning. Emily, are you buying?
Flippen: Neither of these companies were particularly punished by the market for these secondary offerings. While I have my own reservations about Lemonade, I think it's fair to say both Lemonade and Zoom investors are not investing in these businesses because they expect for them to buy back shares or issue dividends, they're expecting growth. So, when you look at these businesses, Lemonade, unprofitable. But looking to raise money, you have to ask yourself, OK, what is the business going to do with this money? In the case of Zoom, they're profitable, but raising more than $1.5 billion, investors ask themselves, man, that's a lot of cash. What do I think Zoom is going to do with $1.5 billion? Growth investors are definitely expecting Zoom to maybe reach out to acquire, expand their product suite. I'm looking forward to potentially some exciting acquisitions coming from Zoom. In the case of Lemonade, raising more than $500 million from their three million shares additionally issued, they're looking at expanding their insurance suite. Getting into things like life insurance, that's what investors in these businesses want to happen. They want for them to continue to expand growth, even if it is at the cost of further dilution. So, neither is particularly bad, expect for the stocks to be under a little bit of pressure, that's understandable. But long-term, if they reinvest this money to support growth, all fine and dandy.
Hill: Like you, Emily, I was struck by the fact that on the day that both of these were announced and they were announced on the same day, shares at both companies were up. Typically, when the average company comes out, announces a secondary stock offering, we see a little bit of a sell-off. Is that more unsettling to you than what we saw from Petco's IPO, or is Petco's IPO still number one on your fear-inducing list?
Flippen: Petco IPO definitely wins for No. 1 on my fear-inducing list. I think if I was an investor in businesses like Lemonade or Zoom, I would ask myself, what are they going to do with that money? If you are raising equity, but you do not create value from whatever you reinvest it into, and that eventually does need to turn into cash value, cash creation. If they're not able to do that, then it would concern me more. But I believe, especially in the case of Zoom, that they'll be able to do something really smart with that money.
Hill: One of the big stories in the financial industry was Visa's (NYSE: V) acquisition of Plaid, a fintech start-up company in a deal worth more than $5 billion. This week, Visa said the deal is off due to antitrust concerns raised by the U.S. Department of Justice. Shares of Visa are down 6% this week. What do you think, Jason? Should Visa have fought Uncle Sam to push this one through?
Moser: They're just so many great spaceballs jokes that came from this deal. I'm sorry to see it die, but I do think with Visa, they saw the writing on the wall. When [laughs] regulators are already referring to you as a monopoly, it's going to be an uphill battle. Though it's worth noting in November that MasterCard was allowed to buy Finicity, which is a very similar style of fintech business. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that MasterCard is a smaller business with a smaller share in the debit market. I think that regulators' concerns were the potential for Visa's monopoly status in the debit market. That really would have been difficult to overcome with the Plaid acquisition because Plaid doesn't really have a status in the debit market today, it's a fintech company. It is working on building these types of tools that enable money to get from point A to point B more quickly and more cheaply. I think on the flip side, this certainly opens up another opportunity for an IPO to triple on its first day of trading, because I would imagine Plaid eventually is going to go public. But I do understand regulators' concerns there. Now with that said, this is really all about the evolution of how we move money around. Technology is changing it and bringing costs down considerably, that's nothing new. Visa and MasterCard's toll booth models, they work well today. They've worked well for a long time, but they're not undisruptive, nothing really is. This is a situation where you get a couple of companies' massive market capitalizations closing. I think combined, $1 trillion dollar market capitalization with the two of them. They have a ton of resources and the ability to compete. I don't think this is something that is devastating Visa's business, it definitely has to send it back to the drawing board to see how they want to pursue this idea going forward in regard to fintech and the way technology is changing the space.
Hill: Shares of Beyond Meat up more than 15% this week on the news of an unlikely new partner, Taco Bell. That's right, Taco Bell is looking to bring in vegetarian customers and says it will be testing a new menu item later this year with a Beyond Meat product. Emily, why not?
Flippen: Chris, I don't appreciate your sarcasm [laughs] if I might be honest with you. The tone of your voice, the way you say, ""Taco Bell,"" I feel personally a little bit attacked. I think that the people who are Taco Bell lifestyle enthusiasts may also feel a little bit attacked. [laughs] But this is actually a great deal for Beyond Meat. The reason is because food service elsewhere Beyond Meat over the past few quarters have been extremely tough and the stock has been under a lot of pressure because of the fall off from restaurants sales as a result of the pandemic. Getting deals with fast food and fast casual restaurants is critical for bringing Beyond Meat back to growth. The reason why this is so big and the reason why it's up 15% on a simple deal with Taco Bell, which is great, by the way, is because they actually won this out over competitors. Back in 2019, Taco Bell met with a Beyond Meat competitor that's Impossible Foods, to potentially roll something out, and they decided not to take that partnership. This year, going with Taco Bell, because they're going with Beyond Meat, says something about its product. I look forward to both investing in Beyond Meat, seeing where that brings the company, but also consuming whatever delicious creation these two companies come up with.
Hill: Taco Bell lifestyle enthusiasts can send their angry emails to me at radio@fool.com. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is getting its third CEO in the past three years. Bob Swan is stepping down next month, VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger will take over at Intel. The immediate reaction from Wall Street was clear, shares of Intel up 15% this week, VMware shares down 5%, Jason.
Moser: Well, remember we were talking about JPMorgan and that advantage of having focused leadership for so long there and Jamie Dimon. Intel, that's the opposite. [laughs] Three CEOs in three years, that's not what you really are aiming for. I think Intel's problem is transcend leadership. I think it could be argued their troubles are a direct result of wanting to have their cake and eat it too as a designer and the manufacturer, and it's really slowed them down. I think for Intel, they really need to choose a lane. To that point, they've been transitioning away from a PC based company more to a data-centric company. That certainly is a very big universe data-centric. You'd go a lot of different ways with that. I think that Mr. Swan, he doesn't have the tech background, that doesn't really seem ideal. That could have been a problem. Conversely, if you look at a company like Qualcomm for example, and even outgoing CEO, Mr. Mollenkopf, incoming CEO Cristiano Amon, they both have electrical engineering backgrounds. I think that's really helped Qualcomm's calls through the years.
I actually think that in this case for Intel, they may be thinking they need to find a meaningful acquisition as soon as possible in order to get things moving. Because turning things around at this stage of the game for a tech company like this, when things are already moving so quickly, it's going to be really difficult. Then you look at the overall environment here, Qualcomm just making an acquisition of NUVIA for $1.4 billion, you get Nvidia and Arm merging, Marvell acquiring Inphi, AMD acquiring Xilinx. There's consolidation going on in space. Intel, it's a big company with a lot of resources, but they're getting left in the dust here. If you look at just Qualcomm's performance compared to Intel over the last several years, Qualcomm is just leaving them in the dust. I think it's going to be a big challenge for Intel. Maybe new leadership is the answer, because it doesn't seem like they've really found the right mind yet to take this company to the next level.
Hill: Real quick, Pat Gelsinger does have a tech background. He was the first ever Chief Technology Officer at Intel, so he's going back to Intel. How long before we know if he's the right person for the job, a year?
Moser: Well, I think a year is a fair number to at least start assessing, because you've given them a full four quarters to report and demonstrate what the strategy is. Much more than that though, like I said, this space moves really fast, so they got to really get things going.
Hill: Exciting news this week from Unilever, the consumer product parent company of Ben & Jerry's. This week, the ice cream maker is launching Doggie Desserts, a line of frozen treats available online and in grocery stores. Emily, I saw this news and I thought, ""Well, that's cute."" Then I realized, [laughs] ""No, this isn't just cute, this is really smart business.""
Flippen: This is playing off of a longer term trend that we've seen in the pet space. It's the same thing that's catalyzing Chewy and this crazy Petco IPO. It's that people love their pets and that really shouldn't be a surprise. These are people who treat their pets like kids, and as a result, are willing to do anything and in this case, pay anything to make their pets' lives as wonderful as possible. It's actually amazing to me that we didn't think about things like pet, or dog in this case, ice cream earlier. But this is where Ben & Jerry's is going to expand their product line into pets. The issue here isn't pet ice cream, is the fact that this dog ice cream looks so good. I think I might eat it. [laughs]
Hill: One of the best-performing stocks over the past five years is Twilio, a cloud communications platform that adds messaging, voice, and video to mobile apps and the apps on the web. Twilio shares have risen more than 1,300% since 2016. Jeff Lawson is a software developer who also happens to be a Co-Founder and the CEO of Twilio. He just published his first book, Ask Your Developer: How to Harness the Power of Software Developers and Win in the 21st Century. He recently talked with Motley Fool Co-Founder, David Gardner, and Tech Analyst, Tim Beyers, about how Twilio is organized, the values that guide the company, and of course, software.
[...]
Jeff Lawson: The amazing thing about software is that you can continually iterate on it. You're never done. You can always listen to your customers and hear something better that you could be doing, get a new feature request, or even if it's something simple like making it faster or whatever. There's always ways in which you can improve the software, and that creates a cycle of continuous improvement. But in the market there is also competition between companies who aren't your business. That pace of software, you hear like, ''Oh, the business world is getting faster and faster.'' A lot of that is because of software. Because software invites you to continually iterate and make it better and better. Think about all those apps on your phone. They're downloading updates now silently, you don't even know it. You're getting new versions of those apps pretty much every week. They're fixing bugs, they are getting better, and they're adding new features and functionality that are going to make your use of that app even better. That's really the superpower of the world of software, and that's one of the reasons why it's so important for companies to really embrace that. Because if your competitors are really embracing that and iterating quickly in running a lot of experiments to figure out what customers want and they don't want, and you are not, you're relatively static. You wrote the software a few years ago and let it sit there. Well, guess who customers are going to actually find to be a better option? The company that's always testing and iterating and getting better and better. That's why it becomes a little self-fulfilling.
You mentioned that Twilio provides the infrastructure for developers and companies to be able to do that, and you're right. We arose because software developers and the companies who employ them saw the need to work more iteratively and to move faster, and therefore, infrastructure like Twilio or Amazon Web Services or Stripe arose to serve those customers, to enable them to then meet the cadence of software and to serve their customers at Internet scale and Internet speed. But then, because we exist, now more companies can get on that bandwagon and more companies can execute with that iterative spirit, and then that makes the importance of it even more for every company. It really is folding into this whole build versus die thing. Because just the nature of business and the speed of iteration and the speed of competition has just accelerated in recent years because of that power of software, it's just built-in.
David Gardner: Really well put, Jeff. I used to say around the halls of Fool HQ, whoever has the most techies wins, and so I'm very much, I guess, sympatical with you on this. That's been part of how I think about every industry when I pick stocks. So, ask the developer, who has the developers? Many of our viewers who have not yet gotten to see your wonderful book, don't know that the title comes directly from, well, basically, a billboard that you put outside Silicon Valley for everybody to drive by and you were working with your marketing team and nobody came up with a good idea and you finally just said, ''Let's go with 'Ask the Developer'.'' Which is a brilliant stroke, and so this has to be one of the few books that I could think of that started with a billboard as the title eventually of the book. I wanted just to shift briefly to Amazon. You speak highly of Amazon, Jeff, both of your time there and where it is today, of course, that's been another long-term hold for us, a great company. Specifically though, Jeff, you credit Amazon for the inspiration for organizing in small teams. I'm curious if you'd like to just lay that out a little bit for our members so they can hear and understand what that means. Then maybe was there another best practice that you've learned from Amazon?
Lawson: Absolutely. Most companies, there's a tendency as they get bigger and bigger, they slow down, they get more bureaucratic, and decision-making gets obfuscated and the employee base just loses its energy that it might have had when it was a start-up. That's the natural tendency of companies, and here's the interesting thing about Amazon. I got hired there in 2004. My friend Dave Schappell hired me. HTe had started at Amazon when there were about 100 people. I got hired, the company was about 5,000 people. Dave promptly quit, he was like, ''Okay, I've been here long enough.'' He left shortly after I got there, he went and started a start-up, and that start-up later got acquired back by Amazon. When Dave landed back at Amazon, the company was 75,000 people. [laughs] Okay, so here's this guy, my friend Dave, who's like, ''You've been at this company. You saw it at 100 people, you saw it at 5,000 people, and now you see it at 75,000 thousand people.'' I called him up one day, this about 2011, and because I was starting to scale Twilio and I'm like, ''How do I make some good decisions here?"" I said, ""Dave, can you compare and contrast those three versions of Amazon? 100 people, 5,000 people, 75,000 people, because it must be totally different.'' He thought about it for a minute and he said, ''Do you know what? It's exactly the same."" The same energy, the same drive, the same bounce, and people staff, the same intellect of the employee base, It's the same company. It just, I work with the 100 people who are closest to me. I would just have no idea that there's 75,000 other groups of those people all around the company. Because it feels like that same start-up I joined in 1997. I thought, ''That is astounding.'' The secret to that is keeping it small, small teams.
When you build a company, when you're growing the company, the goal is to try to keep that energy, that intrinsic drive that every employee has in the early days of a start-up, and replicate it many times over as you get bigger. The way to do that is to continually divide the company and divide the mission of the company into small teams. Teams of no more than say, 10 people, and organize those teams around three things. No. 1, a customer. No. 2, the mission for what they're trying to solve for that customer, and three, the metrics of success that tell you if they're actually succeeding in that endeavor. With those three things, now what you've done is you've unleashed that team's ability to go sprint for that customer every day and to go innovate and try to be as autonomous and independent as possible, and in that small group setting, every member is really connected to the customer and really connected to the mission because it's small again, and you think about a small team of say, 10 people, if there's a low performer on that team or someone who's checked out, you're not going to get by for long in that type of environment. Whereas if you are one of 500 people on a team, you're like, ''Yeah, it's easy to get lost in the shuffle, but when you're on one with 10 people, with a strong sense of ownership over what you're trying to accomplish, somebody who's checked out won't make it very long, and everybody is very close to the decision-making and very close to the customer they're serving. I think that's the magic of how you scale a company while keeping everybody really motivated, really driven, and coming from a position of really understanding why they're there and what success looks like at the local level, at their team level.
Gardner: Jeff, have you just described how Twilio is organized?
Lawson: Yes. That's how we've done it as well, and I talk in the book, it sounds easier said than done because if you're a small company, you're a start-up, ""Okay, I've got 10 people"" or if you're a big company, you have a new initiative, maybe it's got the 10 people, but then it's succeeding and it starts growing, so it becomes 20 people or 30 people, you are like, ''Oh, what do I do now? My team that was nice and small just got big.'' Well, the answer is it's like a mitosis process. You keep dividing the team and you divide the missions and you divide actually the technology, like the code behind it, so that you can continually divide back into small teams that tackle various parts of the business. But every team in that story is connected to a mission and has a lot of drive to do that thing really well. I talk in the book about how you can scale something, whether it's a start-up or whether it's an initiative inside of a bigger company, and continually divide it to keep that entrepreneurial spirit even as the company or the initiative continues to grow.
Tim Beyers: Jeff, you talk a little bit in the book about how you try to make the values very actionable. Twilio has, if you look at it and I encourage anybody, if you're an investor or thinking about investing in Twilio, definitely take a look at the site and the list of values that Twilio has, one of them is, ""Wear the customer's shoes,"" you talk about this in the book, and it seems like what you're talking about just there, about dividing into small teams is a way to actionably wear the customer's shoes, because if you have a huge team, most of the people can't be near the customer. But how do you make it where, say, like the accountants are near to the customer? There's only so many people that can be near to the customer. But can you talk a little bit about this value, and how you get everybody a little bit closer to the customer?
Lawson: Well, it's interesting when you think about it, companies, in the early days of a company, like, I'll talk about the early days of Twilio.
Beyers: Yeah.
Lawson: On any given day, I might be writing some code, talking to a customer who's a sales prospect, supporting a customer with customer support and paying some bills, like you're doing everything. As companies grow, the tendency, of course, is for there to be silos, because people get more functional. You hire experts to do each of those things. There's a lot of great things about hiring an amazing customer support team, so that the developers who are building the product don't have to answer every support ticket. Obviously, that is beneficial, but the problem is if you let it go too far, you end up putting these walls up that separate all the functions. You can have a sales team who's doing sales and their job would be to not have to bring the developers in every conversation with a customer. You've got sales engineers to do that or the customer support team; their job is to answer the support tickets as opposed to having the engineers have to do it all. If you do it perfectly, what you've done is with all good intentions, you've accidentally siloed the people building your product from the very customers they're building it for.
Again, it all came from good intentions, including product managers. Many product managers see their job as protecting their team from the distraction of customers. I think the best product managers are those who see their job as facilitating interactions between their team and their customers. It's not every interaction, but if you don't poke holes in those walled silos that arise in the company, then yes, you will isolate your team from the very customers they're trying to serve. I love the story of one of the product leaders at Twilio; his name is Ben. He started his career, his first job out of college was he was a developer at Bloomberg writing software for the terminals. He got there bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and he said to his manager, ""Hey, when do we get to go to a trading floor to talk to your traders who are using our software?"" The manager laughed and said, ""Oh, yeah. That's a funny idea. We've never actually done that."" Ben was a little dumbfounded. He's like, ""You mean you've never met a customer that uses the software that you do every day yourself?"" [laughs] He's like, ""Well, not really."" Ben actually just found his own path. He went and found a friend of his who was a trader and he said, ""Do you mind if I stop by?"" Ben showed up at the trading floor and they had always assumed that their widget that they were building, like they spent every day building this widget, they assumed it was the full 27-inch screen was their beautiful widget. Well, it turns out that the trader had it in some tiny little, 16x16 box in the corner of their screen. It wasn't even legible. You couldn't read the fonts and it was completely different than how they imagined their software was used. It wasn't until they actually went and interacted with a customer that they actually found out. Then that changed their roadmap entirely. Like, ""We got to make fonts that work at small scale,"" and all these things happened.
I shared that example in the book because it's a really good example of what happens when those walls between you and the customer are so tall that you actually have no idea how your customers are actually using your product. As leaders, I think it's our job to intentionally poke holes in those walls that separate our teams from the customers they're serving.
Hill: Let's dive into the Fool Mailbag before we get to the stocks on our radar, our email address is radio@fool.com. I know the Taco Bell lifestyle enthusiasts are already typing out their emails but we also take stock questions like this one from Kyle Neuberger, who writes, ""Love the show, keep it coming. This question may seem simple, but in your experience, when should you sell a stock, if ever?"" A great question, Kyle. Thank you for that, and Jason, this is one we get often from people, because it's one of those things particularly in the wake of where are we now? Year 11, year 12 of, by and large, a bull market? People who are sitting on some gains are trying to figure out whether or not they should sell at least some of their stocks.
Moser: Yeah. I mean, it's something that I think we all think about. It may seem like a simple question, but really I think it's far more nuanced. When we look at insiders, for example, that own stakes in the companies that they lead, we talk about those insider transactions. We say, and Peter Lynch really popularized this, it's one reason to buy, but you've got many reasons to sell. That really is the bottom line, is there are many reasons to sell and it does depend on the individual, where they are in their life. I think just a general rule of thumb though, if you're a younger investor with a lot of time in front of you, you'd look at selling a stock, No. 1, have the reasons that you bought it changed? Are the reasons you purchased that stock in the first place, have those reasons changed? If they have, then you do a little bit more of an assessment there. Do you feel like it still offers opportunity? If it doesn't, there could be some reasons to sell there if the thesis is broken and the reasons have changed, but clearly, there are going to be many more reasons. Someone needs to consider it and it really depends on where you are in your life and what you need to do with that money, what your investing goals really are.
Hill: Emily, obviously some people, if they've been investing for a while, maybe they look at the stocks that aren't doing as well in their portfolio and look to sell those off sometimes for tax reasons. What do you think about selling?
Flippen: Yes, well, there are two biggest mistakes that investors can make. One is not buying companies that end up being disruptors and game-changers that become the next Amazons and Netflix. The second one is selling those companies too early. If you're an investor looking at their portfolio and feeling the need to sell for issues of valuation, just remember that good companies that are disruptors are hard to value for a reason and they end up growing longer and faster than many people expect. That alone, in my opinion, isn't a good reason to sell, but what is a good reason to sell is when the thesis for owning the company has changed. Maybe that means that it's been a bad performer and you think to yourself this money could better be invested in a disruptor, in a company that I have higher conviction in. That's a perfectly fine reason. Or another perfectly fine reason is if you find yourself staying up at night worrying about companies because they've become such a large part of your portfolio. If you find yourself constantly afraid of the fact that you have maybe 20% of your portfolio in Shopify, just to name one. Even though you believe in Shopify, I think selling that to get it to the point where you're not losing sleep, when you're not feeling stressed over your allocation, is also a perfectly fine reason.
Hill: We've got just a couple of minutes left. Let's get to the stocks on our radar, Jason, you are up first. Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question, what are you looking at this week?
Moser: Yeah, I've been digging into a company called Penumbra (NYSE: PEN); ticker is PEN and this is a global healthcare company that designs, develops, manufactures, and markets medical devices and technology focused on neurovascular and cardiovascular applications. The numbers are pretty astounding actually on a global basis. Stroke is the second leading cause of death, the third leading cause of serious long-term disability, and that really is the problem that Penumbra is trying to tackle. Founder-led business, co-founders still own a little bit of a stake in the company. I think it's really neat, but what really has my attention is this real immersive system that they developed. It's an advanced rehabilitation technology that uses virtual reality for therapeutic activities. You talk about folks who have strokes and that need rehabilitation, well, they're trying to tackle that using immersive technology. It has definitely got my attention. The management said it represents by far the largest total market opportunity that Penumbra has ever taken on. So, it got my attention.
Hill: Dan, question about Penumbra?
Dan Boyd: Yeah, sure. Jason, it looks like late last year Penumbra had some recall issues. Is that anything to worry about going forward?
Moser: Well, it is something always to keep an eye on with medical device makers. Recalls are part and parcel of the business. It does look like something that they have accounted for, but it's always something to keep in mind. It's a risk that comes with these types of companies for sure.
Hill: Emily Flippen, what are you looking at?
Flippen: If I was smart, I would've talked about BarkBox today with all the pet news, but the company that's on my radar this week is actually Pinterest. With all the excitement that Poshmark is getting in the news, it's reminding me about Pinterest, which is a social-media-meets-e-commerce business that I like a lot more than Poshmark. Pinterest has over 400 million monthly active users and it's just at the precipice of effectively monetizing that audience.
Hill: Dan?
Boyd: Not really a question, Chris, more of a comment. Pinterest terrifies me [laughs] because I know whenever my wife is on it, it means that an impending large purchase is going to happen. Maybe that means it's a good business.
Flippen: It does.
Hill: Dan, I'm assuming you never make large purchases of any kind. What do you want to add to your watchlist this week?
Boyd: Listen, man. I've seen it happen so many times. I'm going with Pinterest. I think they're onto something over there.
Hill: All right, Jason Moser, Emily Flippen, thanks for being here.

There’s a bit of controversy in the market right now. One camp says, “Stocks are about to soar. The fourth-quarter earnings season is here!” The other camp says, “There’s too much headline risk from rising political tensions, the coronavirus pandemic, struggling U.S. economy and more.”

So, which is it?
Folks, the numbers don’t lie. The analyst community has continued to increase its fourth-quarter earnings outlook over the past three months, which bodes well for wave-after-wave of quarterly earnings surprises. According to FactSet, the S&P 500’s fourth-quarter earnings are now forecast to decline 8.8% year-over-year, which compares to previous forecasts for a 12.7% decline.
So, just keep watching the market’s best stocks, and buy the dips. Don’t get too distracted by the naysayers. They’ll always find something negative.
When I was in college, for example, my economics professor told me that the stock market could not be beat … that you might as well put your money into index funds and call it a day.
But then I wrote an algorithm that crushed the S&P by a factor of more than 3-to-1. My algorithm worked so well, in fact, that I even began publishing stock recommendations out of my dorm room. I wasn’t even 19 yet!
Yep, new technologies and investing can be a powerful combination, if you have a few programming skills.
I’m proud to say I was there for some of the biggest success stories in the past 30 years. Let’s take a quick look back, because these events are still very instructive today. Keep these lessons in mind next time there’s a bad earnings headline, or some other excuse for the “permabears” to spout gloom and doom on TV.
How I Discovered the Most Innovative Companies Before The Crowd
I’m an investor who likes to “follow the money.” So, I’m constantly fine-tuning my stock picking system — and finding exciting new applications for my methods. My latest is called Project Mastermind.
And back in the day, I wrote a proprietary trading code that uncovered Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) when it was trading for just $6 per share … well before it became one of the leading and most valuable software corporations in America and traded north of $45.
It zeroed in on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) way back before most Americans had even heard of the company. Today, it’s over $1,000 per share!
MarketWatch even recognized me as “The advisor who recommended Google before anyone else.” But it wasn’t really me who first spotted it; it was my proprietary algorithms. All I had to do was know a good thing when I saw it.
That’s also how I uncovered other huge winners too, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), all before they became big household names.
In fact, the environment right now feels very much like it did when I bought Intel in the 1980s.
Lessons of the PC Revolution
I vividly remember the days of mainframe computers. That’s what I used back when I was working on my trading algorithms in college. Mainframes were massive and by today’s standards slow and rudimentary.
So I was just as excited as anyone by the PC revolution.
And remember: They all had “Intel inside.”
It was a tiny device — the silicon microchip — that barely anyone had heard of when IBM started putting them into the first PCs. But Intel’s chips were far and away the best.
Today, you’ll still find “Intel inside” just about every PC in the world. And its stock price has gone up 11,875%!
Through hundreds of hours of research, I discovered how an elite type of stock consistently outperformed the broad market, year in and year out. After extensive analysis, I isolated the eight key qualities that these super-performing stocks shared … and I developed a system for finding them.
Yesterday, I hosted a special event where I unveiled Project Mastermind and revealed the stock I’ve rated number one based on insights from Project Mastermind — ticker symbol and all. Click here to watch a replay.

2021-01-19 00:00:00+00:00,"Watch Out AMD, Intel Is Waking From Its Slumber",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/watch-out-amd-intel-is-waking-from-its-slumber-2021-01-19,,,"Over the last half decade or so, hardly any stocks have outperformed the market to the extent Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has. The huge market gains have been a reflection of the company’s real-world performance, which has seen the chipmaker considerably close the gap on its traditionally much bigger rival Intel (INTC).
Apart from offering superior products, AMD has made the most of Intel’s production delays to eat away at its CPU dominance. However, 2021 is shaping up to be a different year to recent ones. Intel has been taking meaningful steps to turn its business around, and only recently appointed a new CEO, and one with proper pedigree at that.
Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore notes how the new figure at the rival’s helm, could impact AMD’s forward charge.
“While we expect AMD to continue to execute on its new product ramps, and any changes to INTC’s manufacturing strategy will not impact competitive intensity for at least 2-3 years, we do expect this topic to increasingly weigh on the LT AMD thesis,” the 5-star analyst noted. “Consequently, despite increasing our revenue estimates in the near term (higher semi-custom + PC CPU revenue, with EPS slightly falling due to a higher tax rate in 2021), we expect the increased uncertainty around competitive intensity to weigh on AMD’s already premium valuation.”
While Seymore tempers expectations of future performance, he expects AMD to beat the estimates when the company reports 4Q20 earnings early next month (Feb 2.).
Seymore expects AMD to deliver revenue of $3.06 billion, a 9% quarter-over-quarter uptick, near the high end of AMD’s guidance and above the $3.02 billion consensus estimate. While on the bottom line, Seymore anticipates EPS of $0.48, above his previous forecast of $0.47.
Looking further ahead, while Seymore says AMD might be at risk of losing market share to Intel over the long term, “given positive data points in the gaming ecosystem,” the analyst raised his 1Q21 revenue estimate from $2.76 billion to $2.84 billion (Street expects to $2.70 billion).
That said, for now, Seymore expects AMD shares to stay range bound. The analyst rates the stock a Hold, along with a $90 price target. (To watch Seymore’s track record, click here)
Where does the rest of the Street side on this chip player? AMD maintains a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 23 recent ratings. These include 15 Buys, 6 Holds, and 2 Sells. Shares are trading at $89.45, and the $96.55 average price target suggests room for about 8% upside. (See AMD stock analysis on TipRanks)

2021-01-19 00:00:00+00:00,ANALYSIS-China's would-be chip darling Tsinghua Unigroup bedevilled by debt and bad bets,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-chinas-would-be-chip-darling-tsinghua-unigroup-bedevilled-by-debt-and-bad-bets,,,"By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Tsinghua Unigroup, a Chinese conglomerate that has long sought to become a semiconductor powerhouse, is now caught between a rock and a hard place as debt woes mount while key chip units are failing to thrive, sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Best known for an unsuccessful $23 billion bid for U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology Inc MU.O in 2015, Unigroup in November shocked investors with a default on a 1.3 billion yuan ($200 million) bond. Including that bond, Unigroup has now either defaulted or had cross-defaults triggered on seven onshore and offshore bonds worth about $3.6 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
The state-backed conglomerate, which has warned it may not be able to make upcoming bond payments, had some $31 billion in debt as of late June, more than half of which was due to mature in a year's time, filings show. In contrast, it had roughly $8 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
The crisis has raised questions about Unigroup's long-term stability and how much backing the conglomerate, which is 51% owned by Tsinghua University, will continue to be given by Beijing. The central government, keen to develop a weak domestic chip industry, has invested billions of dollars in Unigroup projects as well as in other chipmakers such as SMIC 0981.HK.
Unigroup's efforts to raise more capital have, however, been stymied by the university's attempts to offload its stake, in line with a change in government policy in 2018 which called for higher education institutes to divest their business holdings.
Many banks have been reluctant to lend money because Unigroup may soon be without its parent company but at the same time, it can't easily find a new strategic investor due to its heavy debt load, said a source with knowledge of the matter.
""And lots of the company's subsidiaries are still not mature enough to go to capital markets, and not mature enough to generate positive cash flow,"" the source said.
Some attempts to sell the university's stake to local authorities, such as the Shenzhen government, have fallen through, according to public filings. Sources familiar with the matter said Unigroup is continuing talks with other local governments about potential investment.
Sources were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified. Unigroup did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
In 2015, Unigroup Chairman Zhao Weiguo declared he would spend $47 billion in five years to turn the company, then a little-known maker of chemicals and scanners, into China's next chip giant, primarily through acquisitions.
But three sources - all current or former senior officials within Unigroup - told Reuters its chip units have not generated hoped-for revenue and its investment strategy was haphazard, with too much money going into unrelated, often unprofitable businesses ranging from real estate to online gambling and an Indian phone maker.
""A majority of the company's investments are pretty poor, and that's how they got themselves into this kind of trouble,"" said a former Unigroup executive involved in investment.
Unlisted Unigroup does not break down its revenue and profit figures in detail. According to bond analysis firm YY Ratings, chips accounted for at most 20% of Unigroup's 332 billion yuan in revenue for the first half of 2019, with 69% coming from servers and IT equipment.
CHIP STRUGGLES
Its unit Unisoc, a maker of logic chips for mobile phones, is emblematic of the company's problems. Formerly called Spreadtrum, it was acquired for $1.8 billion in 2013 and its promise then was such that it attracted a $1.5 billion investment from Intel Corp INTC.O a year later.
But Unisoc struggled after losing Samsung Electronics Ltd 005930.KS as a client when the Korean giant reorganised its parts procurement, according to a former Unisoc executive.
As the high-end smartphone sector consolidated, Unisoc was left with mostly inexpensive, third-tier brands as customers.
""If you don't have a top tier customer like Apple, Samsung or Xiaomi, it puts a lot of pressure on the financial side,"" said the former executive.
Unisoc then scrambled to diversify into the Internet of Things, automotive chips and even bitcoin mining.
Another major investment that has yet to prosper is YMTC, which Unigroup founded in 2016 with state-backed funding, marking China's entry into the cut-throat market for NAND chips.
YMTC has since begun mass production of 64-layer NAND flash chips and recently announced it has developed 128-layer NAND flash, which technologically would bring it close to Samsung and SK Hynix 000660.KS.
But in an industry dominated by rivals with decades-long relationships with customers, its market share remains tiny, one of the sources said.
Gu Wenjun, an analyst at research firm ICWise, says that despite its technological strides, YMTC is not competitive due to weak economies of scale and must improve its yields. He estimates that getting to a 20% market share would require an additional $100 billion in investment.

This video was recorded on January 13, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's Wednesday, January 13th. Welcome to MarketFoolery. I'm Chris Hill, with me today is Bill Barker. Thanks for being here.
Bill Barker: Thanks for having me.
Hill: We've got holiday retail numbers starting to come out. We've got some housing news. We're going to start with some surprising news from Intel. CEO Bob Swan is stepping down in mid-February. In June of 2018, he was appointed interim CEO of Intel. In late January of 2019, the interim tag was removed, but suffice to say, Swan has faced a number of challenges over the ensuing two years, and he is on his way out. Moving into the corner office is Pat Gelsinger, who is currently the CEO of VMware. For anyone wondering what the investing world thinks of all of these moves, shares of VMware are down 6% this morning, and shares of Intel up 8%.
Barker: Yeah, so you've got Gelsinger who previously had been at Intel as the Chief Technology Officer and, of course, Swan came up and was promoted to interim and then permanent CEO having been the CFO. I think one of the takeaways that one can take here is that this is perceived to be a technology issue, and the solution comes from technology, not from financial expertise. I don't think there's any accusations that Swan wasn't getting the job done. From the number's point, it's that they are falling behind on the technology and it's time to make a change.
Hill: Yeah. You think about everything that's happened with them over the last couple of years. We've talked on this show about AMD continuing to eat into Intel's market share. Apple, the long-term partnership that Intel had with Apple, ended after 15 years. I understand why shares of Intel would be up on Bob Swan leaving. That said, when you take these two together, when you take the, let's just call it 15% difference between the rise in Intel and the drop in VMware, do you think it's a little overstated? The reason I ask that is because Gelsinger was CEO of VMware for eight plus years, the stock up about 30% over the entire, let's call it eight and a quarter, span of his tenure as CEO. It's not like VMware shares were setting the world on fire under the tenure of Pat Gelsinger.
Barker: Yeah, I don't know if the world is looking at VMware and saying how will they ever replicate what they've been able to accomplish with anybody else in that role. But it may be, look, he's a valued commodity, valued enough that Intel, which despite not going nowhere as a stock for 20 years but going down and then most of the way back up, but that's what you're talking about, 20 years of long term buy-and-hold nothingness, if you got in at the top back in 2000, and I think that the fair question to ask is to whether VMware is losing nearly as much as Intel is hopefully gaining here. I think that the changes being made at all is going to be maybe the lion's share of the stock movement today on Intel, if I had to just wildly guess through the market's actions. You've got Third Point having been pushing for changes from Intel. Intel says it's got nothing to do with that, nothing to do with the pressure we've been getting from Third Point, this is all independent of that pressure. I don't think that's the case, and I think that any change is going to explain a bump in Intel at this point.
Hill: All right. Let's move on to housing. KB Home's fourth-quarter profits were solidly higher than expected, and shares of KB Home rose about 7% this morning. I'm assuming part of the rise that we're seeing is not just the end of the fiscal year on a positive note, but also their outlook for 2021 was pretty positive as well.
Barker: Yeah. If you go back a year, the stock was $35 and change, it was $35 and change today moving up with today's news. From a stock perspective treading water, but the future does look a little brighter than the past. But as good as the fourth-quarter numbers were in comparison to what expectations were, they're still down from a year-ago, unsurprisingly. Things are still moving slower than a year ago when there was no pandemic to deal with. But orders are up and when you've got orders at the highest level as KB Homes just announced, since 2005, and throw a red flag on that year if you're thinking about a home builder, but hey, that's good. This is the highest fourth-quarter orders, that's not translating into sales yet, but that is the best indicator of where the business is going.
Hill: When you look at housing and all of the different ways to invest in housing, where do the home builders rank on that list? In terms of attractiveness for you.
Barker: I think the home builders rank as the most cyclical element of it. If you feel that you are somebody that can time cycles well, you can make a lot of money on home builders by buying at the bottom and selling at the top, of which there will continue to be tops and bottoms. For a long term buy-and-hold investor, I would put home builders as pretty far down in my interest pool. But if you like the market action of cyclical companies and think that you've got insight on when the cycles turn, this is something that either is going to make you some money or cost you some money, depending on whether you're right or wrong.
Hill: I mentioned on yesterday's show, this is the time of year where we start to get, almost on a daily basis, clues as to how the holiday retail season went, and we got some of that this morning. Target said that same-store sales for the holiday were up 17% compared to the previous year. Definitely not the same story for Urban Outfitters. Shares of Urban Outfitters falling as their holiday comps were down nearly 10%.
Barker: Yeah. Are you going to take a shot at my beloved hometown there?
Hill: No. I really enjoy Philadelphia. No. I'm not going to attack Philly with the fact that that's where Urban Outfitters is based. I think of Philly much more highly than that.
Barker: Well, thank you. Thank you for that.
Hill: Because I don't think highly of Urban Outfitters. [laughs]
Barker: What about Free People? What do you think about Free People?
Hill: I always forget that Free People is a thing.
Barker: Okay. Well now is your day to remember that Free People's thing because it's the CEO of the Free People brands, so Urban Outfitters, the holding company has got Urban Outfitters, it's got Anthropologie, and it's got Free People. Free People is doing the best right now of those three, and there's always a challenge in the fashion world of being on the right trends, and Free People of the three is the one getting the job done the best. Comps were up 1%, and so that, not that this is a one-quarter thing, but the CEO of Free People is going to keep doing that and is now the head of Urban Outfitters. The Urban Outfitters brand itself was down 8% and Anthropologie down 12% over the same time period. You can see where that would give a good interview for the job moment for the Free People CEO and maybe, hey, just getting the fashion rate is a huge part of this job, and they are starting with somebody who is getting their fashion right at the moment.
Hill: That's great, but keeping in mind that all things being equal, I think new CEOs should get a couple of years before they start to get judged too harshly. I don't think all things are equal in the case of a business like Urban Outfitters. I think this new CEO has about 12 months to figure out a direction and either prove, yeah, the magic I've been working at Free People, I can make that work throughout the other brands or they need to start pulling some other financial levers, including and maybe especially selling off some of the other brands.
Barker: Yeah, possibly. I mean, between the challenges that some of these brands are going to have, given what percentage of their traffic comes from malls, how they are doing on the online sales. Look, their quarter was not good, and that is not the case for everybody out in retail. Of course, they have online sales, but that wasn't enough to make up for all the sales that were lost in the malls and in stores outside of malls over the fourth quarter. I don't know that anybody is going to lose their job over getting this last quarter wrong given the challenges, but retail is always challenging, probably never been more challenging than it is at this moment, and I don't know that Urban Outfitters deserves a whole lot of leeway, given what it has been mostly failing to do over the last better part of a decade.
Hill: Well, let's go back to Target, because Target's earnings report is about six weeks away from being public. For anyone wondering,why isn't the stock moving, I mean, holiday same-store sales up 17%, that's fantastic. I'll just remind those people that while the stock is basically flat today, over the last 12 months, it's up 60%. It wasn't like this was a beaten down stock by any sense, but I don't know. You look at those numbers and if they can crank out another six weeks like the last six weeks, that earnings report in early March is going to be something to see.
Barker: Yeah. Well, so, for November-December, the comparable sales were up 17%. That was 4% in comp stores and then 102% in digital sales. You've got two stories going on here and the mix of them is good, but it's obviously mostly a digital sales growth story. To the extent that the market may not be throwing enough celebration on today's news, I think it's a reflection of the challenges of keeping up numbers that good when the digital sales isn't growing as fast as it has been. And that was a slowdown, even though 102%. There was a little slowdown from the quarter before. It's a great story, the stock is reflecting all-time highs and it's all good. They've got to keep producing pretty good numbers to justify where the stock is right now.
Hill: Let me ask you a question, and this is a serious question. What's more impressive, the fact that their e-commerce sales doubled compared to a year prior for the holiday section, the time that we're talking about, or the fact that during a pandemic in-store same-store sales were up 4%?
Barker: I'm going to take the obvious answer instead of treating this like a trick question. The more impressive one is the 102% growth part. That's more impressive than the 4% growth part. That's my answer.
Hill: During a pandemic?
Barker: Yeah. I'm going to keep defending. 102% growth is more impressive than 4% growth and you can keep pushing back on that, but I'm going to win.
Hill: I'll just point out that anyone who owns shares of Urban Outfitters now has their face enhanced, pressed up against the glass, staring longingly at the in-store comps being up 4%, because they would love to be talking about [laughs] that today instead of their comps being down nearly 10% across-the-board.
Barker: Well, Free People is up 1%. They're both impressive and of course, Target is one of the stores which is not going to be hit as hard when people are afraid of going to a store because they can go to Target, one stop, get some of their groceries, get some of their necessities and close whatever they can do a lot in one store, and they can also just order online and pick up at the store. The deliveries are up, the buy online pick up in store is way up and they've had the chance to be in the right place at this time by having made the investments into those businesses over the previous years. Target, Walmart, they are both celebrating that success these days and Urban Outfitters is in a much weaker position because it's largely things fashion retail where the customer is looking for more of an in-store experience. I don't know that the Target in-store experience is the reason that Target is so successful.
