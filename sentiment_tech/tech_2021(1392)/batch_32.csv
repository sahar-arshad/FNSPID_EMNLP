2021-04-25 00:00:00+00:00,Forget Dogecoin: Buy These 3 Disruptive Stocks Instead,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/forget-dogecoin%3A-buy-these-3-disruptive-stocks-instead-2021-04-25,,,"Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) prices have jumped from $0.06 to over $0.39 in the past month. However, with high returns has come huge volatility: Dogecoin rose by around 40.8% from the previous closing price to $0.39 on April 19, but then lost 21.7% in a matter of few days, and closed at $0.30 on April 22.
Created by two engineers as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin's rise is a testimony to the power of organized efforts by online communities (and of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's tweets). The cryptocurrency's market price movements are not backed by any stable asset, or by demand-supply dynamics. Unlike Bitcoin, which is limited to 21 million tokens, Dogecoin miners can theoretically continue to mine the currency infinitely. This, combined with limited credibility and even lower utility, makes this asset an unsuitable pick for the average retail investor.
Instead, retail investors can go for Pinterest (NYSE: PINS), NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Cresco Labs (OTC: CRLBF) -- three disruptive stocks with immense growth potential and far less volatility -- to make a killing in 2021.

1. Pinterest
Pinterest's share price has shot up over 273% in the past year. The visual search-based social media company lost almost 14.7% in the last week after Cleveland Research noted a probable decline in spending on Pinterest by some omnichannel retailers in the first quarter. Omnichannel retailers aim at providing a seamless experience to customers across all online and offline sales channels. The recent pullback, however, presents an attractive entry point for retail investors, considering that even Cleveland Research remains optimistic about Pinterest's long-term growth prospects.
Pinterest's global monthly active users (MAUs) jumped 37% year over year to 459 million, while average revenue per user (ARPU) was up 12% year over year to $4.26 in 2020. These metrics will only become stronger in 2021, since companies will be increasing their advertising spend in a post-pandemic economy.
The partnership with Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) is enabling Pinterest to reach out to 1.7 million merchants, who can use its platform to help customers discover products and make direct purchases from their websites. Pinterest benefits from increased advertising spend and social commerce as well as from an expanded product catalog that allows for more personalized recommendations to users and better conversion rates. Shopify merchants, most of which are small and medium businesses, will also earn more due to increased audience reach, considering that 97% of searches on the platform are for unbranded products.
Pinterest also has a unique demographic advantage; 60% of its users are women. Women are responsible for 70% to 80% of all consumer purchasing decisions. The company has also reported a 40% year-over-year increase in digitally savvy Gen Z user base in 2020. Pinterest benefits from having a user base with high purchase intent -- approximately 85% of users claim to visit the platform when they start a new project. All these factors will help boost both the active user count and the monetization potential of the platform in the coming years.
Trading at over 29 times trailing-12-month sales, Pinterest is not a cheap stock. However, this high-growth company has solid fundamentals and is poised to deliver year-over-year revenue growth of at least 70% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 (results will be released on April 27). Although still unprofitable, the company has managed to report $305 million in adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2020. With a rapidly growing and engaged customer base and lucrative partnerships, Pinterest seems well-positioned to write a solid success story in coming years.
2. NVIDIA
Graphics chip specialist NVIDIA is currently trading close to its 52-week high and has gained over 110% in the last year. The pandemic-driven boom in demand for personal computers has translated into 41.5 million units of discrete graphics processing units (GPU) shipped globally in 2020, far surpassing the 3 million units shipped in 2019. The numbers might have been even higher had there not been a worldwide semiconductor shortage constraining supply. Despite these challenges, the global PC market is expected to grow year over year by 8% in 2021. With NVIDIA accounting for 83% of the overall discrete GPU market in the fourth quarter, the company stands to benefit disproportionately from this growing market opportunity.
The International Data Corporation has estimated gaming PC shipments will jump year over year by 18.4% to 65.1 million in 2021. This bodes well for NVIDIA and especially for its RTX 30 series GPUs, for which demand outstripped supply in the fourth quarter. The gaming segment is the company's key revenue driver and accounted for 46.7% of its fiscal 2021 (ended Jan. 31, 2021) revenue.
Although beset with several regulatory setbacks in completing the $40 billion acquisition of chip architecture designer ARM Holdings, the company's pace of innovation has been undeterred. Recently, the company announced its first data center CPU, the ARM-based ""Grace"" chip, which is ten times faster than existing servers and is well suited for high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads. NVIDIA's GPUs are already being used for computationally intensive workloads in the data center market. In fiscal 2021, the data center segment accounted for just over 40% of the company's total revenue. However, the foray into the highly profitable data center CPU market starting in 2023 positions it as direct competition to leading semiconductor players such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.
Although NVIDIA trades close to 23 times trailing-12-month sales, the valuation seems justified. The company's growth prospects in the gaming and data center markets are unparalleled. With NVIDIA now guiding for first-quarter year-over-year revenue growth of over 70%, this stock is well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory in the coming months.
3. Cresco Labs
Although U.S. multistate operator (MSO) Cresco Labs' stock has lost over 11% in the last month, the gloom will not last for long. The secular trends in the U.S. cannabis industry are too strong to ignore. A recent survey shows that marijuana consumption in the U.S. has increased by 56% as compared to 2018. With the ongoing state-level legalization of medical and recreational marijuana, the stigma around marijuana usage is on a decline.
On April 19, the House of Representatives passed the SAFE Banking Act. If the bill is passed by the Senate and signed by President Biden, U.S. banks and credit unions will be able to work with licensed cannabis producers without risking penalties. Access to capital will dramatically improve the financial prospects of the U.S. MSOs.
On April 1, New York became the 17th U.S. state to legalize recreational marijuana. Although sales will not start before 2022, Cresco seems well-positioned to leverage this opportunity, considering it already has four retail Sunnyside locations in the state.
Cresco Labs has strategically created a presence in 10 states, which together account for 63% of the U.S. marijuana addressable market. The company has also taken advantage of economies of scale by focusing more on large-scale marijuana cultivation and wholesale distribution. The success of these strategies is reflected in the company's solid financial performance. In fiscal 2020 (ended Dec. 31, 2020), the company's revenue jumped over 271% year over year to $476.3 million, while adjusted EBITDA was up 7.4% year over year to $116 million.
Against the backdrop of solid structural trends and robust fundamentals, Cresco Labs can prove to be an extremely attractive addition to the retail investors' portfolio.

Berkeley, CALIFORNIA, April 24 (Reuters) - A unit of Samsung C&T Corp 028260.KS is considering developing solar power plants worth $673 million in the U.S. state of Texas, aiming to sell the electricity generated starting December 2023, documents reviewed by Reuters showed.
The plants will be located in Milam county, the documents showed, less than two hours' drive from Austin where affiliate Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS has a chip factory and is considering building another at a cost of $17 billion.
Construction of the solar plants will begin in June 2022 and will result in a combined capacity of about 700 megawatts, the documents showed.
A Samsung C&T official told Reuters that Samsung Renewable Energy is ""proceeding with approval procedures with the state"".
There are no current discussions with Samsung Electronics about the project, for which Samsung C&T aims to attract investment, said the official.
The appeal of solar and wind power is growing quickly as countries worldwide transition from fossil fuels to cleaner renewable sources of power to help slow global warming.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration wants all of the country's power to come from non-carbon-emitting sources such as nuclear and renewable energy by 2035.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Thursday pledged to end new financing for overseas coal projects and said he would soon set an ambitious schedule for slashing carbon emissions.

2021-04-24 00:00:00+00:00,Corsair Gaming Makes a Smart Move to Woo PC Gamers,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/corsair-gaming-makes-a-smart-move-to-woo-pc-gamers-2021-04-24,,,"Sales of gaming PCs (personal computers) and related hardware increased in 2020 as people took to video games to keep themselves occupied amid the pandemic. Corsair Gaming (NASDAQ: CRSR) was a big beneficiary of this trend.
The seller of video gaming hardware and peripherals saw a significant spike in revenue and earnings last year, and its shares nearly doubled within two months of its September stock market debut. However, at this point, Corsair is down year-to-date in 2021, and lagging the broader market.
CRSR data by YCharts
The Motley Fool's Evan Niu predicted this volatility because early investors and insiders were expected to unload Corsair stock after the post-IPO lock-up period expired. Investors are also seemingly worried about the shortage of components that held back Corsair's sales in the fourth quarter, as well as about the potential for a reduction in demand for gaming components in a post-pandemic world.
However, the market Corsair operates in is unlikely to lose momentum, and management is taking smart steps to take advantage.

Corsair Gaming is solving a problem for gamers
Corsair recently launched two new prebuilt gaming systems -- the ONE a200 and the ONE i200. Offered with a choice of high-end processors from AMD and Intel, these gaming PCs will be powered by an NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) RTX 3080 graphics processing unit. The systems are already available in North America, the EU, and the U.K., and will later be sold in additional regions as well.
Gaming enthusiasts could start snapping up these gaming PCs due in part to the acute shortage of graphics cards and other components. Top-tier GPUs are either out of stock or are available only for substantially inflated prices. The NVIDIA RTX 3080, for example, was going for close to $2,200 last month, as compared to its suggested retail price of $699. Similarly, due to strong demand and tight supply, AMD's Ryzen 9 5900X, which has a retail price of $575 on the manufacturer's website, is being listed at around $850 by the best-priced third-party sellers on Amazon.
The ONE a200 priced at $3,799 has 32GB of RAM (random access memory), 1 TB of solid-state drive storage, and 2 TB of hard-disk drive storage. It also comes with Corsair's liquid cooling system. These components would cost a consumer upwards of $400 on the market, and we haven't included the costs of other components such as the motherboard, the power supply, and the Windows license. So, Corsair's new gaming systems look like a good deal as they start at $3,599 and are equipped with high-end parts.
Citing third-party estimates, Corsair points out that 51% of global gaming PCs are priced at more than $1,800. Jon Peddie Research estimates that consumers spent $18.5 billion on high-end PCs last year. The firm also points out that prebuilt, branded systems such as the ones Corsair is offering accounted for nearly two-thirds of the overall gaming PC market in 2019. All of this suggests that there is plenty of room for growth in Corsair's biggest business unit this year and beyond.
The financial impact
The attractive pricing of Corsair's new systems could give them a sales edge, as gaming enthusiasts will be able to save on the time, effort, and extra money required to assemble a PC on their own. NVIDIA estimates that the GPU supply shortage could last through 2021. If getting high-end components remains a problem for retail customers, sales of prebuilt PCs could be stronger than expected.
This bodes well for Corsair's gaming components and systems business, which registered 45% revenue growth in 2020 to $1.16 billion and produced nearly 69% of the company's top line. Also, the segment's performance is likely to remain strong over the long run. Third-party forecasters anticipate that shipments of gaming PCs will grow by 25% from last year's level by 2024.
Corsair Gaming is trading at 28 times trailing earnings and 17 times forward earnings after its recent pullback. So investors looking to add a video gaming stock to their portfolios should take a good look at this company, as it's solving an important problem for customers during a period of high demand for gaming PCs.

Nonetheless, even though investors classify both as semiconductor stocks, Intel specializes in central processing units (CPUs), while Micron makes memory chips. This difference affects how each stock responds to the market forces and could make one of these stocks the clear choice for a long-term investment.
Image source: Getty Images.
Intel
Intel remains a prominent player in the CPU market. For all of the recent focus on AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), Intel generated nearly eight times as much revenue in 2020, $77.9 billion versus just $9.8 billion for AMD.
Still, as AMD took a technical lead in the market, Intel lost much of its prestige. The company that makes AMD's processors, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), has built a leadership position in producing 7nm chips, a feat Intel cannot yet match. Intel had even turned to TSMC in some cases to produce chips.
However, former CTO Pat Gelsinger returned to the company to take the CEO position. Unlike his predecessor, Gelsinger has an engineering background and helped to design the 80486 processor. Additionally, Gelsinger expressed an interest in reviving Intel's foundries. This could play into Intel's hands as industry observers grow concerned about the lack of production growth within the United States. The U.S. produces just under 13% of the world's semiconductors.
When Intel led the chip industry, it worked on two-year ""tick-tock"" cycles. This means Intel would improve the chip-building process in the tick years and make upgrades in the tock years. In recent years, Intel slowed this cycle while AMD tackled development and upgrades simultaneously. Now, Intel may have to follow or surpass AMD in this area to compete. Additionally, chip development cycles typically take three to five years. Hence, investors will not know anytime soon whether Gelsinger's turnaround efforts will succeed.
Gelsinger will also have to drive more revenue growth. Revenue increased 8% in fiscal 2020 on higher demand for chips during the pandemic. Still, net income fell by 1% as Intel paid an additional $1.2 billion in taxes compared with the previous year. Furthermore, revenue fell 1% in the fourth quarter compared with Q4 2019. As a result, rising operating expenses and taxes led to quarterly net income falling 15% during that period.
This may explain the meager 5% growth in Intel stock over the last year. At a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 13, it also significantly lags AMD's 40 earnings multiple. Still, even amid troubles, Intel stock has doubled in the last five years. If it can foster a comeback and match AMD's P/E ratio, it could experience a considerable surge higher.
INTC data by YCharts
Micron
At first glance, the question of whether to consider Micron Technology stock a buy appears obvious. Memory chip prices shot upward amid a pandemic that brought about higher chip demand and foundry shutdowns. This has sent Micron surging higher as the chip shortage continues.
Moreover, Micron is one of only three companies in the world to produce DRAM memory chips, which make up 68% of Micron's revenue. Most of its remaining revenue comes from the NAND, or flash chip, market. Many more companies compete in the NAND market, including Intel.
Higher memory chip demand helped Micron grow its revenue by 21% in the first six months of 2021 compared with the first six months of 2020. During that period, net income rose by 54% as the company limited the growth in operating expenses to 5%.
However, investors who focus only on the last six months miss a 25-year trend in Micron stock. Micron tends to grow in times of high memory prices. Conversely, when memory prices crash, Micron stock has historically plunged on lower profits or outright losses. As a result, Micron lost 35% of its value between 1996 and 2016.
Admittedly, the trend has become less extreme in recent years. Today, applications such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, the Internet of Things, and other applications rely on memory chips. The fact that the memory market no longer relies on just PCs altered the cycle. Its 710% growth rate over the last five years far surpassed Intel's surge. Now, at about $90 per share, Micron is approaching its highest levels since the dot-com bubble of 2000.
MU data by YCharts
Today, the current P/E ratio stands at around 31. While that places the multiple near 52-week highs, the multiple comes in well below the valuation peak of just above 50 in 2017, indicating the possibility of further upside.
Still, memory prices continue to drive Micron stock. Micron lost about half of its value in 2018 when the crash in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies wiped out demand for memory chips. This took the stock to a single-digit P/E ratio, and given the stock's history, investors should probably approach the current price with caution rather than elation.
Intel or Micron?
Both stocks involve significant risks. Intel could fail to catch up to AMD, and Micron could plunge if chip demand falls. Still, considering the historical behavior of both stocks, Intel looks like the more promising investment decision.
Admittedly, Micron stock dramatically outperformed Intel in recent years. Still, Micron has historically acted as a proxy for memory prices, pointing to a likely stock swoon when memory prices crash. Conversely, Intel supports a low P/E ratio, and the potential downside appears limited. If Gelsinger turns Intel around, the sustainable growth of past decades could return.

Intel's data center group suffered a 20% sales decline compared to the same period last year, more than offsetting an 8% jump in PC-related sales.
Intel has been a key beneficiary of the rapid growth of cloud computing. As cloud giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google have built out cloud capacity, Intel's server chips have been the standard option.
That situation is now starting to change. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is competitive with its EPYC server chips. Graphics chip leader NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) plans to launch an artificial-intelligence (AI) focused ARM-based server chip in 2023. And some big Intel customers are designing their own chips and cutting out the middleman entirely.

There's more going on than increased competition in the server chip market, and it's unclear how much of Intel's decline in data center sales was due to AMD stealing market share. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said during the earnings call that the results for the data center segment were actually slightly better than expected despite the huge drop in revenue.
Part of the problem was that cloud customers bought a lot of chips last year, and those customers are still working through those purchases. ""A lot of that was driven exactly, as you asked in the question, by cloud digestion,"" Gelsinger said in response to an analyst asking about the decline in data center sales.
Intel CFO George Davis pointed to the fact that the first quarter of last year was particularly strong, so the comparison makes the company's results look worse than they really are: ""... more than half of it was just the fact that we're comparing the bottom, what we now believe to be the bottom of the digestion phase, with a very, very strong Q1.""
Davis expects the cloud portion of the data center segment to make a big comeback next quarter: ""... one thing I would add, we're going to see growth in all three of the major areas in data center, but the standout grower in Q2 is going to be cloud.""
...but it probably should be
Intel is still overwhelmingly dominant in the server chip market, but AMD has been clawing back market share ever since it launched its first EPYC chips. AMD shipped 7.1% of x86 server chips in the fourth quarter of 2020, according to Mercury Research as reported by the website Tom's Hardware, up from 4.5% one year prior, and up from just 0.8% three years prior.
AMD has the benefit of manufacturing its chips using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's advanced 7-nanometer (nm) process, while Intel has struggled with its in-house manufacturing for years. Many of Intel's PC chips are still using the company's 14nm process, albeit a heavily optimized version. The company is producing its latest Xeon Scalable server chips on its 10nm process, but only after years of problems and delays. It will be a while still until Intel is producing any chips at volume using its upcoming 7nm process.
On top of the AMD threat, NVIDIA is getting serious about going after more data center spend. While the company's acquisition of ARM Holdings may get shut down by regulators, it has plans to roll out its first data center CPU in 2023. NVIDIA's Grace CPU is aimed at AI workloads specifically, but the company may eventually go after a broader swath of the server chip market.
Intel is still the go-to choice in the data center for CPUs, and at least a portion of this 20% drop in sales was unrelated to increased competition. But there's no denying that AMD is winning market share, and there's no denying that NVIDIA has a decent shot at capturing a meaningful portion of the server chip market in the coming years. Intel should be very worried about its most lucrative business.

2021-04-24 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Intel Stock Crashed After a Great Q1 Report,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-intel-stock-crashed-after-a-great-q1-report-2021-04-24,,,"At first glance, semiconductor-giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) did everything right in the first quarter of 2021. The company delivered earnings of $1.39 per share on sales of $18.6 billion, blowing past Wall Street's consensus estimates of $1.15 per share and $17.9 billion. The company also raised its full-year earnings outlook just above the analyst view, and Intel's revenue targets consistently landed slightly ahead of the Street.
Results like these typically send share prices skyward, but Intel's stock was down 7% in Friday's early market action. The bearish market makers had their reasons, of course. Here's why Intel shares dropped despite those mighty fine first-quarter results.
Image source: Getty Images.
Soft guidance
First and foremost, Intel's guidance for the next quarter came in below expectations. Management sees second-quarter earnings stopping near $1.05 per share, which is below the Street's current consensus of $1.09 per share. That small slip-up is enough to spark a bearish attitude among the more short-sighted investors and analysts out there.
Trouble in paradise
Intel's first-quarter results were not uniformly impressive. Datacenter sales fell 20% year over year to $5.6 billion, suggesting that arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) may be stealing market share in this crucial sector. Any weakness here also opens the door for NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) to find a foothold with its recently announced data center processors.
This is a continuation of trends seen in recent quarters, but Intel bears can point to this weakness in support of their negative analyses of the company and its stock.
Image source: Getty Images.
Why I'm not worried
As an Intel shareholder, I actually saw many reasons to applaud this report.
Week-by-week business trends indicate that the data center weakness has peaked and should return to growth in the next quarter.
The well-documented manufacturing issues that kept Intel from dominating the 7-nanometer processor generation are reaching an end. Intel is taping out early designs for its first 7-nanometer CPU, scheduled for market debut in 2023.
Intel is hiring thousands of engineers and investing billions of dollars in infrastructure and research and development efforts, all to reignite the company's storied culture of innovation. This is an expensive but important step that sets the stage for stronger business results in the long run.
""It's amazing to be back at Intel, and Intel is back,"" CEO Pat Gelsinger said on the earnings call. ""You can feel the energy inside of Intel, the passion to innovate, and the drive that made us great.""
Let me also remind you that Intel's financial targets for the full year were respectable, and the stock is falling today due to an unreasonable focus on short-term challenges. If anything, I'm tempted to buy more Intel stock at these lower prices. Maybe you should, too.

The market has been all over the place this week. After stocks looked fatigued, we had a routine dip. As bulls were buying that dip and stocks were rotating higher, a midday jolt on Thursday rattled investors. After a night to ponder, bulls were back to buying stocks on Friday. With all of that in mind, let’s look at a few top stock trades for Monday.
Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Snap (SNAP)

Click to Enlarge

Snap (NYSE:SNAP) had a great post-earnings reaction in early trading, with a nice pop to the upside after solid results. But investors have sold those results. That would be less concerning if the market was performing poorly on the day.
But the market — and tech specifically — is not performing poorly. So it’s a bit discouraging to see investors sell the rally in Snap. That said, the dip didn’t do much technical damage.
I will like Snap more on a move over $60, allowing it to clear this cluster of moving averages. Above that puts stout resistance in play near $65. If we can get a move over $60, then perhaps the stock can challenge the $70 to $73 area and the all-time highs.

On the downside, however, a close below the 100-day moving average likely puts a weekly-down scenario in play. If that unfolds, $48 to $50 could be on the table.
Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Intel (INTC)

Click to Enlarge

While semiconductor stocks are trading well on Friday, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is not. However, it’s bouncing right where it needs to.
Shares tested right down to the March low and the 100-day moving average. These levels acted as support, allowing shares to bounce. Keep an eye on this level, near $57.90.
A close below this mark puts it below the 100-day moving average and gives traders a monthly-down rotation. That opens up $55 and the 200-day moving average.
On the upside, though, look for a move over $60. That’s followed by a potential gap-fill up toward $62.25.
Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Honeywell (HON)

Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is enduring a modest dip on Friday, after the company reported earnings before the open.
After a nice push to new all-time highs, shares are dipping down to the 21-day moving average. With buyers stepping in, look to see if they can push this back above the 10-day moving average and over $232.
That opens the door the 161.8% extension near $235. From there, who knows, perhaps $250-plus is in play.
On the downside, however, a break of Friday’s low — also putting shares below the 21-day moving average — puts the $216 to $218  zone on the table. That puts Honeywell back into the prior breakout level, uptrend support and the 10-week and 50-day moving averages.

I would expect a bounce from this area should we get there.
Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Inovio Pharmaceuticals (INO)

Inovio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:INO) puked all over the rug this morning, and a hangover on Monday is possible.
On Wednesday and Thursday, INO stock was perking up as it tried to break out of its downtrend. However, the 10-week moving average rejected it yesterday and today it plunged.
Shares burst below critical support between $8.25 and $8.75.
While it’s bouncing from Friday’s low, keep these areas in mind. That is, the prior support zone and Friday’s low.
A break of Friday’s low could put lower prices in play. A rally back to prior support needs to be reclaimed if bulls want to regain control. Look for this telling signal: Does prior support become resistance?

The Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) was the big beneficiary on Friday afternoon, rising more than 1.5% as of 2:30 p.m. EDT and approaching all-time record highs.
Earnings are driving a lot of the excitement within the investment community on Friday. One industry that doesn't always get much attention from Nasdaq investors is the financial sector, but one hot prospect in banking gave investors a nice surprise. Meanwhile, semiconductor stocks generally performed well, but Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) wasn't able to join its peers after its quarterly report left shareholders with some unanswered questions.
Bank on SVB
SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ: SIVB) was a big winner on the Nasdaq Friday, rising 10% in mid-afternoon trading. The parent company of Silicon Valley Bank had a strong financial report that raised hopes for a full recovery for the U.S. economy and the tech industry in particular.
Image source: Getty Images.
SVB Financial reported a 37% rise in net income during the first quarter compared to the year-ago period. Average loans jumped 11.5% during the quarter, while total client funds were up more than 16% on a nearly 20% rise in deposits on SVB's balance sheet. SVB saw gains both from net interest income and from fee-based charges.
CEO Greg Becker called the period SVB's best quarter ever, pointing to continued growth and profitability, and improving economic outlooks for future gains. Becker dramatically boosted SVB's expectations for 2021 growth, and the bank has aggressively raised capital to give it the ability to take advantage of expansion opportunities to broaden the scope of its business.
SVB Financial's geographical proximity to Silicon Valley has always given it outsized exposure to the innovation economy. As long as tech companies are moving full speed ahead, SVB should be able to participate in their success.
Intel has a chip on its shoulder
Intel, however, didn't fare as well. After releasing its first-quarter financial results, the chipmaker's stock was down almost 6% on Friday afternoon.
Intel's numbers showed a mixed picture. Revenue was flat from year-ago levels on an adjusted basis. Substantial gains in the client-computing, Internet of Things, mobility, and programmable solutions areas were offset by a 20% drop in segment revenue from the data center group. Adjusted earnings were down 1% year over year. Both sales and earnings figures were better than the company's guidance from January.
Unfortunately, even upgraded guidance from Intel didn't paint a very pretty picture. Intel still sees adjusted revenue moving lower by 1% in 2021 despite a $500 million boost in its projected top line. Similarly, a $0.05 per share boost to earnings figures to $4.60 per share still leaves Intel's bottom line down 10% from 2020 levels.
Intel has been under pressure for quite a while despite an increasingly favorable environment for semiconductor chip manufacturers broadly. The fact that other companies in the industry saw their share prices rise substantial points to the ongoing troubles that Intel has -- and the potential for its rivals to take over Intel's business slowly but surely as time goes on.

April 23 (Reuters) - Intel Corp's INTC.O shares fell 7% on Friday as Wall Street analysts raised concerns about how soon the chipmaker can close the gap with rivals as it spends billions of dollars to increase manufacturing.
In recent years, Intel has struggled with building new manufacturing technology causing it to fall behind rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O in the race to make smaller chips with a faster processing speed.
Patrick Gelsinger, who returned to the company as CEO this year, has announced plans to spend as much as $20 billion to build two factories and open its factories to other chip makers and advance chip manufacturing capacity.
""There are significant issues that must be overcome if this is to be a success, with investment ahead of time and profits unlikely until after 2025 if not later,"" Atlantic Equities analyst Ianjit Bhatti said.
""In the near term (2-3 years), we do not believe that Intel has an answer to AMD's market share gains.""
On Thursday, Intel announced its second-quarter profit forecast that fell short of analysts' average expectation. The company's Chief Financial Officer George Davis told Reuters that the lower profits were because the company was investing in ramping up its new 10-nanometer and 7-nanonmeter manufacturing technologies.
Gelsinger has also announced plans to make chips for car plants at its factories to help alleviate a global chip shortage that has hit the automotive industry.
Analysts were largely on the sidelines; 26 of the 40 covering the stock have a ""hold"" or lower rating. Fourteen analysts have a ""buy"" or higher rating on the stock. The current median price target on the stock is $65, as per Refinitiv data.
""The shortage...is going to require spending on a mammoth scale for chipmakers. Spending that Intel can ill-afford as it attempts to reclaim its title as the most valuable chipmaker in the U.S.,"" said Samuel Indyk, senior analyst at uk.Investing.com.

2021-04-23 00:00:00+00:00,Why Intel Stock Dropped After Its Earnings Beat,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-stock-dropped-after-its-earnings-beat-2021-04-23,,,"What happened
Semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) beat on earnings last night, reporting $1.39 per share in pro forma profit on $19.7 billion in revenue, easily surpassing analyst projections for $1.15 per share in profits and $17.9 billion in sales.
But Intel stock is down today, falling 6.7% as of 10 a.m. EDT. Why is that?
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Well, for one thing, although Intel ""beat estimates"" in the first quarter of 2021, its numbers still weren't great. Revenue declined 1% year over year, and while pro forma profit was $1.39 per share, when calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Intel's profit was only $0.82 per share, down 37% from last year's Q1.
Gross profit margin declined 540 basis points to 55.2% as Intel lost sales to data centers and replaced them with lower-margin PC sales. Research and development spending increased, resulting in operating profit margins getting cut nearly in half to 18.8%.
Now what
Worse than that, Intel kind of took the wind out of its own sales by pairing news of an earnings beat in Q1 with an earnings warning for the second quarter and beyond. Management forecast that in Q2, sales will decline to about $18.9 billion, which is below Wall Street's estimates. Earnings guidance for $1.05 per share likewise looks likely to fall short of the Street's projected $1.09 per share.
Similarly for the full year, Intel projected revenue will not exceed $77 billion, which appears to be slightly less than analysts were looking for. Pro forma profits might eke out a win if they reach Intel's projected $4.60 per share. (Wall Street forecasts only $4.58.) But GAAP profits will once again fall short of that number, with Intel promising only $4 per share.
Long story short, an earnings beat paired with an earnings warning is not the right way to make a stock go up -- and Intel shares are suffering for it.

PARIS/BERLIN, April 23 (Reuters) - European industry chief Thierry Breton will hold discussions with the chief executive of chipmaker Intel INTC.O and a top executive of Taiwanese competitor TMSC on April 30, as the EU seeks to shield itself from shocks in the global supply chain.
Breton will meet Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger in Brussels next Friday and will also hold a video conference with Maria Marced, President of TMSC Europe 2330.TW, on the same day, the European Commissioner said.
""Increasing our autonomy does not mean isolating ourselves in a world where supply chains are global,"" Breton told Reuters.
""In parallel to exploring how we can increase Europe's capacity... we will continue to build bridges with international partners - but with us in the driving seat,"" he added, confirming the meetings.
Sources in Brussels say Breton is keen to attract a leading chipmaker to site a major fabrication plant in the EU that would help realise the Commission's ambition of gaining access to the most advanced production over the next decade.
Gelsinger, new in the job, has announced his intent to build a 'fab' in Europe as part of a strategy reset in which Intel would launch a foundry - or contract manufacturing - division and invest billions in new capacity.
Yet, the Brussels sources say, Breton is keener to reel in TSMC, which is the undisputed industry leader and has a better command of the most advanced manufacturing processes.
Analysts caution that siting a major plant in Europe could prove to be a strategic blunder because the continent - which doesn't produce smartphones and other consumer electronics that require state-of-the-art processors - lacks a viable market.

2021-04-23 00:00:00+00:00,Why AMD Stock Popped After Intel's Earnings Beat,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amd-stock-popped-after-intels-earnings-beat-2021-04-23,,,"What happened
Shares of rising Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) rival and fellow semiconductors giant Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) popped in early trading on the Nasdaq Friday, the first day after Intel's disappointing Q1 2021 earnings report. AMD's shares were up 4.14% as of 11:10 a.m. EDT.
So what
Intel, if you haven't heard, actually beat on its Q1 earnings. Despite sales declining 1% year over year, the company managed to report a pro forma profit of $1.39 per share, which was ahead of analyst expectations.
Regardless, Intel reported a steep 540 basis point decline in its gross margin to 55.2%, and it saw its operating margin cut nearly in half as the company spent heavily to race to catch up to its rivals in advanced computer chips. Analysts at Citigroup commented yesterday that Intel stock appears to be close to its peak valuation and is likely to decline as investors acclimate to the new environment in which Intel is losing, not gaining, market share.
And the reason this is good news for AMD is that, according to Citi at least, it's AMD that's taking that market share away from Intel.

Now what
So what's an investor to do with all this information?
At a valuation of just 13.6 times trailing earnings, Intel stock certainly looks like a relative bargain when compared with AMD stock, which trades at 38.4 times earnings. But AMD has a cash-rich balance sheet, versus Intel that's carrying $13.5 billion in net debt. And analysts see Intel's earnings growing only 10% annually over the next five years, while AMD is pegged for 29.5% annualized earnings growth, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data.
Intel may look like a value stock right now, but it's AMD that's got all the momentum.

At a Virtual CEO Summit on Semiconductor and Supply Chain Resilience earlier this month, President Joe Biden said the U.S. needed to focus on investing in its chip “infrastructure” to address an ongoing shortage of semiconductors in the U.S.
It was music to the ears for several industries badly hit by the immediate crisis, which has affected key industries like consumer electronics, pharmaceuticals and auto manufacturing. White House officials conducted meetings with 20 chief executives.
“These chips, these wafers … batteries, broadband — it’s all infrastructure. We need to build the infrastructure of today and not repair the one of yesterday,” the 46th president of the United States said during the meeting. “The plan I propose will protect our supply chain and revitalize American manufacturing.”
Out of all the industries hit by the shortage of semiconductors, the auto sector has had to weather the hardest blows. General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F) could collectively lose $4.5 billion this year due to the semiconductors shortage.
The positive thing is that Biden has been aggressive in building out capacity to address the crisis. The White House’s $2 trillion infrastructure bill has a $50 billion component for the semiconductor industry.
Biden’s plan to devote billions from the American Jobs Plan to chip production is to boost manufacturing capacity at home since the country is reliant on Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China for semiconductors at the moment.

7 Retail Stocks With E-commerce Locked In
Semiconductors stocks, against this backdrop, are primed to do very well moving forward. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) has eked out a 1.58% gain over the past month as the chip shortage has moved to center stage.
We have picked seven companies that you should consider a position in if you want to play this red hot space.
Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX)
Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)
Brooks Automation (NASDAQ:BRKS)
Semiconductors Stocks: Lam Research (LRCX)

Lam Research is one of the biggest players in semiconductor equipment. Based in Fremont, California, the company is involved in the design, production, marketing, and service of semiconductor processing equipment used to fabricate integrated circuits.
The company has excellent fundamentals and a strong balance sheet. The bottom line and the top line of the semiconductor company have increased 34.9% and 15.4%, respectively, in the last five years. All of the major operating metrics, including gross margin, operating margin, net margin, return on assets, return on equity, and ROIC, are strong and have outperformed the S&P 500 index and the industry, as of the last reporting date.
Moving forward, the U.S. is pushing toward greater onshore fabrication. From its physical base in California, Lam Research stands to benefit from this pivot to the U.S. from Asia.
With $6 billion in cash against $5 billion in debt, the company also has a solid base to invest in manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Those operations only accounted for 4% of 2020 Q4 revenues, but that may change. China, Korea, and Taiwan made up 73% of revenues for the same period.
LRCX stock is up 9.73% over the past month.
Teradyne (TER)

Teradyne is an American automatic test equipment designer and manufacturer. Although it has several segments, the company’s biggest revenue contributor is semiconductor testing.
Teradyne tests approximately 50% of all semiconductors worldwide. So, no surprises that out of total revenues of $759 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, $524 million was due to semiconductor testing.

In the last 12 quarters, the North Reading, Massachusetts-based company beat Wall Street analysts’ consensus earnings estimates every time. Most recently, in the fourth quarter, the company reported an EPS of $1.10 per share, rising 25% year-over-year from the figure of 88 cents last year and beating the $1.01 consensus of the 17 analysts tracking the company.
Revenue of $759 million in Q4 2020 grew by 16% from Q4 2019. For the full year, EPS jumped 62%, and revenues increased by 36%. Gross profit and operating profit margins stand at 57.2% and 29.3%, both better than the industry average and S&P 500.
TER stock is up 7.96% over the past month.
Intel (INTC)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Intel stock saw a substantial drop in 2020, lagging behind the broader semiconductor industry. INTC lost 16.1% in the year compared to a 49.8% increase in SOXX.
The company has also lost the top position among chipmakers as measured by market capitalization. The fact isn’t lost on its major investors. activist hedge fund Third Point has a $1 billion stake in Intel.
Last year, Third Point Chief Executive Daniel Loeb went after the company, arguing it needs to change in the interest of national security. He urged Intel to sell some of its acquisitions and divide design and manufacturing to take advantage of cost synergies.
Intel is aware of these issues. Supply challenges are a serious challenge that the U.S. firms need to maintain their pole positions within their industry. Intel is planning to spend $20 billion on two new chip factories in Arizona.
One thing to note here is that the company is focused on maintaining a strong U.S. presence instead of outsourcing advanced chip manufacturing to Taiwan and South Korea. That will pay dividends with the strong “Made in the USA” push that President Biden is focusing on.
One can understand the frustrations of major investors. But everyday investors should put faith in Intel’s strategy. Plus, in a red-hot investing space, the fact that shares are trading at 13.9 times forward price-to-earnings makes INTC stock one of my favorite semiconductors names out there. As a comparison, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are trading at 45.5 times and 41.2 times, respectively. (See below)
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are the two most prominent players in the semiconductors space. In the last five years, AMD has outperformed the S&P 500 by 2,809.1% and its sector by 2,658.6%. Meanwhile, the technology sector exceeded the market by 150.4% during the same period.
The momentum is not expected to stop anytime soon. AMD’s next-generation EPYC processor will keep chomping away market share from Intel and others in the industry.
As we discussed in the previous section, AMD, and other companies that rely on outsourcing, have cost advantages over companies like Intel that focus on domestic supply. Intel could benefit in the long run from this approach due to the national security aspect of the debate. But for now, AMD will have a better bottom line.

On April 15, Raymond James initiated coverage on AMD stock with an “outperform” rating and a $100 price target, 26% upside from the recent $79.27 close. AMD’s “durable technical advantage” over Intel and increasing server business is the basis of its bullish view.
The only thing going against the stock is valuation. However, it’s such a strong performer; you can rest easy with this one in your portfolio since the trajectory is generally upward.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia is a specialized semiconductor manufacturer that operates in two segments. Although it has grown its software sales, the company’s day-to-day operations are dominated by semiconductor designs.
Much like AMD, NVDA stock has done incredibly well over the last five years, beating the S&P 500 by 1,486.2% and its sector by 1,335.8%. Much of that has to do with its excellent operating performance. It has beaten Wall Street estimates 11 times out of the last 12.
Nvidia’s main concern in the interim will be maintaining their supply chains during the current chip shortage. Demand will continue to be high for its graphics cards and mobile processors in 2021 and beyond. Hence, this is not a company that you should worry about when it comes to either top line or bottom line growth.
Qualcomm (QCOM)

Qualcomm stock is down 19% in the last three months. It’s one of the hardest hit companies in the sector due to the chip shortage. The fabless semiconductor company depends on third parties to produce its chips and is struggling to keep pace with the shortage.
Nevertheless, the company remains an excellent performer. And is poised to become one of the biggest winners of the global 5G upgrade cycle.

Qualcomm’s diversified product portfolio and positive tailwinds will continue to power the stock for several more years. All of its major operating metrics are very strong, and the company has beat expectations in 10 out of the last 12 quarters.
With QCOM stock trading at a discount, there’s more incentive to buy in to this one.
Brooks Automation (BRKS)

Brooks Automation is focused on automation solutions for several purposes and markets. It has two segments, and one is principally engaged in the semiconductor business. Among other products, the Massachusetts company manufactures wafer handling robotics for the semiconductor sector.
In the last five years, the company’s top line has increased 11.4%. According to data tracked by Refinitiv, analysts are forecasting revenue growth of 18.7% and 30.1% in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
Relative to the S&P 500 baseline, BRKS stock has surpassed the S&P 500 by 776.7% and its sector by 626.3% in the last five years. Since its price momentum is excellent at the moment, I would wait for a dip before buying this one.

However, shares of the tech giant dipped 2.8% in Thursday’s extended trading session after closing 1.8% lower on the day.
Intel (INTC) reported 1Q adjusted earnings of $1.39 per share, down 1% on a year-over-year basis but handily beat the Street's estimates of $1.15 per share. Revenue remained flat at $18.6 billion but topped analysts’ expectations of $17.86 billion. Notably, both EPS and revenue exceeded the company’s guidance provided in January.
The company’s Client Computing Group (CCG) segment, Internet of Things Group (IOTG), and Mobileye recorded 8%, 4%, and 48% year-over-year jumps in revenues. Additionally, PC unit volumes surged 38% and notebook volumes set a new record.
Meanwhile, Data Center Group (DCG) recorded a 20% decline in revenue but witnessed an initial recovery of Enterprise and Government sales.
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said, “The response to our new IDM 2.0 strategy has been extraordinary, our product roadmap is gaining momentum, and we’re rapidly progressing our plans with re-invigorated focus on innovation and execution.” (See Intel stock analysis on TipRanks)
For 2Q, the company projects adjusted revenue of $17.8 billion, higher than the consensus estimate of $17.55 billion. Moreover, non-GAAP earnings is expected to be $1.05 per share, versus analysts’ expectations of $1.09.

Following the 1Q results, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $72 (15% upside potential), along with adjusting estimates for the June quarter, 2021, and 2022.
Rakesh believes “INTC is well positioned, with ~$10B+ of FCF/year, ~2% dividend yield, 10nm ramp, better availability on Ice Lake for hyperscale/Enterprise versus tight supply at AMD/TSMC, and INTC entering a new ~$100B TAM by 2025 foundry market.”
Overall, the stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 11 Buys, 10 Holds, and 7 Sells. The average analyst price target of $67.52 implies almost 8% upside potential from current levels. Shares have increased 26% so far this year.

Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you for my firstearnings call I consider it an honor to be CEO of this great company.
Thanks for joining today. Intel delivered a strong Q1 that beat our January guide on both the top and bottom line, driven by exceptional demand for our products and exquisite execution by our team. We shipped a record volume of notebook CPUs. We launched new competitive Intel Core and Xeon processors.
Mobileye had its best quarter ever. With tremendous industry support, we unveiled our IDM 2.0 strategy, setting a bold new course for technology leadership at Intel. The response from employees, partners, and customers has been incredible. Our teams are reinvigorated, innovating, and executing.
It's amazing to be back at Intel, and Intel is back. Before George takes you through the financial details of the quarter, I'll begin with the industry trends we're seeing and why Intel is well-positioned to aggressively capitalize on them. Said simply, Intel is the only company with the depth and breadth of software, silicon, and platforms and packaging and process with at-scale manufacturing that customers can depend on for their next-generation innovations. There are four superpowers driving digital transformation: cloud, connectivity, artificial intelligence, and the intelligent edge.
Intel's mission, and we are uniquely positioned to do so, is to help customers harness these superpowers to improve the lives of every human on the planet. The digitization of everything was markedly accelerated by COVID and has spurred innovation and new models of working, learning, interacting, and care. Technology is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence, and semiconductors are the foundation. This is creating a cycle of explosive growth in semiconductors that will result in sustained growth for a decade or more.
The PC ecosystem, in particular, is experiencing a resurgence. This remote work and learning dynamics of COVID led to more PC shipments in 2020 than at any point since 2012, and that's continuing. 2021 is shaping up to be the largest PC market ever. In fact, we shipped more notebook CPUs in Q1 than in any other quarter in our history.
Total platform unit volumes were up well over 30% in the first quarter. In many markets, one PC in every home is no longer enough. The number of PCs per household, what we call PC density, is increasing. We are seeing strong growth in education where, on a global basis, the number of PCs per 100 students and teachers still remains in the single digits.
Every student needs a laptop, and we have a long way to go. In addition, there are over 400 million PCs running Windows 10 that are over four years old today, which is an enormous PC refresh opportunity. Intel is leading this rejuvenation of the PC with marketing, user experience, and purpose-built innovation at the software, silicon, and platform level. We shipped Tiger Lake-H for notebooks and Rocket Lake for desktops, and customer reception has been enthusiastic.
As a sign of our improving execution, we qualified Tiger Lake-H ahead of schedule in 10 nanometers, and we expect 10-nanometer unit volumes to cross over 14 nanometers in the second half of the year. Our Intel Evo platform gives buyers the very best mobile experience, and we're deepening our ecosystem engagement with partners, including Microsoft, Google, and Samsung to advance the PC experience in new, innovative ways. We see no signs of PC demand slowing and believe the industry will return to shipping more than 1 million units a day. With over 100 million Xeon servers in the installed base, the world runs on Intel.
Building on that foundation, we recently launched our most advanced high-performance data center platform optimized to power the industry's broadest range of workloads from the cloud to the network to the intelligent edge. At the heart of this is our new third-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor codenamed Ice Lake, which offers nearly 50% gen-over-gen performance improvements across a range of workloads. We are already shipping Ice Lake to more than 30 customers, including major cloud providers, communication service providers, enterprise and HPC customers. Another trend driving demand for more and more optimized computing performance is the infusion of artificial intelligence and machine learning into nearly every application.
As the only x86 datacenter CPU with built-in AI acceleration, Ice Lake provides 74% gen-over-gen improvement on AI workloads. And our Habana discrete solutions address the needs of those customers with extreme AI demands in areas like training. Sometimes customers want both. For example, you see San Diego will use Intel Xeon and Habana AI accelerators to power their new Voyager supercomputer.
Mobileye set a new quarterly record. Mobileye's assisted driving technology continues to win over automakers with eight new design wins in Q1. We have programs with 13 of the 15 top automotive OEMs. Mobileye continues to open new categories such as delivery transport with the win at Udelv and is rapidly evolving to power L4 fully autonomous robotaxis beginning next year.
We continue to have extraordinary success winning the next-generation 5G environments. A great example from this quarter is our collaboration with Google Cloud to develop solutions that help communication service providers accelerate 5G deployment across multiple network and edge locations. We're already seeing significant adoption of OneAPI and OneAPI-powered toolkits for high-performance computing, AI, and data analytics. Developers and customers are embracing One API's open standards-based approach for unified programming across architectures and vendors.
This includes leading cloud service providers who are embracing OneAPI at scale. The unprecedented demand for semiconductors has stressed supply chains across the industry. We've doubled our internal wafer capacity in the last few years, but the industry is now challenged by a shortage of foundry capacity, substrates, and components. We expect it will take a couple of years for the ecosystem to make the significant investments to address these shortages.
This fundamental industry challenge underscores the importance of our unique and differentiated IDM 2.0 strategy. IDM 2.0 utilizes our internal factory network to reliably deliver leadership products and provide the industry another source of foundry capacity through our new Intel Foundry Services. Leveraging our IDM advantage, we are working aggressively across our global supply chain to solve substrate shortages to satisfy our customers' surging demand and gain market share. For example, by partnering closely with our suppliers, we are creatively utilizing our internal assembly factory network to remove a major constraint in our substrate supply.
Coming online in Q2, this capability will increase the availability of millions of units in 2021. It's a great example where the IDM model gives us flexibility to address the dynamic market. It's clear the industry and Intel will need more capacity to meet strong future demand, which is why we are dramatically expanding our foundry capability with Intel Foundry Services starting with a $20 billion investment for our first large-scale foundry operations in Arizona. We plan to expand other locations and establish Intel Foundry Services as a major provider of committed foundry capacity in the U.S.
and Europe while ensuring a sustainable and secure semiconductor supply for the world. Since its announcement, the industry response to Intel Foundry Services has already been incredible. We are engaged with well over 50 potential customers today. We're seeing excitement from some of the top technology giants in the world across industry verticals ranging from automotive to high-performance compute and cloud service providers.
We've been responding to and proactively engaging with automotive component suppliers on how we can help them with their supply chains and alleviate shortages in both the near and long term. We're doing our part to address this global supply crisis, but we cannot do it alone. The investment needed at the scale required is immense, and it will require close industry and government partnership to address this need. Governments around the world are recognizing the critical nature of semiconductors and the need to increase advanced chip manufacturing capacity and prepare for the future.
We are encouraged by President Biden's recognition of semiconductor manufacture as a critical component of our national infrastructure and its inclusion along with key research and infrastructure investments in broadband in the American Jobs plan. Looking ahead, we're confident our strategy will drive innovation and technology leadership for Intel. 7 nanometers is progressing well, and IDM 2.0 puts us on a path to restore process performance leadership and build on our industry-leading packaging technologies. With IDM 2.0, we will have superior capacity and supply resilience by leveraging our internal and external capacity and a superior cost structure.
By accelerating our clock rate of innovation, we will deliver leadership products in every category. In the PC business, we will follow the successful launches of Tiger Lake and Rocket Lake with Alder Lake, which is currently sampling and will ship in the second half of this year. Within the next couple of weeks, we'll tape in the compute tile for Meteor Lake, our first 7-nanometer CPU for 2023. In the data center, we will follow the strong ramp of Ice Lake with Sapphire Rapids, which is scheduled to reach production around the end of this year, and ramp in the first half of 2022.
Overall, our 2023 road maps are firm and under execution, and our 2024 and 2025 plans are well under way to provide unquestioned leadership products in every category we participate in. The Intel innovation machine is fired up. Before I pass it to George for the details in the quarter, let me reiterate how excited I am to be back. You can feel the energy inside of Intel, the passion to innovate, and the drive that made us great.
We are reigniting our culture to attract, retain and motivate the best and brightest engineers in the industry. In fact, we've onboarded over 2,000 engineers so far this year, including the recent key hire of Sanjay Natarajan, who will co-lead our logic technology development. In total, we expect to add several thousand more engineers by the end of the year. 2021 is a pivotal year as we lay the foundation of our winning IDM 2.0 strategy and invest in our future to accelerate our trajectory and execution.
Given the incredible demand for computing, the strength of our IDM 2.0 strategy, and the technology investments we're making, I'm certain Intel's best days are in front of us.
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 marked a stronger-than-expected start to the year with both our PC notebook and Mobileye businesses achieving record quarters, when revenue was $18.6 billion, exceeding our guidance by $1.1 billion, led by strength in our PC business and the first signs of recovery in the enterprise and government portion of our data center business. Our IOTG, Mobileye, and PSG businesses also posted strong sequential growth as they began to emerge from an adverse macroeconomic environment driven by COVID. As noted in our January guidance, Q1 revenue includes an approximately $580 million one-time corporate revenue item.
Gross margin for the quarter was 58.4%, exceeding guide by approximately 40 basis points, largely due to flow-through on higher revenue. Q1 EPS was $1.39, up $0.29 versus guide, with the majority of the beat on strong operational performance and the balance on gains related to our ICAP portfolio. Note that these non-GAAP results exclude the impact of a charge related to VLSI litigation that are included in GAAP results. In Q1, we generated $5.5 billion of cash from operations and free cash flow of $1.6 billion.
We repurchased $2.4 billion of shares, completing the $20 billion repurchase plan announced in October 2019. Going forward, we expect to have lower stock repurchases as we enter an investment phase to support strong demand growth in clients, build initial infrastructure for future foundry volumes and make necessary investments to accelerate our return to process leadership. We remain committed to growing the dividend. Moving to segment performance in the quarter.
CCG revenue was up 8% year over year, driven by all-time record notebook unit volumes, up 54% year over year. Increased volume in the consumer entry and education segments resulted in platform ASPs being down 20% year over year. Excluding this upside volume, ASPs were flat year over year. Combined with growth in our WiFi and Thunderbolt connectivity businesses, revenue grew overall in CCG despite the ramp down of our modem and MAX sales and the impact of exiting our connected home division.
Operating income was $4.1 billion, down 2% year over year on higher 10-nanometer mix and increased R&D investment. DCG delivered revenue of $5.6 billion, somewhat above our expectations, but down 20% year over year on a challenging compare. Enterprise and government saw initial recovery with sequential performance above seasonal expectations, while cloud inventory digestion persisted through the quarter as expected. Strong network SoC growth and product mix drove more than half of the 14% year-over-year ASP decline.
DCG operating income in Q1 was down $2.2 billion year over year on lower revenue, transition to 10-nanometer, and increased R&D investment in our Xeon road map. Our intelligent edge businesses were up year over year and quarter over quarter as COVID-related demand impacts began to subside. Specifically, IOTG revenue was up 18% quarter over quarter with strength in retail and industrial segments. Mobileye revenue and operating margin were both all-time records at $377 million and $147 million, respectively.
Mobileye continues to execute well and gain market segment share as the auto industry recovers from pandemic blows. PSG revenue was up 15% quarter over quarter with strength in its communications and embedded segments. Moving to our Q2 and full-year outlook. For Q2, we are guiding revenue of $17.8 billion, down 2% year over year, excluding our NAND business.
We continue to see very strong demand for PCs with fulfillment challenges on industrywide component and substrate shortages. In data center, we believe revenue bottomed in Q1 and will increase in Q2 as cloud digestion impacts begin to subside and enterprise and government momentum continues. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 57%, up approximately 1 point year over year, driven by lower inventory reserves and improved 10-nanometer cost, partially offset by factory start-up costs. We are forecasting EPS of $1.05 per share and a tax rate of 13%.
For full year, we are increasing our guidance provided in March, now forecasting $72.5 billion in revenue, up $500 million from our prior guidance, gross margin of 56.5%, and EPS at $4.60, up $0.05 from our March 23 call. We now expect free cash flow to be $10.5 billion, up $500 million versus prior expectations. We continue to see very strong PC demand with both TAM and our internal PC supply growing double digits year over year. But we expect CCG revenue to be more first half-weighted than normal seasonality due to industrywide supply constraints and the continuing ramp-down of modem and Apple Mac revenue.
In data center, we expect increased demand in the second half as both cloud enterprise and government segments returned to growth. Gross margin percent will be lower in the second half of the year predominantly due to increased 7-nanometer start-up costs and industrywide supply constraints impacting client volume and mix. We expect increased R&D throughout the year as we invest in our road map and IDM 2.0 strategy. As stated in March, this guide is tempered by DCG-related entity list uncertainty and industrywide supply constraints primarily impacting our client, IOTG, and PSG businesses.
We are working closely with our supply chain partners and leveraging our unique IDM capabilities to mitigate these supply constraints, gain market segment share, and outperform this guide. With that, let me turn it back over to Tony and get to your questions.
Tony Balow -- Head of Investor Relations
All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A. As is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask just one question.
Operator, please go ahead and introduce the first caller.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Harlan Sur from J.P. Morgan. You may begin.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Good afternoon and a nice job on the quarterly execution. It was good to see the unveiling of the IDM 2.0 strategy back in March. Was also good to get the 7-nanometer update and continued execution on getting that ramped in 2023. But that's just the point milestone, right? So in order to sustain your technology and performance leadership with the IDM 2.0 strategy, it's going to require the team to maintain a cadence on both internal optimization but also, more importantly, to maintain a cadence of continued node shrinks to 5-nanometer and then ultimately to 3-nanometer.
I think the Intel team had previously articulated node migrations kind of every two, two and a half years. Pat, I think you said a yearly cadence back in March, but I assume that that was internal optimization. But on the move to seven to five, can we expect the team to ramp 5 nanometers two, two and a half years after your 7-nanometer ramp and then 3-nanometer ramp two, two and a half years after 5?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Hey, thank you for the question, Harlan. And overall, as I said on the call, we're seeing very good progress on the 7-nanometer team. You know, they're executing now. We're very confident of the changes that we made on that, right, and the move to really embrace EUV.
And since we've done that, we've just seen superb execution. And as I said, in the Unleashed event, we expect to move to a yearly cadence or better for our process technology. And we're going to be laying that path out very clearly. We're excited about our team's ability to get us back to process parity and ultimately to sustain leadership yet again.
And I'm very happy with the team and some of the investments we're making, the hiring of Sanjay Natarajan that we talked about. Team is getting fired up to execute on that. We also see this is just one piece of our technology leadership strategy. And as we've seen in our IDM 2.0 strategy, it's about packaging.
It's about the process. It's about the full set of IP that we're bringing to the table and at-scale manufacturing. And I will say some of the early enthusiasm that we've seen from some of the foundry customer pipeline is really bringing together our packaging technology with the full IDM 2.0 strategy. So overall, getting back to the heart of your question, exactly.
We are going to increase the cadence of our process technology innovations. We're seeing very positive signs since we made this change, and we're on track to parity and again, sustained leadership out in the future. Our team is firing on all cylinders, and I'm excited about what we're seeing as we monitor those milestones very rigorously going forward. This team's on fire, and we're executing.
Tony Balow -- Head of Investor Relations
Thank you. Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. You may begin.
C.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you for taking the question and I guess a follow-on question, Pat, to your foundry strategy or IDM 2.0 strategy. I get the division of gaining scale by investing for yourselves at the leading edge and then backfilling fully depreciated capacity into '22 down to 10-nanometer nodes over time and the benefit to you guys. But what's the benefit of opening up the business at the leading edge to foundry customers? And how are you going to control folks to redesign to your design? And will you have to subsidize them? Or would that be a subsidy that comes from the U.S.
government? Would love to hear your thoughts there. Thank you.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Overall, let's just paint the picture a little bit more broadly, C.J., and thanks for the question. On the IDM 2.0 strategy, we're all about making leading-edge capacity available for our foundry customers. And the world needs more leading-edge capacity, and there's very few companies that can supply it around the world.
So we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm for that. It's going to cause us to build and expand our capacity more aggressively. And as you suggest, it also means we have a better monetization on the longer life cycle of a foundry business, and we're planning on getting to foundry kind of margins with that investment. Now, as we have already begun engaging with customers, we've seen enthusiasm, right? We've seen enthusiasm that they get to design on our leading process technology, and they have more choices for wherever that might be coming from.
We're also seeing enthusiasm for this idea that they can bring some of their IP and bring our IP to the table. And in particular, some of the cloud customers have been very excited about that ability to say, hey, I can take some of my cool ideas and be better optimized, including things like x86 cores, to have a more optimized solution for their market requirements. This is compelling for them. And then we combine that with all the other strengths that we've talked about such as at-scale manufacturing.
And in the supply constrained environment like we're in right now, boy, that's bringing enthusiasm from customers. Also, we get to do that with all of the other assets that we have with packaging, our software technology. Yes, we think this is a strategy that will be very powerful for the industry. And we've seen that response, early customers, the EDA toolchains, the IP suppliers.
This has really hit the right time in the industry, and we are seeing the international aspects, as well as the government aspect, saying, yes, we need a more geographically dispersed, resilient supply chain for something that's critical to the future of humanity and semiconductor technology. This is the right strategy for the right time, and we're seeing great response from it.
Tony Balow -- Head of Investor Relations
Operator, next question.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the Data Center Group numbers, I guess, both the 20% year-on-year decline in cloud and the 14% decline in platform average selling price. How much of that is just this kind of lingering cloud digestion? And what's your visibility to that resuming? And is there any competitive aspect, do you think, to the weakness there?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll start on that one and ask George to jump in a little bit. Overall, as George said in his comments, Q1 was a little bit better than we expected for DCG in terms of revenue, and we see it improving as we go through the year. So we saw this as the bottom.
A lot of that was driven exactly, as you asked in the question, by cloud digestion. We had an extraordinary last year, and now customers are almost through the digestion of that, and we're starting to see signs that they want to start the next build phase in their cloud. But we also saw some just great successes with the enterprise business starting to pick up. Some of the networking business wins were very strong for our 5G area.
So overall, we believe we're on a path back to growth. I'd also emphasize that the Ice Lake launch, superb, right? This product, major gains in generation, the generation improvement in absolute areas of differentiation like the AI performance. And as I said, this AI is infused now into the 100 million-plus Xeon sockets as we're bringing AI into every one of them. This is a powerful new capability and getting great response from our customers overall.
So we feel very good about the path that we're on. And our overall outlook for the year is that we're going to continue to see that momentum build as we go through the year and expect to see the business response, the competitive position, the customers getting on board. It's an exciting time for our data center business. George, anything you'd add?
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. I would say, really, if you think about the impact year over year in the first quarter, more than half of it was just the fact that we're comparing the bottom, what we now believe to be the bottom of the digestion phase with a very, very strong Q1. The other piece is our investment is going up in this space. This is clearly -- as we make progress on 7-nanometer, you're starting to see 7-nanometer costs reflected that weren't there year over year.
That's a good thing. That gets much better over time. Also, almost on the same scale, we've increased opex to drive the Xeon road map even harder in line with some of the things that Pat was talking about. And then finally, you also have -- this is start-up of the 10-nanometer generation for server, and so you're starting to see the initial cost impacts on that.
We're already seeing very strong 10-nanometer cost improvements in the client side of the business. Some of that's obviously helping DCG today, but it's going to -- they've got some work still to go through as they start to ramp their mix from 14 to 10.
Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Great. And is that -- just to make sure, the 14% decline in platform ASP, was that more mix related toward comms? Or was there something -- is it along any decline like-for-like?
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
It was mix. You've got a lot higher relative mix of SoCs and whatnot in there. You know, when you're down on revenue, all those mix comparisons get tougher and you're down on the strongest margin mix area.
Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon -- Sanford C. Bernstein -- Analyst
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask that question a little more explicitly. So if more than half or about half of whatever of the ASP decline year over year, the 14% in data center, was due to SoC mix and product mix, what would the other half coming from? How much of that is direct ASP decline? And what should we expect on that front as we go into the second half? And how does that tie into the implied gross margin guidance in the second half for the company, which is down something like 250 bps second half versus first half?
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So I think -- let me just clarify, Stacy. So the lower revenue includes the ASP and volume effects compared to what we were seeing in the first quarter of last year. So that's what was over half of it.
I would say the remaining was split between the factory start-up costs that I talked about, higher opex since we're talking about operating margin, and then just the unit cost impact of ramping 10-nanometer relative to what they saw year over year. And when we think about the second half of the year on the overall margin, we think you're going to see some margin impact actually from the supply situation impacting the mix and the volume that we're going to see out of client, again, the 7-nanometer start-up costs ramp throughout the year. So that's probably the next biggest factor and then a little bit offset by the fact that we're going to see server start to recover.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes. And overall, Stacy, I'd just add, it's about building leadership products. Ice Lake is a great product, and we're seeing a strong ramp for it. As the products get better, ASPs will get better, and we're going to be very aggressive in terms of market share in this area.
So we feel like we're now very much on the front foot again in this business, and we're starting to see the market respond that way. And with some of the things that we've talked about with Ice Lake, in particular, and our Sapphire Rapids program following up, we're on a good competitive dynamic, and we're leaning into this area of our business, and we're seeing great response from our customers.
Stacy Rasgon -- Sanford C. Bernstein -- Analyst
Can you define what you mean by aggressive on market share?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Exactly that, aggressive on market share. We're going to fight for every socket in the market. This is an area that is core to our business. We're going to be aggressive.
We've just delivered a great new product for it. We're going to be using our system design, our validation, our software assets. Our customer relationships, our supply chain, everything that we can to bring value to our customers, right? They are looking for us building on that 100 million installed base of servers that we have now. This is a great business and one that we're going to be very aggressive in bringing the best things to our customers.
And I'd also say, Stacy, that as you think about this business, this is an area that, with our cloud partners, our IDM 2.0 strategy is powerful because now we're saying to them not only are we going to be building better and better products for you in this area, but we're also going to be co-designing, co-innovating and bringing new capabilities for them to optimize solutions for their markets as well. Yes, we're going to be aggressive in the data center and cloud business going forward.
Operator
And John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sir, your line is open.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Can you guys hear me?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Thank you, John.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Hey, sorry about that. Pat, just sticking on the theme of data center and the cloud business. Can you help us understand why you're comfortable that this is digestion and not something more like cloud guys going to more internal solutions or solutions away from Intel? And I sort of asked the question because cloud was down about 15% year over year in Q4. It's down about 30% in Q1.
I know you have another hard compare year over year on Q2, but what gives you confidence that this is digestion and not something more? And I know in George's prepared comments, he said all of data center would be up sequentially in June. Do you expect that for the cloud portion as well?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
So at the highest level, I'll just say, we work intimately with these customers, right? Our people are in their environments. We're working supply chains. We're building forecasts with them. We know what their inventory levels are.
These are very intimate relationships. So I'd just say, at that level, we're confident when we speak that -- what they're doing and what we're going to see in the future on how they're digesting and deploying the products that we delivered to them last year are now ramping in and becoming instances they're selling and services they're selling as well. I'll say, because of that intimate relationship that we have, we're quite confident in those comments. Like we said, as we see the sequential growth, we expect that across the business.
We see that in networking. We see that in enterprise and government, and we see that in cloud as well. We do see some of the elements that we talked about with respect to some of them exploring some of their own design work. And I'll just say, with that, we're very close to that.
Those are fairly modest overall in terms of their volumes so far. And as I mentioned in the last question, this is an area that the IDM 2.0 strategy, the Intel Foundry Services is powerful. And the response that we've seen from those customers saying, ""Wow, now we can co-innovate without doing all the work of creating a new architectural point in the cloud environment,"" this is powerful and something that we think is uniquely going to help us to navigate them to an answer that is much more favorable for them, as well as for us, and we're off to a great start.
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Hey, John, one thing I would add, we're going to see growth in all three of the major areas in data center, but the standout grower in Q2 is going to be cloud.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Thank you, guys.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. You may begin.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Yeah. Thank you. Pat and George, I just wanted to come back to the IDM 2.0 strategy. George, you mentioned that ramping down on buyback, which makes sense, so you addressed somewhat capital allocation.
But how should investors be thinking about the impact to P&L as you go through implementing IDM 2.0? And kind of related to that is free cash flow impact as you go to an elevated level of capital spend. And what really are the milestones that investors should be looking for?
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. And thanks for the question. We're clearly going to cover a lot of those details at our analyst day, which will be much more forward-looking. And as you know, the investment cycles for foundry are long.
Not only does it take time to qualify. Capacity additions take a certain period of time. What we're doing to be nimble is investing aggressively in the build-out of shells, which will give us -- and Arizona is a very good example of that, where, first off, we've been chasing demand for -- certainly since I've been here for a number of years. And the idea being we've got to have more optionality to respond to the market, both for foundry and also for our core market, which we cannot fulfill today.
And so what you'll see from us is really building in that optionality. So you would expect capital to be up somewhat reflecting that. That will have some impact on free cash flow, but we have a good growth forecast, which helps, obviously, with the growth of cash from operations. And so overall, I think the investment cycle for this will be logical as we lay it out.
The types of returns you can get will be in investment phase for sure for the next two to three years. But then you start to see customer demand starting to balance out the investment.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes. And I'd just add to that from some of the things building on the Unleashed announcement in March, right, this is a good market, $100 billion foundry market, huge emphasis on that for leading-edge capacity, which we're uniquely suited to give. And I'll say, competitors aren't able to catch up with demand in this area and factories take a long time to build. And clearly, as George has laid out, this is something that the optionality helps our existing business, as well as our foundry business.
And finally, the characteristics of the foundry business for somebody like us, it's a good business. Not only is it large, but it has good margin characteristics, and we expect that we're going to be able to produce good returns over the long term. And as we think about this, again, we go back. The world needs more semiconductor capacity.
It wants a more balanced supply chain. We're seeing industry say that. We're seeing government say that, and we're uniquely positioned to fulfill that.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

Our next question is from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. You may begin.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on the road map for gross margins, both kind of near and longer term. On the near term, your implied gross margins in the back half are about 55% plus/minus. Is this the trough or -- and is this kind of the starting point for calendar '22 that we should keep in mind as you start to invest more in 7-nanometer? And then longer term, when I look at your capex now, it's about 25%, 27% of sales, much higher than depreciation.
So what is the additional pressure as those things converge? And when I look at the foundry business that you're talking about, the best foundry in the world makes 50% gross margin. So how should we think about gross margin both near term and the longer term? Thank you.
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. First off, you know, we're probably not going to be able to forecast '22 and beyond on this call. We'll certainly give you an idea of what margins will look like over time at analyst day. But for the remainder of the year, as I talked about, the first half, second-half dynamics are really -- we're in a supply constrained environment in client, and it's constrained in a way that exposes us to more small core than our higher-ASP and higher-margin products.
The other piece is the 7-nanometer start-up, which I talked about, which is a good factor. This is really showing the readiness of both the process and products to move forward on 7-nanometer. We will get some help because we will see strong recovery from server. Some of that is muted a little bit because this is really where they're ramping to 10-nanometer off of 14, which was a very mature node.
And so it won't be quite as rich as we would expect, but I feel good about where we can drive margins over the long run. You're not going to see material impacts this year from the IFS activities. Obviously, we'll be making some investments, but those investments for the next year or two really are critical just to meet -- much of that investment is critical just to meet the increasing demand that we see on a client.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
And when do depreciation and capex convert, George?
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
You know, it'll depend really on what the multiyear capital picture looks like. So we'll have to wait and discuss that when we're ready to give a multiyear picture.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll just say this is a pivotal year, right? I mean, this is where we're building out the IDM 2.0 strategy. We're getting our product roadmap back in shape. Leadership products produce leadership margins.
And as we see, as we go through the year, we have opportunities of supply, right? As we drive revenues, if we're overachieving and as George said in his prepared remarks, if we overachieve in supply, we will see revenue. We'll see gross margin improvements and leadership products as we're committing to on our road map over time will get us back to leadership margins. So overall, this is pivotal, and we're well under way, right, and making that turn to have a -- I'll say Intel is back, right, with the kind of products, right, the kind of growth that you would expect, want to see from us.

Our next question will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. You may begin.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Thanks a lot. George, I had a two-part question. I guess the first thing is the $500 million in prepayments that was corporate related, where was that reported from a segment perspective? Or was it sort of like sprinkled throughout all the segments? And I guess the second part is just on capex, I know you had talked before about some capex had pushed from last year into this year. I think it was about $1.5 billion, something like that.
So I'm sort of wondering what the right sort of new normal is as you trajectory into next year. Is like $20 billion the right number? Or is it a little bit less than $20 billion? Thanks.
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. First off, the $500 million was not spread. It was in other revenue, so all in one place. In terms of the capex, yes, we had basically eight weeks or more of capital pushed out just because of the pandemic.
It really affected the construction activities. And as you know, it continues to be challenging. But that was probably the biggest factor that we saw last year. So maybe $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, you could argue, is really just catching up with where we were behind from last year.
And so you could add both that to our free cash flow estimates for the year. And also, you could bring down the capex requirements for this year. So I think $20 billion for this year is a good number, and we'll talk more about next year later.

Our next question will come from Pierre Ferragu from New Street. You may begin
Pierre Ferragu -- New Street Research -- Analyst
Hey, thanks for taking my question. Pat, I'd like to come back to all what you said about your foundry initiative, and there are really two ways I look at it. One is bringing a foundry service where your clients can integrate what they want to design with Intel's IP, and one is more like being like a mainstream general-purpose foundry to compete more directly with existing players like Samsung and TSMC. And so what I -- and I think these two are very different in nature.
And what I was wondering is, in the 50 conversations you've had so far, what would you say the percentage of conversations were more centered on the first one versus the second one. And then in your own mind, if you think about Intel in the long run, how do you see the balance between these two ways of being a foundry in your business mix?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Hey, thanks for the question, Pierre. I think it's a good question. And to some degree, I say we don't know, right? We're in this phase where we're beginning to engage with customers.
We have a good pipeline of customers that fit in both of those buckets, right? And definitely, some of the cloud customers, particularly interested in where they can co-mingle or create, I'll say, hybrid design, some of their IP with some of our IP. And then we have a very rich pipeline of customers really across pretty much every segment of the industry, communications providers, automakers, etc., that would fit into the second bucket where it's much more about them using us as a world-class foundry for all of their designs. I'll say, we view this as a very, I'll say, right, broad set of customers that we're aiming at with a broad set of IP. And as we get IP for the RISC-V, the ARM ecosystem, and the x86 ecosystem, our value proposition to customers is across that spectrum, where they don't need to opt priority side ours versus theirs.
They get to design with that full spectrum. The other thing I would say, Pierre, is we're also seeing extreme interest in our packaging technologies. And here, it might be a tile from Samsung or TSMC being combined with a tile from Intel, right? And those might be on older process technologies, newer process technologies, and taking advantage of our world-class packaging and assembly test technology. So we really see that full spectrum coming to bear.
And it really is that combination of world-class foundry, world-class IP, world-class assembly package and test that we think gives us a unique proposition in the industry. And so far, the enthusiasm is very high for that offering.
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. And, Pierre, I would add, as you talk about the two different alternatives, one of the things to remember is that if you look at our internal road map, people are used to seeing a highly differentiated and very specific to Intel set of IP capabilities. We've said over time that it's very clear that we're going to be adopting more and more of the industry ecosystem, IPs and libraries because it makes sense to do it, and it makes sense in terms of cycle time, in terms of taking advantage of capabilities that already exist out there. So we're closing -- we're not going to -- when we intercept on some of these windows, we're not going to be as far away, I think, as people might think in terms of being able to demonstrate a lot of knowledge around many of the IP blocks that our customers depend on today.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And let me just add to that. I think it's a great point, George, because every IP that I generate from the industry increases the IP available to my internal design teams. Every piece of IP I develop internally is going to be made available to the industry, right, for their use as well.
This becomes a powerful reinforcing cycle, right? Also, wherever we're being benchmarked against the industry for our process technology as we move to industry-standard PDKs, right, we're seeing strong embrace from the EDA suppliers. So we see all of this as it makes our process better. It makes our products better. It increases our efficiency and takes our clock rate of innovation up with the industry.
It's a powerful strategy.

Our next question will come from the line of Chris Danely from Citigroup. You may begin.
Chris Danely -- Citi -- Analyst
Thanks, guys. So it seems like we're in the middle of this never-ending fuselage of ARM products out there, both from a merchant and a captive perspective. So Pat, I just appreciate your thoughts on, I guess, where you see things shaking out on an x86 versus ARM, both in the PC and the data center space. And would you guys ever consider maybe licensing the x86 technology to some of your hyper-scale customers and having them design their own products with the foundry?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
The simple answer to the last part of the question is, yes, that's what we just announced, right? x86 cores will be available on our foundry services and available for people to design with them. So that will include the cloud service providers to take advantage of that. So the simple answer is yes. And we do believe that the ability for our customers to take advantage of x86 this way will be a meaningful shift in how people think about ARM versus x86 because part of it was we weren't giving them the flexibility to design, to co-mingle IP as I've described it.
So they really -- if they were trying to do unique design work, they didn't have a good x86 choice. We gave them our standard products, which have lots of capabilities. But in some of -- particularly for the cloud guy, I'd say, ""Boy, I don't use those particular features. I really could optimize with a few of these other things in the network and the memory hierarchy."" And now we're saying, ""Absolutely.
Come on in."" And we're opening the doors of our IP, the doors of our leading process and packaging technology to be able to say let's do this together or let them do their own designs in our foundry as well. It's a very powerful strategy that I think will be a meaningful shift in the exact question that you asked. Overall, we do think that making the x86 available this way is powerful. There are trillion lines of code that have been optimized for the x86.
This is a powerful ecosystem that continues to have very great innovation and capabilities associated with it. And we're enhancing that with new capabilities like AI being integrated into the core instruction set of the new products, as you saw with Ice Lake. These are powerful differentiators. We're continuing to innovate, and the ecosystem is excited about what we're doing in our standard products, as well as what we're making available through IDM 2.0.
Chris Danely -- Citi -- Analyst
Great. Thanks.
Operator
And our last question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. You may begin.
Matt Ramsay -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Pat, I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the data center in terms of architecture. And I think on the strategy event, I asked a similar one, and maybe we can dig into it a little bit more here.
I know you guys just launched Ice Lake and a lot of new features and capabilities as you lay out, but it is a platform transition from Cascade Lake and then another platform transition on to Sapphire. And I just wonder, first, what's been the feedback from Ice Lake as you guys have sampled it and now launched it in terms of platform compatibility issues that customers might be facing? And I guess the second part of the question is what has been the feedback from customers that you've sampled Sapphire Rapids to, particularly around the change from a single die to a tiled architecture and what that does to the memory system. Thank you.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think we could spend an hour on that question. So let me try to be quick here for it. The response from Ice Lake has been very strong.
Early ramp is very strong. Obviously, with the platform change, that does put a bit more work on the part of the customers, but we've been working through that with them. Good response to that as well. And as your question suggests, I mean, clearly, it would be better if we weren't bringing a new platform transition with Sapphire Rapids as well.
But there's so many good things in that platform that the customers are excited about, new PCI, new DDR and probably most seminally is the new CXL launch, right, as part of that. And I'll tell you, opening up, right, that additional interface on the platform has gotten tremendous support from the industry, new capabilities, co-processor capabilities, memory pooling capabilities. It really has been maybe the most exciting new platform capability since the PCI gen when we introduced that quite a number of years ago. So a lot of excitement about that.
And particularly for cloud customers, who have seen their memory portion of their TCO costs rise quite rapidly, there's a lot of enthusiasm in that area of the platform. So I'd say, overall, yes, we would have probably liked to have less platform transitions than this has induced, but so far, the response from customers is they're going through those transitions with us. They're seeing value in those transitions. And particularly, as I say, as we look out to the Sapphire Rapids generation, there's a lot of value in there with some of the major, major enhancements that are part of that.
Obviously, as we look further out in time, having more platform stability in the architecture, I think, is something we're striving for. And I think as we lay out the '23, '24, '25 road map directions to the industry, you'll start to see that theme much more seminally, right, centered in the road map. Also, I think as we get all aspects of our core leadership, our vector AI leadership, process leadership, all of those start to come into play, I think we'll see a very nice view of how that platform architecture lays out over time.
Matt Ramsay -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

2021-04-22 00:00:00+00:00,U.S. stocks close down on news of Biden tax proposal,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-stocks-close-down-on-news-of-biden-tax-proposal-2021-04-22-0,,,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK, April 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dived on Thursday on reports President Joe Biden planned to almost double the capital gains tax, news analysts said provided an excuse to take profits in a directionless market ahead of big tech's earnings next week.
The three main indexes on Wall Street also fell on reports that Biden planned to raise income taxes on the wealthy, a proposal some said would be hard to pass in Congress.
""If it had a chance of passing, we'd be down 2,000 points,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC.
Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago, said when a proposal is floated about raising taxes or capital gains, everybody gets excited, sells first and asks questions later.
""It is more of a short-term, knee-jerk reaction,"" he said.
Biden will propose raising the marginal income tax rate to 39.6% from 37% and nearly double capital gains taxes to 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million, sources told Reuters.
The proposal targets about $1 trillion for child care, universal pre-kindergarten education and paid leave for workers, the sources said.
Markets have been listless after the Dow .DJI and S&P 500 .SPX recently scaled all-time peaks as investors await guidance from Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Facebook Inc FB.O when they report earnings next week.
""Until we get out of this information vacuum the market is going to be generally directionless,"" Hayes said. ""All that really matters moving forward is what are those big tech earnings next week?""
During the session, the S&P 500 healthcare sector .SPXHC hit a fresh record high while industrials .SPLRCI were the biggest gainers.
American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O and Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N reported smaller-than-expected quarterly losses, signaling a revival in travel demand. Both stocks fell, with American down 4.5% and Southwest 1.6%.
Investors welcomed data showing the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week dropped to a fresh one-year low. The Labor Department report suggested layoffs were subsiding and expectations were rising for another month of blockbuster job growth in April.
The speedy U.S. vaccination rollout has improved the economic outlook as people plan summer vacations and leisure spending, but a surge in COVID-19 cases in India and elsewhere in Asia has kept investors anxious, Hayes said.
Equities have likely reached a near-term top as expectations are too high, said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.
""There's going to be continued positive moves throughout the remainder of the year but we are due for some sort of a pullback in the very short term,"" he said. ""Then the dip buyers will step back in.""
First-quarter earnings are expected to increase 31.9% from a year ago, the highest rate since the fourth quarter, according to IBES Refinitiv data.
All 11 S&P 500 sectors closed lower as Microsoft, Apple IncAAPL.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Tesla Inc TSLA.O weighted the most on the downdraft.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 0.94% to 33,815.9, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.92% at 4,134.98, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 0.94% to 13,818.41.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.35 billion shares, compared with the 10.32 billion full-session average over the last 20 trading days.
Chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street targets, betting its next generation of processors for data centers and PCs will meet growing demand for cloud-based services. Shares slipped about 1% in after-hours trade.
AT&T Inc T.N beat Wall Street revenue targets as the U.S. economic reopening following pandemic-linked restrictions boosted smartphone sales and the media business. AT&T shares rose 4.2%.
Biogen Inc BIIB.O beat quarterly profit estimates on stronger-than-expected sales for its muscle wasting disorder drug, though concerns over its reliance on its yet-to-be approved Alzheimer's therapy, aducanumab, weighed on shares. Biogen shares fell 4.0%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.57-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 84 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 86 new highs and 20 new lows.

April 22 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street targets on Thursday, betting on demand for its new generation of processors for data centers and PCs as cloud-based services become an integral part of businesses.
The world's biggest maker of central processors has been aiming to cater to the needs of the modern data centers, where different processors perform specialized tasks and had recently launched a processor dubbed ""Ice Lake"".
With its dual-tracked strategy to manufacture, outsource and build its own foundry for chips, Intel aims to revamp its business model, while keeping a strong hold on its manufacturing.
This could tilt the technological balance of power back to the United States and Europe and away from Asia-centric chip manufacturing given tensions with China.
Intel's strategy could have wide-ranging competitive and political implications in the long term, analysts have said.
The company expects second-quarter revenue of about $17.8 billion, compared to analysts' average estimate of $17.59 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue from Intel's higher-margin data center business fell 20% to $5.6 billion in the first quarter, while analysts on average had expected revenue of $5.89 billion, according to FactSet.
