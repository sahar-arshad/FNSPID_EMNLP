2021-12-15 00:00:00+00:00,7 Big Dividend Paying Stocks to Hold Forever,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-big-dividend-paying-stocks-to-hold-forever,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Within equities as an asset class, there can be a broad classification of growth and income investors. Growth investors seek to find opportunities in high growth business ideas. In general, a portfolio of growth stocks would have a high-beta. Further, there are dividend investors who look for stable businesses with robust cash flows. Income investors prefer to hold dividend paying stocks. Typically, a portfolio of dividend paying stocks have a low-beta.
However, the best strategy is to remain diversified. Overexposure to high-beta stocks can negatively impact the portfolio in a sharp downside. Going overweight on low-beta and high-dividend stocks does make the portfolio defensive. However, in times of high inflation, there can be a potential risk of returns that fail to beat inflation.
My focus in this column is on high-quality dividend stocks that investors can buy and hold forever. Besides potential for sustained dividends and possible dividend growth, I have focused on stocks that also seem undervalued.
7 Tech Stocks Worth Snatching Up After Their Tumble
Investors can therefore expect regular cash flows and there is a possibility of decent capital gains. Let’s take a deeper look into seven dividend paying stocks that are worth buying at current levels.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)
Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)
Altria (NYSE:MO)
Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)
Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)
Chevron (NYSE:CVX)
Big Dividend Paying Stocks to Hold Forever: Intel (INTC)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
There are several reasons to like INTC stock. First and foremost, the stock has remained sideways for the last 12-months. At a forward price-to-earnings-ratio of less than 10, the stock is attractive. Intel recently announced that Mobileye will go public in mid-2022. That’s a key near-term positive catalyst for stock upside.
Furthermore, INTC stock offers investors an annual dividend of $1.39, which implies a healthy yield of 2.75%. Intel has also guided for potential increase in dividends in the coming years.
It’s worth noting that for 2022, Intel plans to invest $25 billion to $28 billion. The company further plans to increase investments beyond 2022. This is likely to translate into revenue and earnings growth in the coming years. The company is looking at revenue growth at a CAGR of 10% to 12% over the next five-years.
Overall, Intel has been a laggard in the last few years and has lost market share. That’s likely to reverse with the company investing in innovation. Further, new chip factories in Arizona and potentially in Europe will address the chip shortage.
Apple (AAPL)

I would include Apple among the top dividend paying stocks. Currently, AAPL stock has an annual dividend of 88 cents and a dividend yield of 0.49%. This might not sound very attractive.
However, the key point here is that Apple is still on a healthy growth trajectory. I would not be surprised if dividend growth sustains in the coming years. The stock is therefore a quality name among high dividend growth stocks.
In terms of business development, Apple has been increasingly diversified in the recent past. iPhone remains the cash cow. At the same time, the wearable and services business have gained significant traction. Emerging businesses are likely to ensure that healthy growth sustains.
It’s also worth noting that Apple has products lined-up that include virtual reality, augmented reality and electric vehicles. The business outlook is therefore robust and Apple has ample financial flexibility to pursue aggressive growth.

From a financial perspective, Apple reported operating cash flow of $104 billion for the last financial year. Robust cash flows will ensure strong dividend growth and value creation through share repurchases.
Overall, AAPL stock has trended higher in the recent past. The rally is likely to sustain on growth expectations. Additionally, dividend investors will increasingly find the stock worth holding.
Big Dividend Paying Stocks to Hold Forever: Lockheed Martin (LMT)
LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California."" width=""300"" height=""169"">

Even in the pandemic year, global defense spending increased. For 2020, defense spending was $2 trillion. It’s clear that the sector will continue to grow even with macro-economic headwinds.
This factor makes Lockheed Martin among the top dividend paying stocks to hold. Currently, LMT stock offers an annualized dividend of $11.20, which implies an attractive yield of 3.25%.
It’s also worth noting that LMT stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.9. Valuations are attractive and investors can expect stock upside besides healthy dividends.
Lockheed Martin reported a total order backlog of $134 billion as of Q3 2021. This provides clear cash flow visibility. For 2022, the company has already guided for sales of $66 billion and operating cash flow of $8.4 billion.
These projections exclude the completion of acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne, which will complete in first quarter 2022. The acquisition will add to the company’s backlog and potential earnings growth.
Another important point to note is that Lockheed has been increasingly diversifying outside the United States. As an example, Lockheed is bidding for a $19 billion Canadian dollar fighter jet contract. Order growth from NATO and Allies will ensure that cash flow visibility remains robust.
Altria (MO)
Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com
Altria is another high-quality dividend stock that also trades at an attractive valuation. Currently, MO stock trades at a forward P/E of 9.8 and offers investors a dividend yield of 7.98%.
Altria has been in a phase of business transformation and growth uncertainties have kept the stock depressed. However, there are two important points to note.
First, even with the company’s gradual shift toward non-combustible tobacco products, Altria continues to generate robust cash flows. In the smokable product segment, Marlboro remains the cash cow.
Revenue from this segment will ensure that dividends remain at current levels. For the first nine months of 2021, Altria reported operating cash flow (OCF) of $5.7 billion. This would imply an annualized OCF of nearly $8.0 billion.
7 Tech Stocks Worth Snatching Up After Their Tumble
Further, the company’s non-combustible product segment is gradually gaining traction. The company’s oral tobacco brand is available for distribution in over 110,000 stores in the U.S. Additionally, for Q3 2021, Marlboro Heat Sticks witnessed 20% growth in sales volume sequentially. In the coming years, the segment is likely to drive growth.
Altria also has exposure to the cannabis business through stake in Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON). A possible Federal level legalization of cannabis would be a game-changer.
Big Dividend Paying Stocks to Hold Forever: Target Corporation (TGT)
TGT) logo on a storefront."" width=""300"" height=""169"">

A key growth driver for the U.S. economy is consumption spending. Within this, retail spending is significant. Therefore, retailers like Target are positioned for steady growth that’s in-sync with GDP growth.
TGT stock is attractive from a dividend perspective. The stock currently offers an annualized dividend of $3.60, which implies a healthy yield of 1.5% at current levels. Additionally, Target has witnessed healthy growth and dividend upside is likely in the coming years.
With changing times, Target has built a strong omni-channel sales platform. This has helped in boosting comparable store sales growth. For Q3 2021, the company reported comparable store sales growth of 12.7%. For the same period, digital comp store sales increased by 29%.
Target has also committed to invest $4 billion annually over the next few years. The investment will be targeted towards boosting the company’s capabilities across its retail platform. These investments are likely to ensure that comparable store sales growth is healthy.
For the first nine months of 2021, Target reported operating cash flow of $5.6 billion. For the same period, the company’s capital expenditure was $2.5 billion. With free cash flows of $3.1 billion, there is ample visibility for dividends and share repurchase.
Pfizer (PFE)
Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com
I rate Pfizer as another high-quality name among dividend paying stocks. I also believe that PFE stock has impending upside from a forward P/E of 12.5x.
From the perspective of dividends, the stock has an annualized pay-out of $1.60, which implies a dividend yield of 3.0%. There are two important reasons to believe that dividend growth is likely in the next few years.
First, Pfizer continues to generate robust cash flows from the Covid-19 vaccine. The company has a healthy order backlog for 2022. Additionally, there is a strong case for a booster dose with the omicron variant creating concerns. This will add to the cash flow potential.
Further, Pfizer has a deep pipeline of drugs in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. The company has guided for 6% revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth through 2025. The innovation pipeline is likely to ensure that cash flows swell and dividends increase.
Additionally, Pfizer has ample financial flexibility to pursue external, or inorganic, growth. In August 2021, the company acquired Trillium Therapeutics. This will boost the company’s oncology pipeline.
7 Stocks to Buy to Hedge Against Omicron Variant Risks
Overall, considering the growth potential, PFE stock looks attractive at current levels. For income investors, there is visibility for sustained upside in dividends.
PFE stock also shows up in the top holdings of several top-performing high-dividend exchange-traded funds, including SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:SPYD) and the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSEARCA:VIG).
Big Dividend Paying Stocks to Hold Forever: Chevron Corporation (CVX)
Source: Denis Kuvaev / Shutterstock.com
Chevron is among the dividend champions from the oil and gas sector. Even with the recent decline in oil price, CVX stock looks positioned to sustain dividends.
Additionally, as economic growth gains traction globally, oil is likely to remain firm. Chevron seems positioned for healthy cash flows in the coming years. Currently, CVX stock offers a healthy dividend pay-out of $5.36 . This implies a yield of 4.53%.
One reason to be bullish on Chevron is low break-even assets. Even at $60 per barrel oil, the company expects excess cash (after dividends and capital expenditure) of $25 billion.
It’s also worth noting that between 2016 and 2020, Chevron reported reserve replacement ratio of 99%. With a strong reserve base coupled with the advantage of low break-even assets, Chevron is positioned to deliver steady cash flows.
At the same time, Chevron is also investing in renewable energy. Excess cash buffer will allow the company to accelerate renewable investments and create a diversified portfolio of assets.
Overall, CVX stock looks attractive at a forward P/E of 14.0. Visibility for dividend growth and stock upside makes the stock among the top names to consider.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares soared last week after the battered semiconductor company announced it would take its Mobileye self-driving-car segment public. Unfortunately, the celebration was short-lived, and INTC stock quickly fell back.

Such is the challenge with down-trending equities. They have ample overhead resistance and legions of underwater longs that are only too happy to depart with their shares at higher prices.
But all may not be lost with Intel’s bottoming efforts.
There’s still a chance the recent double bottom pattern holds as buyers return. Moreover, Intel is one of the cheaper chip stocks and offers decent premiums for options sellers. So let’s take a closer look at what would have to happen before I’d pull the trigger.
INTC Stock Charts

The larger time frame leaves much to be desired. Intel has essentially been dead money for four years despite some massive volatility along the way. What’s more, this circuitous route to nowhere has transpired while the Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH) has tripled!
7 Stocks to Buy to Hedge Against Omicron Variant Risks
To tread water when your industry is struggling is one thing. Doing so when profits are raining down on every one of your competitors and peers is quite another.
If you’re shopping for strength and leadership, I suggest you move along. That’s not what Intel offers. Its appeal is the nearly 3% dividend yield and cheaper valuation. To wit: it carries a single-digit price-to-earnings ratio of 9.
By comparison, Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have P/E ratios of 44, 22, and 94, respectively. Intel’s pain has been their gain.
The weekly chart shows INTC stock is stuck in a downtrend beneath all significant moving averages. No wonder last week’s news-inspired jump failed. We need to break above resistance and reverse the weekly slide before any real gains come to pass.
For now, the best chance bulls have is to hold the recent pair of pivot lows at $48. If we don’t, there’s an air pocket until $44 that could result in a quick move down.
With the big picture properly framed, we can now look at the greater detail offered by the daily chart.
Last week’s gap higher on the Mobileye news gave Intel one of the best chances to bottom in a while. Unfortunately, the selling since has been relentless. The gap quickly filled, and with Tuesday’s drop, we’re now back below the 20-day moving average (and every other one, for that matter). It’s impossible to pull the trigger with six straight sessions where we’ve closed lower than the open. The short-term trend needs to reverse first. For the trade idea below, I suggest one of two triggers.
First, wait for INTC to break above a prior day’s high. That should signal a pivot low is upon us. Second, wait for prices to climb above the 50-day moving average at $51 to signal a new breakout attempt is upon us. Until either development happens, I don’t like bulls’ chances.
Play Safe With Short Puts
Given Intel’s shoddy history and current downtrend, aggressive bullish trades are ill-advised. If you’re trying to bottom fish and want better odds of success, try naked puts instead. Consider them a bet that Intel won’t fall too much further from its current perch.
The Trade: Sell the January $47.50 put for around 90 cents.
If you want to minimize the risk, exit on a break of the strike price ($47.50). It will signal the recent double bottom pattern failed.

2021-12-14 00:00:00+00:00,These 3 Stocks Might Be Getting a Little Too Expensive,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-3-stocks-might-be-getting-a-little-too-expensive,,,"Warren Buffett has talked of preferring to buy into a great company at a good price than a good company at a great price. That points out how important a company's quality is to him, but it doesn't mean that price doesn't matter. His company recently sported close to $150 billion in cash and cash equivalents -- if he didn't insist on only paying good or reasonable prices for stocks and companies, he'd have spent much of that sum by now.
Here are three companies that have been serving their investors very well, but their prices may have gotten ahead of themselves lately.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Nvidia
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a graphics processing unit (GPU) maker that has grown into a behemoth, with a recent market value near $750 billion. (Intel, by comparison, was recently valued near $200 billion.) Over the past decade, Nvidia's stock has soared more than 8,000% (without reinvesting dividends) -- that's more than 55% annually, on average.
Nvidia has a lot going for it, and it's reasonable to expect it to keep expanding and growing. It's already a powerhouse in gaming, and it's also active in other arenas, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, cloud computing, autonomous driving, and 5G. Its overall growth rate is robust, with third-quarter revenue popping 50% over year-earlier levels, with data center revenue up 55% and gaming revenue up 42%. CEO Jensen Huang noted: ""Demand for NVIDIA AI is surging, driven by hyperscale and cloud scale-out, and broadening adoption by more than 25,000 companies.""
Many expect unrelenting growth from Nvidia over the coming years, but still, it's fair to worry that the stock is overvalued at this point. Check out some of its recent valuation metrics vs. their five-year averages:

2. Home Depot
Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has been growing robustly for decades and recently boasted 2,317 locations in all 50 states while employing about 500,000 people. Its market value recently topped $430 billion, and despite that massive size, it's still been growing briskly. In its third quarter, revenue rose nearly 10% year over year, while earnings per share jumped 23%.
The company has successfully secured inventory in the face of supply chain blockages, which bodes well for minimally disrupted operations. However, if demand drops due to continued or new pandemic issues, or perhaps due to housing market changes, it may be left with considerable assets tied up in inventory.
Home Depot is firing on many cylinders and has a lot going for it. Its recent valuation appears rather lofty, though. Check out the numbers below:

3. Sherwin-Williams
Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW) is an underappreciated gem of a stock. Consider that over the past 20 years, its shares have grown in value by more than 4,000% (about 20.4% annually, on average) -- and that's without reinvesting dividends. It's a paint and coatings specialist, not a much-hyped fintech stock or a burgeoning cloud-computing concern.
The company has long been a solid dividend payer, with 43 consecutive years of dividend increases -- most recently a 23% hike, in February. The dividend yield was recently only 0.63%, but that's partly due to the stock rising so much. (Remember that a dividend yield is simply a stock's current annual dividend payment divided by its current stock price -- so as a stock's price rises, its yield will drop, and vice-versa.)
Sherwin-Williams traces its history way back to 1866 and has grown to encompass more than 5,000 company-operated stores and brands, including Sherwin-Williams, Valspar, HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams, Dutch Boy, Krylon, Minwax, Thompson's Water Seal, and Cabot, among others. There's no reason to think it won't continue growing and selling a lot of paint and coatings, but it's also fair to see the stock as having gotten ahead of itself.

Consider waiting
Nvidia, Home Depot, and Sherwin-Williams are terrific companies with wonderful track records of stock growth. They've made a lot of money for millions of shareholders. Their stocks offer little margin of safety right now, though -- indeed, they're priced as if they will grow at breakneck speed without encountering any speed bumps.
To minimize risk, consider adding them to your watchlist, waiting for a pullback before buying into the companies.

2021-12-14 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Stock Looks Undervalued and Poised to Rally,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-stock-looks-undervalued-and-poised-to-rally,,,"Among the blue-chip names in the technology sector, Intel (INTC) stock has been an underperformer in the last 12-months. During this period, the stock has remained sideways.
Of course, the weakness in INTC stock has been due to growth concerns. However, it seems that the stock is undervalued at a price-to-earnings-ratio of 9.8.
I am bullish on INTC stock for 2022 and I believe that a major sentiment reversal is around the corner. Let’s discuss the possible catalysts for stock upside. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)
Intel recently announced the intent to take Mobileye public. Mobileye has a leading market share in driver-assistance and autonomous driving solutions.
In 2017, Intel acquired Mobileye for a consideration of $15.3 billion. The initial public offering can potentially value Mobileye in excess of $50 billion. With a likely IPO of Mobileye in mid-2022, there is an impending value unlocking for shareholders.
It’s worth noting that Mobileye is expected to deliver revenue growth of more than 40% for 2021. If this growth trajectory sustains, valuations can be significantly higher in the next few years. The spin-off has the potential to create value and INTC stock is likely to trend higher.
Gradual Push for Growth
For Intel, gaining market share is unlikely to come overnight. Intel CEO Patrick P. Gelsinger believes that the turnaround effort is a five-year job. However, markets discount the future and with positive developments, INTC stock is likely to trend higher.
In September 2021, Intel announced that the company had commenced the construction of two leading-edge chip factories in Arizona. Intel will be investing $20 billion in these factories. With a global chip shortage, it’s possibly the best time to ramp up investments.
Intel has also pledged to invest $95 billion in Europe’s chip-factory expansion. Shortages of car chips have been a big headwind for EV companies in 2021. European expansion will be targeted towards addressing this demand-supply gap.
For 2022, Intel expects to incur capital expenditures in the range of $25 billion to $28 billion. Furthermore, the company is targeting higher investments in subsequent years. This is likely to translate into revenue and earnings upside.
It’s important to note that Intel is well positioned for big investments. For the first nine months of 2021, the company reported operating cash flows of $24 billion. This would imply an annualized cash flow potential in excess of $30 billion.
Therefore, even with an average annual investment of $25 billion to $30 billion in the next few years, Intel is positioned to deliver free cash flows. INTC stock already offers a healthy dividend yield of 2.8%. With investments likely to deliver earnings upside, Intel seems like an attractive dividend growth stock.
Another point from the growth perspective is innovation. Intel already has a strong innovation pipeline, with products that include the company’s first ASIC-based IPU. Additionally, the next generation discrete GPU for gaming is slated for launch in Q1 2022.
Wall Street’s Take
Turning to Wall Street, Intel has a Hold consensus rating, based on four Buys, 12 Holds, and seven Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average Intel price target of $53.80 implies 7.6% upside potential.
Bottom Line
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) might have taken away market share from Intel in the last few years. However, Intel seems to be fighting back with capital investments and a pipeline of innovation.
A turnaround will not come instantly, but the transformation is likely to take INTC stock higher.
In the near term, Mobileye’s IPO serves as another catalyst. Therefore, INTC stock looks attractive at a forward P/E of less than 10.
Besides the potential for stock upside, Intel also offers the possibility of dividend growth in the coming years.

2021-12-13 00:00:00+00:00,Intel's first foray into the metaverse will be software to use others' chips,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-first-foray-into-the-metaverse-will-be-software-to-use-others-chips,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Dec 13 (Reuters) - In their first public comments on its strategy for tapping into the ""metaverse,"" Intel Corp INTC.O executives said the firm is working on software that will help laptops tap into computing power from other devices, including chips from its rivals.
While the definition of ""metaverse"" is broad, it generally refers to immersive virtual worlds that will be accessed via the internet and a variety of devices, like virtual reality headsets.
The trend is expected to require vastly more computing power, and firms like Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, which makes chips and software used to construct the virtual world, and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, which makes chips used in virtual reality headsets, have both gained value in recent months on investor enthusiasm about the metaverse.
At a news conference after a presentation at the RealTime Conference on metaverse technologies on Monday, Raja Koduri, head of Intel's accelerated computing systems and graphics group, said the company's first technology push into the metaverse will be software that helps devices take advantage of computing power that already exists and is unused.
For example, if a gamer is playing a graphics-heavy title on a laptop that would tax the system's chips but has an unused gaming PC in another room, the software could detect the spare power sitting idle on the PC and tap into it over a home network to make the laptop game run better.
Koduri said the software will work with chips from competitors. The software is designed to solve technical challenges for users, and not just to generate major revenue for Intel. Some of it will be shared, Koduri said.
""The way we are architecting all the layers is that it is going to work with everybody's hardware, as long as they are on industry standard specifications,"" Koduri told reporters. ""There'll be a lot of open sourcing involved with everything that we build.""

This video was recorded on Dec. 7, 2021.
Chris Hill: [MUSIC] It's Tuesday, Dec. 7. Welcome to Market Foolery, I'm Chris Hill. With me today, the one and only Bill Mann. Good to see you.
Bill Mann: I'm back and stocks are back.
Chris Hill: Stock are back, everything's good. The past four weeks, it's all forgotten because we've got two days in a row where everything is good again.
Bill Mann: It's really unbelievable. You and I both as part of our jobs, but also because we're extraverts, interact with people all the time about the stock market. It's really incredible what 48 hours of gains will do to people's moods. It's amazing.
Chris Hill: Today we have a big announcement in tech. We've got a small deal in SPACS and we'll get to all of that. But we're going to start with one of the stocks that is heading higher. That is AutoZone because shares are hitting a new all-time high after first-quarter profits and revenue came in, higher-than-expected, same-store sales were up 13.5%. I'm curious what you think of the business in this moment in time. I will just say let's just put aside for a second to spring of 2020 and what happened to the stock then because that's an aberration. With AutoZone, there's basically a two-year stretch from early 2017 to late 2018 where the company and therefore the stock went through a rough patch. Other than that, this is.
Bill Mann: It's a missile.
Chris Hill: The hindsight is 2020. Amazing stock of this century. This is one of those easy to miss because it's not sexy businesses that has just done nothing but rewards shareholders.
Bill Mann: So unsexy and not only that, and we're going to talk about a related story in just a few minutes. Auto parts has seemed to have been something that you would look at and you'd say from a trend basis, the rise in electric vehicles is going to make the auto parts business somewhat obsolete. But it turns out. I don't have the numbers in front of me, so it will be exciting just to make one up. [LAUGHTER] The stock has gone up something like 633% per year for 20 years. It is maybe a little high.
Chris Hill: I think that's a little high.
Bill Mann: Maybe that's a little high, but it has generated Starbucks and Costco like just fantastic long-term returns. Which as an analyst, you would never go in and say, you've got a company that's going to keep growing 20% per year for 20 years. You would be fired instantly by a bank. If that's the thesis you're putting out there, but that's exactly what AutoZone has done. This quarter, and you're right, 13% same-store sales over 2020. 2020 was weird. But they're just crushing it. They are absolutely just crushing it, 38% growth in earnings per share. This is a company that has just done this year after year after year.
Chris Hill: One of the benefits that we get from seeing a management team in place and how they operate for this amount of time is among the track records they build up is how good or bad they maybe at capital allocation. When you look at AutoZone, the way they've managed their store count, the way that they have employed buybacks as a method of rewarding shareholders. You've got to tip your hat to them.
Bill Mann: William Rhodes is the CEO of AutoZone -- company's based in Memphis, Tennessee, he's a Tennessee guy. He's 56 years old.
Chris Hill: He's a young guy.
Bill Mann: As you and I know, we're getting younger, 56, getting younger all the time, but like he has plenty of time to continue to run the show. He's been at AutoZone, essentially his entire career from once he got out of business school. You're exactly right. It is one of the things that we look to and it's the difference between the companies that are in businesses like this that are commodity-driven. Having a CEO like William Rhodes makes the difference.
Chris Hill: Intel shares moving higher because they announced that next year, they're going to spin off Mobileye, which is Intel self-driving car division. In an IPO that could value Mobileye in the neighborhood of $50 billion, which is a very respectable and significantly higher than the $15 billion Intel paid for it back in 2017. Let's start with Intel and then we'll get to the potential for Mobileye. But in terms of Intel, a stock that has been challenged over the past few years. This seems like a way to unlock value that is getting appreciated on Wall Street.
Bill Mann: Yeah not just unlocking value. Chris, when we were talking about doing this story earlier. I was aware that the reports had come out that they were thinking about doing this. I thought to myself, didn't Intel buy Mobileye like last week? Maybe that's a sign of the pandemic. That to me, 2019 is still last year. But it really seems like they just bought it. But yes, Intel has already come out and said they have a massive amount of restructuring and reconfiguring that they're going to do in their core ship business. Cashing in a little bit of Mobileye, it makes an immense amount of sets and they're going to still retain control of it, both financial and voting control. They're not thoroughly spending it back out. It will remain a subsidiary of Intel. But in a world in which companies like Rivian, Automotive, and Lucid are out there with 70 billion plus market caps and have produced nothing. This makes all the sense in the world for me, for Intel to make this move.
Chris Hill: Pat Gelsinger, the CEO at Intel, compared Mobileye to Tesla, which I suppose I would say that if I were.
Bill Mann: Sure, what trillion-dollar company can we compare this to? Let me think.
Chris Hill: To go back to something you just touched on. It seems like at least part of the calculus for Intel in this move is maybe informed by what they have seen with Rivian and the fact that as you said, it's a $70 billion company with no vehicles on the road. Look, this is one of those things that shouldn't matter to investors like you and me. But it actually does because it involves institutions buying shares in blocks much larger than you or I, or anyone listening to you.
Bill Mann: Speaking for yourself, but OK.
Chris Hill: But you look at what happened with Rivian. Let me put it this way. It's hard for me to look at what's happened with Rivian and draw a conclusion other than there is an appetite among institutional investors for Tesla type investments that aren't Tesla. They've already made their investment in Tesla. They know it's going to be.
Bill Mann: Or they missed it.
Chris Hill: Or they missed it. Or they're getting later than they wanted to and they recognize it's not going to be just like there's not one automaker, there's not going to be one electric vehicle maker. They're going to be multiples. There are going to be multiple winners. Some of that money is going to go into businesses like Mobileye.
Bill Mann: Absolutely. Mobileye to me is a picks and pans play on the industry. You go back in time, obviously I don't know that this is a huge insight, but I'm going to make it anyway. The automobile turned out to be a pretty big deal here in the United States of America and around the world. Yet we went from hundreds of auto companies in the 1940s to essentially four American companies at the beginning of this century. That was how it worked out. This will be a similar. It's going to be a rough go for an industry that really does have a lot of great things in front of us. This will be a lot of the flies industry. I believe that to be true. But companies like Mobileye, which aren't really worried so much about which company wins, I think that they are in a really great spot. The market also thinks that they are in a really great spot. Pat Gelsinger, to your point, recognizes that the rest of Intel isn't in a great spot, but you know what would help? Some cash.
Chris Hill: The timing is such that right now we're looking at the middle of 2022. For those in the business media who are looking to aggregate their list of IPOs to watch in 2022, it's Christmas come early because you can put Mobileye on that list.
Bill Mann: One less thing to do.
Chris Hill: Yes. Speaking of media and aggregation and list building, BuzzFeed went public yesterday via a special purpose acquisition company. I think everybody knows BuzzFeed or is at least, if not a regular consumer, at some point, someone has sent you a BuzzFeed article or a list of some sort, or it's popped up in your Twitter or Instagram feed. It wasn't a great day in terms of what happened, it closed down to 11 percent. There were that early pop. We got the reports over the weekend that a lot of people were initially interested in this and then they just walked away. I mentioned all this not to pick on BuzzFeed, but I do wonder, we've seen so many companies go public via SPACs, and some of them in terms of getting attention from investors and the business media, they barely resonate, it's barely a blip. This is a well-known business. Therefore, it got more attention than the size of the business would warrant.
Bill Mann: Exactly.
Chris Hill: I'm wondering if you think this signals not the end of SPACs, but a part of me feels like whatever heat SPACs had as a category, this was just one more bucket of cold water being dumped on it.
Bill Mann: I know how much you love for your guests to read on the show, [LAUGHTER] I know you love this, but I do have to read something that we at the Motley Fool put out about a year ago and it was about SPACs. A year ago, now, basically, there were a lot of people who believed that the way that you invest was to buy a SPACs, wait for it to announce, sell it and then buy another SPACs and they were going to get rich that way. We wrote, we're not trying to get you to invest in SPACs or to be excited about them. Every investment fad in history has ended badly for the majority of investors and we expect nothing different from SPACs when all is said and done. It's not to say we told you so, because it's dumb to say we told you so, but it is to say that in our job every once in a while, it's really unnerving to watch people to try and play the investment game in a way that it ought not be played, in a way that things aren't really done.
Because you would hope they would figure it out, but usually figuring out that you're playing a game that you don't understand, comes with some pain. The SPACs market this year has been horrible. There are SPACs that have come out public this year that are down more than 90%. It's incredible to think about. In the case of BuzzFeed maybe because it is a higher profile company, this may be the death now of our thinking about SPACs as being magic beanstalk beans. It's a way of coming public, nothing more, nothing less. There are things about SPACs that are better than coming public through a traditional initial public offering. But then there are things that are a lot worse. They really should have been some breaks put on, BuzzFeed went 94% of the premarket money decided to redeem rather than go public with the company because that as they say is bad.
Chris Hill: Well, hopefully, this has a similar and yet opposite effect from what we were talking about earlier with Mobileye and Rivian. In the same way that someone at Intel might have looked at what was happening with Rivian and said, you know if we spin out Mobileye, we could probably make a decent buck. I'm sure, I'm 100% confident there were digital media companies watching closely with their fingers crossed on Monday when BuzzFeed went public via SPACs. Because they were thinking, boy, if this works, then we can do the same thing. Hopefully, at least some of those digital media companies and the people running them are looking at what's happened to BuzzFeed and saying to themselves, you know what? We got to go back to the drawing board.
Bill Mann: Yes, and here's what's really important, and I think that this gets lost a lot. When companies go public, the reason that they are doing so, there are a lot of different reasons, but the primary reason is to raise money. They're going to raise money. BuzzFeed got $19 million after all of the redemptions. The group that brought them public got $35 million in transaction fees. [LAUGHTER] If I do the math, that comes out to be a pretty high percentage, that's math. This divided by that equals high. I would think that there were a number of media companies that looked at this and have said, OK, maybe this isn't the environment for it, but this is definitely not the vehicle for it, not now.
Chris Hill: Maybe this is a question that is drenched in hope.
Bill Mann: You're leading the witness?
Chris Hill: In the same way that hopefully some digital media companies watch this play out and said to themselves, we got to go back to the drawing board, I'm not suggesting that this puts the final nail in the coffin of SPACs, but is 2022 going to be a year with fewer SPACs than we saw this year, hopefully for everybody's sake?
Bill Mann: Chris, the crazy thing is that all of the SPACs that have been stood up by now are still out there looking for companies to merge with and they have a fuse on them that lasts a maximum of two years. We're going to see plenty of more companies being brought public by SPACs. Ideally, what we will see now is fewer SPACs being stood up to start with. Although, if you want to be cynical about it, I'd say it went pretty well for the SPACs promoter, they got $35 billion. But I don't know that this is the ideal, absolutely positively the bloom is off the rose. The belief that you can just buy SPACs, by individual investors, you could buy a SPACs blindly and it's going to go up, that's a dead issue at this point and I think it's better.
Chris Hill: I agree. Bill Mann, always great talking to you. Thanks for being here.
Bill Mann: Thanks, Chris. It was fun.
Chris Hill: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. That's going to be it for this edition of Market Foolery. The show is mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Chris Hill, thanks for listening, will see you tomorrow.

Intel Corp has posted three successive down quarters in terms of revenue growth and as a result, INTC stock has been drifting lower. But now the stock is starting to look interesting here and could be approaching good value.
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Back on March 11, 2021, I wrote that Intel was overvalued in my article, “Buy INTC Stock When It’s Hated Most, Not Now.” At the time, the stock was at $63.82 and it later peaked at $68.26 on April 9.
It hit a trough at $47.89 on Oct. 27. But now, as of Dec. 13, INTC stock has drifted down to $50.38 per share. So 7 months after the stock peaked, it is finally starting to rebound. I believe that is because the company’s future is starting to look brighter, at least after next year.
Where Things Stand With Intel Corp
The reason is next year analysts project lower revenue and earnings compared to 2021 (and 2021 will be below last year). For example, this year earnings per share (EPS) might fall from 8.7% to $4.51, based on the average earnings forecast of 19 analysts surveyed by Seeking Alpha.
Moreover, for 2022 there are 22 analysts who expect EPS to fall to $3.41, or over 24% year-over-year (YoY). In fact, analysts don’t expect EPS to inch up until 2023 when it hits $3.52. And then by 2024, they foresee a slight gain to $4.05 in earnings per share.
7 Stocks to Buy Now for a Potential Year-End Rally
But at least now there is some sort of turnaround in sight. Earlier this year, the market was rising on false hopes that it would rebound sooner.
Maybe it has taken some time for the new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who started in February, to get his footing. He has had to put together a strategy to turn the company around. Moreover, both analysts and the board of directors have taken their time to warm up to his plans.
For example, he used to be the chief technology officer for the company but he left in 2009 after being passed over for the CEO job. Now he has to take on the company’s manufacturing issues.
At first, analysts had faith in the CEO’s ability to take on competitor Advanced Material Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and its process technology. But recently, at least one analyst, Ambrish Srivastava, of BMO Capital Partners, is having second thoughts, according to Barron’s magazine.
His concerns are that the company’s huge capital spending plans in the process of its turnaround will be expensive. It will not lead to Intel producing free cash flow (FCF) growth for a while. He also feels that the company’s plans to grow its revenue line by over 10% are not believable.
Where This Leaves INTC Stock
One reason why INTC stock looks to be undervalued is its dividend yield. Right now, Intel pays an annual dividend equal to $1.39 per share. That gives it a yield of 2.75%. However, every four quarters, the company tends to announce a quarterly increase.
Intel last announced its latest quarterly dividend on Sept. 16. That implies that sometime this coming month, in early January, Intl may announce a quarterly dividend increase for the next four quarters. Last year it increased the dividend on Jan. 16 from 33 cents quarterly to 34.75 cents or 5.3%.
Even if the dividend rate increase is only half of that or 2.5%, the new dividend per share (DPS) would be $1.425 annually. So, at today’s (Dec. 13) of $50.38, the dividend yield will be at least 2.75%. That is higher than the last couple days.
However, from a historical standpoint, INTC stock has a much higher yield than in the past. For example, Seeking Alpha has a page that shows that the average yield in the past 4 years has been 2.4%.
What INTC Stock Is Worth
We can use this to value INTC stock. For example, if we divide the conservatively estimated new dividend of $1.39 by 2.4%, we get a price of $58 per share. That represents a potential gain of $8.79 per share, or 17.4% (i.e., $8.79/$50.38 price today).
Moreover, if the board of directors decides to raise the DPS by its historical 5% rate, the new rate will be $1.46 per share. Therefore, assuming the stock trades at its historical 2.4% yield, the price target will be $60.83 per share next year. That represents a potential upside of 20% for the stock. This is why INTC stock is starting to look very cheap here today.

Intel: Mishaps Lead to Low Valuations
Intel is active in an industry with growth tailwinds, especially in the data center space and in areas such as automotive driving, where Intel has a strong market position thanks to its Mobileye division.
Despite market tailwinds and high R&D efforts, Intel has not executed very well in recent years, which is why it has lost market share to AMD and NVIDIA in high-value areas such as data centers and AI.
Process delays, such as the one that impacts its 7nm next-generation chips, have made it easy for Intel's competitors to gain market share at Intel's expense.
Nevertheless, Intel remains a highly profitable company that generates strong cash flows, which allow the company to invest heavily in future growth areas, including its Foundry business that seeks to make money by manufacturing chips that were designed by other companies.
Intel Is Very Inexpensive
The below-average growth rate in recent years, compared to the growth seen at AMD, NVIDIA, and many other semiconductor companies, has resulted in a pretty low valuation for Intel's shares.
The better operating performance of Intel's peers has made many investors favor those stocks over Intel, which is why their valuations are way higher than Intel's.
Based on current earnings per share estimates for this year, Intel is trading for just 9.5x net profits today, which results in an earnings yield of more than 10% -- which is very rare for tech stocks such as Intel.
Looking at Intel's EV/EBITDA multiple, which accounts for debt usage and thus makes comparisons between companies that employ leverage differently more easy, Intel looks inexpensive as well. Its forward EV/EBITDA multiple is just 7x, versus readings of more than 30 for its peers AMD and NVIDIA. Intel is the player with the weakest growth rate, but it is also, by far, the least expensive among these three chip peers.
The company generated free cash flows of $17.3 billion over the last four quarters, which results in a free cash flow multiple of just 11.8, which, again, is a relatively low valuation for a tech company with growth tailwinds such as Intel. When we consider that FCF is impacted by Intel's heavy investments, the low free cash flow multiple is even more surprising.
Intel's strong free cash flow generation also allows the company to return more cash to its owners compared to the shareholder payouts we see at many other semiconductor companies. Intel pays a dividend that is yielding 2.8% right now, with dividend growth coming in at 6% a year over the last five years.
Intel also has bought back shares at a pace of around $10 billion in recent years, although that has slowed down to just $2 billion over the last four quarters, as Intel is ramping up its growth spending.
All in all, Intel is looking like a solid choice in the semiconductor space -- its growth is not very strong, but thanks to large industry tailwinds, Intel should still be able to grow its business to some extent in the long run. At the same time, a very low valuation and an above-average dividend yield do result in solid income generation and multiple expansion potential.
Turning to Wall Street, Intel has a Hold consensus rating, based on the four Buys, 12 Holds, and seven Sells assigned in the last three months. At $53.80, the average Intel price target implies 7.2% upside potential.

2021-12-13 00:00:00+00:00,4 Red Flags for Intel's Future,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-red-flags-for-intels-future,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) might initially seem like an attractive investment for value-oriented income investors. The chipmaker's stock trades at just 10 times forward earnings and pays a forward dividend yield of 2.7%.
Intel's insider sentiment has also improved since Pat Gelsinger took over as its new CEO in February. Over the past 12 months, Intel's insiders bought nearly twice as many shares as they sold. But during that period, Intel's stock rose just 5% as the S&P 500 advanced nearly 30%. AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD) stock skyrocketed more than 50%. Intel's low valuation and high yield might limit its downside potential, but four red flags could also prevent it from outperforming the market.
Image source: Intel.
1. Its data center share losses to AMD
Between the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2021, Intel's share of the global x86 CPU market fell from 77.1% to 62.1%, according to PassMark Software. AMD's share rose from 22.9% to 37.7%. Intel's losses in the desktop and laptop markets were already disappointing, but its losses in the data center market -- which it traditionally dominated with its high-end Xeon CPUs -- were the most surprising.
During that period, Intel's share of the server market fell from 98.4% to 91.9%. AMD's share rose from 1.6% to 8.1%, with most of those gains occurring earlier this year. That pressure clearly indicates that AMD's EPYC chips are pulling big data center customers away from Intel's pricier Xeons. If Intel can't stop that bleeding, its data center group (DCG), which generated 34% of its revenue last quarter, could be in serious trouble.
2. Its ambitious plans to overtake TSMC and Samsung
Intel ceded the CPU market to AMD because it suffered from delays and chip shortages while falling behind TSMC (NYSE: TSM) and Samsung in the ""process race"" to manufacture smaller and more advanced chips. Intel manufactures its own chips, while AMD outsources the production of its highest-end chips to TSMC. So when Intel's own foundry failed to keep pace with TSMC's smaller nodes, it also lost its technological lead to AMD.
Before Gelsinger returned to Intel, his predecessor Bob Swan had flirted with the idea of becoming a ""fabless"" chipmaker like AMD. However, Gelsinger quickly scrapped that idea and doubled down on expanding Intel's manufacturing capabilities by investing billions of dollars into building new plants in the U.S. and Europe. Intel is also opening up its plants to third-party fabless chipmakers to compete against TSMC and Samsung.
Gelsinger believes Intel will catch up to TSMC and Samsung in the process race by 2024 then reclaim the lead by 2025. That bold claim raised a lot of eyebrows since TSMC already plans to spend about $100 billion over the next three years to expand its capacity and maintain its lead. Therefore, Intel will likely need to outspend TSMC to reclaim the lead in just four years, but it only allocated $18 billion to $19 billion to capital expenditure (CapEx) this fiscal year.
3. Its dependence on big government subsidies
Intel doesn't have enough cash to regain the process lead on its own, so it's asking the U.S. and Europe for large subsidies. In the U.S., Intel is pushing for the approval of the CHIPS act, which would grant $52 billion in subsidies to domestic chipmakers for the production of new stateside plants. Intel is also asking the European Commission to fund its development of new plants with nearly $10 billion in subsidies.
Intel claims that its plants will enable fabless chipmakers to reduce their dependence on TSMC, Samsung, and other Asian foundries. Gelsinger also argues that Chinese threats make Taiwan -- which is home to TSMC and its smaller rival UMC -- a more ""unstable"" region for chip production than the U.S.
Unfortunately, Intel's plan has a glaring flaw: The U.S. government views Taiwan as a crucial geopolitical ally, and it already granted TSMC subsidies for the construction of a new $12 billion plant in Arizona earlier this year. TSMC has also been urging Congress to include foreign chipmakers in the CHIPS act. If that happens, Intel's entire subsidy-funded expansion plan could fall apart.
4. It needs to suspend its dividends
Intel has already taken bold steps to raise more cash. It's in the process of selling its NAND memory chip business to SK Hynix for $9 billion, and it plans to spin off its automotive chip unit Mobileye in an initial public offering (IPO) to raise more cash. It also significantly reduced its buybacks this year.
But, Intel could free up significantly more cash by suspending its dividend, which used up $5.6 billion of its free cash flow (FCF) in 2020 and another $4.2 billion of its FCF in the first nine months of 2021. It doesn't make any sense for Intel to pay out billions of dollars in dividends while pleading for government subsidies. Intel could eventually realize that it's a bad look and suspend its dividend, but its income investors will flee.
A rocky road ahead
Intel's stock looks cheap, but these four red flags justify that discount. It's still struggling to keep pace with AMD, it's heavily dependent on future government subsidies, and it might need to suspend its dividend in the near future. Investors should stick with better-run chipmakers until more green shoots appear.

2021-12-13 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Stock Looks Undervalued And Poised For A Rally,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-stock-looks-undervalued-and-poised-for-a-rally,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has been among the major under-performers from the technology sector. During the last 12-months, the stock has remained sideways.
However, it seems very likely that INTC stock is poised for a trend reversal. This column will discuss the potential catalysts for 2022.
In terms of valuation, INTC stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings-ratio of 9.8. The stock clearly seems undervalued with the S&P 500 index trading at a cyclically adjusted P/E ratio of 38.3.
Of course, there have been growth headwinds for Intel and that’s the reason for the stock remaining depressed. I however believe that the company is taking corrective measures, which will show in the form of growth upside.
In a recent news, Intel announced the intent to take Mobileye public. It’s worth noting that Mobileye is positioned for 40% revenue growth in 2021 as compared to 2020. With the latter being a market leader in driver-assistance and autonomous driving solutions, healthy growth is likely to sustain in the coming years.
It’s being estimated that the public offering is likely to value Mobileye at more than $50 billion. Intel plans to retain majority stake. I believe that the potential listing will unlock value.
The company’s CEO, CEO Patrick Gelsinger, believes that the self-driving car unit will be comparable to Elon Musk’s Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the “tech-heavy future of the auto industry.” This is clearly bullish in terms of potential valuation upside for Mobileye.
It’s important to note that Intel has a market capitalization of $213 billion. Mobileye will therefore command a valuation that’s at least 25% of Intel’s market capitalization.
Once there is progress on the listing plans, INTC stock is likely to trend higher.
Investments and Innovation
In September 2021, Intel announced the initiation of construction for two new chip factories in Arizona. The company will be investing $20 billion in these factories.
7 Stocks to Buy Now for a Potential Year-End Rally
Additionally, Intel has guided for capital expenditure of $22 to $25 billion for 2022. The company believes that investments can be further scaled-up beyond the next year.
The big investment line-up is likely to translate into revenue and earnings growth over the next few years.
It’s also worth noting that Intel has been a laggard on a relative basis when it comes to innovation. That’s likely to change in the coming quarters. In Q1 2021, Intel will be launching the next generation discrete GPU for gaming. The line-up of innovation also includes Intel’s first ASIC-based IPU.
Intel has also been bullish on silicon photonics. The company believes that it can help in moving “information at light speed in datacenters and beyond.”
Intel recently launched an integrated photonics research center. The mission is to “pave the way for the next decade of compute interconnect.”
From a financial perspective, the following points are worth noting.
First, Intel reported cash and equivalents of $7.9 billion for Q3 2021. Additionally, the company has $4.0 billion in short-term investments. With a total cash buffer of nearly $12.0 billion, the company is well positioned for aggressive investments.
Further, for the first nine months of 2021, Intel reported operating cash flow of $24.2 billion. This would imply an annualized OCF of $32 billion. Therefore, even with a big investment target for the next few years, Intel is likely to remain free cash flow positive.
This is important to mention as Intel expects to increase dividends in the coming years. Considering the growth projects and cash flow visibility, INTC stock is worth holding for dividend investors.
Bottom Line
Intel seems to be fighting back from the perspective of innovation. At the same time, the global chip shortage creates an opportunity for growth. With Intel investing heavily in the new manufacturing facility, the results are likely to show in the next few years.
Considering the potential growth from investments, dividends and spin-off of Mobileye, INTC stock is a screaming buy at a forward P/E of less than 10.

2021-12-13 00:00:00+00:00,How The Pieces Add Up: QSY Targets $69,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-the-pieces-add-up%3A-qsy-targets-%2469,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the WisdomTree U.S. Quality Shareholder Yield Fund ETF (Symbol: QSY), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $69.01 per unit.
With QSY trading at a recent price near $62.28 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.80% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QSY's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Voya Financial Inc (Symbol: VOYA), Pioneer Natural Resources Co (Symbol: PXD), and Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC). Although VOYA has traded at a recent price of $63.23/share, the average analyst target is 18.26% higher at $74.78/share. Similarly, PXD has 16.64% upside from the recent share price of $184.25 if the average analyst target price of $214.90/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting INTC to reach a target price of $57.38/share, which is 13.41% above the recent price of $50.59. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of VOYA, PXD, and INTC:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
WisdomTree U.S. Quality Shareholder Yield Fund ETF QSY $62.28 $69.01 10.80%
Voya Financial Inc VOYA $63.23 $74.78 18.26%
Pioneer Natural Resources Co PXD $184.25 $214.90 16.64%
Intel Corp INTC $50.59 $57.38 13.41%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2021-12-11 00:00:00+00:00,Intel shows research for packing more computing power into chips beyond 2025,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-shows-research-for-packing-more-computing-power-into-chips-beyond-2025,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Dec 11 (Reuters) - Research teams at Intel Corp INTC.O on Saturday unveiled work that the company believes will help it keep speeding up and shrinking computing chips over the next ten years, with several technologies aimed at stacking parts of chips on top of each other.
Intel's Research Components Group introduced the work in papers at an international conference being held in San Francisco. The Silicon Valley company is working to regain a lead in making the smallest, fastest chips that it has lost in recent years to rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS.
While Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has laid out commercial plans aimed at regaining that lead by 2025, the research work unveiled Saturday gives a look into how Intel plans to compete beyond 2025.
One of the ways Intel is packing more computing power into chips by stacking up ""tiles"" or ""chiplets"" in three dimensions rather than making chips all as one two-dimension piece. Intel showed work Saturday that could allow for 10 times as many connections between stacked tiles, meaning that more complex tiles can be stacked on top of one another.
But perhaps the biggest advance showed Saturday was a research paper demonstrating a way to stack transistors - tiny switches that form the most basic building bocks of chips by representing the 1s and 0s of digital logic - on top of one another.
Intel believes the technology will yield a 30% to 50% increase in the number of transistors it can pack into a given area on a chip. Raising the number of transistors is the main reason chips have consistently gotten faster over the past 50 years.
""By stacking the devices directly on top of each other, we're clearly saving area,"" Paul Fischer, director and senior principal engineer of Intel's Components Research Group told Reuters in an interview. ""We're reducing interconnect lengths and really saving energy, making this not only more cost efficient, but also better performing.""

2021-12-11 00:00:00+00:00,"5 Reasons to Buy Apple, and 1 Reason to Sell",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-reasons-to-buy-apple-and-1-reason-to-sell,,,"Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock hit an all-time high on Dec. 9 after two influential analysts made bullish predictions about the tech giant's future.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives declared that global demand for the iPhone 13 was still outstripping its supply by about 10 million units, that its holiday sales would be strong, and that Apple's upcoming launch of an augmented reality (AR) headset would significantly boost its sales and profits next year.
Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty claimed Apple's price didn't reflect its upcoming AR, VR, and vehicle-related products yet, and that it would benefit from a ""flight to quality"" from other stocks. Both analysts have set a price target of $200 on Apple's stock -- roughly 14% above its current price.
Image source: Apple.
Is Apple's stock really such a great investment? Let's discuss five reasons to buy this tech bellwether -- as well as one reason to sell it -- to decide.
1. The iPhone's 90% loyalty rate
Apple's overwhelming dependence on the iPhone, which generated 52% of its revenue in fiscal 2021, is often cited as a major weakness by the bears. However, a recent study by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) indicates that 90% of iPhone buyers still plan to stick with Apple.
Two factors keep its users firmly locked in. First, Apple's expanding ecosystem of first-party services discourages its users from switching to Android devices. Second, iPhones are widely considered status symbols with a luxury appeal that even the priciest Android devices still can't match.
2. 745 million paid subscribers
Apple finished fiscal 2021 (which ended in September) with 745 million paid subscribers across all of its services, which represents nearly fivefold growth from five years ago. Its annual services revenue, which accounted for 19% of its top line in 2021, has nearly tripled over the past six years.
3. $191 billion in cash and equivalents
Apple ended the year with $191 billion in cash and marketable securities. That gives it plenty of room to expand its software and services ecosystem with new content, develop new AR devices, and invest in its secretive electric vehicle projects. Apple could also acquire more companies to accelerate those efforts and reduce its overall dependence on the iPhone.
4. It's well insulated from inflation
Rising inflation causes component and labor costs to rise. Therefore, companies that can't negotiate lower prices with their suppliers or pass those higher costs onto their consumers will suffer.
Apple doesn't need to worry about either headwind yet. It leverages the strength of its brand and the size of its orders to pressure suppliers to lower their costs, and it often splits orders for the same components between multiple suppliers to prevent them from gaining an edge in price negotiations.
Apple has also been designing more first-party chips to reduce its dependence on third-party chipmakers. That's why it replaced Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) CPUs with its own Arm-based CPUs in its Macs and MacBooks over the past year, and why it acquired Intel's baseband modem division to reduce its dependence on Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM).
As for passing on its higher costs to consumers, Apple's brand loyalty arguably gives it more room to raise its prices than other hardware makers. In short, Apple is much more resistant to inflation than other tech stocks.
5. $86 billion in buybacks
Apple bought back a whopping $86 billion in shares throughout fiscal 2021, which reduced its total number of outstanding shares by nearly 4%.
Over the past five years, Apple has reduced its share count by 22% as its stock price has soared nearly 500%. Apple will continue this tradition of big buybacks to tighten up its valuations for the foreseeable future.
The one reason to sell Apple: its forward valuation
I've owned Apple for many years, and I don't plan to sell my shares anytime soon. However, I'm not as bullish as Ives or Huberty on Apple's near-term future for a simple reason: Its stock is getting expensive.
Apple already trades at 30 times forward earnings. That's a very high price-to-earnings ratio for a company that is expected to grow its revenue and earnings by 4% and 2%, respectively, this year. Next year, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow just 4% and 7%, respectively.
At $200 a share, Apple would be trading at 35 times forward earnings -- which is a very high valuation even if we factor in its upcoming products in 2022.
Apple's upside potential could be limited
Apple is a great long-term investment, but investors who don't already own the stock should have realistic expectations about its upside potential. The stock might rally to $200 on the recent speculation about Apple's upcoming products, but I don't think those gains will be sustainable.
Investors can accumulate some shares of Apple now, but they shouldn't expect it to generate meaningful long-term gains until it actually releases its long-rumored AR, VR, and automotive products.

2021-12-10 00:00:00+00:00,7 Stocks to Buy Now for a Potential Year-End Rally,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-to-buy-now-for-a-potential-year-end-rally,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The holiday season has arrived. Bullish investors are hoping for a potential Santa Claus rally after what’s been a bumpy start to the last month of the year. As more information on the omicron variant continues to crop up, Wall Street’s worst fears of a large-scale lockdown seem to be fading away. Against this backdrop, I’ll discuss seven stocks to buy now for a potential year-end rally.
“We expect reopening dynamics to continue to drive returns at the start of the year as excess consumer savings are spent,” UBS (NYSE:UBS) remarked in its 2022 outlook report. “As the year progresses, we think business spending will play a larger role in driving returns, as companies expand capacity, restock inventories, and target increased market share.”
However, despite the positive outlook, the end of 2021 could turn out to be a choppy one. We are likely to see more near-term dips before the stock market reverses course and launches a dramatic year-end rally.
7 Christmas Stocks to Buy for a Jolly Ending to 2021
With that information, here are seven stocks to buy that should make great additions to a long-term portfolio before a potential year-end rally:
Bath and Body Works (NYSE:BBWI)
First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (NASDAQ:TDIV)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)
Stitch Fix (NASDAQ:SFIX)
Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC)
Twilio (NYSE:TWLO)
Stocks to Buy: Bath and Body Works (BBWI)

52-Week Range: $29.18 – $82
Columbus, Ohio-based retailer Bath & Body Works specializes in home fragrance and body care products. It generates most of its revenue in North America through the Bath & Body Works, C.O. Bigelow, and White Barn brands. In August, L Brands spun off Victoria’s Secret (NYSE:VSCO) and renamed the company as Bath & Body Works.
The retailer released third-quarter results on Nov. 17. Net sales came in at $1.68 billion, down from $1.7 billion a year ago. Adjusted net income came in at $245 million, or 92 cents per diluted share, up from $236 million, or 83 cents per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter.
On the results, CEO Andrew Meslow remarked, “In our first quarter as a standalone business, Bath & Body Works continued our positive momentum. We achieved third quarter results that exceeded our expectations, with a net sales increase of 53 percent and an adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increase of 360 percent compared to the third quarter of 2019.”
Bath & Body Works has delivered solid growth since August. Yet, rather than soaps and candles, the retailer has benefited primarily from hand sanitizers and self-care spending.
Thanks to its primarily domestic supply chain, the company is forecasting a robust fourth quarter this holiday season. BBWI stock is at $76 per share, up about 103% YTD. Shares are trading at 15.9 times forward earnings and 2.1 times trailing sales. The 12-month median price forecast for Bath & Body Works stock is $90.
First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (TDIV)

52-Week Range: $48.26 – $62.39
Expense Ratio: 0.5%
Our next discussion centers around an exchange-traded fund (ETF), namely the First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund. It provides exposure to dividend-paying technology or telecommunications firms listed stateside.
TDIV, which has 93 holdings, tracks the NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index. The fund started trading in August 2012, and assets under management stand at $1.75 billion. Funds are distributed among semiconductors and semiconductor equipment (38.75%), technology hardware, storage and peripherals (14.74%), software (14.57%) and telecommunication services (9.96%), and other segments.
The top 10 stocks in the fund constitute roughly 60% of all holdings. Among the leading names on the roster are Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Intel and IBM (NYSE:IBM).
Given the robust run-up in stock prices over the past year and growing uncertainty around the Omicron variant, the Street is becoming more selective about which tech names to include in portfolios right now. Thus, a potential Santa Claus rally will mostly depend on whether leading tech stocks can sustain their positive momentum during the holiday season. Therefore, a fund like TDIV could take the guesswork out of investing for many retail market participants.

TDIV is up 26% since the start of 2021. The ETF is trading at 21.6 times earnings and 4.2 times book value. Interested investors may consider buying the dip in the fund.
Stocks to Buy: Intel (INTC)

52-Week Range: $45.24 – $68.49
Santa Clara, California-based Intel is the world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturer. It is highly regarded for its microprocessors for global personal computer and data center markets.
Intel released Q3 results in late October. Total revenue increased 5% YOY to $19.2 billion. It delivered “all-time record revenue in Intel’s Internet of Things Group (IOTG) and record third-quarter revenue in the Data Center Group (DCG) and Mobileye businesses.” Non-GAAP net income came in at $7 billion, or $1.71 per diluted share, up 54% YOY from $4.5 billion a year ago. Cash and equivalents ended the period at $7.87 billion.
After the announcement, CEO Pat Gelsinger remarked, “Q3 shone an even greater spotlight on the global demand for semiconductors, where Intel has the unique breadth and scale to lead. Our focus on execution continued as we started delivering on our IDM 2.0 commitments.”
Management aims to set the stage for future growth as it goes through a period of high capital expenditure. It has pledged to invest $20 billion in two cutting-edge semiconductor foundries in Arizona. Meanwhile, analysts forecast the Internet of Things segment will become the key growth driver over the next few years.
Intel recently announced plans to take its Mobileye autonomous vehicle business public. Intel hopes to capture a considerable share of the lucrative self-driving technology market.
INTC stock hovers slightly below $51, up 1% YTD. The current price offers a dividend yield of 2.7%. Shares are trading at 14.3 times forward earnings and 2.7 times trailing sales. And the 12-month median price forecast for Intel stands at $55.
Shopify (SHOP)

52-Week Range: $1,005.14 – $1,762.92
Ottawa, Canada-based Shopify offers an e-commerce platform tailored mainly for small and midsize businesses that want to have an online commerce presence. The company has recently launched Shopify Markets, with the aim of making cross-border commerce easier and safer for entrepreneurs.
Shopify released Q3 results on Oct. 28. Revenue rose 46% YOY to $1.12 billion. Investors were pleased to see that the Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) reached $41.8 billion.
Adjusted net income declined to $102.8 million, or 81 cents per diluted share, below $140.8 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Cash and marketable securities ended the quarter at $7.52 billion.
On the metrics, company President Harley Finkelstein remarked, “It took 15 years for our merchants to get to $200 billion in cumulative GMV, and just 16 months to double that to $400 billion.”
Shopify is well-positioned to benefit from Omicron variant disruptions could push people to spend more online. Analysts also suggest that a potential dovish vibe from the Federal Reserve could mean further tailwinds for Shopify’s near-term growth.

SHOP stock is at $1,465, up 29% this year. Shares are currently trading at 278 times forward earnings and 43 times trailing sales. In other words, from a valuation standpoint, they are frothy. Nonetheless, the 12-month median price forecast for Shopify stands at $1,700.
Stocks to Buy: Stitch Fix (SFIX)

52-Week Range: $17.92 – $113.76
San Francisco, California-based Stitch Fix provides personal style service for its customers. It relies on artificial intelligence (AI) software to create personalized collection of apparel, accessories, or shoes suited for clients. Management sees further upside potential in its long-term addressable market.
Stitch Fix released Q1 FY22 results on Dec. 7. Net revenue increased 19% YOY to $581 million. Net loss was $1.8 million, or 2 cents loss per diluted share, compared to a net income of $9.5 million, or 9 cents per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Cash and equivalents ended the period at $250 million.
CEO Elizabeth Spaulding remarked, “Our revenue per active client topped $500 for the second quarter in a row, reaching a record $524 across our nearly 4.2 million clients. These quarterly results reflect a strong performance in our business from both Fix and Freestyle.”
SFIX stock is around $19 per share, down 67% YTD. Shares are trading at just 1.2 times trailing sales. The depressed valuation limits downside risk and offers an opportunity to buy SFIX shares at a discount. Finally, the 12-month median price forecast for Stitch Fix stands at $23.50.
Teladoc Health (TDOC)

52-Week Range: $88.25 – $308
Virtual health provider Teladoc Health became a household name during the pandemic. Its telehealth platform has enabled millions of Americans to access on-demand healthcare from their homes. Management now aims to take advantage of its first-mover advantage in the telemedicine market.
Teladoc released Q3 results in late October. Revenue soared 81% YOY to $522 million. But net loss widened to $84.3 million, or 53 cents per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $35.9 million, or 43 cents loss per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Cash and equivalents ended the period at $823.8 million.
On the results, CEO Jason Gorevic remarked, “Our strong performance in the third quarter reflects our continued success in leading the transformation of healthcare delivery and expanding access for all.”
Wall Street believes Teladoc is well-positioned for long-term growth as it expends the range of services. Management anticipates revenue to surpass $2 billion this year, representing more than 80% YOY growth following sky-high results of 2020.

Appetite for virtual healthcare stocks faded away as social distancing efforts eased in 2021. TDOC stock plunged 32% in November. It currently hovers at $95 territory, down 53% YTD. Investors may consider taking a long position following the recent dip. TDOC is trading at 7.9 times trailing sales. The 12-month median price forecast for Teladoc stands at $161.50.
Stocks to Buy: Twilio (TWLO)

52-Week Range: $235 – $457.30
San Francisco, California-based Twilio is a communications-platform-as-a-service (CPaaS) company. Through its platform, developers can integrate audio, SMS text or email functionality into applications so that companies can better engage with their clients.
Its early-mover advantage has allowed Twilio to reach over a quarter-million developers. Management recently launched the Twilio Engage platform, which offers marketers tools, analytics, data integrations, and messaging to launch analyze marketing campaigns.
Twilio released Q3 results in late October. Revenue increased 65% YOY to $740 million. Non-GAAP income came in at $8.2 million, or 1 cent per share, up from $7.3 million in the prior-year quarter and far better than the 14 cents per share loss management had previously anticipated. Cash and short-term investments ended the quarter at $5.39 billion.
After the announcement, CEO Jeff Lawson remarked, “We are extremely excited about the next generation of our customer engagement platform, and our newest pillar, Twilio Engage, which will allow companies of all sizes and in any industry to build and optimize hyper-personalized marketing campaigns on every channel for customer acquisition, conversion and retention.”
TWLO stock is currently 40% below its all-time high in February. It currently hovers at $270 territory, down 20% YTD.  Shares are trading at 16.5 times trailing sales. The 12-month median price forecast for Twilio stands at $410.

The stock market is still hanging tough near it’s all-time highs. However, investor sentiment is nowhere near that. In fact, it is the one variable that keeps flip-flopping on us. We have become headline traders as a baseline. There’s much less emphasis on fundamentals, which left Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock at a disadvantage. Boring and non-flamboyant stocks fell off traders’ radars.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) hog the headlines. But Intel is bigger than both of them combined and twice over. This was my bullish thesis last week to my chatroom members. Then it popped 12% out of the blue on headlines.
Intel is looking to spin Mobileye off onto its own. Now that’s the kind of headline the new investors chase.
I emphasize new investors because those with more experience would not have. They would not have bought it on a headline going into prior failure levels. Those who bought the pop are sitting on fast losses. Now is a better time to get in, not on Monday.
7 Christmas Stocks to Buy for a Jolly Ending to 2021
INTC stock is still a bargain by all definitions. Nevertheless, I would not go all in. Instead, I’d leave room for error.
Outside Risks Exist With INTC Stock
I recognize INTC’s value, so I anticipate the setup for a long-term stock recovery. It is still the behemoth in the field and it will regain investor confidence. Management has been lackluster for too long, and just like GE (NYSE:GE), for example, they will need to snap out of it. Committing long at these levels is sane, but there are outside risks.
The indices bring a threat to timing because we could correct from these altitudes. The macroeconomic conditions do not demand it, because there’s just too much money in circulation.
Spending trillions requires a lot of time. In fact, we could spend $1 million a day and need 2,740 years to burn only $1 trillion. Therefore, inflation is here to stay regardless of what the Federal Reserve does. They could talk tough, but I doubt they will be too hawkish. This leaves INTC stock to recover nicely off the lows that it just made.
Intel Is Cheap
Valuation is a selling point and will not be a detriment for a long time. It has a price-to-earnings ratio that just exceeded the single digits. Its price-the-sales ratio is under 3x, so there’s very little premium in the price. Investors have been too humble with their assessment of the stock price.
Total revenues have grown steadily in past years even through the pandemic. Net income more than doubled in 4 years. Clearly management is making the best out of its tepid sales growth. Intel’s management is flowing revenues freely to the bottom line. After all, this is the end game for every company regardless of the business they’re in.
With that in mind, let’s recap the situation for INTC stock. Sales are growing albeit not too fast, and the bottom line is exploding higher. Moreover, the valuation has continued to fall steadily. Sign me up, as this is the definition of having more upside potential than downside risk.
INTC: Lean But Not Yet Mean
Source: Charts by TradingView
There isn’t a lot of fat on this stock, so it can absorb a correction better than others. NVDA and AMD, even though they are not exorbitantly expensive, have easier froth to shed if equities stumble. My overall macroeconomic outlook is still positive. As such, I don’t insist on having a correction.
However, investors should be ready for that just in case. No one should be all in with anything regardless of how good the deal is. At the end of the day, overall demand on Intel products will remain strong for as long as this digitization trend explodes higher.

2021-12-10 00:00:00+00:00,Why Ambarella Stock Jumped This Week,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-ambarella-stock-jumped-this-week,,,"What happened
Ambarella (NASDAQ: AMBA) shareholders beat the market this week as the stock jumped as high as 11% through Thursday trading before settling to a 7% increase.
The push put the semiconductor chip tech specialist at a return of over 120% so far in 2021 and was powered by rising optimism about its business.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Ambarella attracted a head-turning upgrade from a Wall Street investing firm earlier in the week. Sales growth expectations are rising for the company, whose products power computer vision, artificial intelligence, and driver assistance cameras.
Shares were also pushed higher on news that Intel is spinning off Mobileye, its autonomous driving platform, into public markets. The move highlights growing demand in the space, and likely expanding valuations for its key players.
Now what
Ambarella laid the foundation for this week's stock price move by announcing strong third-quarter results a week earlier. Sales jumped 64% in the period that ended in late October, management said on Nov. 30, and profitability expanded.
CEO Fermi Wang and his team expressed optimism about its Q4 sales and earnings outlook despite continued supply challenges on key manufacturing components. That bullish forecast echoed the bright forecasts that larger peers such as Nvidia have issued in recent weeks.
Ambarella's smaller selling niche makes it more vulnerable to competition than huge players like Nvidia. However, the markets it serves, particularly electronics manufacturers in need of computer vision solutions, are growing quickly enough to support many winners in the space. As a result, Ambarella shares might move higher if the tech stock continues delivering value to these customers.

When it comes to solving the semiconductor shortage, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) stock is at the front of the line.
Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.com
Before Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs the chips and before Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) makes the chips, Applied must make the necessary manufacturing gear.
This made 2021 a grand year to own AMAT stock. Shares are up 82% through early December. They closed Dec. 8 near an all-time high, at $157.29 each. Despite this, the price-to-earnings ratio of 24.58 is not excessive. Analysts at Citigroup (NYSE:C) are pounding the table for the stock, telling investors to buy, buy, buy.
A Banner Year
Applied announced fourth quarter earnings on Nov. 18 and the results couldn’t be finer. Net income was $5.9 billion, $6.40 per share, up 63% from the previous year.. Revenue of $23 billion was up 34%, and the net operating margin was 33%. Numbers were even better on a non-GAAP basis.
If you want to find a touch of gray in those numbers, fourth quarter gains trailed those of the full fiscal year. Also, the chip shortage is hitting the chip equipment market, according to CEO Gary Dickerson. “We expect supply shortages of certain silicon components to persist in the near-term,” he said. About $300 million in expected fourth quarter revenue had to be pushed into fiscal 2022.
7 Stocks to Buy as Biden Picks Powell for Fed Chair
What that means is that the good times should continue to roll, even longer than what might be expected. Semiconductors have in the past been a boom-and-bust business, prices firming until demand is exhausted, then falling hard. What’s happening now is a “super-cycle,” with new cloud-and-device based applications continuing to soak up supplies.
Not the Only Winner
Back in the 20th century, when my brother-in-law worked for Applied, the company’s fate was closely tied to that of Intel. This is no longer the case. Today it’s based on investing ahead of growth in artificial intelligence and robotics. Applied has also expanded far beyond its Santa Clara base, even opening two facilities next year in Kalispell, Montana.
Applied does have competition, with LAM Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) often touted as an industry winner. But in 2021, Applied’s stock performance has outpaced LAM’s by about 2-1.
This puts AMAT stock in rarified company, alongside that of Nvidia, which is up 130% so far in 2021. Net income at Applied Materials has been rising twice as fast as revenue, and in semiconductor systems it’s up 78%.
Any Bears Around?
You can’t buy yesterday in the stock market, only tomorrow. There are always going to be bears, even in a stock like Applied. That’s good, because if everyone is in a stock, there’s no one left to buy, and the price must go down.
In the case of Applied, the bear case is based on lower-than-expected forecasts, which have some preferring the chip makers to their suppliers. You also have those who say this year’s run-up can’t be repeated. Of 18 analysts following Applied and tracked by TipRanks, just three are calling it a “hold” for exactly that reason.
The Bottom Line on AMAT Stock
Downgrades of Applied stock, like one issued in September by New Street Research, are generally tactical in nature. Since the New Street downgrade, the AMAT stock price is up only 3%.
But tactical downgrades should not worry long-term investors. Over time, such things tend to even out. Applied is one of those stocks you can accumulate steadily, with confidence that its value will hold and even rise. Not every year will be 2021, but the stock’s not expensive, and “normal” performance should suit your portfolio fine.

Dec 9 (Reuters) - A $52 billion bill aimed at bolstering the U.S. semiconductor industry will include funding for chip design activities, a U.S. commerce department official told Reuters, addressing concerns the funds would mostly support manufacturing.
The CHIPS Act, which passed the Senate as part of a larger package of funding in June, is meant to reverse a longstanding trend in which most chip manufacturing capacity has shifted to Taiwan, Korea and other parts of Asia. Chip industry advocates had hoped the bill would become law this year, though U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said this week the bill could slip to 2022.
Once passed, the next phase will be to carve up the money, an effort likely to be led by the Commerce Department. Intel Corp INTC.O, the biggest U.S. manufacturer of chips, has lobbied aggressively to position itself for potential funding.
But most of the rest of America's biggest chip firms, such as Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, focus their efforts on design and rely on partners for manufacturing.
Some of those firms have expressed frustration to government officials that the act focuses on manufacturing instead of design work, where rivals like China are also trying to gain an edge over the United States just as they are in manufacturing.
Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves told Reuters that the department views design as an essential part of building a more robust chip sector and plans to support it.
""You can't divorce the design side, the innovation side, the research side, from the manufacturing side,"" Graves said while traveling through Silicon Valley to speak with industry officials. ""Once the CHIPS Act gets passed, we'll be very focused on investing to make sure that part of the ecosystem is getting the investment and support that it needs.""

2021-12-09 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Is Taking Mobileye Public. Is an Acquisition Looming?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-is-taking-mobileye-public.-is-an-acquisition-looming,,,"In this video, I will be talking about Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) intent to take Mobileye public at a rumored $50 billion valuation and what that could mean for the company. You can find the video below, but here are some highlights.
Mobileye went public in 2014 and was acquired by Intel in 2017. Intel currently owns 100% of Mobileye and is expected to retain majority ownership following completion of the IPO. The valuation is rumored to be around $50 billion.
Last quarter, Intel reported that Mobileye had generated $326 million, up 39% year over year. Unsurprisingly, it is one of Intel's fastest-growing segments.
Several months ago, news broke that Intel was considering acquiring chipmaker GlobalFoundries for $30 billion. The company was spun out of AMD in 2008. The tricky part here is that GlobalFoundries still counts AMD as a key customer, so a potential Intel takeover might be a deal breaker.
Intel might use the money raised through this IPO to further fund the company's efforts to turn the ship around or potentially acquire another chipmaker.
Today there are close to 1,400 chips in a typical vehicle, and that number is only going to increase as the industry continues its move toward electric vehicles. The average electric vehicle has over 2,000 chips. According to Intel, the share of semiconductors is expected to be 20% of a premium vehicle's total bill of materials by 2030.

2021-12-08 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Processing its Entry into Advanced Driver Assistance,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-processing-its-entry-into-advanced-driver-assistance,,,"Semiconductors have been a hot topic for nearly the past year, the supply of which came into concern for several industries after a perfect storm of high demand, labor constraints, and shipping bottlenecks.
While companies like Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) and Samsung (GB:SMSD) made their shift to 5nm wafers long ago, American Intel Corp. (INTC) has lagged behind.
In response, the large processor firm has made strides to construct several more advanced wafer fabrication sites and has been investing in strategic initiatives in search for organic growth. (See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks) 
Reporting on one of these potentially pivotal initiatives is Tristan Gerra of Robert W. Baird, who broke down a news flash from the Wall Street Journal that Intel intends to publicly float its acquired Mobileye business.
INTC purchased the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) firm for about $15 billion in 2017, and now plans for a $50-billion valuation.  
Gerra rated the stock a Buy, and assigned a price target of $60. This target suggests potential 12-month upside of 16.4%.
The bullish five-star analyst added that Mobileye currently accounts for between 60-65% of the global Level 2 ADAS market share, and has a pipeline which includes robotaxis hitting the streets of Tel Aviv and Munich as early as 2022. The company has a strong partnership with LiDAR developer Luminar (LAZR), which is expected to continue at least until 2025.  
Despite Intel’s lofty and ambitious long-term roadmap, Gerra remains confident. He went on to write that he believes “Intel will continue to pursue the critical automotive central compute platform,” and that Mobileye's public listing is “incrementally positive” for both INTC and LAZR.  
Gerra has one opinion, but a crowd may have another. To debate on INTC’s roadmap and plans for Mobileye, check out our Intel discussion forum.  
On TipRanks, INTC has an analyst rating consensus of Hold, based on four Buy, 12 Hold, and seven Sell ratings. The average Intel price target is $53.80, reflecting a possible 12-month upside of 4.3%.
