2021-01-18 00:00:00+00:00,"EXCLUSIVE-Trump admin slams China's Huawei, halting shipments from Intel, others -sources",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-trump-admin-slams-chinas-huawei-halting-shipments-from-intel-others-sources-2,,,"By Karen Freifeld and Alexandra Alper
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The Trump administration notified Huawei suppliers, including chipmaker Intel, that it is revoking certain licenses to sell to the Chinese company and intends to reject dozens of other applications to supply the telecommunications firm, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The action - likely the last against Huawei Technologies HWT.UL under Republican President Donald Trump - is the latest in a long-running effort to weaken the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, which Washington sees as a national security threat.
The notices came amid a flurry of U.S. efforts against China in the final days of Trump's administration. Democrat Joe Biden will take the oath of office as president on Wednesday.
Huawei and Intel Corp INTC.O declined to comment. Commerce said it could not comment on specific licensing decisions, but said the department continues to work with other agencies to ""consistently"" apply licensing policies in a way that ""protects U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.""
In an email seen by Reuters documenting the actions, the Semiconductor Industry Association said on Friday the Commerce Department had issued ""intents to deny a significant number of license requests for exports to Huawei and a revocation of at least one previously issued license."" Sources familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was more than one revocation. One of the sources said eight licenses were yanked from four companies.
Japanese flash memory chip maker Kioxia Corp had at least one license revoked, two of the sources said. The company, formerly known as Toshiba Memory Corp, said it does not ""disclose business details regarding specific products or customers.""
The semiconductor association's email said the actions spanned a ""broad range"" of products in the semiconductor industry and asked companies whether they had received notices.
The email noted that companies had been waiting ""many months"" for licensing decisions, and with less than a week left in the administration, dealing with the denials was a challenge.
A spokesman for the semiconductor group declined to comment.
Companies that received the ""intent to deny"" notices have 20 days to respond, and the Commerce Department has 45 days to advise them of any change in a decision or it becomes final. Companies would then have another 45 days to appeal.
The United States put Huawei on a Commerce Department ""entity list"" in May 2019, restricting suppliers from selling U.S. goods and technology to it.
But some sales were allowed and others denied while the United States intensified its crackdown on the company, in part by expanding U.S. authority to require licenses for sales of semiconductors made abroad with American technology.
Before the latest action, some 150 licenses were pending for $120 billion worth of goods and technology, which had been held up because various U.S. agencies could not agree on whether they should be granted, a person familiar with the matter said.
License applications usually seek permission for items suppliers are hoping to ship over four years, typically highball the estimated values, and do not need to be backed by purchase orders, the source and industry experts said.
Another $280 billion of license applications for goods and technology for Huawei still have not been processed, the source said, but now are more likely to be denied.
Intel has received licenses from U.S. authorities to continue supplying certain products to Huawei, an Intel spokesman said last September.
An August rule said that products with 5G capabilities were likely to be rejected, but sales of less sophisticated technology would be decided on a case-by-case basis.
The United States made the latest decisions during a half dozen meetings starting on Jan. 4 with senior officials from the departments of Commerce, State, Defense and Energy, the source said. The officials developed detailed guidance with regard to which technologies were capable of 5G, and then applied that standard, the person added.
That meant issuing denials for the vast majority of the roughly 150 disputed applications, and revoking the eight licenses to make those consistent with the latest denials, the source said.
The U.S. action came after pressure from a recent Trump appointee in the Commerce Department, Corey Stewart, who wanted to push through hard-line China policies after being hired for a two-month stint in the agency at the end of the administration.
Trump has targeted Huawei in other ways. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, was arrested in Canada in December 2018, on a U.S. warrant. Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, and the company itself were indicted for misleading banks about its business in Iran.
Meng has said she is innocent. Huawei has denied the claims of spying and pleaded not guilty to the indictment, which also includes charges of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and conspiring to steal trade secrets from American technology companies.

2021-01-18 00:00:00+00:00,3 Breakout Stocks to Watch in 2021,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-breakout-stocks-to-watch-in-2021-2021-01-18,,,"Many stocks generated explosive gains in 2020, even as businesses closed down and unemployment rates climbed throughout the pandemic. Tech stocks in particular attracted lots of bulls, as they were well-insulated from those headwinds and benefited from stay-at-home trends.
As a new year starts, investors are probably looking for a new batch of breakout stocks that could generate comparable returns this year. Today I'll highlight three of those potential winners: Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Sea Limited (NYSE: SE).
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Baidu
Baidu's stock tread water throughout most of 2020 as the Chinese search giant's ad revenue declined year over year for six straight quarters. It blamed that slowdown on macro headwinds, including the sluggish growth of the Chinese economy and the pandemic, and competition from other platforms. It previously offset those declines with the growth of its video platform iQiyi, but even iQiyi gradually lost its momentum.
But over the past two months, Baidu's stock suddenly surged more than 70%. That rally was sparked by several major developments. First, Baidu's quarterly revenue rose year over year for the first time in three quarters. Its revenue rose just 1% during the third quarter, but its guidance for 4% growth in the fourth quarter indicated its advertising business was finally recovering.
Baidu also agreed to buy JOYY's YY Live streaming platform to diversify its business away from search-based ads, and it recently partnered with the Chinese automaker Geely to develop electric vehicles. Those tailwinds, along with the recent revelation that Baidu wouldn't be added to the growing investment blacklist in the U.S., propelled the stock to its highest levels since mid-2018.
But even after that rally, Baidu's stock still trades at just 19 times forward earnings and less than two times next year's sales. Therefore, Baidu's stock could still have lots of room to run this year, especially if its core advertising business returns to growth and it continues to expand its ecosystem of cloud, AI, and driverless services.
2. Intel
Intel's stock declined nearly 20% in 2020 as the chipmaker struggled with chip shortages and delays. It fell behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing in the ""process race"" to create smaller and more power-efficient chips, it ceded market share to Advanced Micro Devices in the PC market, and big customers like Microsoft and Apple started developing their own silicon to replace Intel's chips.
Image source: Getty Images.
Instead of aggressively fixing those issues, CEO Bob Swan, the former CFO who took the helm in early 2019, focused on divesting Intel's non-core businesses, cutting costs, and repurchasing shares to boost the company's earnings. But Swan's lack of engineering experience worried investors, especially since AMD and NVIDIA are both led by seasoned engineers.
That's why Intel's stock recently surged to its highest levels in over a year after the company replaced Swan with former VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger. Gelsinger, who holds a master's degree in electrical engineering, previously served as Intel's chief technology officer, and was actually the architect of the original Intel 80486 processor.
Gelsinger's arrival, along with reports that Intel would outsource the production of some of its chips to TSMC, generated fresh hope that Intel would resolve its R&D and production issues this year. If that happens, Intel's stock -- which trades at just 11 times forward earnings -- could hit fresh highs.
3. Sea Limited
Shares of Sea soared nearly 400% in 2020 as the Singapore-based tech company dazzled investors with its robust revenue growth. Its revenue rose 163% in fiscal 2019, then jumped another 101% year over year to $2.81 billion in the first nine months of 2020.
Sea's gaming unit, Garena, locked in gamers with its hit battle royale game Free Fire, the highest-grossing mobile game in Southeast Asia and Latin America. Garena's profits subsidized the expansion of its e-commerce platform Shopee, which surpassed Alibaba's Lazada as Southeast Asia's top online marketplace last year.
Sea remains unprofitable, but it generated a positive adjusted EBITDA in the first nine months of the year as Garena's profits offset Shopee's losses. Analysts expect Sea's revenue to rise 78% this year and 46% next year, for its adjusted EBITDA to remain positive, and for its net losses to narrow in fiscal 2021.
It might seem foolish to call Sea a breakout stock after its massive gains in 2020, but I believe it could soar much higher, for two reasons. First, Garena will likely keep growing as Shopee gains more shoppers, reduces its loss per order, and supports the growth of its SeaMoney fintech services.
Second, Sea trades at less than 16 times next year's sales. Many tech companies that generate slower growth still trade at much higher price-to-sales ratios than Sea -- which suggests its stock is still overlooked by many growth-oriented investors. If they start paying more attention, its stock could easily hit new highs in 2021.

2021-01-18 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia: Can Anything Stop This Train?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia%3A-can-anything-stop-this-train-2021-01-18,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of those companies that can make a humble reporter look like a genius. I called NVDA stock a “bullet train” in 2016, when the shares passed $100.  I pointed out how not all its success was tied to gaming in 2019.

When I finally took my own advice, it made my eventual retirement look golden. Shares I bought for $157 in 2019 opened January 15 at $530.
But I must admit I took some profits recently, selling part of my position at $511. Did I make a mistake?
Clouds Around NVDA Stock
What pushed Nvidia shares over $500 was the agreement to buy ARM Holdings from Softbank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) for $40 billion, a deal announced in September.
ARM designs lie inside Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) chips, as well as those of the other Cloud Czars. The deal puts Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and even Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) squarely in Nvidia’s sights. But since the deal went down shares have been stuck in a trading range. They’re up only 2.5% while the average NASDAQ stock is up 18.5%.
Why? One reason could be skepticism the ARM deal will ever go down. Regulators in many countries must approve it. China has been slow-walking to tech acquisitions, as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) now knows well. The incoming Administration may not be as sanguine as the outgoing one was. Europeans also must go along.
9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon
Then there’s the valuation. Nvidia is now worth $327 billion. Its 2020 sales were under $20 billion. The price to earnings ratio is 86x, and the 16 cent/share quarterly dividend now yields just .12%. Add the moves of Apple and the other Czars toward their own designs (even if they’re based on ARM). Add the recent move by Intel to finally get its act together, hiring Pat Gelsinger from VMWare (NYSE:VMW) as its CEO.
Who Should Buy Now?
None of this has chased out all bullish sentiment. Of 18 analysts following the stock at Tipranks, 14 still say buy it. Their price target of $597 is 13% above the current price. Valuewalk calls NVDA stock the “slam dunk of the decade.”
There is still a lot to like. Gaming remains strong, giving one analyst a $650 price target. As I wrote years ago, gaming offers designers the cutting-edge when it comes to speed and features. Nvidia began as a graphics chip maker for gaming PCs.
There’s now a gaming chip shortage, with Nvidia boards selling well above their list price. Nvidia remains hungry, re-starting production for cryptocurrency miners.  It has announced a new, less-expensive chip for laptops that should keep gamers salivating. Nvidia design leaks are now followed as avidly as those for Intel once were.
Then there’s the car market. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says software will soon define auto profit, and hardware is increasingly software. (Nvidia doesn’t own any fabrication plants.) Nvidia can create a “halo effect” around cars that support it, as was shown recently with Nio (NYSE:NIO), which hit an all-time high after agreeing to work with it.
I sold half my Nvidia position and put some of it into Intel while drawing out cash. I haven’t left the stock, and don’t advise others to.
I now have a real profit in Nvidia, but I haven’t sold out of it. It’s still a great long-term holding. But when an investor sees a big gain, it’s wise to take something off the table. You don’t really have a profit, in any stock or security, until you sell it and have cash in your hand.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The Trump administration notified Huawei suppliers, including chipmaker Intel, that it is revoking certain licenses to sell to the Chinese company and intends to reject dozens of other applications to supply the telecommunications firm, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The action - likely the last against Huawei Technologies HWT.UL under Republican President Donald Trump - is the latest in a long-running effort to weaken the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, which it says is a threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.
The notices came amid a flurry of U.S. efforts against China in the final days of Trump's administration. Democrat Joe Biden will take the oath of office as president on Wednesday.
An Intel Corp INTC.O spokesman had no immediate comment, and a Commerce Department spokesman did not immediately return requests for comment.
In an email seen by Reuters documenting the actions, the Semiconductor Industry Association said on Friday the Commerce Department had issued ""intents to deny a significant number of license requests for exports to Huawei and a revocation of at least one previously issued license."" Sources familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was more than one revocation. One of the sources said eight licenses were yanked from four companies.
Japanese flash memory chip maker Kioxia Corp had at least one license revoked, two of the sources said. The company, formerly known as Toshiba Memory Corp, could not immediately be reached for comment.
The semiconductor association's email said the actions spanned a ""broad range"" of products in the semiconductor industry and asked companies whether they had received notices.
The email noted that companies had been waiting ""many months"" for licensing decisions, and with less than a week left in the administration, dealing with the denials was a challenge.
A spokesman for the semiconductor group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Companies that received the ""intent to deny"" notices have 20 days to respond, and the Commerce Department has 45 days to advise the companies of any change in a decision or it then becomes final. Companies would then have another 45 days to appeal.
The United States put Huawei on a Commerce Department ""entity list"" in May 2019, restricting suppliers from selling U.S. goods and technology to the company.
But some sales were allowed and others were denied while the United States ratcheted up the restrictions against the company, including expanding U.S. authority to require licenses for sales of semiconductors made abroad with American technology.
Before the latest action, some 150 licenses were pending for $120 billion worth of goods and technology, which had been held up because various U.S. agencies could not agree on whether they should be granted, a person familiar with the matter said.
Another $280 billion of licenses for goods and technology for Huawei still have not been dealt with, the source said, but now face a higher likelihood of denial.
An August rule said that products with 5G capabilities were likely to be denied, but sales of less sophisticated technology would be decided on a case-by-case basis.
The United States made the latest decisions during a half dozen meetings starting on Jan. 4 with senior officials from the departments of Commerce, State, Defense and Energy, the source said. The officials developed detailed guidance with regard to which technologies were capable of 5G, and then applied that standard, the person said.
By doing that, the officials denied the vast majority of the roughly 150 disputed applications, and revoked the eight licenses to make those consistent with the new denials, the source said.
The U.S. action came after pressure from a recent Trump appointee in the Commerce Department, Corey Stewart, who wanted to push through hard-line China policies after being hired for a two-month stint in the agency at the end of the administration.
The United States has targeted Huawei in other ways during the administration. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, was arrested in Canada in December 2018, on a U.S. warrant. Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, and the company itself were indicted for misleading banks about the company's business in Iran.
Meng has said she is innocent. Huawei has denied the claims of spying and has pleaded not guilty to the indictment, which also includes charges of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and conspiring to steal trade secrets from American technology companies.

he stock market’s record-shattering rally from the March 2020 lows have been nothing short of remarkable. But how much higher can we go, particularly as COVID cases (and deaths) in the United States continue to rise? That answer is starting to become a bit more clear.
Although President-elect Joe Biden late Thursday announced a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan, it will take more than that amount, not to mention time, before it trickles into the economy in a meaningful way. What’s more, Friday’s U.S. December retail sales data, which showed a decline for the third consecutive month, doesn’t inspire confidence for the degree of growth the market expected for during the holiday shopping season. So, it’s not a surprise that several retail stocks saw heavy selling pressure Friday, leading the broader market lower.
On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 177 points, or 0.57%, to close at 30,814.26. But at one point, the Blue Chip index fell as much as 378.85 points at Friday’s low. The leading decliners on the Dow were Walmart (WMT), Coca-Cola (KO) and International Business Machines (IBM). The S&P 500 Index lost 27.29 points, or 0.72%, to close at 3,768.25, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 114.14 points, or 0.87%, to close at 12,998.50.
It’s safe to say that some investors are surprised by the market reaction, despite the president-elect’s coronavirus relief plan which included not only $1,400 cash payments to households, but also supplemental unemployment payments as well as money for distributing COVID-19 vaccines. The market’s “sell-the-news” reaction would suggest that the attention is now on Q4 earnings. And there are some concerns, given the downbeat U.S. December retail sales data, that earnings might disappoint.
This week as the fourth quarter earnings season kicks into high gear, with results expected from technology heavyweights Netflix (NFLX) and Intel (INTC) - both of which have something to prove. For Netflix, can it maintain its status as the king of streaming? For Intel, fresh on the heels of announcing a change in leadership, the chip giant must convince that it can quickly turn things around. As for the broader sector this earnings season, estimates call for a decline of 6.8%, which if achieved, will be the fourth largest earnings decline since Q3 2009, according to Factset.
While that’s not an encouraging figure, we are in a pandemic, after all. That said, the market is known to punish companies for falling short of expectations and issuing weak guidance. With stocks trading near all-time highs, there won’t be any mercy for disappointment.
All that said, here are this week’s earnings I’ll be watching.
Netflix (NFLX) - Reports after the close, Tuesday, Jan. 29
Wall Street expects Netflix to earn $1.38 per share on revenue of $6.61 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $1.30 per share on $5.47 billion in revenue.
What to watch: Can Netflix maintain its status as the king of streaming? While the market broadly expects Netflix to remain the most successful streamer in 2021, the likes of Disney’s (DIS) Disney+ is coming on strong, as are other rivals. According to SimilarWeb data reported by Business Insider, the company continues to enjoy strong subscriber increases in international markets, though its North American growth is slowing. For the just-ended quarter, Netflix is forecasted to add 6 million global streaming subscribers -- a number that would bring it global total to 201.15 million. While the company didn’t excite investors with its third quarter results, topping 200 million subs would be a significant milestone. As is often the case, how Netflix guides for the next quarter and full year will determine how the stock reacts.
United Airlines (UAL) - Reports after the close, Wednesday, Jan. 20
Wall Street expects United Airlines to lose $6.58 per share on revenue of $3.46 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $2.67 per share on revenue of $10.89 billion.
What to watch: Due to slumping booking demand, some airlines will fail. This sad reality is understood by the majority of professional analysts. But on this gloomy reality might have to wait. Not only did airline traffic end 2020 on a positive note, progress of (and distribution) vaccines have turned around investor sentiment that things can get back to “normal” much sooner than expected in 2021. Plus, with better-than-expected Q4 results from Delta Airlines (DAL) which showed improved cash burn rates, airline stocks may yet demonstrate some value. In the case of United, it had some $24 billion of capital expenditure commitments as of Q3. Its main objectives, amid the decline in travel demand, is to reduce that spending as much as possible, or in a manner that improves the economics of the business. While the company is arguably better-positioned to survive the pandemic, it will need to show significant improvements in the cash burn to inspire confidence.
IBM (IBM) - Reports after the close, Thursday, Jan. 21
Wall Street expects IBM to earn $1.79 per share on revenue of $20.63 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earning were $4.71 per share on $21.78 billion in revenue.
What to watch: When will the real turnaround of IBM begin? The company’s cloud ambitions have promised to return value to shareholders, but IBM shares still haven’t regained their pre-COVID levels even has the rest of the market breaks to new highs. The Red Hat acquisition does raise the market opportunity for IBM. Red Hat has served to modernize the cloud business. But cloud leaders such as Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG , GOOGL) are seemingly too far ahead for IBM to catch up. Arvind Krishna, the company’s new CEO, is tasked with elevating Big Blue into a leading cloud and AI position, while distancing the company from the legacy business. The market will want to hear progress on these fronts on Thursday.
Intel (INTC) - Reports after the close, Thursday, Jan. 21
Wall Street expects Intel to earn $1.10 per share on revenue of $17.48 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $1.52 per share on revenue of $20.21 billion.
What to watch: Intel shares have soared more than 10% Wednesday after the company confirmed that CEO Bob Swan will step down on February 15. Swan will be replaced by Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO of VMWare (VMW). This news comes on the heels of Swan, earlier this month, holding a call with activist investor Dan Loeb of Third Point Capital. When activists are engaged, it’s typically a signal that a company is under pressure. Intel has lost ground and market to rivals AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) in several important chip developments. But can Gelsinger quickly turn things around? Analysts at Needham upgraded Intel stock to a Buy from Hold and raised the price target to $70 which suggests a premium of more than 20%. The company on Thursday must say all the right things to support that level of confidence.

2021-01-16 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Is About to Double Down on a Huge Opportunity,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-is-about-to-double-down-on-a-huge-opportunity-2021-01-16,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has made impressive strides to boost its sales of processors for servers, and taken market share away from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in the process. Its bigger rival still dominates this niche, but things are about to get even better for AMD in 2021.
The chipmaker reportedly increased its server market share from 5% to 8% in 2019, and its share hit double-digit percentages in the second quarter of 2020. According to an article in DigiTimes, some semiconductor industry watchers expect that AMD could double its server market share in 2021 and end the year with 20% of the market. While that's an ambitious forecast, don't be surprised to see it come to pass: AMD is about to heap more pain on Intel with its newest processors.

AMD launches a broadside at Intel
AMD has finally given investors a peek at its third-generation EPYC server processor -- dubbed ""Milan"" -- based on the Zen 3 microarchitecture. While the details are sparse as the chipmaker only previewed the new processor at CES 2021, it seems that AMD is about to deliver another gut punch to Intel.
AMD demonstrated two Milan processors at CES by having them run a weather prediction simulation, pitching them against Intel's Xeon Gold 6258R. The Milan was 68% faster than the Xeon processor in single-socket performance, and also took the prize in dual-socket performance, where it was 46% faster.
Investors should take these results with a grain of salt, as they came from the company, not an independent third-party. Moreover, the CES event was only a preview, not a real-world test. It would be prudent to wait and see what independent testers have to say about the processors' comparative speeds after the Milans are launched and AMD's claims can be checked.
But it won't be surprising to see these upcoming AMD server chips beat Intel's by a comfortable margin, for a few simple reasons. First, AMD's Zen 3 microarchitecture has helped the chipmaker achieve 19% IPC (instructions per cycle) gains in desktop chips over the preceding architecture. To put it more simply, chips based on AMD's new platform can complete more tasks in one cycle because of a refined manufacturing process.
This brings us to the second reason why AMD could hammer Intel yet again in servers this year. The Milan chips are based on a 7-nanometer (nm) manufacturing node, and while that's the same as the previous generation Rome chips, the Zen 3 microarchitecture has certain improvements in thermal management and a unified memory cache to remove latency. This allows the new chips to perform better than the previous generation, and blow Intel's offerings out of the water as the Xeon processor AMD was pitted against in the preview is built using an inferior 14nm process.
Intel is trying to recoup some of the ground it lost to AMD with its 10nm Xeon scalable processors, which have already gone into production. Chipzilla will start the volume ramp of these chips in this quarter. But it remains to be seen how much good that will do, given that AMD has already refined its 7nm process with the third-generation EPYC Milan chips, which are expected to launch this quarter.
Huge financial gains in the cards
If AMD's new chips perform in line with its claims and it lures more of the market away from Intel this year as a result, it could add billions of dollars to its revenue from the data center market.
The chipmaker looked to be on track to mint $1.5 billion from the data center business in 2020 after generating an estimated $1 billion from this segment the year before. AMD estimates that the size of the server CPU market could hit $19 billion by 2023. A 20% share of that would amount to $3.8 billion, which suggests that AMD's data center revenue could in just a few more years almost quadruple from its 2019 level and more than double from its 2020 mark.
But AMD could also kick things up a gear and take an even larger share of the server processor market in the next two years because it's expected to move to the 5nm Zen 4 microarchitecture next year. That could certainly help it widen the gap with Intel. So, AMD could continue to win big in the data center market by clawing away market share from Intel. This is one more reason for investors to buy this top growth stock, which has other solid catalysts to boot.

These Tech Stocks Could Be Huge Winners,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investing-in-2021-these-tech-stocks-could-be-huge-winners-2021-01-16,,,"In spite of seemingly insurmountable odds, stocks managed a more-than-respectable 16% return in 2020, as measured by the S&P 500 index. And with a glimmer of hope on the horizon now that COVID-19 vaccines are in production, 2021 could be another good year for investors. Technology in particular has a bright future ahead of it as the world contends with new challenges brought on by the pandemic.
Specifically, three Fool.com contributors think Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) could be huge winners in 2021. Here's why.
A growing cybersecurity firm at a relative value
Nicholas Rossolillo (Fortinet): Legacy cybersecurity firm Fortinet has been my favorite investment among security-software stocks for a while now. But calling it a ""legacy"" firm is a little disingenuous. This is still a fast-growing outfit, deriving virtually all of its 19% year-over-year sales growth (through the first nine months of 2020) from organic development of new products and services. The ""legacy"" stigma gets attached because Fortinet isn't growing nearly as fast as cloud-native computing (and more narrowly focused) security names like Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS) and CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD).
But this company is putting up respectable numbers in its own right and is a growth-at-a-reasonable-value investment. In addition to its robust sales growth through three quarters of 2020, free cash flow was $684 million -- also up 19% from last year and good for a free-cash-flow margin of 37%. Paired with the $1.66 billion Fortinet has on its balance sheet and zero debt, this is a rock-solid name in the cybersecurity world.
Fortinet put up solid results during the pandemic thanks to its expanding stable of subscription-software services, especially cloud computing aimed at helping large organizations transition away from their old IT infrastructure. In conjunction with that, Fortinet also sells best-in-class firewall hardware (a device that monitors data coming into and going out of a network) for data centers. Because of the pandemic, many security vendors specializing in firewall hardware struggled in 2020. Not Fortinet. It's hardware sales bucked the trend and grew 14% last year, a testament to the high quality of its tech, as many of its customers grow increasingly reliant on data centers for their day-to-day operations.
Between growth from cloud software and its portfolio of data-center security, Fortinet looks primed to continue its steady expansion in 2021 and beyond. And trading at 30 times trailing 12-month free cash flow, the stock looks like a reasonable value compared to some of the high-flying names mentioned above. I remain a buyer at these levels.

Sink your FAANGs into Google
Anders Bylund (Alphabet): Alphabet, Google's parent company, is a fantastic long-term investment at nearly any price. You should be buying Alphabet shares today, even though the stocks are trading at all-time highs after a 23% gain in 52 weeks.
I know, I know -- the law of large numbers says that huge companies must grow more slowly than their smaller rivals. Alphabet is an industry titan, sporting a $1.2 trillion market cap and $172 billion of annual sales. Surely, the company will hit a brick wall of saturated markets someday soon, and the stock would be guaranteed to follow suit. Right?
Well, I'm not so sure. What started as a search engine wrapped in advertising services has branched out into an ever-growing number of adjacent markets. Google owns Android, the world's most popular smartphone platform. YouTube has 30 million premium paid subscribers and another 5 million users checking out the ad-free video service through free trials. Google Cloud has grown into a leadership position in the cloud-computing market, delivering 45% year-over-year sales growth in the third quarter of 2020. On top of all that, ad buyers still see Google as the best place to spend most of their ad budgets. This growth story is far from over.
Furthermore, Alphabet isn't afraid to tackle dramatic market changes. Looking beyond the evolving cloud-computing and YouTube businesses, Alphabet is exploring dramatically different ideas, such as self-driving cars, medical research, and a balloon-based network that provides internet service in developing and underserved markets.
If you don't own Alphabet shares yet, this would be a great time to go ahead and fix that unforced error. This incredible FAANG stock will serve you well for decades to come.
The most important tech company today
Billy Duberstein (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing): Sure, it's not exactly cheap after an amazing run, but there's a good case to be made that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) is the most important company in the world right now. In that case, it should probably be on the list of core technology holdings for any investor, along with the more well-known and popular FAANG stocks.
Earnings expectations were already high for Taiwan Semiconductor heading into its Q4 results released Thursday, and Taiwan Semi reported another strong quarter, with revenue growing 22% year over year, and both gross margins and operating margins coming in significantly higher than expected.
Even more shocking was Taiwan Semi's guidance for its capital expenditures (CAPEX) this year, which management said would be between $25 billion and $28 billion, a whopping 42% to 62% increase over 2020. Keep in mind, 2020 had already seen a 10% surge in CAPEX spend over a strong 2019 spend even amid COVID-19. Taiwan Semi has done an excellent job of under-promising and over-delivering in the past few years, so that massive capital spending plan means management sees huge growth prospects ahead.
That's not a surprise. Two years ago, Taiwan Semi leapt ahead of both Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Samsung in the race to produce 7nm chips. While Intel and Samsung are still struggling with yield issues, Taiwan Semi is already ramping up 5nm chips, which are inside the iPhone 12 and made up 20% of revenue last quarter. With TSMC pulling ahead in capability to produce the most advanced semiconductors, the U.S. government is now subsidizing a TSMC plant in the U.S., and even Intel is likely to outsource some of its chipmaking to TSMC, its main rival.
Technology inflections are usually much more powerful than your typical competition in other sectors due to the difficulty of technology processes as well as massive global scale. Though TSM has more than doubled over the past year, it still should be a core holding for any large-cap tech portfolio.

2021-01-15 00:00:00+00:00,Can New CEO Steer Intel in the Right Direction? Analyst Weighs In,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-new-ceo-steer-intel-in-the-right-direction-analyst-weighs-in-2021-01-15,,,"Intel (INTC) is trying on a new outfit, and investors appear to like the new look. Shares gained 11% this week after the company announced the appointment of a new CEO.
The struggling semiconductor giant announced CEO Bob Swan is stepping down and will be replaced by VMWare CEO Pat Gelsinger. The new man at the helm began his career at Intel, and served as the company’s first Chief Technology Officer, during his initial 30-year stint. In contrast to Swan whose background was in finance, Gelsinger is an engineer and was the architect of the original 80486 processor.
“Given Gelsinger's knowledge of Intel and his technical acumen, he is likely one of the best candidates for the role of Intel's CEO,” said Northland analyst Gus Richard. ""We also believe Mr. Gelsinger has his work cut out for him.”
That last sentence is key. Intel’s woes have been well documented and during Swan's short time in charge (since Jan 19), Intel has struggled as expensive production delays have seen it lose market share to rival AMD.
There are other issues, Richard says.
“Intel no longer has the manufacturing scale to compete with TSMC. Also, it primarily fills its fabs with x86 processors that require only the most advanced process. Further, due to the high level of re-use, overinvestment in 14nm Intel's capacity will require significant investment to catch up to TSMC. For these reasons, fab lite is not a winning strategy.”
The solution, according to Richard, is to sell the fabs, and Gelsinger has the “creditability to do this whereas the former CEO did not.”
Global Foundries, Samsung and TSMC are all possible takers. And while Richard notes that the process of going fabless will no doubt be a “painful 3-year transition,” he believes the quality of the company’s assets, which include Mobileye, Si Photonics, Intel Capital, Altera, and “deep process technology know-how that could be leveraged with a foundry partner,” are being underestimated by investors.
“Investing in these assets over time could return INTC to a growth company,” Richard summed up. “But it is a steep hill to climb that will require short steps, deep breath, and a lot of time.”
For the time being, Richard sticks to a Market Perform (i.e. Hold) rating, backed by a $46 price target. The figure suggests shares will decline by 20% in the year ahead. (To watch Richard’s track record, click here)
A Hold is also the conclusion reached by the analyst consensus, and is based on 15 Holds, 6 Buys and 5 Sells. The $54.15 average price target is a more optimistic one than Richard’s, yet still implies a share drop of 5% in the coming months. (See Intel stock analysis on TipRanks)

The tech giant appears to be bowing to consumer pressure to bring back physical keyboard keys rather than the touch- and gesture-sensitive control bar to adjust the computer's volume, display, and more.

Heeding the call
Apple-watcher website 9to5Mac reports TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says the new 2021 MacBook Pro, which Apple will introduce later this year, will feature a number of enhancements. But arguably the most notable will be what's missing: the Touch Bar.
The site says actual function keys have returned to the keyboard, even though the low-end 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro that Apple released last year had the Touch Bar intact. It's noteworthy because all of the M1 Macs are streamlined to largely feature the same hardware designs.
It speculates that Apple is responding to customer opinions about the innovation, which tended to be negative almost right out of the gate.
Back when the 2016b model was introduced, orders for refurbished 2015 MacBook Pros reportedly skyrocketed, reflecting consumer dissatisfaction with the updated design and the fact that Apple was pushing customers to buy increasing numbers of dongles to make their laptop functional.
Other changes the analyst reportedly said Apple is making to this year's model include Apple-designed ARM co-processors instead of Intel chips, the MagSafe charging connector, and more built-in IO ports to help minimize the number of dongles consumers need to purchase. The 2021 MacBook Pro will also come in 14-inch and 16-inch versions.

2021-01-15 00:00:00+00:00,Why Intel's Competitive Edge Is Crumbling,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intels-competitive-edge-is-crumbling-2021-01-15,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is the largest chipmaker in the world, with products that range from personal computing to data centers. Currently, the company is also the market-leading provider of central processing units (CPUs) for laptops, desktops, and servers. But competition from chipmakers like ARM, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has put pressure on Intel in recent years, and it's starting to take a toll on the iconic company. Here's why investors should be worried.
Image source: Getty Images.
Competition with customers
Intel's chips are built on the x86 instruction set, a fundamentally different architecture than ARM's chips. The difference between the two is simple: Intel's chips are made for performance, and ARM's are designed for efficiency.
However, ARM's chips also offer a level of customization that Intel cannot match. That's because Intel sells its chips directly, while ARM licenses its CPU architecture to partners. This has allowed various tech companies to build on ARM's energy-efficient architecture, adding their own customizations to improve performance. In fact, as of November 2020, the most powerful supercomputer in the world runs on custom-built ARM-based processors.
Two years ago, Amazon started using its own ARM-based Graviton processors to replace Intel chips in Amazon Web Services data centers. For the sake of comparison, Amazon's custom-built chips offer up to 40% better price performance than Intel's. Apple recently made a similar decision, replacing Intel chips in its MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops with its own M1 chips. These custom-built ARM-based processors actually surpass the performance of Intel's latest Tiger Lake CPUs for laptops. And just a few weeks ago, Microsoft followed suit, announcing that it would design its own ARM-based chips for its data centers and Surface PCs.
This is bad for Intel. The company is losing customers in markets it has historically controlled, like data center and PC, as those buyers' preferences shift. Companies want custom solutions, and Intel's current products cannot provide them.
Competition with NVIDIA
For years, Intel's Xeon CPUs have dominated the data center market. However, NVIDIA has also become a critical player in this space, since its graphics processing units (GPUs) are much better at accelerating heavy workloads like artificial intelligence. In fact, NVIDIA's recently launched Ampere GPU is up to 237 times faster than Intel's CPUs.
In 2020, NVIDIA doubled down on its data center business and acquired networking solutions provider Mellanox for roughly $7 billion . Compared to Intel's products, Mellanox's networking solutions offer better performance and, as a result, have captured a larger market share. For NVIDIA, this acquisition has already allowed the company to combine its GPUs with Mellanox technology to create products like the BlueField-2X DPU, which enhances a Mellanox SmartNIC (network interface card) with ARM CPU cores and the AI capabilities of NVIDIA's GPUs. In other words, NVIDIA can bundle its accelerators and networking products together, enhancing data center security and efficiency. This not only fits the trend toward high-performance networking in data centers, but also further differentiates NVIDIA's offering, as Intel does not have a comparable product.
Even worse for Intel, NVIDIA announced its intention to acquire ARM. If approved, this would combine NVIDIA's best-in-class accelerators, Mellanox's high-performance networking, and ARM's energy-efficient CPUs. And while ARM processors have only a tiny portion of the data center market today, NVIDIA's focus on R&D could help ARM produce a server CPU that further displaces Intel from data centers.
Competition with AMD
In recent years, AMD's Ryzen chips have helped the company take significant market share away from Intel in both the laptop and desktop CPU markets. For desktops, AMD released its Ryzen 5000 series chips in November 2020. Compared to Intel's latest desktop chips, the 10th-generation Core CPUs codenamed Comet Lake, these Ryzen chips offer better performance across the board -- gaming, single-threaded (light) computing, and multi-threaded (heavy) computing. However, Intel plans to launch Rocket Lake, its 11th-generation Core CPUs for desktop, in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. This new technology may help the company regain some lost ground.
Additionally, AMD has also taken share in the server market (data centers) with its second-generation EPYC CPUs, codenamed Rome. And Intel has not helped itself here -- the company has delayed the launch of Ice Lake, a third-generation Xeon scalable processor for servers. This chip was originally set for production in early 2020, but management now says Ice Lake won't ramp until the first quarter of fiscal 2021. This could delay the launch of its next server chip, Sapphire Rapids, which is currently set for late 2021. If that happens, AMD may have an easy time taking more of this market with the upcoming release of its third-generation EPYC CPU, codenamed Milan.

Intel's financial performance
All of this competition has put pressure on Intel, and it has weighed heavily on the company's financial performance. Overall revenue growth has been slow, up only 26% over the last three years, compared to NVIDIA's 65% and AMD's 71% growth. Additionally, NVIDIA's and AMD's gross profit margins have expanded, while Intel's have dropped from 62% in 2017 to 53% in the most recent quarter, indicating a loss of pricing power. Investors should watch these metrics going forward.
On the positive side, Intel still generates much more revenue than its competition, which means the company has more cash to spend on operating and capital expenses. If Intel can put that advantage to work, it may be able to repair its crumbling competitive edge. However, given the strong performance of Intel's competitors, and the resultant deterioration in Intel's financial performance, I think investors should be cautious about buying this stock.

2021-01-15 00:00:00+00:00,These Stocks Would Have Doubled Your Money Last Year,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-stocks-would-have-doubled-your-money-last-year-2021-01-15,,,"It isn't unusual for a stock's price to double after a few years. However, many tech stocks doubled, tripled, or even quadrupled their value in 2020 as the pandemic turned the sector into a safe haven for growth-oriented investors.
Tech stocks were naturally insulated from the worst effects of the pandemic and other macro headwinds, while stay-at-home measures lifted PC sales, online shopping, and the usage of cloud-based software. Let's take a look at three tech stocks that rode those tailwinds and doubled in value last year: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG), and JD.com (NASDAQ: JD).
1. Advanced Micro Devices
AMD, the world's second-largest producer of x86 CPU and discrete GPU computer chips, saw its stock double in value in 2020. Sales of its Ryzen CPUs surged as rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) struggled with chip manufacturing shortages and delays, while stay-at-home measures sparked increased sales of its chips for new PCs.
Image source: Getty Images.
AMD didn't suffer the same setbacks as Intel because it doesn't manufacture its own chips like its larger rival. Instead, AMD outsources the production of its chips to big foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
AMD is also led by a seasoned engineer, Dr. Lisa Su, while Intel has been led by Bob Swan, the former CFO who took the helm two years ago. Under Su, AMD launched new CPUs and GPUs that offered comparable performance to Intel's and NVIDIA's chips but at lower prices. Under Swan, who recently resigned under pressure from an activist investor, Intel mainly focused on cutting costs and repurchasing shares. As a result, Intel's stock declined 17% last year as the bulls rushed to AMD.
AMD could continue to outperform Intel this year if demand for its CPUs and GPUs remain elevated. Robust sales of Sony's PS5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X and S gaming consoles, which AMD supplies chips for, could amplify those gains. Analysts expect AMD's revenue and earnings to rise 27% and 47%, respectively, next year -- which arguably justifies its forward P/E ratio of 52.
2. Datadog
Share prices of Datadog surged 160% last year as its data monitoring platform locked in more customers. Datadog pulls all of a company's data from different computing platforms -- including servers, databases, and apps -- onto unified dashboards for developers and IT professionals.
Datadog's silo-busting approach helps companies streamline their businesses and cut costs. More than 400 platforms, including big cloud platforms like Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS), can be integrated with its dashboards.
Image source: Getty Images.
Datadog deploys a ""land and expand"" model, in which it signs a customer to one service to cross-sell additional services, to grow its revenue. It's an effective strategy -- 20% of its customers were using four or more products last quarter, up from just 7% a year ago, and its net retention rate (which measures its revenue growth per existing customer) surpassed 130% over the past few quarters.
Datadog has had a great run, but its revenue growth is decelerating. It expects its revenue to rise 62%-63% this year, compared to 83% growth last year, and analysts anticipate just 36% growth next year. That slowdown, along with competition from similar platforms like Splunk and New Relic, could limit the stock's gains next year -- since it already trades at 40 times next year's sales.
3. JD.com
Shares of JD, the largest direct retailer in China, surged 150% last year as its growth in annual active customers accelerated, its margins expanded, and its profits soared.
Unlike Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), which runs paid listing platforms but doesn't take on inventories, JD takes on inventories and fulfills its orders through its first-party logistics network. JD's business model is more capital-intensive than Alibaba's, but it's better shielded from fraud and counterfeit products.
JD significantly expanded its reach into China's lower-tier cities, which accounted for about 80% of its new shoppers last quarter, to widen its moat against Pinduoduo in the lower-end market. Sales of grocery items, healthcare products, consumer electronics, and home appliances also remained robust on its core marketplace website.
That momentum could continue next year, and JD could profit from Alibaba's recent antitrust troubles as regulators take drastic steps to loosen Alibaba's grip on China's e-commerce market. JD should remain well-insulated from antitrust threats since its ecosystem is much narrower than Alibaba's.
Analysts expect JD's revenue and earnings to rise 23% and 40%, respectively, next year -- which are high growth rates for a stock that trades at 40 times forward earnings and less than one times next year's sales.

Year after year, tech stocks continue to outperform the broader market. In the past year, the Nasdaq Composite has been up by 90% since March and shows no signs of stopping. This is likely due to the surging demand for these tech services as the world continues to adopt the latest technology we have today at unprecedented speeds. Today, we see that a pandemic and global uncertainty still plagues the world. Investors however have been flocking to top tech stocks as the go-to stocks in search of high returns.
Who would stand to gain as a new year begins and tech companies continue to innovate? With the Consumer Electronics Show happening this week, we certainly get to see the best that tech has to offer. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has just announced its latest generation chipsets for laptops and expects over 150 new laptops with its chipsets to hit the market in 2021. Tech company Waymo, a subsidiary of Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL), has also announced its fifth-generation self-driving technology, Waymo Driver. Waymo Driver is designed to improve safety and provide new mobility solutions. From these examples, you see how tech affects many aspects of our lives.
It is safe to say that the tech industry is still booming. This is despite how the pandemic has desecrated many other key industries such as retail and energy. With talks of a $1.5 trillion stimulus bill along the way and with Joe Biden set to be inaugurated as President of the United States next week, we could soon see another rally in the best tech stocks to watch. With that in mind, is this list of top tech stocks worth adding to your portfolio?

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
Future Fintech Group (NASDAQ: FTFT)
Marvel Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL)
Intel Corporation
Intel is a tech company that is based in California. It is the world’s largest and highest valued semiconductor chip manufacturer based on revenue. The company supplies its microprocessors for computer system manufacturers such as HP (NYSE: HPQ) and Dell (NYSE: DELL). Intel’s share price shot up by over 11% yesterday on news that Pat Gelsinger will now become the company’s new CEO. Gelsinger is a respected CEO and industry veteran, with more than 4 decades of technology and leadership experience. He has also spent 30 years at Intel where he began his career.
Could things finally take a turn for the company that has been struggling to keep up with its competitors like AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) in the last few years? In the company’s latest quarter financials posted in October, Intel reported total revenue of $18.3 billion for the quarter, representing a 4% decrease year-over-year. The decrease in revenue is due to pandemic-related impacts in significant portions of its business. The company will announce its fourth-quarter results next week.
At CES this week, Intel highlighted how it is driving technology leadership with the introduction of more than 50 processors, which will result in more than 500 new designs for laptops and desktops in 2021. The company also recently launched its 11th Gen Intel Core vPro platform, an unrivaled business platform to deliver the industry’s highest performance and the world’s most comprehensive hardware-based security. These are game-changing plays for the company and would position the company for growth in the long run. With all things considered, will you have INTC stock as a top tech stock to buy?

Marvell Technology
Marvell is a tech company that provides data infrastructure technology and semiconductors solutions. The company has over 25 years of experience in the enterprise, cloud, automotive, and carrier industries. Marvell has been expanding its portfolio over the last few years in preparation for the 5G era. The company’s share price has been up by over 10% in the last month.
How has the company been doing financially? In its latest third-quarter fiscal posted last month, the company reported a revenue of $750 million, a 13% increase year-over-year. This revenue increase is driven by its networking business, which grew by 35% compared to a year earlier. Marvell attributes strong 5G and Cloud product ramps that are fuelling its ongoing success as it carries on in these strategic growth markets. The company also continues to see demand for its infrastructure and services. 
The company became part of the NASDAQ-100 Index last month. This is indeed a testament to Marvell’s strength and future growth opportunities. The company launched an end-to-end 5G platform at the beginning of 2019 to speed up its deployment of 5G infrastructure. Companies like Samsung (OTC: SSNLF) and Nokia (NYSE: NOK) have been utilizing Marvell’s processors to power their 5G solutions. With two major telecommunications manufacturers behind Marvell, things certainly look promising for the company. Will that be enough for you to buy MRVL stock?

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock was a laggard among the broader semiconductor industry in 2020. That’s a real shame because semiconductors had a great year. But where does INTC stock stand now? Let’s take a look.
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Intel fell far behind a few of its notable competitors in 2020, namely Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). And there were notifications that former partners would soon get into microchips themselves. The result is that Intel trades at under $60 per share, while AMD trades above $90, and Nvidia is around $530. 
The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio tells a better story, though, for Intel. It truly indicates how far the company has fallen relative to its peers. INTC stock carries a 11.62 P/E ratio while NVDA and AMD shares have P/E ratios of 87.17 and 125.8, respectively.
But there is a bullish case forming for INTC stock right now. 
Hedging Forward
Back at the end of 2020, on Dec. 20, activist hedge fund Third Point essentially demanded that Intel make wholesale changes to its strategy. The firm submitted a letter to Intel, outlining its failures after establishing a $1 billion stake in Intel. 
7 Dividend Stocks That Are Growing Their Payouts
Markets reacted, sending Intel shares up 5% following the news. 
Third Point Chairman Daniel Loeb accused Intel of abdicating its duty as America’s former top chip maker. Loeb also called on Intel to sell some of its acquisitions and to separate design and manufacturing. 
By going fabless, Intel could theoretically regain ground it ceded to both AMD and Nvidia. Both U.S. companies utilize manufacturing outsourced to Asia. Intel already outsources some of its production, but a full outsourcing of manufacturing, or going fabless, would be a drastic change for the company. The company has had manufacturing and engineering coupled together for the past three decades.
Intel had already said that it would consider outsourcing some of its more complex chips earlier. And there is widespread speculation that Intel will announce some sort of manufacturing partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) perhaps as soon as its upcoming earnings call. 
In-House Fab Still Has Pros
Intel has been plagued by woes related to its fabrication and manufacturing troubles. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) famously dropped them. Chief Engineering Officer Venkata Renduchintala left the company. And the company ceded its position as the top chip maker by market capitalization. 
Yet, the company can still make a valid argument for its strategy of maintaining in house fabrication. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show, it announced four new families of chips and that it was ramping up advanced server processor production. 
While the chip sector currently is experiencing supply-chain issues, Intel is proving that its strategy does have its benefits and strengths. That’s why markets should expect an upcoming announcement that will equate to increased outsourcing. I don’t believe Intel is going to outsource everything, however.
Security Risk
Third Point CEO Daniel Loeb called Intel’s strategy a matter of national security in his letter. There is certainly some validity to such an argument, and it makes sense to then side with an ally in Taiwanese manufacturer TSM. 
Certainly the erosion of Intel as a leading force in American semiconductor design and manufacturing leaves our country weaker. But in my mind that means Intel will likely want to figure out how to solve manufacturing issues within the U.S. borders, and not outside of them by simply relying on more advanced chip manufacturing in Taiwan and South Korea. 
I expect a redoubling of efforts in manufacturing capability. Intel is going to outsource, but it will also introduce new efforts to solve problems internally.
The Takeaway on INTC Stock
My impression is that Intel is going to scale down its tight integration between engineering and manufacturing and make announcements very soon. I also believe it will somehow improve internal manufacturing. This could happen concurrently with an imminent announcement of a fabrication partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor. 
The other chip manufacturers who burst ahead of Intel now can see that the company wasn’t completely wrong in keeping fab in-house.

2021-01-14 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Reaches Analyst Target Price,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-reaches-analyst-target-price-2021-01-14,,,"In recent trading, shares of Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $55.65, changing hands for $56.95/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 23 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Intel Corp, but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $40.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $82.00. The standard deviation is $9.651.
But the whole reason to look at the average INTC price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with INTC crossing above that average target price of $55.65/share, investors in INTC have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $55.65 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

2021-01-14 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Replaces Its CEO,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-replaces-its-ceo-2021-01-14,,,"Bob Swan is stepping down as CEO of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), the company announced yesterday. He will serve in the position until Feb. 15, when he will be replaced by current VMware (NYSE: VMW) CEO and onetime Intel executive Pat Gelsinger.
Swan's tenure did not last long. He was formally appointed CEO in January 2019, following seven months as the company's interim leader. His reign did not cover the most glorious years of the once-dominant chipmaker; last summer, for example, the rollout of Intel's new 7-nanometer chips was significantly delayed.

More recently, longtime client Apple rolled out the first iterations of its proprietary chip, the M1. Subsequent to that, another partner of long standing, Microsoft, was reported to be going its own way with chip development, too.
Compounding those headaches, last month activist investor Daniel Loeb of hedge fund Third Point sent a letter to Omar Ishrak, the chairman of Intel's board. In the letter, as is his wont, Loeb pushed for changes to the company's business approach. He also wrote that it should ""evaluate strategic alternatives,"" which is typically taken to mean a sale. Loeb's letters have been known to influence their target companies.
At the time, various media reports indicated that Third Point had amassed a nearly $1 billion stake in the company.

2021-01-14 00:00:00+00:00,REUTERS NEXT - ASML CEO sees U.S.-China trade antagonism outlasting Trump,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/reuters-next-asml-ceo-sees-u.s.-china-trade-antagonism-outlasting-trump-2021-01-14,,,"AMSTERDAM, Jan 14 (Reuters) - ASML ASML.AS CEO Peter Wennink expects further antagonism between the United States and China over semiconductor technology, even as a new administration is set to take over in Washington, he told the Reuters Next conference on Thursday.
The Netherlands-based technology giant has already been caught up in the trade war between Washington and Beijing, with the halting of sales of its latest machines, worth roughly $200 million each, to China due to U.S. government pressure.
Some industry watchers had hoped that the transition from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to President-elect Joe Biden would ease tensions.
But Wennink said he does not expect a major change any time soon due to rival efforts by the superpowers to control leading technology, including semiconductor systems produced by ASML.
""That has a competitive space there and that creates this antagonism and that's what we have seen,"" he said referring to the U.S. restrictions on trade with China.
""I don't think that's going to change. To be honest this goes to the heart of, I would say the very core of, industrial policy in both countries. It's semiconductors, it's technology that will create that value base, so that's not going to change and we'll have to live with that.""
ASML is the world's leading manufacturer of lithography machines, which use energy beams to map computer chip circuitry. It's main customers are chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and Intel Corp INTC.O, which use its most advanced ""EUV"", or extreme ultraviolet, systems.
For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the company's net sales rose to 3.96 billion euros ($4.82 billion), from 3 billion a year ago, ahead of analyst estimates of 3.7 billion euros. Net profit rose to 1.06 billion euros from 627 million euros.
($1 = 0.8222 euros)

HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Taiwan's technology know-how should provide a diplomatic edge. TSMC, the $560 billion chipmaking powerhouse, showcases the island's clout in international supply chains and beyond. That bodes well for bilateral trade and investment flows, even as geopolitical uncertainties mount.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is leading a rebound in the trade-dependent economy. Strong demand for semiconductors worldwide, combined with President Tsai Ing-wen's successful containment of Covid-19, helped boost exports to a record $345 billion in 2020. TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, grew annual sales by a quarter, to $48 billion, with more financial results due out later on Thursday. Its shares have surged 75% over the past year, thanks to a relentless march on rivals in developing cutting-edge chips for everything from 5G smartphones to self-driving cars.
A chaotic presidential transition in Washington, however, has dampened the mood in Taipei, where Tsai has benefited from fresh U.S.-China tensions under President Donald Trump. American arms sales to Taiwan topped $5 billion in 2020, according to Reuters, while diplomatic engagements have been at their strongest in years. Outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week announced he was lifting restrictions on contacts between U.S. officials and their Taiwanese counterparts. The unprecedented move prompted fierce condemnation from Beijing, which claims the democratic island as its own territory.
It’s no wonder that over half those polled in Taiwan favoured a Trump re-election, according to an October survey conducted by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation. President-elect Joe Biden is likely to be less antagonistic to China. Fears that he would roll back support for the island were heightened on Tuesday when a planned visit by the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations was cancelled. The decision may be part of the transition to the incoming administration but follows another postponed trip by a senior U.S. official in November.
The two economies are nevertheless growing closer, particularly as the United States seeks to develop advanced technologies at home. Intel may soon outsource chip production to TSMC, joining a long list of American giants like Apple and Qualcomm that rely on Taiwanese components. Those sorts of ties can withstand political ructions.
