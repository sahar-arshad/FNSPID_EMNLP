*Stock Advisor returns as of November 10, 2021
Jason Hall: We're just getting to the second question because we had a really long first one with a couple two-parters there. This is the one that I wanted to talk about the most actually, maybe the second most. But it's semiconductors, what's going on broadly. Supply chain, what's going on broadly. I read The Wall Street Journal today that Samsung is set to announce like it was going to be at five o'clock. I think it might have been the Texas governor was set to make a big economic announcement. But the indications and insiders apparently are saying that the announcement was going to be Samsung was going to plan to build a semiconductor plant in Texas, Arizona, and I think New York state were the three that were most in the running. But it's a $17 billion deployment for this particular plant. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has already announced plans to spend tens of billions in the U.S. There are estimates that Intel could spend between $16 and $120 billion in the U.S. in deployments. Here's the thing, guys. We know the need to expand global capacity is far beyond just semiconductors. A lot of companies are planning to spend a lot of money to build more goods in the U.S., putting more supply chain stuff, distribution and warehousing, e-commerce fulfillment, like all of this stuff. It's a response to what we're dealing with right now, but also, everything that happened during the first part of the global pandemic. We couldn't get goods out of China. China was locked down and just global supply chain spent most of the past year lockdown and now we can't get everything we need because of demand. Here's the question. Taylor, I'm going to ask you to kick us off here briefly if you could. What's your favorite stock that you think is going to be a winner from the big movement of the reshifting of supply chain and so much more coming back to North America?
Taylor Carmichael: That was a really tough question for me, Jason, because I'm not a semiconductor guy, I'm not a hardware guy and I avoid anything that smacks of a factory just as an investor. But one thought that popped into my mind is ZipRecruiter. That's ticker ZIP. This is an internet company. It helps people find jobs. They have an AI solution. Anytime you have mass movement in the job market and more and more people change jobs all the time. ZipRecruiter, I think they have a very strong brand now and they have really powerful revenue growth going on in this, 100% revenue growth. It's a small-cap company, about 600 million in revenue. They're already profitable at five percent and their price per sale is PS 7. It's cheap for a growth story. They just came public. They are under the radar.
Hall: That company has been around for a long time, but it played second fiddle to a lot of the bigger names out there.
Carmichael: Well, yeah. The whole job sourcing is huge. I mean, you think about LinkedIn and you think there are a lot of different ways to play looking for jobs and how you network. I think are really interesting using AI to connect people with that wonderful job that maybe they can't find on their own or they don't know about and so they are having a lot of success with companies hiring them or paying for their solution to help them find a better class of recruits. It's an interesting company. I have a small investment here. It's asset-light business that I love. I cheated on your question a little bit.
Hall: Not at all. I think it falls right in line with the core mission of that question. Taylor, I think you hit it out of the park.

2021-12-03 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia metaverse future bright even as Arm may slip from grasp,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-metaverse-future-bright-even-as-arm-may-slip-from-grasp,,,"By Nivedita Balu
Dec 3 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp's NVDA.O dreams of acquiring British chip technology provider Arm for a hefty price of over $80 billion may not materialize, but analysts believe the chipmaker has plenty to focus on as it pushes into the metaverse.
On Thursday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block the deal, which has been mired in global regulatory scrutiny.
Nvidia's shares fell about 3% on Friday morning.
Analysts have long believed that the chances of the deal getting through are slim to none.
""Even if Nvidia does not complete its ARM Holdings acquisition, demand for NVIDIA AI continues to accelerate,"" Tigress Financial Partners' Ivan Feinseth said, adding that ""Nvidia is all about AI and the Omniverse/metaverse.""
Nvidia, the world's biggest maker of AI chips and graphics, has been doubling down on its data center business as more internet companies invest in the metaverse -- an online realm that connects people through augmented and virtual reality.
The blockbuster deal would give Nvidia exposure to Arm, which licenses its chips and blueprints to major chipmakers Apple Inc AAPL.O, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS, and a chance to dominate the global semiconductor industry.
It would also put Nvidia into intense competition with rivals in the data center chip market such as Intel INTC.O and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O.
""What is lost is the ability of Nvidia to invest in the ARM ecosystem at a much more impactful way than SoftBank had or ARM can,"" WestPark Capital analyst Ruben Roy said.
The FTC said the deal would give Nvidia control over computing technology and designs that competitors rely on to develop their chips.
""Owning Arm would be very nice... But if they can't pull it off, they will save the purchase price... We think the company will be fine either way,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said.

Am I missing something here? The world desperately needs microprocessors, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is the most famous chip supplier. This sounds like a perfect storm for massive profits, yet INTC stock just keeps going down.
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Averaging down when a stock declines can be a disastrous strategy if you’re invested in an obscure, small-market-capitalization company. But we’re talking about Intel here, for goodness’ sake.
The company’s most recently released quarterly financial data looks terrific, all around. Besides, Intel just revealed a product family that could innovate/renovate/decimate the industry.
So, let’s hunker down as I double down on my favorite tech-market loser of 2021. As long as Intel keeps making those chips, you’re welcome to keep buying those dips.
A Closer Look at INTC Stock
Seriously, INTC stock has everything that a sensible investor could possibly ask for. The stock’s 52-week range is $45.24 to $68.49. At the beginning of December, it was trading near the bottom of that range, at $49.50 per share.
Furthermore, Intel has a trailing-12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 9.64. If you’re a dyed-in-the-wool contrarian, then you should be salivating right about now. How many mega-capitalization tech names have P/E ratios below 10 nowadays?
7 Stocks to Buy to Hedge Against Rising Oil Prices
Plus, Intel serves up a generous forward annual dividend yield of 2.81%. You’d expect to see a yield like that from an energy or utilities company, but not a tech business in 2021.
Finally, let’s observe that INTC stock has a five-year monthly beta of 0.51. This is an indicator of very low volatility, so you can hoard Intel shares in your portfolio and sleep soundly at night.
Really, what more could any informed investor want than that?
The Proof’s in the Numbers
If Wall Street doesn’t love Intel right now, that’s fine. The investors have plenty of data-ammo in their armory. Checking in on Intel’s third-quarter 2021 report, it’s evident that the company is firing on all fiscal cylinders.
For one thing, Intel reported a 5% year-over-year increase in both GAAP revenue ($19.2 billion) and non-GAAP revenue ($18.1 billion).
Next, the company’s third-quarter earnings per share of $1.67 exceeded the year-earlier quarter’s $1.02 by a hefty 64%.
And by the way, Intel’s tremendous quarter wasn’t solely driven by microchip sales. As it turned out, the company achieved all-time record revenue in Intel’s internet of things group (IOTG) segment. To quantify this, Intel generated a cool $1 billion in its IOTG segment, up 54% year-over-year.
Additionally, the company took in $326 million worth of revenues with Intel’s Mobileye segment, representing a 39% year-over-year improvement.
Powering Up
Of course, Intel wouldn’t be able to sustain that pace of revenue growth if the company didn’t continually advance novel tech products.
To that end, the company just released its 12th Gen Intel Core processor family. This includes the launch of six new unlocked desktop processors. Among those are what Intel calls the “world’s best gaming processor”: the 12th Gen Intel Core i9-12900K.
For all of you gaming geeks out there, you’ll be glad to know that this gaming processor features a max turbo boost of up to 5.2 gigahertz and as many as 16 cores and 24 threads.
Also new and exciting is the Intel Thread Director. This, according to Intel, “enables the two new core microarchitectures to work seamlessly together by guiding the operating system (OS) to place the right thread on the right core at the right time.”
The idea here is to optimize performance and compatibility between operating systems, in case you had trouble “processing” (sorry, another pun) all of that lingo.
The Bottom Line
What we’re looking at here are awesome new products and strong revenue growth across multiple segments. That’s what Intel offers to its stakeholders. Moreover, there’s a sweet dividend yield and an absurdly low P/E ratio.
So, don’t hesitate to take advantage of Wall Street’s irrationality. When investors come back to their senses  — or should I say, when the chips are down — a long position in Intel will go a long way.

2021-12-02 00:00:00+00:00,Intel's CEO Just Affirmed That Chipzilla's Recovery Is On Track,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-ceo-just-affirmed-that-chipzillas-recovery-is-on-track,,,"Semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has suffered some rare miscues in recent years. The company's traditional lead in manufacturing technology turned into an uphill battle in 2017 when the 10-nanometer (nm) production process was delayed by a full generation cycle of two years. Intel's stock has barely moved in the last four years, gaining just 9% while the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) market index posted a 70% increase.
At the Credit Suisse Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference this week, CEO Pat Gelsinger took the stage to concede that his company has struggled but also to make it clear that Intel is on track to recover and thrive.
A quick primer on Intel's situation
Gelsinger took Intel's CEO office in February this year, topping off a long career at the company where he was the chief architect of the 486 processor in 1989. He quickly pledged to rejuvenate Intel's company culture and get the manufacturing technology back on track to compete with current market leaders Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Samsung.
Intel investors have been shrugging off Gelsinger's promises. Shares are trading at a measly 9.4 times trailing earnings and 5.3 times free cash flow today. You won't find another large-cap semiconductor company with a P/E ratio below 12. Talk is cheap, and Intel needed to show some concrete progress in order to be taken seriously again.
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger. Image source: Intel.
Proof of life
At this week's conference, Gelsinger admitted that you can't make up for several years of ""bad execution"" in just a few months. At the same time, he said he had a lot of evidence to back up his claims that the struggling manufacturing operation is healthy again.
Intel is getting back into foundry operations after a long period of keeping its manufacturing advantages close to the vest. One of its first customers is mobile chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), whose global scale is comparable to Intel's own. Gelsinger said Qualcomm is a very selective customer, and the company wouldn't give the contract to Intel unless the manufacturing process was up to par.
""You don't get a design like that arbitrarily,"" he said. ""They take us and our technology teams through our paces to be able to say, 'Yes, we're going to start using that as a foundry customer in the angstrom era.'""
Pride (in the name of silicon)
The company has a long history of game-changing innovations, which makes it all the more unpleasant to experience several years of mishaps and poor management decisions. Now, Gelsinger said, Intel's engineers are ""working for their pride:""
Every major innovation that's happened in semiconductor transistor technology for the last 30 years came from this team. They screwed up big time. They are now back to restore their honor in the marketplace. They are so fired up. If I told them they had to take a day off, I couldn't get them to do it. It just is impossible at this point because we said we are betting on them big time.
Sure, that sounds a bit like locker-room pep talk at halftime in a losing playoff game. Then again, maybe that's exactly what Intel needs right now -- a CEO that takes personal pride in the company's culture of innovation and wants to infuse that attitude into the whole organization.
Is Intel stock a buy today?
Intel is spending more than $25 billion to boost its manufacturing plants over the next couple of years, installing next-generation technologies such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems and 3D packaging tools. It's an expensive strategy but it also sets Intel up for great returns on that big investment in the long run. You have to spend money to make money. Having a market-leading manufacturing platform will do wonders for the third-party foundry business, and will also give Intel's own products the performance and low-cost production advantages they used to enjoy before 2017.
Nothing ever comes easy in the cutthroat semiconductor industry but Intel really does have solid evidence that the manufacturing operation is getting back to full health -- and then some. This stock doesn't deserve a bargain-bin valuation, and Gelsinger's actions should fuel market-crushing shareholder returns as the recovery plan plays out. That pep talk makes me want to buy more Intel stock while the shares are trading at an unreasonable discount.

2021-11-30 00:00:00+00:00,"Amazon offers new data tool to help carmakers prevent recalls, improve safety",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-offers-new-data-tool-to-help-carmakers-prevent-recalls-improve-safety,,,"By Paul Lienert and Ben Klayman
Nov 30 (Reuters) - Amazon Web Services has launched a new cloud-based data service that could help automakers remotely diagnose issues in their vehicles to prevent recalls and improve safety, as well as manage related data, the company told Reuters.
Called AWS IoT FleetWise, the latest tool in the company’s newly branded AWS for Automotive portfolio of products and services for the transportation industry is being rolled out on Tuesday at Amazon.com Inc’s AMZN.O annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas.
FleetWise enables customers, including auto suppliers and transportation providers, to collect, organize and transfer vehicle data to the cloud, while standardizing different data formats to simplify data analysis, according to Mike Tzamaloukas, general manager of AWS for Automotive.
“As vehicles become more intelligent and advanced, the sheer amount of data produced from vehicles equipped with cameras, lidars and radars is growing exponentially,” Tzamaloukas said in an interview. FleetWise was developed to allow customers “to easily access fragmented data across the different fleet models and vehicle types,” he added.
FleetWise also was designed to complement data-driven services offered by automakers, including General Motors Co’s GM.N OnStar and Ford Motor Co’s F.N Ford Pro Intelligence, he said.
The new service joins a broad range of in-vehicle and cloud-to-vehicle offerings from AWS for Automotive and 185 business partners, according to Dean Phillips, worldwide tech leader for the business unit.
With a greater focus on the industry’s growing shift to software-defined vehicles and systems, “we’re trying to make it simpler and easier for our customers to discover solutions to their problems,” he said, citing development of self-driving cars and “digital customer engagement,” including streamed services.
The AWS portfolio includes cloud-based computing, data storage, analytics and application development.
While Amazon does not break out the value of its automotive cloud services business, the company’s AWS unit continues to grow.
In 2020, AWS reported operating profit of $13.5 billion on sales of $45.4 billion, up 47% and 30% respectively from the previous year. Through the first nine months of 2021, despite the ongoing pandemic and global supply-chain disruptions, AWS’s growth was even more robust: $13.2 billion in operating profit on $44.4 billion in sales, nearly matching its full-year results in 2020.
According to Synergy Research Group, more than 60% of the $45 billion in enterprise cloud services spending in the third quarter was funneled to three large tech companies: Alphabet Inc’s GOOGL.O Google, with 10%, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O with 20%, and AWS with 33%.
On Tuesday, AWS, one of the biggest buyers of data center processors, also introduced new custom computing chips aimed at helping its customers beat the cost of using chips from Intel Corp INTC.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O.

Nov 30 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O cloud computing unit on Tuesday introduced two new custom computing chips aimed at helping its customers beat the cost of using chips from Intel Corp INTC.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O.
With $45.37 billion in sales in 2020, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's biggest cloud computing provider and one of the biggest buyers of data center chips, whose computing power AWS rents out to its customers. Ever since buying a startup called Annapurna Labs in 2015, AWS has worked to develop its own custom chips.
On Tuesday, the company released the third generation of its Graviton chip that is designed to compete with central processors from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O. The Graviton3 is 25% faster than its predecessor, and Dave Brown, vice president of Elastic Compute Cloud at Amazon, told Reuters that the company expects it to provide a better performance per dollar than Intel's chips.
AWS also said that a new class of chip called Trainium, which is designed to train machine learning computer models and will compete against chips from Nvidia, will soon be available to its customers. AWS expects it to train machine learning models for a cost that is 40% lower than Nvidia's flagship chip.
AWS still works closely with Intel, AMD and Nvidia - for example, it is working with Nvidia to pair its Graviton processors to providing a way for the Android game developer to stream its titles to devices. Brown said AWS wants to keep the computing market competitive by offering an additional chip choice.
""We have thrown down the gauntlet on performance. And I believe that in the years to come, you'll see better performance from all of them - Intel, AMD - on price-performance specifically,"" Brown said. ""That's the thing they have got to keep our customers happy on.""
Raj Bala, a vice president and analyst at research firm Gartner, said the chip companies should take competition from AWS seriously over the long term.
For now, many cloud computing customers will want to use Intel and Nvidia chips because decades of software have been written to run on them. Only early adopters who can handle the complexity of re-writing their own software are likely to try the new AWS chips, Bala said.
But the same was true when AWS launched a decade and half ago and was used by smaller tech-savvy customers. The company eventually expanded to mainstream companies and is now on pace to become as large as traditional firms like Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O.
""It is a broadside against Intel,"" Bala said. ""There's no two ways about it.""

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-11-30 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Stock Right Now: Buy or Sell?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-stock-right-now%3A-buy-or-sell,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) started 2021 with a bang, with shares of the chip giant accelerating in the first quarter of the year thanks to news that it may be gaining ground against rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). However, Intel hasn't been able to sustain its impressive momentum, and the stock has given up all the gains it recorded in the early part of the year.
INTC data by YCharts
Shares of Intel are now trading close to the lower end of their 52-week range. Wall Street doesn't seem to be too optimistic about the company's prospects either, as the stock has an average price target of $54, which points toward a tepid upside from current levels.
Given the challenges Intel is facing, investors will probably think twice before buying it, while existing investors may consider cutting their losses by selling the stock. Let's look at both sides and see if it makes more sense to buy or sell Intel stock.

Reasons to sell Intel stock
The biggest reason investors may want to sell Intel is because of the company's lack of competitive edge, which has translated into lukewarm revenue growth and margin erosion over the past three years.
INTC Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
Intel has been forced to lower the price of its chips to compete with AMD, while customers have been flocking to Chipzilla's rival in the x86 processor market. This is reflected in Intel's latest quarterly performance, with its non-GAAP revenue increasing just 5% year-over-year in the third quarter to $18.1 billion.
AMD, on the other hand, is in red-hot form: Its third-quarter revenue shot up 54% year-over-year to $4.3 billion, driven by growth across all its business segments. What's more, AMD also increased its full-year guidance and expects to close 2021 with 65% revenue growth. Intel's non-GAAP revenue forecast of $73.5 billion would translate into a mid-single-digit drop over the prior year's revenue of $77.9 billion.
Even worse, analysts don't see a turnaround in Intel's fortunes in 2022. The company's revenue is expected to remain flat, while earnings are expected to decline to $3.70 per share from this year's estimated $5.28 per share. The long-term forecast doesn't appear to be bright either, as Intel's earnings are expected to clock a compound annual growth rate of just 3% for the next five years.
All of this indicates that Intel stock may continue to underperform. This is why investors might find it prudent to put their money in other fast-growing semiconductor stocks that could deliver a stronger upside.
Reasons to buy
There are three reasons why Intel stock seems worth buying despite gloomy analyst predictions.
First, the company pays a nice dividend. Intel has a dividend of 2.8% and a payout ratio of less than 27%. Intel paid out $1.4 billion in dividends in the third quarter, which was easily covered by its operating cash flow of $9.9 billion. The company has paid out $4.2 billion in the form of dividends in the first nine months of 2021, compared to $12.6 billion generated in free cash flow during the same period. Since Intel's dividend seems safe, it could turn out to be a good retirement stock.
The second reason to buy Intel is its cheap valuation. The stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of just 9.5 and a price to forward earnings ratio of 13.5. The low multiples aren't surprising, as the chip giant's top- and bottom-line prospects appear to be weak for the next year or so. Yet, the dirt-cheap multiples could appeal to investors looking to buy a potential turnaround candidate, especially considering that Intel will reward patient investors with a nice dividend.
This brings us to the third reason why investors may consider betting on Intel stock right now -- the possibility of a comeback. Intel has decided to roll up its sleeves and ramp up its capital spending in the coming years to become more competitive. The company plans capital spending of $25 billion to $28 billion in 2022, which explains the weaker bottom-line performance next year. The planned outlay would be a huge jump over this year's spending of $18 billion to $19 billion.
It is also worth noting that Intel's latest Alder Lake processors are giving AMD's processors a run for their money as per third-party tests. The Alder Lake chips are manufactured using Chipzilla's 10-nanometer process, which matches AMD's 7nm manufacturing node -- this explains why Intel has been able to aggressively price its latest processors and offer impressive performance.
Given that Intel has laid out an aggressive product roadmap for the next couple of years, it wouldn't be surprising to see the company regain its competitive edge. So Intel's potential turnaround, cheap valuation, and nice dividend could help attract investors, as it could turn into a growth stock, assuming its product development moves pay off and it recaptures its mojo.

2021-11-29 00:00:00+00:00,Record number of U.S. firms change tack on political spending after Jan. 6 attack,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/record-number-of-u.s.-firms-change-tack-on-political-spending-after-jan.-6-attack,,,"By Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The number of S&P 500 companies that have either stopped political giving or plan to disclose it hit a record in 2021 after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and recent social justice protests, according to a study viewed by Reuters.
According to the study from the Center for Political Accountability, U.S. companies see new risks in political giving in light of the country's hyper-partisan environment, leading corporations to either halt contributions or disclose them. The center advocates for corporate transparency.
""Unrest and angry political conflict have defined the past two years,"" according to the study, which cited as examples the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol, the two-time impeachment of former President Donald Trump and attempts to overturn the 2020 election. ""In these explosive times, companies are taking action.
""They’ve adopted political spending policies to avoid or mitigate heightened risk,"" according to the study.
Political spending came under closer scrutiny earlier this year after a raft of major companies suspended contributions to lawmakers who voted against President Joe Biden's election certification. L1N2JN2ZQ
At the same time, some companies, such as Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N, are becoming outspoken on social and political issues, including voting rights. L1N2OP2UL
The new study found that 370 companies disclose some or all of their political spending, or ban at least one type of it, such as contributions to trade associations. That figure is up from 332 companies last year. L1N2H31BW
The Center for Political Accountability considers disclosure or outright banning of political giving a mark of top flight corporate governance policy, said Bruce Freed, the group's president.
The study found that one of the biggest changes over the past six years among companies related to so-called ""dark money"" groups, which are tax-exempt organizations that influence politics. There was nearly a 100% increase from 2015 to 2021 in the number of companies who prohibit or disclose contributions to those organizations.
Intel Corp INTC.O was highlighted by the study for adopting a corporate political contribution policy stating that the chipmaker reviews recipients' voting records and public statements, and that it will communicate directly with them.
The study also highlighted videogame maker Activision Blizzard Inc ATVI.O and artificial intelligence computing company NVIDIA Corp NVDA.O, among others, for improving their policies by prohibiting payments to the ""dark money"" groups.

2021-11-28 00:00:00+00:00,Better Semiconductor Stock: Nvidia or AMD,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-semiconductor-stock%3A-nvidia-or-amd,,,"Last December, I compared two of the market's hottest semiconductor stocks: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).
At the time, I said AMD was a better buy than Nvidia because I believed it was better insulated from macro headwinds, it would benefit from the arrivals of the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, and it would continue to grow its market share against Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
However, Nvidia's stock price has rallied nearly 150% since I wrote that article, while AMD's stock has only advanced about 70%. Let's take a fresh look at both chipmakers to see if I made the wrong call last year.
Image source: Getty Images.
What I got wrong about Nvidia
I had expected Nvidia's gaming and data center GPU businesses, which both experienced strong growth during the pandemic, to lose their momentum as the pandemic passed, people played fewer games, and data centers faced less pressure to upgrade their AI-processing servers. But that slowdown never happened.
Nvidia's revenue rose 53% to $16.7 billion in fiscal 2021, which ended back in January. That growth was led by its gaming and data center businesses, which easily offset the slower growth of its auto, professional visualization, and OEM businesses. Its adjusted gross margin expanded 310 basis points to 65.6%, while its adjusted net income surged 75% to $6.3 billion.
In the first nine months of fiscal 2022, Nvidia's revenue grew 65% year over year to $19.3 billion. Its gaming and data center businesses continued to grow, while its auto, professional visualization, and OEM segments all recovered as the pandemic-related headwinds waned. Its data center business also benefited from its takeover of the data center networking equipment maker Mellanox last April. Its adjusted gross margin rose 90 basis points year over year to 66.6%, and its adjusted net income jumped 83% to $7.9 billion.
Analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings to grow 60% and 74%, respectively, for the full year. Those estimates notably don't factor in the potential success or failure of its $40 billion takeover bid for Arm Holdings from Softbank, which could be stuck in regulatory limbo for the foreseeable future.
What I got wrong about AMD
AMD performed very well over the past year, but it didn't actually gain much ground against Intel in the CPU market. Between the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2021, Intel's market share rose from 61.5% to 62.1%, according to PassMark, while AMD's share dipped from 38.5% to 37.8%.
AMD's share of the discrete GPU market also dipped from 20% to 17% between the third quarters of 2020 and 2021, according to JPR. Nvidia's share rose from 80% to 83%. AMD benefited from robust sales of Sony and Microsoft's new gaming consoles this year, but the ongoing supply chain shortages are capping those gains.
Yet AMD continues to grow. Last year, its revenue rose 45% to $9.76 billion, Its adjusted gross margin expanded two percentage points to 45%, and its adjusted net income more than doubled to $1.58 billion.
In the first nine months of 2021, its revenue grew 78% year-over-year to $11.6 billion, its adjusted gross margin rose from 44% to 47%, and its adjusted net income soared 146% to $2.31 billion. It attributed most of that growth to robust sales of its Ryzen CPUs for PCs and Epyc CPUs for servers.
Analysts expect AMD's revenue and adjusted earnings to increase 65% and 104%, respectively, for the full year. Those estimates don't include its planned purchase of Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX), which will complement its Eypc data center business with programmable chips.
The valuations and upcoming challenges
Nvidia trades at 62 times forward earnings, while AMD has a lower forward price-to-earnings ratio of 46. Analysts expect both chipmakers to generate slower growth next year, but Nvidia might have more catalysts than AMD.
Nvidia's core GPU business remains far ahead of AMD's, and the secular strength of the gaming and data center markets -- along with the recovery of its smaller end markets -- should support its long-term growth.
AMD is still a thorn in Intel's side, and it remains ahead of its larger CPU rival in the ""process race"" to create smaller and more advanced chips because it outsources its production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). However, that balance could eventually shift as Intel doubles down on its own first-party manufacturing efforts and tries to catch up to TSMC.
That looming threat, along with intense competition from Nvidia in the GPU market, could be preventing investors from paying a higher premium for AMD's stock, even though it's growing at a comparable rate as Nvidia.
AMD's planned takeover of Xilinx, which mirrors Intel's takeover of Altera six years ago, is also arguably more important to its long-term growth plans than Nvidia's planned purchase of Arm -- which would merely complement its existing business with new CPU design and licensing capabilities.
The winner: Nvidia
Both chipmakers are still great long-term growth plays. However, Nvidia clearly looks like the stronger investment than AMD right now -- even though it trades at significantly higher valuations.

Shares of Intel showed losses of about 2% in 2021, having underperformed, as the tech giant is under pressure both from competitors in the semiconductor business and from its own delays in the next generation of processors. I am bullish on INTC stock. It trades at an extremely attractive valuation and is investing heavily now in strengthening its global leadership in the semiconductors industry. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)
Business Highlights
On October 27, 2021, at Intel's Innovation event, several new products, along with new technology and new tools for developers, were announced. Some of the most up-to-date news highlights were “a unified Developer Zone, new oneAPI 2022 toolkits and new oneAPI Centers of Excellence designed to better enable developers to access reference designs, toolkits and other assets across AI, client, cloud, 5G/edge and gaming with an open, standard-based, unified programming environment.” Management also announced the launch of the 12th Gen Intel® Core™ family, including Intel Core i9-12900K.
Turning to autonomous vehicles, Intel announced that Mobileye, an Intel company, will start operating its 6-passenger, electric autonomous vehicle for commercial driverless ride-hailing services in Tel Aviv and Munich starting in 2022, under the MoovitAV service branding.
Among the important news that Intel announced over the past months, the most important one is the decision to invest $20 billion to build two new chip factories in Arizona. This investment decision supports Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy, which is a combination of three components that allows the company to strengthen and expands its manufacturing, innovation, and product leadership.
According to the company's press release, this strategy comprises not only “Intel’s global, internal factory network for at-scale manufacturing” to optimize products and improve economics, “Expanded use of third-party foundry capacity” to build relationships with third-party foundries, but also “Building a world-class foundry business, Intel Foundry Services,” which is big news. Intel Foundry Services (IFS) is a new business unit created to meet the demand for semiconductor manufacturing.
Furthermore, on September 8, 2021, it was reported that Intel had won a U.S. government project to develop a foundry ecosystem.
Q3 2021: Mixed Bag
The Q3 2021 earnings report for Intel was mixed. There was a beat on earnings but a miss on revenue. The Refinitiv estimates for Intel were for EPS adjusted of $1.11 and revenue adjusted of $18.24 billion. The actual figures were EPS adjusted of $1.71 and revenue adjusted of $18.1 billion.
Intel's PC chip business revenue of $9.7 billion fell 2% on a year-over-year basis. In contrast, the IOTG business unit reported revenue of $1.0 billion, up 54% on a year-over-year basis, which was the highest increase among all business units. The Mobileye unit reported revenue of $326 million, up 39% compared to Q3 2020.
Investors were concerned by both the decline in revenue for its PC chip business, which is the largest business unit for Intel, and the warning that key fundamental metrics such as gross margin and free cash flow will be under pressure in the following two to three years. The pressure will result from the large capital expenditures in which Intel has engaged.
Valuation and Dividend Yield: Two Strong Reasons to be Bullish
Two promising signs for investors are Intel's dividend yield and valuation. Intel has a forward dividend and yield of $1.39 and 2.79%, respectively. Simply Wall Street reports that INTC's dividends per share have been stable in the past 10 years. On top of that, INTC's dividend payments have increased over the past 10 years.
Moreover, INTC stock is undervalued, based on its PE Ratio (9.6x) compared to the U.S. Semiconductor industry average (30.2x). Also, its undervaluation is indicated by its PE Ratio (9.6x) compared to the U.S. market (17.6x), and on its PB Ratio (2.2x) compared to the U.S. Semiconductor industry average (4.9x).
Wall Street’s Take
Intel has a Hold consensus rating, based on 4 Buys, 12 Holds, and 6 Sells ratings. The average Intel price target of $53.90 represents a 10.8% upside potential.

2021-11-27 00:00:00+00:00,"Up 150% This Year, Is Nvidia Stock a Smart Buy Now?",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/up-150-this-year-is-nvidia-stock-a-smart-buy-now,,,"Supply chain disruptions sparked by the pandemic have created problems in numerous industries. For instance, automakers and consumer electronics companies are currently grappling with chip shortages, and those headwinds may last through next year. Of course, that particular problem has actually been a tailwind for chipmakers like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).
In fact, Nvidia's share price has skyrocketed 150% since the beginning of 2021 and 455% since the beginning of 2020. The company has a market cap of $814 billion as of this writing, making it the world's largest semiconductor business by a wide margin. But after those tremendous gains, is Nvidia stock still a smart buy?
Let's dive in.

The leader in supercomputing
Nvidia specializes in accelerated computing. In 1999, the company invented the graphics processing unit (GPU), a chip designed to parallelize compute-intensive tasks. In other words, GPUs can perform thousands of calculations at the same time. For that reason, they are ideal for generating ultra-realistic video game graphics, and they are shaping the future of evolving technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality, and the metaverse.
However, GPUs also excel at handling complex data center workloads, such as analytics, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. And last year, Nvidia reinforced its hardware portfolio with the acquisition of Mellanox, a specialist in high-performance networking solutions. That move made Nvidia even more relevant in the data center, expanding the scope of its products. But Nvidia does more than hardware -- it's a full-stack computing company.
To that end, Nvidia also provides a range of GPU-optimized software, such as TensorFlow for AI training, TensorRT for AI inference, and Rapids for data science workloads. It also offers a range of application frameworks that hasten development such as Merlin for recommender systems, Isaac for robotics, and Drive for autonomous vehicles. In short, Nvidia is an end-to-end solution for accelerated computing.
More importantly, it has established itself as the industry leader. Its compute platform powers eight of the top 10 supercomputers, and Nvidia holds over 90% market share in supercomputer accelerators. Those figures evidence its dominance in the data center, a market that management estimates will reach $100 billion by 2024.
Likewise, Nvidia chips are still the gold standard for gamers and graphics as it holds 83% market share in discrete GPUs for PCs and over 90% market share in workstation graphics.
Not surprisingly, Nvidia's financial performance has been impressive.
Data by YCharts.
A robust growth strategy
In addition to deploying Nvidia hardware in private data centers, clients can run workloads on Nvidia GPUs in every major public cloud, from Amazon Web Services to Tencent. And Nvidia recently added support for hybrid environments with the launch of AI Enterprise, a suite of software that allows businesses to virtualize AI and analytics workloads across private and public clouds. Virtualization software (in this case, VMware vSphere) creates a pool of resources from the underlying infrastructure, allowing clients to use physical hardware more efficiently.
To supplement its AI Enterprise suite, Nvidia offers two additional subscription products: Base Command and Fleet Command, which streamline the development and deployment of AI applications. Collectively, all three products are available through Nvidia LaunchPad, a program that provides businesses with immediate access to AI infrastructure.
However, the more exciting subscription product is Omniverse. This revolutionary platform took Nvidia nearly five years to develop, and it's finally live. Omniverse accelerates 3D workflows by enabling real-time collaboration among creators like architects, engineers, and game developers across a range of 3D design software. It also serves as a simulation engine capable of generating physically accurate synthetic data, meaning Omniverse can be used to train AI models that power autonomous robots and self-driving cars.
That's incredible, but those use cases only scratch the surface. For instance, Nvidia recently announced Omniverse Avatar, a platform capable of generating AI avatars -- digital automatons that can see, speak, think, and understand. That technology could revolutionize customer service and empower every person with an intelligent digital assistant. In short, Omniverse is a stepping stone to the metaverse, and Nvidia has already established itself as a key player.
More broadly, the company's foray into subscription software should translate into a stable revenue stream in the years ahead.

Some concerns about valuation
Currently, Nvidia stock trades at 34 times sales, an incredible premium compared to chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, which trade at about 13 and three times sales, respectively. Perhaps more concerning, Nvidia's current price-to-sales multiple is two times higher than its average over the last three years (and the highest it has been in decades). Put simply, this stock looks very expensive.
On the flip side, Nvidia's dominance in accelerated computing has made it a key player in several emerging industries, from artificial intelligence and augmented reality to robotics and the metaverse. And the visionary leadership of founder and CEO Jensen Huang should keep the company on a good trajectory.
Looking ahead, I certainly think Nvidia can grow its business over the long term, but I'm less certain the stock can beat the market in the near term. For that reason, if you have plenty of time on your hands -- and you're prepared for volatility -- I think it's okay to buy a few shares today. But start small, and build a position slowly through dollar-cost averaging.

2021-11-24 00:00:00+00:00,INTC January 2022 Options Begin Trading,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intc-january-2022-options-begin-trading,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options begin trading today, for the January 2022 expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new January 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $49.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.44. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $49.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $47.56 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $49.42/share today.
Because the $49.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.94% return on the cash commitment, or 24.38% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $49.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $53.00 strike price has a current bid of 52 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $49.42/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $53.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.30% if the stock gets called away at the January 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $53.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $53.00 strike represents an approximate 7% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.05% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.73% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $49.42) to be 33%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-11-24 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why It Might Be Time to Buy Intel Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-it-might-be-time-to-buy-intel-stock,,,"In this video, I will be talking about Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) new CPU, Alder Lake, and how it is pushing AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) to do things it wouldn't want to do. With the current market and economic situation, it might actually be smart to have a company like Intel in your portfolio. You can find the video below, but here are some of the highlights.
Intel is down 12% since it reported earnings but right now with what's going on in the market and the economy as a whole, it might not be such a bad idea to have a company like Intel in your portfolio. It pays a 2.8% dividend yield and is generating $9.9 billion in cash from operations.
Intel is planning on taking back its lost market share with the launch of Alder Lake and future GPU products. With regards to Alder Lake, Intel has finally moved on from the 14 nm chips to 10 nm. The new Alder Lake CPUs are compatible with DDR5 RAM whereas the AMD counterpart is not.
To counter this, AMD has already cut the prices of some of its CPUs. The Ryzen 5800X, for example, has been reduced from $449 to $299, which has caused it to sell out very quickly.
AMD is expected to launch the Ryzen Zen 3 CPU early next year but only plans to unveil the Zen 4 later in 2022, and that one will support DDR5.
The beauty of this market is that there's so much demand that both Intel and AMD will thrive. But if we compare both companies' valuations right now, you would say Intel is very cheap and has growth potential if the comeback story is on with the new CPUs, GPUs, and IDM 2.0.
It's crucial for the Western world to have a player like Intel located outside Asia. Intel has already broken ground on two new fabs, three months ahead of schedule.

2021-11-24 00:00:00+00:00,Investors Met With Slowing Returns on Capital At Intel (NASDAQ:INTC),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investors-met-with-slowing-returns-on-capital-at-intel-nasdaq%3Aintc,,,"If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.
Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Intel:
Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)
0.17 = US$23b ÷ (US$168b - US$30b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2021).
So, Intel has an ROCE of 17%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Semiconductor industry average of 14%.
NasdaqGS:INTC Return on Capital Employed November 24th 2021
In the above chart we have measured Intel's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Intel here for free.
What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us
While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has employed 50% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 17%. 17% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Intel has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.
What We Can Learn From Intel's ROCE
To sum it up, Intel has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 58% to shareholders over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.

2021-11-23 00:00:00+00:00,Will Intel Gain Back its Charm Among Investors?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-intel-gain-back-its-charm-among-investors,,,"The stock of Intel (INTC) has been under pressure for quite some time now.
It has been struggling with product ramps, falling market share, increasing competition from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA), lackluster performance on Wall Street, and other problems.
At the same time, Intel is working to improve its business by selling low-margin activities and investing in new growth areas. The recent introduction of Intel's Alder Lake processors could also help the business reverse the tide in its favor to some extent while keeping it competitive.
This semiconductor chip manufacturer's stock has gained 8% over the past year but has lost about 13% in the last six months.
Weak Q3 but CEO Remains Hopeful
On October 21, Intel released its third-quarter earnings. The investors were dissatisfied with the results.
The top-line figures improved 5% from the year-ago quarter, but they fell short of the average forecast. Overall, the results indicated that Intel may be at risk of falling behind its competitors.
Nevertheless, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger thinks the company has the power to once again lead the fast-growing semiconductor sector.
During the Q3earnings call Gelsinger stated, “Q3 shone an even greater spotlight on the global demand for semiconductors, where Intel has the unique breadth and scale to lead. Our focus on execution continued as we started delivering on our IDM 2.0 commitments... We also announced major customer wins across every part of our business.”
He further added, “We are still in the early stages of our journey, but I see the enormous opportunity ahead, and I couldn’t be prouder of the progress we are making towards that opportunity.”
Encouraging TipRanks Metrics
Despite the aforementioned challenges, the TipRanks analytics shows some impressive positive stats about the company.
Intel stock scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.
Furthermore, TipRanks' Stock Investors tool shows that investors who hold portfolios on TipRanks are growing their exposure on Intel stock. Notably, about 2.5% of these investors have increased their exposure to Intel stock in the last 30 days.
Also, TipRanks’ Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool indicates that hedge fund managers have increased their holdings in Intel stock by 5.0 million shares in the last quarter.
These metrics illustrate that Intel is regaining the trust and affection of the investors.
Expert’s Take
While uncertainties remain, Citigroup's Christopher Danely believes that October notebook shipments indicate increasing demand from the enterprise end market.
It's ""clearly good news"" for both Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, according to Danely. However, he does not anticipate the enterprise advantage to persist more than a few quarters, and he points out that Q4 notebook shipments are still below seasonality.
As a result, the analyst maintained a Neutral rating on Intel stock.

The companies plan to offer clients improved flexibility across multiple public clouds with Snowflake’s Data Cloud using Intel Xeon Scalable processors and Intel Xeon-based cloud instances.
Both the companies seek to do performance testing on their clouds and hardware instances with a view to match up the best performing Intel-based instances for specific Snowflake workloads.
Based on testing results, Snowflake will be able to optimize instances with multiple cloud providers. Also, Intel will design and produce chips that support specific workloads.
Meanwhile, Intel said that it was working on Snowflake’s search engine optimization when used to search semi-structured data like JSON. (See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks)
With this deal, Intel seeks to enhance open-source technologies used in Snowflake’s software stack such as Foundation DB to accelerate workloads optimized for Intel’s processors, enabling customer use cases with performance advantages.
The Chief Technology Officer in the Datacenter and AI Group at Intel, Arijit Bandyopadhyay, said, “Intel’s engineering teams help disruptor innovators exploit the latest Intel products together with leading software optimizations and silicon engineering to optimize critical workloads across deployment models. Together with teams like Snowflake engineering, we can reach new heights in SQL query acceleration while innovating on the next-generation hyperscaler instance designs across major cloud providers.”

2021-11-22 00:00:00+00:00,3 Falling-Star Stocks to Buy Into the Holidays,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-falling-star-stocks-to-buy-into-the-holidays,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The lockdowns have not been part of the conversation for a long while. They are resurfacing now as we heard rumblings last week. Last year, the pandemic forced the whole world into a giant halt. That decimated the profit-and-loss statements of millions of businesses. Nevertheless, even back then there were stocks to buy on the dips. Our mission today is to find a few good ones going into the holidays.
The businesses that thrived last year were mostly mega-caps. Currently there are some of those that have lost large portions of froth in their stocks. These make for a fine collection of stocks to buy even when there is threat of more macroeconomic downside.
It was clear from the crisis that governments have tremendous commitment to reflating the economies. The U.S. pulled out all stops with trillions of dollars thrown at the problem. Evidence of this is the level of inflation now. Therefore, my assumption is that we are highly unlikely to repeat the cause of the problem.
The politicians this time around will not be quick to reset the stay-at-home order. We have since learned a lot about the virus. More importantly, we have remedies for it. Although we don’t have a cure, we do have many effective vaccines and the promise of easier treatments. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Merck (NYSE:MRK) promised us treatment pills.
If we assume that we are not likely to lockdown, then the bulls are in charge. The Federal Reserve already announced its tapering process for the next three months. This will make it very likely that we will have the QE extend beyond next summer. There were rumblings of aggressive rate hikes, but I would bet against those.
If at all, we might have one token raise next year unless something new comes up. The overseas bonds still carry negative yields, therefore the bid for the U.S. Treasurys will remain strong. In that environment, it is highly unlikely that the Fed will raise rates. Something will have to force its hand to do that.
I’ve heard people use the term “hyperinflation” in their discussions of the U.S. situation. With all due respect, those who bring it up haven’t seen real inflation. Ask the folks in Lebanon, who can attest to what it feels like to have gasoline prices quadruple overnight.
In the United States things are more expensive, but it’s not stopping people from buying them. Inflation only becomes a problem when it crimps spending. The U.S. consumers are spending at record pace. Moreover, that segment is two-thirds of the economy.
This is an environment where investors should be looking for stocks to buy, not short. Today’s three are prior champions that have fallen out of favor in an aggressive way. None of them have systemic problems that have caused their woes. They are:
Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)
Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Stocks to Buy: Alibaba (BABA)
Source: Charts by TradingView
We all know already about the plight of BABA stock. The government waged war against its largest, more successful businesses. They want to minimize monopolistic behaviors there. As a result, BABA stock has lost more 55% of its value in about a year. Conversely, its business is still growing at a healthy clip.
Management has more than doubled its revenues in three years. Their gross income is 50% bigger than 2019. And most importantly that income is still strong in spite of the recent complications. These are not statistics of a struggling business. Quite the opposite.
In fact, its success may be the cause of the slide in the stock price. It has become a target for the authorities to try and stifle. Alibaba just delivered more than $100 billion in revenues in one day from their singles event on 11/11. They muted the headlines around it perhaps on purpose. They also downplayed their success with their earnings message. I would do the same if the authorities were breathing down my neck about my success.
This is all to say that the business is fine and that this too shall pass. There is also current technical support from the charts. The zone just below current price has recently served as a base. But if it fails, it could trigger another leg lower to $110 per share.
BABA stock here or lower is a bargain by any metric. Unless the Chinese government is intent on demolishing the company, this is definitely on my list of stocks to buy. Since the indices are at risk overall, I should leave room for doubt – just in case.
Zoom Video (ZM)
Source: Charts by TradingView
Our second pick today benefits from the idea of lockdowns. Consider this a hedge on the other two in case those headlines gather steam. Regardless of new restrictions, the behavior of “zooming” has not turned out to be a fad. We continue to use its services even though people are going back to work. I zoom on a weekly basis for business. My family zooms almost every day on a personal level.
Zoom services just makes sense, so we are not going to ditch it soon. We are driving less and telecommuting more. Also, business meetings are now totally acceptable over a video connection. ZM metrics continues to grow at an aggressive pace. The drop in ZM stock price is astonishing given the reports its delivering.
Speaking of which, it will have another earnings event soon. Onus is on management to paint a trouble-free picture. It is not likely for them to be overly aggressive since investor sentiment soured a bit. Furthermore, they do have the cover of potential lockdown headlines. Management may want to under-promise to they can over-deliver next report.
The financial metrics have improved drastically for ZM stock. The price-to-sales, for example, dropped 100 points all the way down to 21. This is an absolute bargain relative to where it was last year. This can only happen when management executes on its plans and doesn’t squander an opportunity.
They had a huge spike in usage during the pandemic. However, they made the most of it and then some. They currently have a 12-month revenue rate of $3.6 billion. More importantly they also have $1 billion in net income. Signs point to the success of ZM stock in the long run. Therefor, this absolutely belongs on the list of stocks to buy.
Stocks to Buy: Intel (INTC)
Source: Charts by TradingView
Our third stock to buy today is Intel. Unlike the other two, it hasn’t been on a recent downward trend. INTC stock has been trading sideways for three years. It fell behind in the race for headlines while Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) hogged them.
Investors forgot about Intel, yet it is the actual beast in the sector. It produces more revenue, gross profit and net income twice more than the other two combined. Eventually it will matter again and investors will flock to its stock.
The demand on chips is only going to increase exponentially. The digitization revolution is not a fad, it is a long-term trend where tech will beget tech. We will need all suppliers to contribute, and this is the biggest one. Management needs to better focus investor attention on its strengths.
INTC stock is out of favor, but that is not going to last forever. Statistically, this is the absolutely cheapest stock in the chip sector. This makes it a dormant giant stock that could wake up within the next six months. I recently had the good fortune of catching a breakout. I will re-engage long from around this base.
It is important to reemphasize that strong conviction is a threat to financial health. It sounds great, but stocks do not trade in a vacuum. The indices just broke records, so they are susceptible for hiccups. Those would drag down all stocks, including these three.

Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) Mobileye gets very little attention. The unit develops self-driving cars and advanced driver-assistance systems. As electric-vehicle stocks enrich speculators, INTC stock is stuck. The chip giant could reduce its reliance on the personal computer market and turn investors’ attention to Mobileye; then its shares could rise as those of Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) did.

But that scenario is a dream. For now, Intel is jump-starting its desktop chips in an effort to catch up to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). In the near-term, AMD will be the top, high-end, gaming chip supplier. Intel, however, is well-positioned to grow its market share in the budget and mainstream markets.
Alder Lake Will Lift INTC Stock
Earlier this month, Intel launched a refresh to its CPUs. The Core i9 12900K is getting rave reviews. Investors should  read reviewers’ praise for Intel’s refreshed lineup. For the upcoming holiday season and into 2022, there’s a good chance that consumers will upgrade and pick Intel over AMD.
PC Gamer  gave  Intel’s 12900K a score of 89%. The site said the chip has great single-threaded performance, improved multi-tasking ability, and is the best support platform for DDR5 and PCIe 5.0.
DDR5 is the company’s next-generation memory chip, and investors expect demand for the product, which is as good as AMD’s competing offerings, to accelerate. Gamers need those faster chips to get the most from their CPUs and graphics cards.
The DDR5’s architecture has more cores, bandwidth, and speed than its predecessors. It is Intel’s first chip on the 7 nm process node . The company’s departure from the 14nm process node is long overdue. For many years the process nodes of Intel’s products consistently shrank, decreasing their  production cost and increasing their performance.
Now Intel is taking a different approach. It added both P-cores, or Performance Cores, and E-Cores, or Efficient cores, to its CPUs. Gamers want more P-Cores and clock speeds as high as 5.2GHz. Intel has an edge over AMD as these features minimize the latency of Intel’s chips.
Intel built the E-cores by utilizing its legendary Atom architecture that uses comparatively little power.  As a result, the E-Cores will increase the performance of multi-threaded CPUs and gaming CPUs.
Gaming Stocks
Investors can also consider buying shares of Corsair Gaming (NASDAQ:CRSR) alongside Intel stock. Corsair recently posted strong, full-year 2021 revenue guidance. It expects net revenue in the range of $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion and EBITDA, excluding certain items,  of $190 million to $205 million.
7 Stocks to Watch Now as Consumer Prices Spike
While supply constraints hurt Corsair’s outlook, the high-end gaming supplier offers  solutions powered by the chips of AMD and Intel. Look for Corsair’s customers to pick the Intel-powered systems, validating this article’s bullish stance on Intel.
Fair Value
Of the 22 analysts covering Intel stock, 12 have a “neutral” or “hold” rating. The analysts have an average 12-month price target of $53.81 on the shares, TipRanks reported.
Investors should ignore the analysts’ cautious outlook. Unless speculators panic sell tech names in general, INTC stock is unlikely to fall further. Its trailing price-earnings ratio is below ten times, and the stock pays a healthy dividend of $1.39 annually, which works out to a yield of 2.8%.
It will take a few months for consumers to appreciate Intel’s Alder Lake chip. As more gamers praise the product, the sales of the chip will rise.
Risks
Intel has fooled hopeful investors before each of its earnings reports. The stock usually rallies in anticipation of guidance increases by the chipmaker,. but falls when Intel lowers its guidance and reports production or research and development delays.
Those days are probably over.  Intel’s leadership has improved due to the appointment of its new CEO, Patrick Gelsinger His leadership of VMware (NYSE:VMW) for eight years has given him relevant software experience.
The Bottom Line
With few technology stocks on sale, Intel is the exception. It has disappointed investors many times in the past. Those days are probably over, due to its new CEO. Intel lags AMD in certain areas, but Intel will thrive as it meets the needs of the mainstream and budget markets.
