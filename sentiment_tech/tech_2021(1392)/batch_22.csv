NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - A surge in Delta variant infections sparked a broad sell-off on Wall Street on Monday as investors feared renewed COVID-19 shutdowns and a protracted economic recovery.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session sharply lower, with the S&P and the Nasdaq suffering their largest one-day percentage drop since mid-May.
The blue-chip Dow had its worst day in nearly nine months.
The risk-off sentiment also sent U.S. 10-year Treasury yields sliding, pulling rate sensitive banks stock prices with them.
""Much of it is related to the Delta (variant),"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""There’s some concern too that maybe the economy is not going to open up as quickly as everyone thinks, and the big boom that everyone’s expecting is going to be more of a pop than a boom.""
""We’re woefully off of breakneck economic growth, and judging by the activity we’re seeing we’re overestimating a lot of the economic reports,"" Nolte added.
The highly contagious COVID-19 Delta variant, now the dominant strain across the globe, has caused a surge in new infections and deaths, nearly exclusively among unvaccinated people.

""Global availability of the vaccine has been an issue from day one."" Nolte said. ""That’s been out there for a long time. This is the latest iteration of that. We still have a long way to go.""
Travel and leisure stocks plunged, with the S&P 1500 Airline index and the S&P 1500 Hotel and Restaurant index .SPCOMHRL losing significantly more ground than the broader market.
The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, a gauge of investor anxiety, touched its highest level in two months.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 724.56 points, or 2.09%, to 33,963.29, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 68.36 points, or 1.58%, to 4,258.8 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 152.25 points, or 1.06%, to 14,274.98.
All 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 closed deep in negative territory.
Second-quarter reporting season is under way, with 41 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 90% have beaten consensus estimates, according to Refinitiv.
Among high-profile names, Netflix NFLX.O, Twitter TWTR.K, Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N, United Airlines UAL.O and Intel INTC.O, along with a host of industrials from Honeywell HON.N to Harley-Davidson HOG.N are due to post results this week.
International Business Machines Corp IBM.N results are expected shortly.
Analysts now see year-on-year S&P 500 earnings growth of 72% for the April to June period, substantially higher than the 54% annual growth forecast at the beginning of the quarter, per Refinitiv.
Zoom Video Communications Inc ZM.O announced a $14.7 billion all-stock deal to buy cloud-based call center operator Five9 Inc FIVN.O. The teleconferencing services provider's shares fell on the news, while Five9's jumped.
Tech tensions between the United States and China grew more heated with the United States and its allies accusing Beijing of a global hacking campaign while shares of Chinese tech firms listed on foreign exchanges dropped amid fears of regulatory crackdowns.
U.S.-listed shares of China-based ride-hailing app Didi Global DIDI.N extended their decline.

LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - Risk-aversion ruled on Monday as a surge in worldwide coronavirus cases sank bond yields and left stocks facing their longest losing streak since the pandemic first hit global markets 18 months ago.
Europe's STOXX 600 .STOXX slid over 2% in its worst session in seven months; London's FTSE .FTSE fell a similar amount to the lowest since mid-May as Britain's ""freedom day"" lifting of COVID-19 restrictions was overshadowed by its fully vaccinated health minister contracting the virus.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI dropped 1.4% in early U.S. trading, with the S&P 500 .SPX and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC nearly matching those falls.
Meanwhile safe-haven government bonds GVD/EURUS/ enjoyed healthy gains, with U.S. 10-year Treasury yields sliding to new five-month lows while the dollar climbed to a 3-1/2 month high. /FRX
""The big concern for the market is whether we are going to see a slowdown in the global economic recovery, and this could be the overriding force which results in a bad period for equities in the weeks ahead,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at brokerage AJ Bell.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei .N225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng HSI dropped 1.3% overnight. Cases hit an 11-month high at the weekend in Singapore, Thailand had its highest single-day increase since the pandemic began and Sydney's construction workers were told to down tools after cases rose there as well.
Markets were fretting over whether broader lockdowns might be needed again and a slowdown in the world's No. 2 economy China, meaning a recent surge in commodity prices could be peaking.
Natwest's Global Head of Desk Strategy, John Briggs, said rising COVID-19 cases would focus markets' mind on which countries had the highest vaccination rates, their appetite for social restrictions and their fiscal appetite.
""The U.S. comes out on top of all these,"" Briggs added. ""We are in a period of renewed U.S. exceptionalism ... So all this is bullish for the USD.""
In Europe, coronavirus angst saw travel and leisure stocks .FTNMX405010 fall to their lowest level of the year. Shares of cruiseship operator Carnival CCL.L, airlines easyJet EZJ.L and British Airways-owner IAG ICAG.L, and the UK's Restaurant Group RTN.L and Cineworld cinema chain CINE.L all fell between 5%-6%. .EU
It wasn't just COVID-19 dampening the mood. China's supersized tech trio Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent had sank 2.5%-3% overnight after a Shanghai court at the weekend posted a list of ""typical unfair competition cases"". .SS
PERMANENTLY CHANGED?
Oil prices slid about 4% after the OPEC group of producing nations overcame a recent spat and agreed to boost output in a hastily arranged meeting on Sunday. O/R
Brent crude LCOc1 was down $2.80 at a more than six-week low of $70.75 a barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 fell a similar amount to $68.84 a barrel.
Global economic growth is beginning to show signs of fatigue as many countries, struggle to curb the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus.
Investors are also worried about the spectre of elevated inflation, which the market has long feared.
Economists at Bank of America downgraded their forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to 6.5%, from 7% previously.
In bond markets, the move to safe-haven assets meant further falls in yields. Germany's 10-year bond yield DE10YT=RR hit its lowest level since late March at -0.351% ahead of an ECB meeting this week. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields US10YT=RR slipped to 1.21% and have fallen for 11 of the last 15 trading sessions.
The dollar =USD was also riding high as risk currencies came under pressure. An index measuring the dollar's value against a basket of major currencies briefly rose to as high as 93.041, its highest since early April.
But the dollar failed to make any headway against the yen, with the currency pair trading below the 110 yen per dollar mark at 109.10, leaving the yen almost 0.9% higher on the day. JPY=
Britain's sterling hit a three-month low against the dollar at $1.3703 GBP=D3GBP/ after its health minister Sajid Javid had tested positive for COVID-19. That forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson and finance minister Rishi Sunak to quarantine on Sunday.

NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - Investors moved away from risky assets on Monday as a rise in worldwide coronavirus cases crushed bond yields and left stocks facing losing streaks, with Wall Street falling more than 1%.
New COVID-19 cases rose in England and Asia, with U.S. infections soaring 70% last week, dampening optimism on the economic recovery. The 10-year yield US10YT=RR fell 8.7 basis points to 1.212%, a low last seen in February, while the S&P 500 fell for a third straight session.
""Investors shed risk assets in early morning trading amid fears of a surge in COVID infections that have the potential to curtail global growth,"" said Peter Essele, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network, in an e-mailed statement. ""The risk aversion was most pronounced in the 10-year Treasury yield, which fell to its lowest level since the early days of 2021.
""Fear of stagflation will be a major concern for investors if a resurgence in COVID infections causes economies to slow while consumer prices continue an upward trajectory,"" Essele said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI dropped more than 2% mid-morning on Monday, with the S&P 500 .SPX falling 1.5%. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC fell nearly 1%.
MSCI's all-country world index .MIWD00000PUS, a gauge of global shares, was down 1.71%.
In a sign of the continued implications of the pandemic, Britain's ""freedom day,"" ending over a year of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in England, was marred on Monday by surging infections, warnings of supermarket shortages and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's own forced self-isolation. Britain's fully vaccinated health minister also contracted the virus.
U.S. deaths from the coronavirus, spurred by the dominant Delta variant, are up 26%, with outbreaks occurring in parts of the country with low vaccination rates. About one in five new cases are in Florida.
""The big concern for the market is whether we are going to see a slowdown in the global economic recovery, and this could be the overriding force which results in a bad period for equities in the weeks ahead,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at brokerage AJ Bell.

Natwest's Global Head of Desk Strategy, John Briggs, said the chances of broader lockdowns being needed again were growing and also China's economy was slowing, meaning a recent surge in commodity prices could be peaking although oil is now expensive enough to be a weight on many economies.
""Where all this comes out of the wash for me is that with this narrative gaining traction, it is clearly more bullish for the dollar,"" Briggs said.

Investors are also worried about the spectre of elevated inflation, which the market has long feared.
Economists at Bank of America downgraded their forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to 6.5%, from 7% previously, but maintained their 5.5% forecast for next year.
""As for inflation, the bad news is it's likely to remain elevated near term,"" they said in a note, pointing to their latest proprietary inflation meter, which remains high.

Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) stock is in the catbird seat in such a way that vauation isn’t a problem right now.

America is dependent on the company’s chip-making technology, and anxious to see it build more plants here.
China is also dependent on Taiwan Semiconductor’s technology. Germany and Japan both want Taiwan Semiconductor fabs.
Taiwan Semiconductor, known as TSMC, has perfected extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUL) techniques that will let it make chips with circuit lines just 2 nm apart. That’s thinner than a strand of DNA.

7 A-Rated Retirement Stocks to Buy to for Your Golden Years
TSMC’s dominance in EUL gives it enormous political as well as economic power. Withholding this power from China, and depositing it in the Arizona desert, is a very big deal.
It means China is dependent upon Taiwan. C.C. Wei is, in that way, more powerful than Xi Jinping.
A Closer Look at TSM Stock
After writing about TSMC’s growing importance for years, I finally put some shares into my retirement account a year ago. They have more than doubled in value.
On July 16 TSMC had a market cap of $609 billion. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was worth $275 billion.
The only other players in microprocessor fabrication are Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), worth about $469 billion, and Global Foundries, which Intel may buy for just $30 billion.
As circuit lines get closer together, the technology needed to make chips grows more precious. Consolidation into a virtual monopoly was always inevitable.
The only way to get past 2 nm is through techniques like quantum computing, which is still not commercial.
Overpriced?
Every leading maker of processing chips, even Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD), is dependent upon TSMC.
It’s TSMC’s drive to fulfill those orders, and to build the Arizona plant now due to open in 2024, that is keeping not their stock prices high, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as well.
So how can TSM stock possibly be overvalued? Our Will Healy suggests its power may have peaked, that the chip shortage should ease, and that TSMC’s ambitions will naturally be hampered by geopolitics.
The Arizona plant, after all, will represent just 2% of the company’s production. Most production will remain in Taiwan, and Healy takes China’s threats to invade seriously.
I don’t. A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would plunge the whole world into economic and technological darkness. Social cohesion in China remains tied closely to the country’s continued economic progress.
You tell the Chinese they’re going to be poor again for the Party and you had better duck.
Analysts at Tipranks have also cooled to TSM stock. Only five now follow it, and only three say buy it. This despite the average revenue estimate for 2022 being $74 billion, 32% ahead of 2021 estimates.
Profit margins must fall as chip shortages ease, the thinking goes.
The Bottom Line
The world’s economic dependence on TSMC, and by extension Taiwan, is deeply ironic.
It’s assumed to be short-term. Samsung and Intel must eventually catch up. Both the U.S. government and China’s government are pouring billions into semiconductor development to make that happen.
But Intel has been claiming to have EUL licked since 2018. It’s not licked yet. Intel stock costs less today than it did a year ago.
Money alone won’t solve the problem. China’s billions haven’t cracked it. America’s billions haven’t cracked it, either. Until Intel delivers on its promises to compete with TSMC, I’m sticking with it, but I’m holding some Intel, too, just in case.

LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - Risk-aversion ruled on Monday as a surge in worldwide coronavirus cases drove down bond yields and left stocks facing their longest losing streak since the pandemic first hit global markets 18 months ago.
Summer markets were suddenly stormy. Europe's STOXX 600 .STOXX saw its worst morning in two months and London's FTSE .FTSE fell over 2% as Britain's 'freedom day' when it lifted COVID restrictions was overshadowed by its double-jabbed health minister contracting the virus.
Asia had seen Japan's Nikkei .N225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng HSI drop 1.3% overnight too. Cases hit an 11-month high at the weekend in Singapore. Thailand had its highest single-day increase since the pandemic began and Sydney's construction workers were told to down tools after cases rose there as well.
Wall Street futures down nearly 1% ESc1.N although it was good news for those holding safe-haven government bonds GVD/EUR or the dollar, which climbed to a more than three-month high. /FRX
Natwest's Global Head of Desk Strategy, John Briggs, said the chances of broader lockdowns being needed again were growing and also China's economy was slowing, meaning a recent surge in commodity prices could be peaking although oil is now expensive enough to be a weight on many economies.
""Where all this comes out of the wash for me is that with this narrative gaining traction, it is clearly more bullish for the U.S. dollar,"" Briggs said.
He said that if COVID-19 cases rise again, factors to consider included which countries have the highest vaccination rates, their appetite for social restrictions and their fiscal appetite.
""The U.S. comes out on top of all these,"" Briggs added. ""We are in a period of renewed US exceptionalism ... So all this is bullish for the USD.""
In Europe's stock markets, COVID angst saw travel and leisure stocks .FTNMX405010 fall to their lowest level of the year. Shares of cruiseship operator Carnival CCL.L, airlines easyJet EZJ.L and British Airways-owner IAG ICAG.L, and the UK's Restaurant Group RTN.L and Cineworld cinema chain CINE.L all fell between 5% and 6%. .EU
It wasn't just COVID crushing the mood either. China's supersized tech trio Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent had sank 2.5% - 3% overnight after a Shanghai court at the weekend posted a list of ""typical unfair competition cases"". .SS
PERMANENTLY CHANGED?
Oil prices sank more than 2% after the OPEC group of producing nations overcame a recent spat and agreed to boost output in a hastily arranged meeting on Sunday. O/R
Brent crude LCOc1 was down $1.70 at a five-week low of $71.85 a barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 fell a similar amount to $70.59 a barrel.
Global economic growth is beginning to show signs of fatigue as many countries, particularly in Asia, struggle to curb the highly contagious Delta variant of the novel coronavirus and have been forced into some form of lockdown.
Investors are also worried about the spectre of elevated inflation, which the market has long feared.
Economists at Bank of America downgraded their forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to 6.5%, from 7% previously, but maintained their 5.5% forecast for next year.
""As for inflation, the bad news is it's likely to remain elevated near term,"" they said in a note, pointing to their latest proprietary inflation meter, which remains high.
""The good news is ... we are likely near the peak, at least for the next few months, as base effects are less favourable and shortage pressures rotate away from goods towards services.""
In bond markets, the move to safe-haven assets meant the recent fall in yields continued. Germany’s 10-year bond yield DE10YT=RR was at its lowest since late March at -0.369% ahead of an ECB meeting this week. U.S. Treasury yields slipped to 1.265% and have fallen for 11 of the last 15 trading sessions.
Action in the currency market lifted the dollar =USD 0.3% against a basket of major currencies to 92.976.
But it failed to make ground against the Japanese yen - the dollar/yen currency pair traded below the 110 yen per dollar mark at 109.85, leaving the yen 0.2% higher on the day. JPY=
Britain's sterling hit a three-month low against the dollar at $1.3706 GBP=D3GBP/ after its health minister Sajid Javid had tested positive for COVID-19. That forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson and finance minister Rishi Sunak to quarantine on Sunday.
""Despite rising vaccination rates, a return to pre-corona normality seems questionable,"" Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX and commodity research at Commerzbank, wrote in a research note.

Owned by the United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co, GlobalFoundries in 2018 stopped pursuing the technology needed to make advanced computing chips, citing escalating costs. Instead, the company focuses on specialized fields like radio-frequency communications chips, which are used in 5G, and high-reliability manufacturing for automotive customers.
GlobalFoundries said it plans to add over the next several years a second factory at its ""Fab 8"" site in upstate New York, where it relocated its headquarters from California earlier this year. The new factory will double the site's chipmaking capacity and add 1,000 jobs, GlobalFoundries said, adding that the factory will be funded through ""private-public partnerships including customers, federal and state investments.""
In the shorter term, GlobalFoundries said it plans to spend $1 billion immediately to boost the existing factory's output by 150,000 wafers per year. Wafers are the silicon discs on which semiconductors are made in bulk, and each one can contain thousands of chips.
GlobalFoundries earlier this year announced a new chip factory in Singapore and an expansion of a chip factory in Dresden, Germany.
Mubadala is planning to take GlobalFoundries public in an initial public offering, sources have told Reuters. The Wall Street Journal last week reported that Intel Corp INTC.O was exploring acquiring GlobalFoundries for $30 billion.
A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that there are no active discussions with Intel yet, and Mubadala is focused on taking GlobalFoundries public as planned.
Mubadala declined to comment.

SYDNEY, July 19 (Reuters) - Asian shares slipped again on Monday while perceived safe haven assets, including the yen and gold, edged higher as investor risk appetite was soured by fears of rising inflation and a relentless surge in coronavirus cases.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 0.4% for its second straight day of losses.
Japan's Nikkei .N225 dropped 1.3% as did Australia's benchmark share index .AXJO. South Korea's KOSPI .KS11 was 1% lower while New Zealand's shares were off 0.4%.
Global economic growth is beginning to show signs of fatigue while many countries, particularly in Asia, are struggling to curb the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus and have been forced into some form of lockdown. The spectre of elevated inflation, which the market has long feared, is also haunting investors.
Economists at Bank of America have downgraded their forecasts for U.S. economic growth to 6.5% this year, from 7% previously, but maintained their 5.5% forecast for next year.
""As for inflation, the bad news is it’s likely to remain elevated near term,"" they said in a note, pointing to their latest read from their proprietary inflation meter which remains high.
""The good news is...we are likely near the peak, at least for the next few months, as base effects are less favourable and shortage pressures rotate away from goods towards services.""
U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly said any inflation fare-up is expected to be transitory, indicating monetary policy will remain supportive for some while yet.
Yet, it's taking a hard time convincing markets.
Aviva Investors, the global asset management business of Aviva plc, expects rapid growth and inflation to put some upward pressure on long-term sovereign bond yields.
""As such, we prefer to be somewhat underweight duration, mainly through U.S. treasuries,"" said Michael Grady, head of investment strategy and chief economist at Aviva Investors. ""Overall, we have a neutral view on currencies.""
Action in the currency market was muted on Monday.
The dollar =USD was barely changed against a basket of major currencies at 92.640.
Against the safe haven yen JPY=, the dollar was down 0.2% at 109.86, edging closer to the recent one-month trough of 109.52.
The euro was mostly flat at $1.1811.
The risk-sensitive Aussie AUD=D3 slipped to $0.7392, the lowest since last December during early Asian trading.
Equity performance in recent days underscored investor nerves.
For example, MSCI's all-country world index .MIWD00000PUS, a gauge of global shares scaled a record peak last week but finished it 0.6% lower. The Dow .DJI closed down 0.9%, the S&P 500 .SPX slipped 0.75%, and the Nasdaq .IXIC lost 0.8%.
These losses came despite stronger-than-forecast U.S. retail sales last week, which rose 0.6% in June, contrary to an expected decline.
Next on investors' radar is June quarter corporate earnings with Netflix NFLX.O, Philip Morris PM.N, Coca Cola KO.N and Intel Corp INTC.O among companies expected to report this week.
Bank of America analysts forecast an 11% earnings beat, which they say would help refuel investor confidence in broader economic recovery and drive a rotation back into so called ""value"" stocks, which currently trade below what they are actually worth.
Elsewhere, gold, a perceived safe haven asset, inched up with spot prices XAU= at $1,815.4 an ounce.
Oil extended losses, with Brent crude LCOc1 down 55 cents to $73.04 a barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 slipped 41 cents to $71.40 a barrel.

hanks to strong earnings results from several blue-chip companies and banks, the stock market has notched record highs. But despite strong June retail sales and the strong start to second-quarter earnings, there’s still some concerns about flagging consumer sentiment. How much higher can stocks go, particularly with valuations seemingly stretched in several sectors? That appears to be what pressured stocks this week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday declining 299.17 points, or 0.9%, to close at 34,687.85.
Weakness in blue chips such as Apple (AAPL), Home Depot (HD) and Cisco (CSCO) pressured the Dow. The S&P 500 index lost 32.87 points, or 0.75%, to end the session at 4,327.16, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed 115.90 points to finish at 14,427.24. The declines, driven by weak consumers sentiment, snapped a three week winning streak for each of the major averages.
Notably, investors were seemingly unswayed even as Jerome Powell, Fed Chairman, said all of the right things in his attempt to stabilize the market by saying the rise inflation was likely to be temporary. For the week, all three major averages posted declines, led by the Nasdaq which fell 1.9% for the week amid a sizable pullback in tech. The S&P 500 lost 1% for the week, while the Dow declined more moderately 0.5%. To be sure, despite the pullback, stocks aren’t far from record highs.
The market is in a see-saw battle between corporate earnings and the guidance that will be provided versus the potential impact of an increase spread of the coronavirus and possible delay in a global re-opening. But there’s also good news, such as the 0.6% increase in June U.S. retail sales which beat a forecast for a 0.4% decline. That is pretty significant. Plus, when excluding autos, which has suffered due to the chip shortage, retail sales rose 1.3% last month, which is almost three times as much as Wall Street expected. This data suggests the economy is quite strong.
What’s more, it also points to how quickly consumers are getting out of their homes to shop, eat and taking the vacations they were prevented from taking a year ago. And there’s more good news to factor in. Aside from widespread vaccinations across the country, which some analysts forecast will lead to a surge in economic growth, there’s also the infrastructure spending plan proposed by the Biden administration. These catalysts are factored into the the growth expectations not only for the second quarter, but also for the third and fourth quarters as well.
On the earnings front, things are starting to ramp up and here are the ones I'll be watching this week:
IBM (IBM) - Reports after the close, Monday, Jul. 19
Wall Street expects IBM to earn $2.29 per share on revenue of $18.29 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earning were $2.18 per share on $17.72 billion in revenue.
What to watch: IBM has always been a great stock to buy for dividend investors, but has the company become more appealing to growth investors as well? The tech giant has struggled to grow revenues over the past decade and has not benefited in the massive economic expansion that saw cloud leaders such as Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) produce double-digit revenue gains. But as it transitions away from its legacy businesses, IBM’s turnaround has seemingly begun. The company’s cloud ambitions have shown some promise in recent quarters, and has provided ample revenue strength to support a higher multiple, thanks to the Red Hat acquisition which modernized its cloud business.
The company is now forecasted to grow revenues by high single digits annually over the next 5 years. The stock has rallied from about $115 back in January to near $140, but the stock is facing some key resistance. The market is now, understandably, taking a wait-and-see attitude with Monday’s earnings results.
United Airlines (UAL) - Reports after the close, Tuesday, Jul. 20
Wall Street expects United Airlines to lose $4.23 per share on revenue of $5.25 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the loss was $9.31 per share on revenue of $1.48 billion.
What to watch: Due to slumping booking demand caused by the pandemic, airline stocks have been one of the worst-performing sectors over the past year. But that was before vaccine distribution kicked into high gear. Not only has airline traffic picked up over the past six months, there is optimism that the increased demand will be sustainable through 2022. In anticipation of this, United recently ordered 270 narrow-body planes that will replace the company’s fleet of 50-seat regional jets. This is on top the company’s existing orders that has an estimated price tag of close to $15 billion. The investment is based on the company’s capacity growth forecasts of 5% annually through over the next five years. The question is, with the stock passing the $50 benchmark, will the market assign United a valuation that is commensurate to its growth objective? While the company is arguably better-positioned today than a year ago, like with IBM, investors are taking a wait-and-see approach before piling in more cash.
Netflix (NFLX) - Reports after the close, Tuesday, Jul. 20
Wall Street expects Netflix to earn $3.15 per share on revenue of $7.32 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $1.59 per share on $6.08 billion in revenue.
What to watch: Despite the emergence of rival streamers such as Disney+ (DIS), HBO Max (T) and Apple TV+ (AAPL), Netflix has figured out ways to maintain its status as the king of streaming. The company has been willing to consistently re-evaluate its market position and approach to remain competitive. One recent example is negotiated a deal with Sony (SONY) that now allows Netflix not only to receive more content sooner than their previous deal, it also also opens the door for both companies to delve into new partnerships. Netflix stock has responded favorably, rising 10% over the past month, besting the 2.7% rise in the S&P 500 index. But Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne, despite maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock, last week highlighted some risks for Netflix, suggesting that estimates for both Q2 and Q3 might be too bullish. Swinburne seen an increase in net subscribers to come in Q4 and for 2022 as the new content accelerates. As is often the case, how the company guides for the next quarter and full year will answer the important question of what direction the stock takes.
Intel (INTC) - Reports after the close, Thursday, Jul. 22
Wall Street expects Intel to earn $1.06 per share on revenue of $17.84 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $1.23 per share on revenue of $19.73 billion.
What to watch: Which version of Intel will the market see on Thursday? Shares of the chip giant has fallen 3% over the past six months, compared to 16% rise in the S&P 500 index. The stock is down more than 14% since the company reported its Q1 results. While Intel has surpassed the Street’s revenue estimates in nine straight quarters, investors have grown frustrated about the company’s lack of progress in key business segments, particularly in its datacenter group and client computing group, which accounts for 28.3% and 53.9% of the company’s Q1 revenue, respectively. Weaknesses in these areas for Intel have been magnified by the successes and market share gains from rivals AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) in several important chip developments. While new CEO Pat Gelsinger has done a decent job changing the negative narrative surrounding the company, Intel on Thursday must prove the naysayers wrong, while selling the upside potential of the many growth initiatives it can still achieve.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 1.1% for a second straight day of losses to 677.45, a level not seen since July 12. The index was on track for its biggest daily percentage drop since July 8.
Japan's Nikkei .N225 dropped 1.3% as did Australia's benchmark share index .AXJO. South Korea's KOSPI .KS11 was 1% lower, while Chinese stocks also started on the backfoot with the blue-chip index .CSI300 down 0.6%.
Oil prices stumbled more than 1% after an agreement over the weekend within the OPEC+ group of producers to boost output at a time when the outlook for demand is still cloudy. O/R
Global economic growth is beginning to show signs of fatigue while many countries, particularly in Asia, are struggling to curb the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus and have been forced into some form of lockdown. The spectre of elevated inflation, which the market has long feared, is also haunting investors.
Economists at Bank of America downgraded their forecast for U.S. economic growth to 6.5% this year, from 7% previously, but maintained their 5.5% forecast for next year.
""As for inflation, the bad news is it's likely to remain elevated near term,"" they said in a note, pointing to their latest read from their proprietary inflation meter which remains high.
""The good news is ... we are likely near the peak, at least for the next few months, as base effects are less favourable and shortage pressures rotate away from goods towards services.""
U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly said any inflation flare-up is expected to be transitory, indicating monetary policy will remain supportive for some while yet.
Yet, markets remain hard to convince.
Aviva Investors, the global asset management business of Aviva plc, expects rapid growth and inflation to put some upward pressure on long-term sovereign bond yields.
""As such, we prefer to be somewhat underweight duration, mainly through U.S. treasuries,"" said Michael Grady, head of investment strategy and chief economist at Aviva Investors. ""Overall, we have a neutral view on currencies.""
Action in the currency market was muted on Monday.
The dollar =USD was mildly firmer against a basket of major currencies at 92.712.
Against the safe haven yen JPY=, the dollar was down 0.2% at 109.90, edging closer to the recent one-month trough of 109.52.
The euro was mostly flat at $1.1801.
The risk-sensitive Aussie AUD=D3 slipped to $0.7372, the lowest since last December during early Asian trading.
Equity performance in recent days underscored investor nerves.
MSCI's all-country world index .MIWD00000PUS, a gauge of global shares scaled a record peak last week but finished it 0.6% lower. On Friday, the Dow .DJI closed down 0.9%, the S&P 500 .SPX slipped 0.75%, and the Nasdaq .IXIC lost 0.8%.
These losses came despite stronger-than-forecast U.S. retail sales last week, which rose 0.6% in June, contrary to an expected decline.
Next on investors' radar is June quarter corporate earnings with Netflix NFLX.O, Philip Morris PM.N, Coca Cola KO.N and Intel Corp INTC.O among companies expected to report this week.
Bank of America analysts forecast an 11% earnings beat, which they say would help refuel investor confidence in broader economic recovery and drive a rotation back into so called ""value"" stocks, which currently trade below what they are actually worth.
Elsewhere, gold, a perceived safe haven asset, inched up with spot prices XAU= at $1,815.4 an ounce.
Brent crude LCOc1 was down 90 cents to $72.69 a barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 slipped 83 cents to $70.98 a barrel.

2021-07-17 00:00:00+00:00,2 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy in July,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-dividend-paying-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-july-2021-07-17,,,"Chip stocks have experienced choppy trading action this year, but the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index has managed to stay above water. It's returned over 17% year to date and has more than doubled over the last two years.
Prospects for more gains look favorable. World Semiconductor Trade Statistics calls for the chip market to increase by 19.7% in 2021 and by 8.8% in 2022. Chips have become the fundamental building blocks of the global economy, with technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and 5G wireless connectivity becoming more pervasive. Investors can not only ride these trends to decent returns, but there are some very profitable semiconductor companies that have a record of paying regular dividends too.
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) are two great dividend-paying tech stocks to consider buying shares of today.

1. Texas Instruments
The semiconductor industry is highly competitive and can be subject to dips in demand when the global economy turns south. There's also an ongoing risk with rapid technological change and pricing pressures. It's for these reasons investors should do well with Texas Instruments.
Texas Instruments has been in business since 1930 and has successfully navigated a wide range of geopolitical and economic obstacles. Most importantly, it possesses structural advantages that allow it to produce healthy amounts of free cash flow and pay dividends. It has 14 manufacturing sites worldwide, tremendous product breadth, and over 100,000 customers that use its embedded and analog chips across a wide variety of products, including mobile phones, enterprise computer systems, and autonomous vehicles.
Texas Instruments invests in its own manufacturing process, which allows it to drive costs down, leading to healthy margins. Even during the supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic, Texas Instruments generated $5.5 billion in free cash flow on revenue of $14.4 billion.
""[O]ur competitive advantage of internal manufacturing and technology delivers the benefits of lower cost and greater control of our supply chain which really shows through in a market environment like this,"" said Investor Relations Vice President Dave Pahl during the Q1 earnings call.
Since 2004, Texas Instruments has increased its dividend by 26% on a compounded annual basis. It paid $3.4 billion in dividends in 2020, which suggests a cash payout ratio of 62% relative to free cash flow, providing the business a cushion to maintain dividend payments in a weak demand environment. At a current dividend yield of 2.1%, investors can buy shares of one of the best chip companies around and get paid an above-average yield.

2. Taiwan Semiconductor
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has built an incredibly profitable business making chips for other companies, including Advanced Micro Devices, NVIDIA, and Intel. Its the leading chip foundry in the world with 57% market share. In 2020, revenue and earnings per share advanced 25% and 50%, respectively. Rising demand for powerful chips for 5G and artificial intelligence applications should keep TSMC in growth mode.
The stock has climbed 365% over the last five years, which beats Texas Instrument's return of 199%. While TSMC has been the better growth stock, Texas Instruments might be the safer dividend stock. That's because TSMC pays out virtually all of its free cash flow in dividends. Over the last four quarters, TSMC's cash payout ratio was 96%, which doesn't leave much wiggle room to sustain the dividend if chip demand suddenly dropped off.
Moreover, the sharp rise in TSMC shares has made the stock more expensive, trading at over 30 times forward earnings estimates. That has also brought its dividend yield down to 1.4%, but despite its lower dividend yield and high cash payout ratio, there are a few reasons why TSMC should be a great dividend stock.
First, TSMC has a fortress balance sheet, with $23 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter, which is more than enough to offset its debt.
Another reason investors can be confident in TSMC's dividend payout is the future demand curve for chip technologies. Last year's growth wasn't a fluke. Management's capital budget for 2021 calls for spending between $25 billion to $28 billion. This higher spending is in preparation to meet the growing demand expected over the next few years for 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer, and eventually 3-nanometer chip nodes. TSMC is guiding for revenue to grow between 10% to 15% annualized through 2025.
Texas Instruments and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are both as solid as rocks. Choosing winners and losers can be difficult in the semiconductor industry, but Texas Instruments and TSMC have delivered exceptional performance, and should continue rewarding investors with solid returns and steady dividend payments for years to come.

2021-07-16 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Short-Circuited Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-short-circuited-today-2021-07-16,,,"What happened
Shares of graphics and crypto-mining semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) tumbled for a fourth straight day Friday, falling another 4% through 3:20 p.m. EDT.
You can probably thank Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) -- and The Wall Street Journal -- for that.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
As the WSJ reported today, Intel is ""in talks"" to buy rival Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) old chip-production division, GlobalFoundries, in a deal valued at $30 billion.
The deal, if true, would constitute Intel's largest-ever acquisition, and transform Intel into a major player in the market for contract chip manufacturing -- a market currently dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and a market utilized by Nvidia.
The combination would not directly affect Nvidia, which according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence uses Taiwan Semiconductor as its main contract manufacturer. It would, however, be interesting in a larger industry context because GlobalFoundries still provides contract manufacturing services to AMD (as does Taiwan Semiconductor).
Now what
In short, the rumored deal would increase Intel's market power, and perhaps by extension minimize Nvidia's. That being said, this acquisition is no sure thing.
The WSJ makes it clear that GlobalFoundries' agreeing to a buyout is not ""guaranteed."" Moreover, the newspaper says GlobalFoundries' own executives don't appear to be involved in the negotiations, and even deny they are in talks with Intel. (The implication being that Intel is negotiating directly with GlobalFoundries' owner, Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment.)
Still, if there's one thing the stock market abhors, it's uncertainty. Until we get a clearer picture of exactly what Intel is up to -- and whether it will succeed -- Nvidia investors may remain nervous about the outcome.

July 16 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell on Friday, with growth and value stocks falling as investors turned risk-averse towards the end of the week, while gains in defensive parts of the market kept declines at bay.
Markets have largely cheered a steady recovery in the labor market this year, but concerns about higher inflation due to a faster-than-expected rebound has hurt sentiment, with investors oscillating between ""value"" and tech-heavy ""growth"" names in the past few sessions.
Economy-sensitive S&P 500 energy .SPNY, financials .SPSY and industrials .SPLRCI led declines among the 11 major sector indexes by afternoon trading. The energy sector is down over 6% so far for the week.
Technology stocks .SPLRCT also fell on Friday, while defensive utilities .SPLRCU, consumer staples .SPLRCS and real estate .SPLRCR gained. Real estate also hit a record.
""It's been hard for the market to gain here from these already elevated prices,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.
""Investors are more concerned right now about missing the upside of this market than they are about a sell off. In the near term, all they're really doing is shifting between stocks and not taking money out of the overall market.""
Data from the Commerce Department showed retail sales rebounded 0.6% last month, as spending is shifting back to services, bolstering expectations that economic growth accelerated in the second quarter.
After earnings from big banks this week, focus will shift to quarterly results from technology-focused companies including International Business Machines Corp IBM.N, Netflix Inc NFLX.O, Verizon Communications VZ.N, AT&T T.N, Intel Corp INTC.O, Snap Inc SNAP.N and Twitter Inc TWTR.N.
""We got a lot of optimism for the earnings, but then you've got fear of inflation and that's kind of giving us a whipsaw market,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC.
""The tech earnings starting next week can make the market forget about those fears (inflation).""

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Intel may buy chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-is-in-talks-to-buy-globalfoundries-for-about-30-billion-11626387704 for $30 billion, says a Wall Street Journal report. That seems logical in light of Intel’s production problems, and a global semiconductor shortage. But it might make most sense if any acquisition were followed by a bigger Intel divestment.
Chipmaking is expensive and difficult, so most companies either design or produce. GlobalFoundries does the latter but Intel does both, and boss Pat Gelsinger has opened up its factories to rival semiconductor designers to spread costs. GlobalFoundries would bring customers and technology – though the company, owned by Abu Dhabi sovereign fund Mubadala Investment, isn’t in talks, according to the Journal.
The risk is that GlobalFoundries customers might not like seeing Intel inside. Besides, investors like specialization. Intel is valued at 3 times trailing revenue. Specialized rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are valued at 8 and 11 times.
AMD figures in this story in another way too. It used to own GlobalFoundries and eventually spun the whole thing out deciding independence suited both better. Since then AMD’s stock is up more than 30-fold. Maybe by buying, combining and then spinning off manufacturing operations, Intel can have it both ways. (By Robert Cyran)

Tech stocks went into high gear in the middle of May. The Nasdaq rallied 15% and the chip stocks followed along. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock ran 32% from low to high. It has since retreated -9% off the top, but the 12-month performance is still impressive.

Owning AMD stock for the long term is absolutely a viable thesis. Timing it right short term is the tricky part now. Spoiler alert, I’d rather delay deploying new risk until after a substantial dip.
I have been a fan of AMD stock for a long time. Management earned its kudos in my book. They normalized their financial metrics pretty quickly. The turnaround was impressive and investors who believed in it reaped a handsome reward.
At this stage, I would prefer waiting out a few weeks before deploying new money into it. I say this with a clear conscience because I have been consistent with my bullish message.
AMD Stock Is Cheap
The company went from expensive to cheap in a short period of time. In the last three years, they doubled their revenues and increased their net income 10 times. AMD stock now sports a svelte 9 price-to-sales and 40 price-to-earnings ratio. This is much cheaper than Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) its main competitor. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is the cheapest but for good reason while management rights that ship.
7 of the Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy as Others Get Greedy
All three are winners and will have strong demand for years. The whole world is going digital and in a panic. Buying the dip will yield the best results in the short and medium terms. This week’s dip is not yet big enough for me. I am confident that there will be better opportunities later this year.
My favorite chip stock remains AMD. INTC is second and NVDA is third because of value. I could change my mind if Nvidia crashes to bring it back in line.
For almost a year, AMD has traded in a very wide horizontal range above $73 per share. If the bulls lose that for any reason, they risk losing another 12% to 15% from there. That’s the great entry point that I am seeking this year. If it doesn’t come so be it. I am willing to miss out on whatever upside there is above here.
It Can Get Cheaper From Outside Factors

We have to remember that stocks don’t trade in a vacuum. They will need the help of an entire market. The indices are running on fumes and into diminishing returns from the economic relief packages. We could be going into a tough fall season. There’s also the chip shortage problem that certainly won’t help matters much. These are precarious situations for stocks. This is not a reason to short them, but at least be patient and not chase.
Because the markets are at all time highs and for so long, we all must be traders not just investors. Even those who are in it for the long term should think about having protection or balance. We have seen all dips find immediate buyers for too long. My watch list has a bunch of stocks that have fallen into support. I could assume that they will all hold, but if they don’t, the leg lower will be painful.
What happened in March to the Nasdaq was likely just a scary preview. The higher we go without a correction, the faster and harder we fall. My message today is that it would be better to wait for a bigger dip. Therefore, I am committing to buying the dip that suits my taste. Anything near $70 per share would be good, closer to $60 would be awesome.
Last year during the pandemic panic, I successfully bought the dip in size. Smart money stepped up to the plate while the masses were panicking. I do the homework now so I can repeat the process again. My bet is there will be another tizzy this year.

July 16 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes reversed early gains on Friday, with a decline in cyclical stocks outweighing gains in growth stocks, while data showing an unexpected increase in U.S. retail sales in June kept declines at bay.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rebounded 0.6% last month, as spending is shifting back to services, bolstering expectations that economic growth accelerated in the second quarter.
Markets have largely cheered a steady recovery in the labor market this year, but concerns about higher inflation due to a faster-than-expected rebound has hurt sentiment, with investors oscillating between ""value"" and tech-heavy ""growth"" names in the past few sessions.
""We got a lot of optimism for the earnings, but then you've got fear of inflation and that's kind of giving us a whipsaw market,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC.
After earnings from big banks this week, focus will shift to earnings reports from technology-focused companies including International Business Machines Corp IBM.N, Netflix Inc NFLX.O, Verizon Communications VZ.N, AT&T T.N, Intel Corp INTC.O, Snap Inc SNAP.N and Twitter Inc TWTR.N.
""The tech earnings starting next week can make the market forget about those fears (inflation),"" said Bright Trading's Dick.
