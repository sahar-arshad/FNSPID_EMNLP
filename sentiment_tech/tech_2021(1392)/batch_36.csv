2021-04-06 00:00:00+00:00,7 Best Stocks on the Nasdaq,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-best-stocks-on-the-nasdaq-2021-04-06,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
When the Nasdaq composite index peaked in February, investors who bid on the dip likely lost money. Confidence in the technology is waning. Selling follows after most sharp rallies, while the index struggles in building an uptrend.
The market is shifting away from the stay-at-home pandemic trade and seeking traditionally valued stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Valuations are another headwind for the sector that rewarded investors with gains above 100% or more in the last year, in some cases.
Investors cannot time the dip, so buying the best stocks on the Nasdaq is the next best thing to do.
7 Monthly Dividend Stocks That Pay the Bills
The seven best stocks on the exchange and listed in alphabetical order are:
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)
DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU)
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR)
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN)
List sorted by overall score
Chart courtesy of Stock Rover
In the table, Regeneron scores the best overall and on quality. On quality, every stock scores an 82/100 or above except for DocuSign. DocuSign makes up for the lower quality score with a strong valuation ratings score of 72/100.
Facebook sticks out for having a perfect 100/100 on its growth score.
The scores will change for the better as these firms increase profits and revenue in 2021.
Nasdaq Stocks: Cisco Systems (CSCO)

Cisco Systems bottomed in November 2020 at below $36. CSCO stock staged a rebound after it posted strong quarterly earnings. On March 1, it announced the completion of its Acacia Communications acquisition. Cisco paid $4.5 billion for the company. Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said Acacia will help it meet the fast-growing demand for data. He said, “our Internet for the Future strategy puts Acacia’s high-speed coherent optics technologies front and center as we work to empower webscale companies, service providers, and data center operators.”
In the second quarter, Cisco posted a product order growth of 1% year-on-year. GAAP earnings per share fell 12% YOY to 60 cents. Although revenue did not change at $12 billion in Q2, it forecast Q3 revenue growing 3.5% to 5.5% YOY. EPS will be in the range of 64 to 69 cents.
Strong DevOps buyers, IoT, and the Meraki technology platform are growth drivers for Cisco.
DocuSign (DOCU)

After failing to break out at above $250 since the start of the year, DocuSign is trading in a holding pattern. The EPS beat in the fourth quarter failed to lift DOCU stock.
In Q4, DocuSign posted EPS of 37 cents beating consensus estimates by 15 cents. Revenue grew by an impressive 56.7% at $430.9 million. The company forecast revenue of $1.96 billion to $1.97 billion. In the months ahead, as companies bring workers back to the physical office, contracts will get digitized. They will need a solution offered from DocuSign instead of going back to paper.
7 Monthly Dividend Stocks That Pay the Bills
After the trifecta again of beating estimates on earnings, revenue, and offering guidance that exceeds expectations, DocuSign is the best stock on the Nasdaq to watch.
DocuSign is worth over $200 if its revenue growth continues over the next five years.

In the model, readers may assume an EBITDA multiple of around 42 times. This would reflect the strong revenue growth ahead, as companies embrace digitization for contract management.
Readers may assign a lower discount rate if they are confident that the company will continue beating expectations.
 Dollar Tree (DLTR)

Like DocuSign, discount store Dollar Tree posted strong fourth-quarter results. It earned $2.13 a share, up 310% YOY. Investors cannot go wrong buying DLTR stock.
Net sales rose by 7.2% to $6.77 billion. In the all-important same-store sales metric, Family Dollar’s 8.1% increase suggests continued strength ahead. Dollar Tree’s Family Dollar partnered nationally with Instacart. This resulted in continued sales momentum at its stores. Furthermore, the company introduced a new “combination store” format that performed very well.
During fiscal 2020, it tested this format at its approximately 50 stores in rural and small-town communities. The strong results suggest that the company will expand the format this year. In Q4, the company bought back 1.83 million shares for $200 million. With $2.4 billion in its share repurchase authorization, shareholders are getting the maximum return from their investment.
Nasdaq Stocks: Facebook (FB)

Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming privacy changes are an existential threat to Facebook. But CEO Mark Zukerberg said that the changes will put Facebook’s commerce products in a stronger position. Apple is giving users direct control on its privacy. So when Apple’s iOS 14 gives them privacy options, users could limit the way Facebook tracks them.
Giving limited customer data to customers may end up hurting advertisers. Since advertisers have few other platforms besides Facebook, ad sales should not change.
To expand its addressable market, Facebook launched Instagram Lite to 170 countries. The growing user base will solidify the experience-sharing site’s social networking market share.
7 Monthly Dividend Stocks That Pay the Bills
In the fourth quarter, Facebook said it would buy back $25 billion in shares. This is in addition to its $34 billion authorization. The continued site usage and 33% revenue growth assures that investors are getting the best returns by holding FB stock.
Intel (INTC)

Intel’s Rocket Lake processor launch keeps the mature chip giant in the game. The company says the 11th generation Intel core offers “unmatched overclocking, game performance.”
The i9-11900K chip is nothing short of impressive. It offers speeds of up to 5.3GHz, which should appeal to power users and PC gamers. The chip is 19% faster than previous generation architectures. The integrated graphics architecture performance is an equally notable achievement. Business users who buy CPUs want on-board graphics support to lower the cost over ownership. On the press release, Intel said that the UHD graphics matter “because games and most applications continue to depend on high-frequency cores to drive high frame rates and low latency.”
For a few quarters, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) enjoyed a sizable technical lead over Intel. Rocket Lake is an answer to AMD’s Ryzen 5000 series chip. Still, AMD offers better performance at the price paid. But with limited supplies from the latest Ryzen CPU, Intel has a chance to accelerate sales in 2021.
Microsoft (MSFT)

Software giant Microsoft grew its addressable market when it received the European Union’s approval for the Bethesda acquisition. Acquiring ZeniMax Media, the parent of Bethesda Softworks, gives Microsoft 23 game studios.
Titles like Doom and Fallout have growing revenue potential as the gaming sector remains hot. Consumers have few other major sources of entertainment during and after the pandemic. Microsoft will not only increase its cash flow from its Office365, SQL Server, and Windows sales but will get a lift from games.
In early March, hackers took advantage of a flaw in Microsoft’s email software. The hack affected tens of thousands of organizations in Asia and Europe. Despite the negative news, MSFT stock did not react at all. Shares traded steadily in the $230 to $240 range for the month.

Microsoft is resilient to bad news as the market looks ahead to its continued growth.
Nasdaq Stocks: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)

After announcing positive topline data for its novel coronavirus antibody, Regeneron has yet to attract investors. REGN stock is taking a back seat to Covid-19 vaccine suppliers instead.
The drug manufacturer is posting billions in revenue for its blockbuster drug, Dupixent. On top of that, markets are ignoring the potential of its treatment for Covid-19 patients. On March 23, Regeneron reported the results of its Phase 3 trial. The antibody cocktail reduced hospitalization or death by 70% for non-hospitalized Covid-19 patients. It also shorted the duration of symptoms by four days.
Regeneron said that doses in the 1,200 mg to 8,000 mg range had similar efficacy. This suggests that if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves REGEN-COV, it will have a 1,200 mg dose level. Chief Scientific Officer Dr. George D. Yancopoulos said, “We will discuss the new data with regulatory authorities and request that the 1,200 mg dose be rapidly added to the U.S. Emergency Use Authorization, in order for the anticipated REGEN-COV supply to be available to treat even more patients.”
If approved, Regeneron will become one of the best stocks on the Nasdaq to hold.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 24 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Intel Corp, but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $40.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $86.00. The standard deviation is $12.853.
But the whole reason to look at the average INTC price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with INTC crossing above that average target price of $65.58/share, investors in INTC have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $65.58 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

2021-04-06 00:00:00+00:00,Intel aims for supply chain edge with new data center chip,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-aims-for-supply-chain-edge-with-new-data-center-chip-2021-04-06,,,"By Stephen Nellis
April 6 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O on Tuesday introduced its newest flagship data center microprocessor, hoping its in-house manufacturing operations will help it navigate a chip shortage to better compete against rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc's (AMD) AMD.O faster chips.
The new ""Ice Lake"" chip is designed to be used by cloud computing providers and others who run massive data centers, and Intel said it has already shipped about 200,000 test units.
Intel's new chip will be slower than AMD's new flagship data center server chip released last month. Intel years ago lost its speed lead because of fumbles with the in-house 10-nanometer manufacturing technology it uses to make the chip, while AMD outsources its server chip manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW and has gained market share against Intel.
But Intel is hoping that greater control over its supply chain - in addition to a portfolio of data storage, networking and other chips designed to work well with the ""Ice Lake"" processor - will help make the chips competitive during the midst of a global chip supply crunch, in part by mitigating customer concerns about shortages.
""Nobody else in the industry has the intersection of (intellectual property), architecture, design and manufacturing. We think that's a particularly important differentiator for the company at a time when demand is exploding and supply is short,"" Navin Shenoy, executive vice president and general manager of the data platforms group at Intel, told Reuters.
To fight the loss of its speed title, Intel has focused on tailoring its chips and systems to optimize them for specific kinds of computing. One area of focus has been 5G networks, which are shifting from being built on proprietary systems such as those from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd HWT.UL toward using commodity parts like Intel chips. Shenoy said Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N plans to use the new ""Ice Lake"" chips.
Verizon will appear at an event showcasing the chips, alongside Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Oracle Corp ORCL.N and others.
Intel's 5G push ""gives economies that are worried about security issues or geopolitical tensions a lot more flexibility. They can lean on Western supply chains to build out their next-generation 5G infrastructure,"" Shenoy said.

2021-04-06 00:00:00+00:00,Don't Count Intel Out Just Yet,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dont-count-intel-out-just-yet-2021-04-06,,,"A combination of solid products from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and years of delays and missteps on the manufacturing side has put chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in a tough spot. The company is still manufacturing many chips on its 14-nanometer (nm) process because of problems with its 10nm process, a situation that has erased any manufacturing lead Intel once had over third-party foundries.
AMD uses a 7nm process from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for its latest Ryzen PC chips. The Ryzen 5000 series, which launched late last year, overtook Intel's chips in terms of single-threaded performance thanks in part to that cutting-edge manufacturing technology. Single-threaded performance is particularly important for gaming, as well as for other use cases that can't take full advantage of many cores.
Comparing manufacturing processes across companies isn't exactly apples-to-apples, but it's clear that Intel has fallen behind. However, the company is still managing to wring out performance gains from its 14nm process. Intel's latest Rocket Lake PC chips, built on a heavily tweaked and optimized 14nm process, manage to hold their own against AMD.
The chips are based on the Cypress Cove architecture, Intel's first new desktop PC architecture in years. That architecture change and whatever manufacturing improvements Intel made are enough to provide a viable alternative to AMD, particularly for PC gamers. While AMD certainly has the upper hand until Intel starts shipping 7nm chips, the company shouldn't be counted out.
Image source: Intel.
Rocket Lake goes after gamers
Part of AMD's strategy with its Ryzen chips has been to up the core count aggressively. The $549 Ryzen 5900X, for example, sports 12 cores and 24 threads. The lower-end $299 Ryzen 5600X has six cores and 12 threads.
Intel is not trying to compete on core counts with Rocket Lake at the high end, partly because the new chips require a lot of power to be competitive. Instead, the company is ceding AMD's advantage in heavily multithreaded applications and focusing on single-threaded performance.
The $539 i9-11900K from Intel features eight cores and 16 threads, so it loses by a wide margin to AMD's comparably priced chips in multithreaded applications. But reviewers at Tom's Hardware found Intel's chip to offer similar performance in gaming and other lightly threaded applications to AMD's Ryzen 5900X.
The cheaper i5-11600K from Intel, which is a six-core, 12-thread part priced at $262, undercuts the Ryzen 5600X on price. There's a graphics-less version of Intel's chip with an MSRP of just $237 as well. While the Ryzen chips beats the Intel chip in gaming benchmarks, the significantly lower price makes the i5-11600K a compelling choice for cost-conscious gamers.
One factor that complicates these comparisons is the actual retail pricing available. AMD has struggled to keep its chips its stock, and retail pricing for Ryzen chips is often much higher than MSRP. The Ryzen 5600X sells for around $400 on Amazon.com right now, for example.
Manufacturing its own chips may give Intel an advantage, since it has more control over supply. Even though Intel's chips are far from clear-cut winners at MSRP, if gamers have a choice between an Intel chip close to MSRP and an AMD chip at a severely inflated price, the Intel chip starts to look like a much better option.
It's likely tp take years for Intel to close the manufacturing gap between itself and leading third-party foundries. But even with an aging 14nm process, Intel has been able to keep putting out largely competitive products. AMD has staged an impressive comeback and has a clear advantage, but Intel is far from a lost cause.

FAANGs Start to Look Sharper, Too
The Nasdaq Composite remains a few hundred points shy of its February highs, but it still had itself a day, climbing 1.7% to 13,705.
The tech-heavy index was propelled in part by Tesla (TSLA), which jumped 4.4% along with several other electric vehicle stocks Monday. Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives upgraded Tesla to ""Outperform"" and raised his price target to $1,000 amid several drivers, including EV-friendly initiatives in President Joe Biden's $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan.
Also heading higher were all of the ""FAANGs,"" best among them Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL, +4.2%) and Facebook (FB, +3.4%) – welcome news for the group of mega-cap tech and tech-adjacent stocks that easily outstripped the major indices in 2020 but have collectively simmered this year, underperforming the S&P 500 on average.
Most of the analyst community remains bullish on the group, though each of these large companies has a more difficult row to hoe in 2021. Should you buy the FAANGs now?

April 5 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger will virtually attend a meeting being put together by President Joe Biden's administration for April 12 to discuss the semiconductor supply chain issues disrupting U.S. automotive factories, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Reuters previously reported the meeting will include Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and a top economic aide, Brian Deese, as well as chipmakers and automakers.
Gelsinger last month said Intel will spend $20 billion to build two new chip factories in Arizona.
A chip shortage has been disrupting U.S. automobile production since late last year.
Ford Motor Co F.N, which has had to cut production of its best-selling F-150 because of the shortage, last week said that it will provide investors an update on the hit to its operating profit on April 28. The U.S. automaker previously said its operating profit this year would be reduced by $1 billion to $2.5 billion. The update to that forecast will be provided when Ford reports first-quarter results on April 28.
The Biden administration last week called for $50 billion in funding to support the U.S. chip industry as part of the administration's $2 trillion infrastructure plan. In February, the administration ordered a review of the semiconductor supply chain to find gaps in U.S. manufacturing capabilities.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-04-04 00:00:00+00:00,Why ASML Holdings Rose 11.1% in March,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-asml-holdings-rose-11.1-in-march-2021-04-04,,,"What happened
Shares of ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) rose 11.1% in March, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
The sole maker of mission-critical EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography machines necessary to produce leading-edge semiconductors inked a big new order from a major customer. Additionally, a widespread global chip shortage boosted forecasts for semiconductor equipment more broadly.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
In late February, ASML inked a $4.3 billion five-year procurement deal with Korean chip giant SK Hynix (OTC: HXSCL) for around 30 EUV machines. The move is notable because while EUV technology has already made a big splash in semiconductor logic chips, it's just now moving into the memory-chip space.
However, SK Hynix is one of the world's largest memory producers, and will use EUV machines to produce its next-generation DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) chips. Hynix also recently announced a massive $106 billion cluster of fabrication plants in Korea, marking a huge expansion of its production capabilities.
This is just another instance of huge spending across the semiconductor space recently, which has boosted sentiment for semiconductor equipment stocks. In March, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) held its Intel Unleashed event featuring new CEO Pat Gelsinger. While some had thought Intel might abandon in-house manufacturing altogether, Gelsinger instead doubled down, announcing two new fab plants in Arizona -- a project that will cost $20 billion. Intel also said it was doubling down on EUV in order to catch up to Asian rivals in leading-edge chip capabilities -- another positive for ASML.
Finally, analysts at Cowen upgraded their price target and ratings on ASML from neutral to buy, citing higher EUV demand visibility. All of these factors led to a solid 11.1% gain in March, putting ASML up a nice 26.6% for the year:

Trading at around 50 times this year's earnings estimates, ASML is much more expensive than some of its semiconductor-equipment peers. Yet that's at least partially deserved. The company holds a monopoly on EUV lithography technology, the key that unlocks today's smallest, most powerful, and most advanced chips. With leading semiconductor foundries recently announcing massive spending plans and even Western governments now allocating billions to bring leading-edge chip production to their shores, ASML's growth path over the next decade seems assured. Expect the good times to continue.

Shares of Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) rose 13% in March, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
The leading semiconductor equipment company by revenue continued to benefit as the global race in advanced chip production heated up, amid severe semiconductor shortages across a broad range of applications.

So what
Applied Materials had already been up strongly on the year, amid a blowout February earnings report, as well as increased spending forecasts from large customer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) in January. Widespread reports of a severe semiconductor shortage this year have also pushed sentiment higher for Applied as well.
The good news kept on coming in March, when Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) held an event updating investors on its future production strategy. Intel has struggled with its 7-nanometer chip production in recent years, falling behind Taiwan Semiconductor and leading some to believe Intel may scrap its in-house production entirely. Yet new CEO Pat Gelsinger did the opposite, announcing Intel would instead invest $20 billion in two new fabs (chip factories) of its own in Arizona, while also becoming a foundry for other chip designers.
That means there will be another large buyer for Applied Materials' machines, as companies and countries around the world seek to own significant in-country chip production.
Now what
Not only is Intel looking to invest in more U.S. chip production capacity, but semiconductors are also part of the Biden administration's new infrastructure bill, The American Jobs Act. About $50 billion of the $2 trillion bill will be geared toward advanced semiconductor research and manufacturing.
For much of the past two years, amid the trade war, Applied Materials was a cheap value stock. Now, with pandemic-era digitization trends accelerating and countries realizing the need to have critical capacity on their own shores, demand for leading semiconductor manufacturing equipment is soaring. No wonder Applied's stock is up so much this year. Even more strikingly, the company still only trades at 22 times this year's earnings estimates.
The company will hold its next investor meeting on Tuesday, April 6.

2021-04-04 00:00:00+00:00,The 3 Best Tech Dividend Stocks to Buy Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-3-best-tech-dividend-stocks-to-buy-now-2021-04-04,,,"March was a rough month for tech stocks, but there are plenty of buys out there after the sell-off. Some of those names in technology even pay a dividend -- and since tech is a growing industry, tech dividend payers are promising dividend payout increases over time. For the month of April, three Fool.com contributors think Amdocs (NASDAQ: DOX), Kulicke and Soffa Industries (NASDAQ: KLIC), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) are top dividend stocks right now.
You shouldn't take investing advice from short-sellers
Anders Bylund (Amdocs): Communications-oriented software and services specialist Amdocs can be found in Wall Street's bargain bin right now. The stock plunged 14% on Wednesday as a short-selling firm issued a scathing report on the company. Claims of outright accounting fraud from people with a negative financial interest in the stock should always be watched with a raised eyebrow, and this is no exception. I agree when well-respected analyst firm J.P. Morgan calls this situation a buying opportunity, driving share prices lower and effective dividend yields higher.
Here's the thing. It's not hard to make Amdocs look bad in a handcrafted report that highlights a few interesting events but doesn't give readers and investors the whole story. The company runs an incredibly complicated business model in order to cut down tax expenses and maximize its bottom-line returns. Pinch an unusual number here, put some spin on an accounting practice there, and you'll end up with a credible-looking fraud claim.
Founded in Israel and managed from Chesterfield, Missouri, Amdocs is registered in semi-British tax haven Guernsey for accounting purposes. Tax expenses stopped at $85 million in 2020, based on top-line revenue of $4.2 billion. Free cash flows are consistently higher than the tax-burdened net income. In the end, this company likes to pass its rising cash profits on to shareholders in the form of opportunistic buybacks and rising dividends. Quarterly payouts have nearly doubled in five years, and I expect the dividend boosts to continue:
DOX Dividend data by YCharts
I think it's a mistake to frown too hard at accusations from the short-seller report. Amdocs' stock is trading 13% below the multi-year highs that were set last week, and the dividend yield is a meaty 2%. There's no need to back up the truck here but Amdocs looks like a useful addition to income-oriented portfolios at this deep discount.

This semiconductor equipment leader is taking off
Billy Duberstein (Kulicke & Soffa): This is an extremely strong market for semiconductor equipment manufacturers, which should boost the stock of advanced packaging machine supplier Kulicke & Soffa, currently yielding 1.15%.
With manufacturing constrained and demand soaring from accelerated digitization trends brought on by the pandemic, the semiconductor sector is in a shortage. Meanwhile, $50 billion of semiconductor investment is currently included in the newly unveiled American Jobs Plan, the new infrastructure bill put forth by the White House. That's an effort catch up to leading Taiwan-based chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which just announced a $100 billion investment plan over three years. That announcement followed the $116 billion 10-year plan recently announced by Samsung (OTC: SSNLF), and the recent announcement by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) that it will build a new $20 billion foundry in Arizona.
This intense global race for new and better chips all bodes well for Kulicke & Soffa, which makes machines for back-end assembly processes that connect semiconductors into multi-chip packages. Back-end assembly is becoming crucial as chip system designs become more complex, increasing capital intensity in bonding, lithography, and other processes into which Kulicke sells its machines.
Currently, Kulicke & Soffa's business is booming. Last quarter, revenue surged 85.6%, and adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share of $0.86 nearly tripled. Management also guided to sequential growth in the current quarter. Annualizing last quarter's EPS yields $3.44 in earnings, which may be somewhat conservative, given the strong current quarter guidance. At just over $51 today, Kulicke's stock only trades around 15 times that annualized earnings estimate. But K&S also has an excellent balance sheet, with over $9 per share of cash. Factoring that in, the stock's enterprise value-to-earnings ratio is only around 12.5.
Obviously, the market is skeptical this historically cyclical stock can maintain these high levels of earnings. But with the current chip shortage likely to last through the year, along with the huge multi-year investment plans going on in advanced semiconductors all over the world, it's possible the industry could have permanently higher levels of equipment spend. If that's the case, K&S is still far too cheap.
An epic confluence of events for the world's largest chip fab
Nicholas Rossolillo (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing): It may not be a household name here in the states, but Taiwan Semiconductor has surpassed Intel as the world's largest chip manufacturer in recent years. The company claims an incredible 57% of the global chip fabrication market, hauling in $45.6 billion in sales over the last trailing 12 months.
As Billy mentioned above, TSM is investing heavily to expand its chipmaking capacity -- including building a new plant in Phoenix, Arizona. TSM has the most advanced manufacturing process around. Its 5 nm chip architecture (the smallest and most powerful computing semiconductors) is way ahead of the 7 nm chips of its rivals, and it's already working on even smaller 3 nm architecture to stay ahead of the pack. Besides benefiting from the global shortfall in tech hardware right now, TSM is setting itself up for years of dominance as it handles advanced silicon for everything from AI to 5G mobile networks.
Granted, TSM stock has more than doubled since the start of 2020 -- even after pulling back over 10% from all-time highs last month. But shares trade for a reasonable 36 times trailing-12-month earnings considering the company's growth profile. Management forecasted Q1 2021 revenue to increase at least 23% year over year, and for operating profit to increase a similar amount. Revenue and earnings should continue to rise throughout the year as TSM churns out parts to keep up with its customers' demand. And as for the dividend, TSM is committed to at least holding its quarterly payout steady and increasing it over time as its capacity increases. Currently, shares yield 1.4% a year.
If you're looking to bet on manufacturing, it's hard to go wrong with Taiwan Semiconductor. It's the global leader providing tech's basic building blocks, and isn't going to be unseated from that leadership position anytime soon. And with its manufacturing lines running at max capacity this year and the company investing heavily to grow the next few years, now looks like a timely opportunity to make a purchase for the long haul.

2021-04-03 00:00:00+00:00,Micron Stock Is a Buy as the Global Chip Shortage Continues,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-stock-is-a-buy-as-the-global-chip-shortage-continues-2021-04-03,,,"With a global chip shortage expected to last all year, Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is riding high right now. The company reported during its fiscal 2021 second-quarter update (the three months ended March 4, 2021) that it's operating near full capacity to keep up with its customers' needs as effects from the pandemic and surging demand for electronic devices has sales back in strong growth mode. Sooner or later, supply will catch up and this upcycle for Micron and other semiconductor manufacturers will moderate. But for now, Micron is a great buy as it closes back in on record revenue.
How did this chip shortage happen?
In recent months, production of everything from smartphones to automobiles has been throttled by a global shortage of semiconductors -- the building blocks of all things electronic. These basic commodities for tech are a cyclical affair. Years of booming sales and high prices can be followed by lean periods when demand falls. Such a downturn started back in 2018 after Micron reported new all-time highs for sales and profits.
Data by YCharts.
These cycles are normal for manufacturing, but the downturn was exacerbated by the U.S.-China trade war. Global supply chains had to be rerouted to account for tariffs and embargoes on sales to certain companies. Then COVID-19 struck, temporarily shuttering chip foundries. And chip companies' customers (like automakers, for example) slowed their purchasing of new hardware and worked down existing inventory during 2020 to manage their cash flow.

Demand for electronic devices, autos, and industrial equipment came roaring back, but all the aforementioned effects added up to a global shortfall in supply. For a company like Micron, there could be worse situations. Operating at or near max capacity means greater efficiency, and it appears the global shortage will keep sales pushing higher for the rest of the year. And new technologies like artificial intelligence systems in data centers, the rollout of 5G mobile networks, and more powerful consumer devices mean this uptrend could have legs for a while. Micron had a great Q2, and forecasts Q3 fiscal 2021 revenue and adjusted earnings per share will increase another respective 31% and 98% from a year ago to $7.1 billion and $1.62 per share.

Offloading a drag on the bottom line
Micron has done a lot of work to tighten up operations and get more efficient, and it's paid off. The chipmaker remained profitable (granted, just barely) throughout the last downturn. But there's always room for improvement. Micron bought out Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) 49% stake in the 3D XPoint (a new type of architecture for memory chips) joint venture between the two companies back in 2019 for $1.5 billion. However, as Micron explained on a call prior to the Q2 report, 3D XPoint hasn't really taken off and industry needs are moving in a different direction. Underutilization at the Lehi, Utah, plant that makes 3D XPoint memory has been a $400 million-a-year drag on Micron's operating profits.
The decision was thus made to abandon 3D XPoint and sell the Lehi operation. Given the global shortage in chip supply, there's a good chance someone out there can repurpose the fab for other uses. Micron said on the Q2 call it's in talks with potential buyers and expects a sale by the end of calendar year 2021. This should help Micron recoup some losses from its purchase -- not to mention further boost the bottom line as those underutilization charges go away.
Given expected top- and bottom-line growth and Micron's continuous work to optimize its memory chip fabrication, shares look like a reasonable deal at 25 times trailing 12-month adjusted earnings per share. Bear in mind this current upcycle will eventually moderate and give way to another downcycle, but for now that's not on the horizon. I remain a buyer of Micron right now.

2021-04-02 00:00:00+00:00,The 7 Best Blue-Chip Stocks in the Dow Jones,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-7-best-blue-chip-stocks-in-the-dow-jones-2021-04-02,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Blue-chip stocks are typically cornerstones of most long-term portfolios. They’re large capitalization businesses with relatively long histories, a broad range of resources, strong brands, stable earnings and cash-flow growth. These businesses benefit from economies of scale and can quickly invest in new technologies. The 30 stocks included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are blue-chip stocks. So, today I’m introducing you to seven DJIA blue-chip names that could work for buy-and-hold investors.
The companies in the DJIA represent a wide range of industries. Following the market lows seen in spring 2020, they have also rebounded significantly. In fact, the broad-based market rally since November has taken the index to new highs in recent days. Year-to-date (YTD), the index is up over 8%. Similarly, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:DIA) — an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the returns of the DJIA — has also returned over 8%.
April means the start of a new earnings season, which typically brings increased volatility to broader markets. Are you worried that further choppiness may put pressure on many stocks that have gone up double digits in the past 52 weeks? Then it may be time to look for solid blue-chip stocks that could brave possible further headwinds in second quarter.

7 Cheap Stocks with Growing Tailwinds
With that background in mind, here are seven of the best blue-chip stocks in the Dow Jones. I believe these names have strong business models, clean balance sheets, proactive management and strong competitive positions. They should create shareholder value for many quarters to come:
American Express (NYSE:AXP)
Intel  (NASDAQ:INTC)
Merck (NYSE:MRK)
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG)
Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)
Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ)
Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: American Express (AXP)

52-week range: $72.61 – $151.46
One-year change: Up about 86%
Dividend yield: 1.19%
First up on this list of blue-chip stocks, American Express offers charge and credit payment card products as well as travel-related services across the globe. With significant exposure to the travel and leisure sectors, though, sales have been negatively affected over the past year.
The company released Q4 and full-year metrics back in late January. Revenue for the quarter was $9.35 billion, down 18% year-over-year (YOY). That also showed little improvement from Q3. Net income also came to $1.43 billion, meaning a decline of 15%. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $1.76, a decrease of 13%. However, EPS is expected to be between $5 and $7 in 2021. That would mean a partial recovery from the Covid-19-related decline seen in 2020. CEO Stephen Squeri noted:
“While we remain cautious about the pace of recovery, we are focused on achieving our aspiration of being back to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 in 2022, and for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm.”
Currently, AXP stock’s forward price-earnings (P/E) and price-sales (P/S) ratios are 22.4 and 2.93, respectively. With expected increases in travel spending in the coming months, the company’s revenues will possibly improve during the year. However, given the upcoming earnings release in late April, shares could be volatile. A potential decline toward the $135-level would offer better value.
Intel (INTC)

52-week range: $43.61 – $67.44
One-year change: Up about 24%
Dividend yield: 2.15%
Intel is one of the largest chipmakers in the world. Its products range from personal computing to data-center applications and it delivers computer, networking, data storage and communications platforms. In fact, Intel is one of the most important providers of central processing units (CPUs) for laptops, desktops and servers. 
What’s more, recently Intel has been in focus, thanks to an increase in the share price following the announcement that Pat Gelsinger would be the new CEO. Over the past several years, the performance of INTC stock has lagged behind the semiconductor sector. Now, though, the company is taking steps to enter the foundry business. The Street seems to approve of these plans.
In late January, Intel announced Q4 and full-year metrics. Quarterly revenue was $20 billion, down just 1% YOY. Non-GAAP net income was $6.2 billion, down 6% YOY. Furthermore, EPS was flat at $1.52 on a non-GAAP basis. In 2020, the group also generated a record $35.4 billion cash from operations and $21.1 billion of free cash flow during the quarter. Bob Swan, Intel’s CEO at the time, noted:
“We significantly exceeded our expectations for the quarter, capping off our fifth consecutive record year […] Demand for the computing performance Intel delivers remains very strong and our focus on growth opportunities is paying off […] Intel is in a strong strategic and financial position as we make this leadership transition and take Intel to the next level.”

The 8 Biggest Growth Stocks of the First Quarter
This pick of the blue-chip stocks has forward P/E and P/S ratios of 14.01 and 3.60, respectively. I believe the chipmaker deserves to be on your radar screen. However, a potential decline closer to $60 would improve the margin of safety.
Merck (MRK)

52-week range: $71.72 – $87.80
One-year change: Up about 4.5%
Dividend yield: 3.37%
Next up on this list of blue-chip stocks, pharma giant Merck develops leading treatments against cancer and infectious diseases. The company’s research and products also extend to animal health. Keytruda, an antibody used in cancer immunotherapy, is one of the leading sources of revenue for the company.
In early February, Merck released Q4 and full-year results. Worldwide sales during the quarter were $12.5 billion, up 5% YOY. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.32 for the quarter. Further, worldwide revenue for the fiscal year rose 2% YOY to $48 billion, while full-year non-GAAP EPS was $5.94. Management expects full-year 2021 sales between $51.8 billion and $53.8 billion as well as non-GAAP EPS between $6.48 and $6.68. On the results, CEO Kenneth Frazier commented:
“Our scientists continue to advance our internal pipeline of promising medicines and vaccines, including in oncology, HIV, and pneumococcal disease, and, more recently, therapeutics for COVID-19. These pipeline developments provide us with increasing line-of-sight to significant potential growth drivers later this decade and into the next.”
Merck’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 11.84 and 3.74, respectively. This name is well-known as a reliable dividend company that also buys back shares. So, any decline in MRK stock during the upcoming earnings season would make it a strong candidate for dividend growth and passive income portfolios.

Tech darling Microsoft needs little introduction on this list of blue-chip stocks. The firm is best known for its Windows operating systems and Office productivity suite. Recent years have seen operations also extend to its cloud-based Microsoft Azure, which now competes with Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS). Generally over the past year, MSFT shares have benefited greatly from the digitalization trend.
Microsoft announced Q2 2021 results at the end of January. Revenue was up by 17% YOY and came at $43.1 billion. The biggest revenue driver was the company’s Intelligent Cloud segment, with a 23% YOY increase. Additionally, net income increased 33% and reached $15.5 billion. Diluted EPS also jumped by 34% to $2.03. Finally, total cash and equivalents at the end of period stood at $132 billion. Amy Hood, CFO of Microsoft, commented on the earnings call:
“[F]or FY21, with our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year and our outlook for Q3, we expect to deliver another full year of double-digit revenue and operating income growth, as well as healthy operating margin expansion even after excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and COVID-related savings.”
Management expects as much as $13.6 billion in revenue from the Productivity and Business processes segment in Q3. For the Intelligent Cloud segment, top line is estimated to be between $14.7 billion and $14.95 billion. Finally, the Personal Computing segment is anticipated to see $12.3 billion to $12.7 billion in revenue.

7 Oil Stocks Being Squeezed by Weak Demand 
Right now, shares of MSFT stock are trading at a forward P/E of 32.88 and P/S of 11.16. Moving forward, analysts expect the company to become a leading name in artificial intelligence (AI) as well the Internet of Things (IoT). However, a potential decline toward $225 would improve the risk-return profile here.
Procter & Gamble (PG)

Procter & Gamble is one of the most important consumer goods manufacturers worldwide. Billions of global citizens use its brands, including Ariel, Crest, Dawn, Gillette, Pampers, Tide and more. Altogether, the company has a strong market share both stateside and globally. Plus, the pandemic has meant increased sales for many of its household products. 
Over the past several years, PG’s management has focused on making the company a leaner organization, narrowing its offering to approximately 70 to 80 brands. As a result, organic growth has been stable. These restructuring efforts have also led to significant cost-cutting.
Like other blue-chip stocks on this list, this company announced fiscal year 2021 Q2 results in late January. Net sales of $19.7 billion meant an increase of 8% YOY. Net earnings were $3.8 billion, up 4% YOY. Diluted net EPS was $1.47, also up 4%. Finally, free cash flow as of Dec. 31, 2020 was roughly $4.9 billion. Altogether, PG came out of 2020 with strong financials. President and CEO David Taylor noted:
“We remain focused on executing our strategies of superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and improving P&G’s organization and culture. These strategies enabled us to build strong business momentum before the COVID crisis, accelerated our progress in calendar year 2020 and remain the right strategies to deliver balanced growth and value creation over the long term.” 
However, PG stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios of 23.60 and 4.38 point to an overstretched valuation level. So, interested investors might want to wait for the next quarterly results and a potential pullback toward $125. With a wide moat and dividend-aristocrat status, though, PG stock should appeal to a range of passive income seekers.
Salesforce (CRM)

52-week range: $131.66 – $284.50
One-year change: Up about 63%
Dividend yield: N/A
Our next pick of the blue-chip stocks, Salesforce was added to the DJIA back in August 2020. This group provides customer relationship management (CRM) enterprise products. Its well-known platform includes marketing and sales automation, customer service, digital commerce, analytics and collaborative productivity tools. What’s more, the company has been increasingly focused on cloud-based offerings. 
Salesforce announced Q4 and full-year results back in February. Quarterly revenue was $5.82 billion, up 20% YOY. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.04. Cash from operations for the quarter was also up 33%, at $2.17 billion. Total cash and equivalents came at $11.97 billion.
Furthermore, management raised its first-quarter fiscal 2022 revenue guidance to between roughly $5.88 billion and $5.89 billion, which would be growth of about 21%. On the results, CEO Marc Benioff noted: “We had a record quarter and year by innovating more and faster than ever, enabling our customers to be successful from anywhere, and becoming more relevant and strategic than ever.” 

8 Small-Cap Stocks With Plenty of Cred
CRM stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 63.58 and 7.82, respectively, pointing to an overextended valuation. Investors have recently started to rotate away from technology stocks. Therefore, a potential decline below $200 is possible in the coming weeks. Personally, CRM is on my strong wish list in Q2. As one of the largest software-as-a-service (SAAS) businesses, it has a bright future for the next decade.
Verizon (VZ)

52-week range: $52.85- $61.95
One-year change: Up about 10%
Dividend yield: 4.31%
Our last entry on this list of blue-chip stocks, Verizon is an important telecommunications group for the ongoing digitalization trend in the United States. It provides provides products and services in tech, communications, information and entertainment. It is also becoming a significant player in 5G. With its voice, data and video services, the company generated revenues of $128.3 billion in 2020.
Verizon announced Q4 and full-year results in late January. Quarterly revenue was $34.7 billion, down fractionally YOY. Net income was $4.7 billion, which was down 9.6%. Adjusted EPS was $1.21, too. Finally, the company ended 2020 with free cash flow of $23.6 billion, an increase of about 32% YOY. CEO Hans Vestberg commented:
“[Verizon] witnessed a mass shift toward virtual collaboration, touchless retail and delivery, remote work, distance learning, and telemedicine […] We continued to execute our multi-use network strategy; we were recognized by RootMetrics as the best overall wireless provider, undefeated in all categories; and we continue to be the partner of choice for the world’s most innovative brands. Today, we are excited to lead technological advances beyond mobile devices, and create new opportunities for growth across multiple industries.”
VZ stock currently has forward P/E and P/S ratios of 11.49 and 1.81, respectively. All in all, 2020 became the year when consumers needed faster networks. Verizon succeeded in offering that. As a result, it has a dependable stream of revenue and cash — both crucial qualities in a dividend player.

2021-04-02 00:00:00+00:00,Why It's Too Early to Give Up on AMD,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-its-too-early-to-give-up-on-amd-2021-04-02,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock now faces something it has not seen in years: a considerable decline. Recent moves by NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have caused uncertainty among stock investors, taking AMD into bear-market territory. Still, amid counterpunches from key peers, the drop in AMD may have given investors in this chip stock the best buying opportunity in years.
AMD's rivals counterpunch
AMD has spent years riding high under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su. Su took a near-bankrupt company and made it competitive against NVIDIA in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. AMD's GPU market share rose as high as 19% in 2020, according to Jon Peddie Research.
Su also capitalized on turmoil at Intel and took a technical lead in central processing units (CPUs). AMD continues to market 7nm processors as Intel continues to delay the release of a comparable chip.
However, in recent weeks, AMD stock has fallen as its rivals counterpunched. Intel appointed Patrick Gelsinger as CEO. He previously served as Intel's chief technology officer and helped design the original 80486 processor. With that experience, he brings an engineer's mindset to the CEO job, seeking to revive the company's foundries and reclaim the lead Intel held over AMD for decades.

Intel already generates about eight times as much revenue as AMD. Considering this move, Intel's current P/E ratio of 13 looks appealing compared with AMD, which trades at 37 times earnings.
AMD still looks cheap compared with NVIDIA's multiple above 75. Still, NVIDIA has acquired Mellanox to boost its competitive advantage in the data center space. GPU-powered data centers can deliver improved performance for both computational and graphics workloads. Hence, this could potentially become a lucrative niche for NVIDIA.
Moreover, NVIDIA made competitive strides against AMD late in the year. AMD's market share for GPUs now stands at 17%, down from 19% last summer. Additionally, NVIDIA retained its contract with Nintendo to provide the processor for the Switch game console. Though Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox run on AMD processors, NVIDIA will still retain some of the game console market.
Consequently, investors have soured on AMD's stock. Not only has its P/E ratio reached multiyear lows, but the stock price has also lost just over 15% of its value since it hit an all-time high in January. While a 5% decline in the Nasdaq explains part of that drop, the counterattacks have also taken a toll.
AMD data by YCharts
But AMD is far from down and hardly out
However, investors should not assume that AMD does not pack counterpunches of its own. It retains a close relationship with its chip producer, Taiwan Semiconductor, which maintains a technical lead over Intel's foundries. Thus, as Intel finally releases a 7nm chip, AMD could introduce a 5nm alternative in the near future.
AMD also plans to continue challenging both Intel and NVIDIA in the data center market. On March 15, Su unveiled the EPYC 7003 series of processors, which the company calls the ""world's highest-performing server processor.""
AMD claims its EPYC chips beat Intel's server processors on numerous performance metrics such as database and high-performance computing. Admittedly, those numbers come from AMD instead of an independent third party.
As of the fourth quarter of 2020, AMD holds only 7% of the market, according to Mercury Research. Still, AMD made huge strides in one year, considering the 4.5% of the market it claimed in Q4 2019. This latest release could lead to it taking further market share from Intel.
In the game console market, AMD also sits in a comfortable position. Both Microsoft and Sony released their latest generation of game consoles late last year. Demand has reached such high levels that consoles are out of stock. Hence, this should remain a lucrative book of business for AMD as Sony and Microsoft work to supply the market.
Furthermore, AMD's aforementioned 37 P/E ratio is its lowest multiple in nearly 10 years. Moreover, the company more than doubled its profits in 2020, yet the valuation has fallen to its lowest level since Su returned the company to profitability.
While AMD did not issue a forecast for net income for 2021, the predicted revenue growth of 37% comes in only slightly below the 2020 revenue growth rate of 45%. Additionally, since Intel continues to produce single-digit growth numbers, AMD stock could retain its appeal to investors despite Intel's P/E ratio of 13.
The state of AMD stock
Given the market share gains that have driven AMD, investors could not realistically expect Intel and NVIDIA not to fight back. Nonetheless, while these competitive strides rightly serve as a wake-up call to AMD investors, the sell-off in AMD stock appears overdone.
AMD still appears competitive in the GPU field and in gaming, and Intel has not yet threatened AMD's lead in the CPU market. With a multiple under 40 and AMD preparing to log an additional revenue gain of 37% in 2021, investors should consider buying the dip in AMD stock rather than treating the price drop as a reason to run.

Lack of chip supply has throttled the production of everything from smartphones to cars and trucks. With demand high and fabrication plants scrambling to catch up, this is a good time to be in the chip-manufacturing business.
5 top semiconductor fab stocks
Top names in the semiconductor fabrication industry include Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Samsung, and privately owned GlobalFoundries. But some other lesser-known names in chip manufacturing could be timely additions to your investment portfolio given the current constraints on supply. Here's a list of the top chip fab stocks.

Let's find out a bit more about each of these semiconductor fabricators.
1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Though it may not be the household name that Intel is, Taiwan Semiconductor is actually far and away the world's largest semiconductor company as measured by market capitalization. And as far as revenue goes, this foundry giant has taken the crown away from Intel in chip fabrication in recent years. (However, Intel also makes money on engineering and design.) TSM currently claims a 57% market share in the global chip fab industry.
Its advanced manufacturing technology has been key to its success. Its 5-nanometer chip production (the smallest, most power-efficient, and powerful computing processors around) puts it way ahead of its peers. As a result, nearly all fabless semiconductor companies around the globe have turned to TSMC as a trusted production partner. Even Intel has, as it has struggled with the rollout of some of its new manufacturing lines. From chips that power 5G mobile networks to those that underpin artificial intelligence systems, TSMC can handle the production job.
The company just announced that it plans to spend $100 billion over the next three years to increase its production capacity. This is because the company hasn’t been able to keep up with demand over the past year despite running its fabrication plants at over 100% utilization.
TSMC continues to pay a dividend that currently yields 1.5% a year. If there's a profit to be turned from chip manufacturing operating at max capacity for the foreseeable future, investors in TSMC can be sure they'll reap some of it.

2. Texas Instruments
Texas Instruments designs and manufactures chips used in a wide variety of applications, from advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) in cars to microcontrollers for the aerospace and defense industries. It isn't the fastest-growing company in its sector. But TI is a critical supplier in the global economy and has been expanding at a steady pace for decades as electronic components grow increasingly important in all sorts of devices.
The semiconductor industry can be highly cyclical. Years featuring surging unmet demand (like 2021) can be followed by lean ones as supply ramps up to meet global needs and then exceeds them. But TI has been a consistent winner throughout these cycles by efficiently allocating resources to improve its manufacturing processes. The company averaged 12% growth in free cash flow annually from 2004 to 2020, and it has increased its dividend payout every year along the way. In fact, shares currently yield 2.2% a year right now, making this one of the best chip stocks there is for investors seeking both steady growth and reliable income.
3. Micron Technology
Unlike the previous two chip fabs mentioned, which produce a diverse array of chip types, Micron is laser-focused on digital memory. Memory chips are a tech staple, showing up everywhere -- in more complex semiconductor designs, in data centers, and as stand-alone parts in consumer electronics. Historically, their prices have been prone to wild swings due to fluctuations in supply and demand. But digital memory is more important than ever before, and Micron weathered the last downturn (which culminated in 2020), emerged even stronger than it was before, and is returning to rapid profitable growth.
That's because technologies like artificial intelligence, data centers, cloud computing services, 5G mobility and smartphones, cars with ADAS and electric powertrains, and robotic industrial equipment all require massive amounts of data. That demands places to store all that information. Micron is constantly investing in tech to shrink the size of its memory chips while simultaneously increasing the chips' storage capacity. And as it does so, its profit margins are improving. The company expects demand to stay high in 2021 and beyond as more applications require its memory components to function.
4. Analog Devices
Analog Devices is another well-diversified designer and manufacturer of chips, similar to Texas Instruments. The company makes everything from processors to network connectivity chips to silicon designed for more specific applications like LiDAR or 5G mobility. Its top end-markets include industrials, communications, and the automotive industry.
Analog Devices is also driving important technological trends. Its chips are lowering power consumption in industrial equipment and manufacturing industries, wireless connectivity, and battery-powered vehicles and energy storage. It's highly profitable too. It has plenty of cash (free cash flow profit margin was an impressive 33% in Q1) to invest in new designs and improve its fab processes. Its dividend currently yields 1.8%, and business is growing fast during the current global chip shortage.
5. NXP Semiconductor
Rounding out the top five is NXP Semiconductor, a leader in the design and manufacture of connectivity chips and processors for autos, smartphones, and industrial equipment. Last year was a bad one for automakers, but even with car and truck sales down sharply during the earlier phases of the pandemic, 40% of NXP's revenue was derived from that industry. Besides connectivity, it also has a hand in vehicles' ADAS hardware, infotainment systems, and electric drivetrain technology.
This makes NXP a top buy for investors looking to bet on a rebound in the auto industry -- not to mention the development of autonomous and electric vehicles. Adverse weather temporarily shuttered some of NXP's plants in Texas early this year, but the company is rapidly recovering from the effects of the pandemic and ramping up production. Profitability is recovering as well as a result. NXP was recently added to the S&P 500 index, reinforcing this chip company's growing prospects as a top fab of electronic components.
A word of caution
Chip fabrication companies stand to make a lot of money during the global chip shortage. High demand means high pricing on hardware sold -- and record profitability to boot. But the semiconductor business is a cyclical affair. Eventually, supply will catch up with demand and sales and profits will moderate. This can be expected to lead to some wild swings in stock prices.
Nevertheless, the chip shortage underscores the importance of these basic building blocks of tech. If you invest, avoid building too large a position out of a fear of missing out, and instead stay focused on the long term (at least a few years, but the longer the better). Semiconductors are enjoying a secular growth trend that has lasted for decades now, and that trend is poised to continue in the decade ahead.

It's hard to see 10 years into the future, and the unexpected can always leap up to disrupt a sound narrative.
However, there are steps we can take to identify companies with stellar growth opportunities and sustainable competitive advantages. Some mega-trends are relatively easy to predict, and the best companies enabling those trends are likely to outperform the market over the long term. With a 10-year time horizon, we don't have to take as much care to limit volatility or nitpick valuation ratios. A decade from now, the winners will have ridden out economic cycles and grown enough to justify all but the most aggressive valuations today.
These two stocks have established businesses, exposure to major tech trends, and reputable products in growth categories. They're great building blocks for your investment portfolio.

NVIDIA
NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) rose to prominence as a leader in the design and production of graphics processing units (GPU) for computers. The company's products have evolved to become important components in data centers, cryptocurrency mining hardware, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. This aligns NVDIA's fortunes directly with some of the disruptive technology trends that are expected to define the next decade. As blockchain, AI, security, remote connectivity, and video gaming become more prominent, demand for NVIDIA's industry-leading products will also grow.
The company is also in advanced discussions to acquire a licensed chip design company called Arm, which would expand NVIDIA's operations into a new growth avenue. That'd be especially true if moves from Apple and others to manufacture chips internally boost demand for chip design services.
The story has a fair share of risks. The semiconductor industry is notoriously cyclical, as demand and pricing can fluctuate drastically based on the product replacement cycle, rather than global macroeconomic conditions. Plus, a serious decline in highly volatile cryptocurrency prices could also see a steep drop in demand for the chips used in mining. NVIDIA trades at more than 38 times forward earnings, nearly 19 times price to book, and has an enterprise-value-to-EBITDA ratio above 55. If bad news creeps in, share prices could crater quickly.
Still, NVIDIA is growing rapidly, and its products have an excellent reputation. The company is deeply connected to all of the most exciting technology trends of the next decade, and there's an enormous opportunity ahead for shareholders. It's good to hold today, and it could be much larger in the future.
Microsoft
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is famous for its Windows operating system and the Office software suite, but it is also one of the major players in cloud services. The company also owns the networking and employment social media platform LinkedIn, has a large video game business, and sells the popular Surface brand of touchscreen computers.
Microsoft has a rare combination of favorable characteristics. The company enjoys stability through enormous scale and product diversity, but it is also delivering exceptional growth -- that's not common. For the first six months of fiscal 2021, total sales increased nearly 15% over the prior year. The company's Azure server products and cloud services grew 50% year over year in the most recent quarter. That segment has expanded to exceed the revenue produced by Microsoft's flagship personal computing products. Almost every business is tech-enabled now, and the inevitable growth of software as a service (SaaS), cybersecurity, and remote collaboration is a catalyst for cloud service providers.
Microsoft is in direct competition with fearsome heavy-hitters including Amazon, Alphabet, and Apple. That's certainly a risk. That said, Azure is second only to AWS in the cloud market, with 20% share. Encouragingly, it has actually gained market share over the past year. Microsoft will grow by merely maintaining share in the next decade, as cloud services are expected to expand nearly 20% annually.
At a forward P/E ratio of only 28.7, there's too much upside potential here relative to the risks associated with competition. Microsoft has the established business to make it a relatively safe stock, and it also provides growth potential to outpace the market.

2021-04-01 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) vs. Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-advanced-micro-devices-amd-vs.-intel-2021-04-01,,,"Intel and AMD, which hold a near-duopoly in x86 CPUs for PCs and servers, have treated investors very differently over the past three years.
During that time, Intel's stock price rose nearly 25% but underperformed the Nasdaq's 85% gain. Its manufacturing issues, chip shortages, market share losses, and the abrupt resignation of its CEO in 2018 all weighed down its stock.
Meanwhile, AMD's stock price surged nearly 670% as it profited from Intel's missteps. It produced smaller and more cost-efficient chips than Intel, didn't suffer any chip shortages, held its ground against NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) in gaming GPUs, and stuck to its long-term roadmap under its visionary CEO.
However, past performance never guarantees future gains, so we should take a fresh look at both chipmakers to see if AMD is still the better buy.

The key differences between Intel and AMD
Intel generated 56% of its revenue from PC-centric chips last year. It generated 36% of its revenue from data center chips, while the remaining 8% came from other types of chips -- including IoT (Internet of Things) chips, programmable chips, computer vision chips, and memory chips.
Intel agreed to sell most of its memory chip business to SK Hynix last October, and it's developing discrete GPUs to complement its CPUs and compete against NVIDIA and AMD. However, Intel's core business still mainly relies on its sales of x86 CPUs for PCs and data centers.
Intel manufactures its own chips with its internal foundry. But Intel's foundry fell behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the world's largest third-party foundry, in the ""process race"" to create smaller chips in recent years. Those mistakes clogged up Intel's foundries and caused shortages of its latest CPUs.
AMD, which outsources the production of its CPUs and GPUs to TSMC instead of manufacturing them internally, didn't struggle with any shortages. As a result, AMD's share of the global x86 CPU market more than doubled from 18.1% to 39.4% between the first quarters of 2017 and 2021, according to PassMark Software, as Intel's market share plunged from 81.9% to 60.5%.
Last year, AMD generated nearly two-thirds of its revenue from its computing and graphics segment, which sells its Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs. The rest of its revenue came from its EESC (enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom) business, which mainly sells custom chips for gaming consoles (including Sony's PS5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series consoles) and Epyc CPUs for data centers.
Which chipmaker is growing faster?
Based on these facts, it's easy to see why AMD grew at a faster clip than Intel over the past three years.

Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)
13%
2%
8%
AMD (NASDAQ: AMD)
23%

Data source: Annual reports. YOY = year over year.
AMD's growth decelerated in 2019, mainly due to slower sales of gaming consoles. However, its growth accelerated again in 2020 as it launched its new Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs, while Intel's ongoing chip shortage continued to generate tailwinds for both its PC and data center businesses.
Intel's overall revenue growth initially seems stable, but its data center chip sales declined year over year in the second half of 2020 -- which partly offset its higher sales of PC CPUs during the pandemic.
Intel recently outsourced the production of some of its chips to TSMC to resolve its ongoing shortages, but it doesn't expect to launch its next-gen 7nm chips until 2023. AMD launched its first 7nm CPUs back in 2019, and it will likely launch its first 5nm chips in 2022.
Profitability and valuations
After Intel's former CEO Brian Krzanich resigned in 2018, CFO Bob Swan took the helm and mainly focused on cutting costs and repurchasing shares instead of resolving Intel's R&D problems.
Meanwhile, AMD continued to generate explosive earnings growth without relying on buybacks or cost-cutting measures. Instead, it reinvested most of its cash back into the development of its new chips.

Intel's new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, is trying to get the chipmaker back on the right track, but that process could take years.
AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, has led the chipmaker's ongoing turnaround since 2014. Su's main strategies, which include the expansion of AMD's gaming console business and the development of new chips that address the performance issues of prior generations, will continue to cause headaches for Intel.
Analysts expect Intel's revenue and earnings to decline 7% and 13%, respectively, this year. Those dismal growth rates indicate Intel's stock still can't be considered cheap at 14 times forward earnings.
Wall Street expects AMD's revenue and earnings to jump 38% and 53%, respectively, this year. Those growth rates easily justify its higher forward P/E ratio of 31. We should always be skeptical of analysts' forecasts, but AMD clearly looks like a much healthier investment than Intel.
The winner: AMD
Intel's low valuation and forward dividend yield of 2.1% might limit its downside potential, but I believe it will underperform AMD again this year. Intel isn't doomed yet, but Gelsinger must resolve the company's biggest problems before I consider this classic chipmaker to be a worthy long-term investment again.

2021-04-01 00:00:00+00:00,"Global chip supply chain increasingly vulnerable to massive disruption, study finds",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/global-chip-supply-chain-increasingly-vulnerable-to-massive-disruption-study-finds-2021-04,,,"By Stephen Nellis
April 1 (Reuters) - A new study from a U.S. industry group found that the global semiconductor supply chain has become increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters and geopolitical disruptions because suppliers have become more concentrated in distinct regions.
The report comes amid a global chip shortage that started with overbooked factories in Taiwan late last year, but has since been exacerbated by a fire at a plant in Japan, a freeze that knocked out electricity in the U.S. state of Texas and a worsening drought in Taiwan this year. The shortage has idled some production lines at automobile factories in the United States, Europe and Asia.
Modern chipmaking involves more than a thousand steps and requires complex intellectual property, tools and chemicals from around the world. But the Semiconductor Industry Association, representing most U.S. chipmakers, on Thursday said it found more than 50 places in the supply chain where a single region has more than 65% market share.
Intellectual property and software to design cutting-edge chips, for example, is dominated by the United States, while special gases key to fabricating chips come from Europe. And the manufacturing of the most advanced chips is completely located in Asia - 92% of it in Taiwan.
If Taiwan were unable to make chips for a year, it would cost the global electronics industry almost half a trillion dollars in revenue, the report found: ""The global electronics supply chain would come to a halt.""
Still, the study warned, a go-it-alone approach in which governments try to replicate the supply chain domestically is infeasible because it would cost $1.2 trillion globally - with up to $450 billion of that cost in United States alone - causing the price of chips to skyrocket.
In some cases, though, it called for incentives to create ""minimum viable capacity"" in regions that lack any part of the supply chain.
In the case of the United States and Europe, that would mean new advanced chip factories to balance concentration in Taiwan and South Korea.
""We don't have enough semiconductor manufacturing in the United States ... And it's got to be fixed with the assistance of the U.S. government,"" John Neuffer, chief executive officer of the association, told Reuters.

2021-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,EXPLAINER-Why is there a global chip shortage and why should you care?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/explainer-why-is-there-a-global-chip-shortage-and-why-should-you-care-2021-03-31,,,"March 31 (Reuters) - From delayed car deliveries to a supply shortfall in home appliances to costlier smartphones, businesses and consumers across the globe are facing the brunt of an unprecedented shortage in semiconductor microchips.
The shortage stems from a confluence of factors as carmakers, which shut plants during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, compete against the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies.
Consumers have stocked up on laptops, gaming consoles and other electronic products during the pandemic, leading to tighter inventory. They also bought more cars than industry officials expected last spring, further straining supplies.
Sanctions against Chinese tech companies have further exacerbated the crisis. Originally concentrated in the auto industry, the shortage has now spread to a range of other consumer electronics, including smartphones, refrigerators and microwaves.
With every company that uses chips in production panic buying to shore up stocks, the shortage has squeezed capacity and driven up costs of even the cheapest components of nearly all microchips, increasing prices of final products.
  CARS
Automobiles have become increasingly dependent on chips - for everything from computer management of engines for better fuel economy to driver-assistance features such as emergency breaking.
The crisis has forced many to curtail the production of less profitable vehicles. General Motors Co <GM.N > and Ford Motor Co F.N are among the big carmakers who said they would scale down production, joining other automakers including Volkswagen AG, Subaru Corp, Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co.
A shortage of auto semiconductor chips could impact nearly 1.3 million units of global light vehicle production in the first quarter, according to data firm IHS Markit.
IHS said a fire at a Japanese chip-making factory owned by Renesas Electronics Corp 6723.T, which accounts for 30% of the global market for microcontroller units used in cars, has worsened the situation.
Severe winter weather in Texas has also forced Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS, NXP Semiconductors and Infineon to shut down factories temporarily. Infineon and NXP are major automotive chip suppliers, and analysts expect the disruptions to add to the shortfalls in the ailing sector.
ASIAN SQUEEZE
At the root of the squeeze is the under-investment in 8-inch chip manufacturing plants owned mostly by Asian firms, which means they have struggled to ramp up production as demand for 5G phones and laptops picked up faster than expected.
Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, whose chips feature in Samsung phones, is one major chipmaker struggling to keep up with demand. Apple Inc's AAPL.O major supplier Foxconn also warned of the chip shortage affecting supply chains to clients.
The majority of chip production occurs in Asia currently, where major contract manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW and Samsung handle production for hundreds of different chip companies.
U.S. semiconductor companies account for 47% of global chip sales, but only 12% of global manufacturing is done in the United States.
WHAT'S BEING DONE ABOUT IT?
Factories that produce wafers cost tens of billions of dollars to build, and expanding their capacity can take up to a year for testing and qualifying complex tools.
U.S. President Joe Biden has sought $37 billion in funding for legislation to supercharge chip manufacturing in the country.
Currently, four new factories are slated in the country, two by Intel Corp INTC.O and one by TSMC in Arizona, and another by Samsung in Texas.
China has also offered a myriad of subsidies to the chip industry as it tries to reduce its dependence on Western technology.

Severe winter weather in Texas has also forced Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS, NXP Semiconductors and Infineon to shut down factories temporarily.",2021,3
2021-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,7 5G Stocks Keeping an Eye on Huawei,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-5g-stocks-keeping-an-eye-on-huawei-2021-03-31,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
After the presidential election, the U.S. and China trade war conflicts appear to have moderated. On the surface, the lower tensions could mean increased trade between the two superpowers. Conversely, opening trade talks again will benefit some sectors while hurting others. In the technology space, such as emerging 5G technology, the U.S. will want to step up protection for its highly valued intellectual property. If it does not do so, it could lose further ground against China.
In the race to dominate the telecoms networking market, the U.S. is racing to upgrade from 4G to 5G. So, it would benefit from the continued ban of Huawei equipment in U.S. infrastructure. That would give American firms chances to win supply deals with Verizon (NYSE:VZ) or AT&T (NYSE:T).
7 Oil Stocks Being Squeezed by Weak Demand
There are seven 5G stocks keeping an eye on Huawei. The companies are:
Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT)
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)
Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Nokia (NYSE:NOK)
NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI)
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)
Almost all of the stocks score well on quality and growth:

The 5G rollout will drive the demand for base stations and repeaters. 5G offers higher frequency signals, increasing bandwidth to 10 Gbps (gigabits per second) and data rates that are 10 times greater compared to 4G.
In the first quarter, the company highlighted the broader adoption of 5G handsets leading to silicon content in smartphones growing at double-digit rates. Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said that the smartphone market is increasing demand for OLED screens. So, AMAT stock benefits from the increasing demand for OLED in devices, TVs, and IT applications.
Back in 2019, AMAT acquired Kokusai Electric for $2.2 billion. The company anticipated the race for more advanced processor demand from artificial intelligence and 5G technology.
According to simplywall.st, Applied stock has a fair value of around $106. Even though the value, based on its future cash flow, is close to the stock price, the semiconductor company is a compelling holding. It is diversified in the memory, AI, and 5G space and offers consistently strong quarterly growth. In Q1/2021, AMAT posted a 24% revenue growth from last year to $5.16 billion. It earned $1.22 a share, up 27% year-over-year.
Cisco Systems (CSCO)

Cisco would benefit from Huawei losing market share in the 5G market. Jonathan Davidson, a senior vice president, and general manager of Cisco’s Mass-Scale Infrastructure Group, highlighted its 5G offering to T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). The executive said it helped T-Mobile in its transition to a 5G standalone network.
Davidson said that customers perform upgrades once or twice a week on its cloud-native technology. Before that, appliance upgrades happened every six to 18 months. Cisco was slow to embrace the disaggregated infrastructure before. Now, it is finding opportunities to offer updates for their IP transport networks for 5G to operators.

2021-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Announces New Plan To Capture Market Share,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-announces-new-plan-to-capture-market-share-2021-03-31,,,"Intel Corporation (INTC), one of the largest chipmakers in the world, has lagged its peers over the last few years in the development of advanced transistor processors.
Intel’s rival, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), has already introduced 7nm chips to the market and plans to bring 3nm chips by 2022 through its business relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM), which is already using 5nm chips.
Intel is yet to bring 7nm chips to the market, and this delay led Apple, Inc. (AAPL) to ditch Intel as a supplier of processors for MacBook products late last year.
Pat Gelsinger, the newly appointed Intel CEO joined the company on Feb. 15 and introduced a strategic plan on March 23 to expand the manufacturing capabilities of the company to bring advanced chips to the market. This is a step in the right direction.
Details Of The New Plan
Intel is planning to invest $20 billion in 2 new manufacturing facilities in Arizona to expand its foundry services segment. Fabless chipmakers, or semiconductor companies that design and sell hardware and semiconductor chips without manufacturing the silicon wafers used in their products, outsource the fabrication process to a foundry. Intel’s new plants are trying to capture this business opportunity and according to the recent announcement, Intel will treat the foundry business as a standalone unit to avoid cannibalization.  
Separately, the company confirmed its plans to outsource some of its manufacturing needs to third-party chipmakers, which could turn out to be a catalyst for growth in the future. AMD has already seen success with this strategy.
Many Wall Street analysts have been questioning Intel’s decision to manufacture all products internally, which has proved to be inefficient in the last few years. Using a blended production strategy might help Intel bring advanced chips to the market more efficiently, which in turn, will boost revenue growth.
The Outlook Is Promising And The Valuation Is Cheap
The growth in the adoption of cloud computing services accelerated as a result of the virus-induced recession that led to secular growth in the work from home movement. This presents Intel with a good opportunity to grow its earnings.
Data centers are under pressure to improve the efficiency of their servers to cater to the strong demand for cloud computing, and this can only be achieved by using advanced chips. Intel, as one of the leading chipmakers in the world, is well-positioned to benefit from this macroeconomic development.
Intel’s strong presence in the personal computer chip market will also be a catalyst for growth. According to data from Gartner Research, worldwide PC shipments clocked in at 275 million units in 2020, growing 4.8% year-on-year. This was the highest annual growth rate seen since 2010, and the increased adoption of remote working played an important role in the growth of PC sales last year.
Many large-scale employers including Twitter, Inc. (TWTR), Snap Inc. (SNAP), and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) have introduced plans to allow remote working in the long run, which is likely to keep PC sales at an elevated level in the next couple of years. This is good news for Intel.
Despite all these positive developments, Intel continues to trade at a forward earnings multiple of 14.28 compared to the sector average of 31.62. This suggests that Intel is relatively undervalued, and the failure of the company to introduce technologically advanced processors in the last few years is the probable cause of cheap valuation metrics. However, a positive turn-around is possible if the company is able to execute its new plan effectively.
Wall Street’s Take
Analysts reacted to the latest announcement by Intel with mixed feelings. According to Barron’s, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya has cast doubt over Intel’s ability to match or exceed the manufacturing capabilities of industry leaders such as Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor.
Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis is wary of the lack of clarity regarding the upcoming products that would be released by Intel, and he remains cautious of the significant capital outlays the company will have to incur to develop the announced manufacturing plants in Arizona.
Wall Street analysts have an average analyst price target of $66.34 per share for Intel based on 14 Buy, 11 Hold and 8 Sell recommendations. This implies modest upside potential of around 4% from the current market price. (See Intel stock analysis on TipRanks)
Takeaway
Intel’s new CEO is focused on improving the efficiency of the manufacturing process. Lack of efficiency has kept the company from capturing market share in the lucrative semiconductor industry over the last few years. If executed correctly, the newly announced plan could trigger a growth phase, which should lead to an expansion in valuation multiples. Shares seem relatively undervalued, but the investment thesis for Intel is dependent on the success of this new plan.
