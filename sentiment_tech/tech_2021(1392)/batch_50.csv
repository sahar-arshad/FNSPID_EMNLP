2021-12-09 00:00:00+00:00,3 Reasons to Add Marvell Technology to Your Buy List for 2022,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-to-add-marvell-technology-to-your-buy-list-for-2022,,,"Third-quarter results from Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) are out, and they did not disappoint. The highly acquisitive chip design firm has been on a tear this year, acquiring both Inphi and Innovium to broaden its expertise in data centers.
But there's a whole lot more to Marvell's business these days that could continue to power the company higher in the years to come. Here are three reasons why the stock is worth adding to your watch list for 2022.

Data center revenue is soaring
Marvell easily surpassed its own guidance for the fiscal 2022 third quarter (the three months ended Oct. 30, 2021), posting total year-over-year sales growth of 61% to $1.21 billion. Of the total, 41% of sales came from the data center end market.

Of course, Marvell enjoyed a big boost from its recent takeover of Inphi (networking and optical connectivity equipment) and Innovium (data center switches). But the standalone Marvell business is doing just fine too, and adding these two new companies to the mix is a real game-changer. Marvell said it's landing new design wins thanks to integrating Inphi and Innovium technology into its existing portfolio, and management thinks it will enjoy about 30% year-over-year data center growth through fiscal 2023.
Longer-term, Marvell's data center business is a fantastic reason to buy and hold this chip stock. For every cloud computing service out there, a data center is needed to do the work. With a new upgrade cycle in cloud infrastructure getting under way, Marvell is a great way to play the movement.
Laying the foundation for a leading auto supplier business
Data centers aren't the only secular growth trend at play here. Marvell reported strong growth in its networking and carrier infrastructure (telecom industry) businesses as well. 5G mobile networks are still early in their construction in most markets around the world, and like its data center segment, the company is also landing new chip design wins for 5G too.
But mobile networks aren't the only mobile computing system at play here -- the auto industry is an especially exciting realm for Marvell. Housed within its industrials segment, management said annualized auto industry revenue is now at $140 million. Today, most of that revenue is from ethernet connectivity, helping automakers stitch together data moving from one system to another in the modern tech-enabled vehicle. Eventually, Marvell thinks this auto ethernet business will be worth hundreds of millions per year.
But it has even greater ambitions for the connected car. Marvell announced the launch of a new subsidiary business called Brightlane focused on automakers, which includes not just ethernet equipment but also processors (another ""multi-billion per year market opportunity"") custom designed to act as the ""brains"" of electric and semi-autonomous vehicles. As cars get smarter in the decade ahead, computing and data management will be a big business within the automaking industry.
Profits will follow in time
Revenue growth is undisputed, but thanks in no small part to acquisition costs, Marvell's bottom line is a bit of a mess right now. Its net loss totaled $62.5 million in the fiscal third quarter, although on an adjusted basis, the company reported net income of $364.3 million, which excludes non-cash amortization expense of acquired assets. Excluding $3.5 billion in cash acquisition charges, free cash flow was $334 million through the first nine months of the current fiscal year, down 41% from $562 million during the same period last year.
As Marvell works through these purchase costs, it expects to emerge with improved free-cash-flow-generating ability. The combination of assets is equating to content gains at data center, telecom, automotive, and other customers. In other words, Marvell is becoming more of a one-stop shop for computing engineers and developers, and the combination of multiple chip design technologies is helping it innovate new products for those same users. As a result, when revenue rises, profits should (eventually) rise by an even greater amount.
Marvell Technology stock currently trades for 59 times current-year adjusted earnings per share estimates. With double-digit revenue growth on pace to continue into the new year and beyond, this is an oft-overlooked leader in the semiconductor industry that deserves your attention.

2021-12-07 00:00:00+00:00,"This Explosive Tech Stock Is On Fire After Its Latest Earnings, Suggesting It Is a Screaming Buy",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-explosive-tech-stock-is-on-fire-after-its-latest-earnings-suggesting-it-is-a,,,"Just last month, I wrote about why Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) stock looked like a terrific buy despite logging impressive gains in 2021. The chipmaker's fiscal 2022 third-quarter results, released on Dec. 2, offer up some fresh support for my assertions that this hot stock is headed higher.
It appears I'm not the only one who thinks so, as Marvell's stock price shot up 17% after the release of its latest quarterly report which registered outstanding growth in revenue and earnings that helped it crush Wall Street's expectations.
Let's look at the numbers from Marvell's third-quarter report and see how it adds to the argument that this stock's explosive run isn't over yet.
Image source: Getty Images.
Marvell Technology delivers terrific growth
Marvell Technology's fiscal Q3 revenue shot up 61% year over year to $1.21 billion, driven by substantial growth across all five of its end markets. Analysts were looking for $1.15 billion in revenue from Marvell, but the robust demand for chips from the data center, telecom, networking, consumer, and auto/industrial markets helped it exceed expectations.
The chipmaker's non-GAAP net income increased to $0.43 per share in the quarter from $0.25 per share in the year-ago period. The bottom line easily exceeded consensus estimates of $0.38 per share. The sharp year-over-year jump of 72% in Marvell's earnings per share was aided by an increase of 2.1 percentage points in the adjusted gross margin to 65.1% during the quarter.
It is worth noting that Marvell's acquisitions of Inphi and Innovium, completed in April and October this year, provided a substantial boost to the company's results. However, Marvell's organic business that excludes these acquisitions also did well, recording nearly 30% year-over-year growth during the quarter. It is also impressive to see that the new acquisitions are enhancing the company's margins and improving its earnings power, as is evident from the jump in its margins last quarter.
The good part is that Marvell's terrific momentum shows no signs of ending, as its guidance indicates. The company anticipates $1.32 billion in revenue this quarter along with earnings of $0.48 per share at the midpoint of its guidance range. The forecast is well ahead of Wall Street's expectation of $0.42 per share in earnings and $1.21 billion in revenue.
For comparison, Marvell had reported $0.29 per share in earnings on revenue of $798 million in the year-ago period, which means that it is on track to sustain its terrific performance once again.
More growth is in the cards
Marvell CEO Matt Murphy pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that the company is seeing a sharp spike in demand for chips used in the fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks. More specifically, Marvell's 5G business is expected to increase 30% sequentially in the fourth quarter, driven by the ramp-up of new products featuring the company's chips.
Marvell points out that it is going to witness a substantial increase in revenue thanks to the new design wins it has scored in the data center and 5G markets. In the words of the CEO:
We updated our expectations for revenue from cloud-optimized silicon design wins to ramp to $400 million in fiscal 2024, a year earlier than prior projections. These wins are further projected to double to $800 million in revenue in fiscal 2025. In 5G, starting in fiscal 2024, we expect to benefit from an increase in content at Nokia when we start ramping our 5-nanometer OCTEON-embedded processors into their 5G base station.
The ramp-up of the 5G business will positively affect the company's revenue from the carrier infrastructure business. This segment accounted for 18% of Marvell's top line last quarter and recorded a 27% year-over-year jump in revenue. The company now anticipates year-over-year growth of 40% in the carrier infrastructure business thanks to the 5G ramp.
Meanwhile, Marvell's biggest business has also hit a purple patch thanks to the acquisitions and the increasing adoption of its chips. The data center segment produced 41% of Marvell's total revenue last quarter at nearly $500 million, growing 109% over the prior-year period. Just like the 5G business, Marvell says that the data center business is also witnessing ""the start of new product ramps, which we expect will continue to drive sustained growth.""
As a result, Marvell says that its data center business is on track to double once again in the current quarter as compared to the prior-year period.
Meanwhile, the automotive/industrial end market is turning out to be another growth hotspot for Marvell. Though the segment produced just $66 million in revenue last quarter -- just over 5% of the top line -- it recorded 114% year-over-year growth. The important thing to note here is that the segment's growth was organic in nature and wasn't powered by the acquisitions, as was the case with other segments.
Marvell credited this impressive growth to the faster adoption of its automotive chips by OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), and it sees a massive opportunity in this space going forward. The company expects the cloud, 5G, and automotive end markets to generate a revenue opportunity of $18.9 billion by 2024, up from this year's estimated $10.9 billion.
The company's overall addressable opportunity is expected to hit $30 billion by 2024, indicating that it has a lot of room to grow as it is on track to clock just over $4.4 billion in revenue this fiscal year.
The stock remains a screaming buy
Marvell's lucrative end markets explain why analysts expect the company's bottom line to clock a compound annual growth rate of 43% for the next five years. The huge addressable market also points toward robust top-line growth in the coming years.

With the recent downturn in the stock market, some investors may have lost their appetite for tech stocks. But amid the recent retreat, some investors are still hunting for bargains. No doubt, the concerns over the new Omicron variant, inflation, and other headwinds have sent many large-cap tech stocks down by double digit percentages. Having said that, many remain optimistic about the long-term outlooks for some of the top tech stocks.
That said, the industry continues to innovate and reinvent themselves. For instance, Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) announced earlier today that it will restructure its commerce group by forming two new digital commerce divisions, respectively focused on international and domestic markets. The broader concerns that U.S.-listed Chinese stocks may be forced to delist from the U.S. stock market is also adding pressure to BABA stock. With the sharp sell-off over the past 6 months, some investors are considering initiating a position in China’s Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).
Elsewhere, the leading e-commerce company in Latin America, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is also not spared from the pullback despite its tremendous growth recorded during the pandemic. Considering that the growth from the tech space remains respectable, should investors consider buying these tech stocks in thestock market today

Semiconductor stocks are among the hottest stocks in the stock market this year. This should not come as a surprise as demand for semiconductor chips is also at an all-time high. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), semiconductor shipments reached an all-time high in the third quarter of 2021. During the quarter, worldwide sales of semiconductors totaled $144.8 billion, an increase of 27.6% from the same quarter last year. Well, with the ongoing high demand for chips, the industry is putting extraordinary efforts to ramp up production. After all, most would agree that semiconductors are the nerve center of the world’s economy, national security, and critical infrastructure. 
Recently, we saw major corporate leaders, including Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook urging the congressional leaders to speed up a semiconductor aid bill. The legislation would provide $52 billion in grants and incentives for domestic chip production. Other notable companies supporting the letter are Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and many more. So, should Congress get these initiatives across the finish line, it would be a huge boost for semiconductor stocks. With that in mind, here are some of the top semiconductor stocks worth considering in the stock market today.
Best Semiconductor Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] This Month
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)
Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MRVL)
Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU)
ON Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ: ON)
NVIDIA
Firstly, we will be looking at the semiconductor giant, NVIDIA. The company made its name through its graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets. Not to mention, it also makes system-on-chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. Given its ability to deliver excellence in various markets, it is no wonder that NVDA stock is having a stellar year thus far.
During the third quarter, NVIDIA posted record revenue of $7.1 billion, up 50% year-over-year. Out of which, gaming revenues were $3.22 billion and Data Center revenues were $2.94 billion. Both increased by 42% and 55% respectively compared to the prior year’s quarter. With record revenues across the board, the demand for NVIDIA’s products and services is surging at an unprecedented level.
Furthermore, the company along with Atos announced the Excellence AI Lab last month. Both companies hope to advance climate and health care research with exascale computing. Also, the lab will bring together scientists and researchers to help advance European computing technologies, education, and research. In the long run, it can only be beneficial for both companies as they continue to push the boundaries with the help of supercomputers. Given these considerations, would NVDA stock be worth buying now?

Marvell Technology
Marvell is a data infrastructure semiconductor solutions provider. Put simply, it principally engages in delivering the data infrastructure technology that connects the world. On top of that, the company’s subsidiary, Inphi Corporation, engages in providing analog and mixed-signal semiconductor solutions for the communications and cloud markets.

For starters, Marvell announced its third-quarter financial report yesterday. The company posted a record revenue of $1.21 billion, an increase of 61% year-over-year. This exceeds the high end of the company’s guidance. Meanwhile, its Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $364 million or $0.43 per diluted share. These results instill confidence in investors and are a testament to the company’s progress thus far.
Concurrently, the company also introduced the industry’s first 802.1AE MACsec integrated dual 1000BT1 and 100BT1 PHYs. These Ethernet PHY solutions enable energy-efficient, secure in-vehicle networks and assist in achieving functional safety compliance at the system level. Ultimately, these new products would extend Marvell’s leadership position in automotive Ethernet PHY. With that in mind, would now be the right time to jump on the MRVL stock bandwagon?

Micron Technology
Another top name in the semiconductor space now would be Micron. The company is a world leader in innovative memory solutions that transform how the world uses information. With a history of more than 40 years, it has been instrumental to the world’s most significant technology today. Despite trading sideways for most of the year, the company’s stock is slowly picking up its pace. MU stock has risen more than 15% just within the past month. 
Last month, Micron announced that MediaTek has validated Micron’s low-power double data rate 5X DRAM for MediaTek’s new Dimensity 9000 5G flagship chipset for smartphones. Micron’s LPDDR5X will enable smartphone ecosystems to unlock the next wave of data-intensive applications powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G innovations. These new levels of memory performance are increasingly critical and Micron aims to remain at the forefront of this growing industry. 
Well, Micron is not one that easily rests on its laurels. On Wednesday, it announced an expansion of its business relationship with United Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE: UMC). This strengthens its customers’ supply chains and continuous access to products that are critical to its automotive and mobile customers. With all these exciting developments taking place, would you say that MU stock is a top semiconductor stock to buy now?

Its portfolio includes sensors, power management, analog, logic, timing, connectivity, discrete, SoC, and custom devices. ON stock is yet another semiconductor stock that has been having an excellent year. It saw gains of more than 110% over the past year. 
Earlier in November, the company announced that it will be collaborating with SensiML™ Corporation. The partnership aims to deliver a complete machine learning solution for autonomous sensor data processing and predictive modeling. In addition, developers using the RSL10-based platform and the SensiML software together can implement AI for smart industrial applications regardless of their expertise in data science. 
On the financial end, ON Semiconductor has also been firing on all cylinders. Last month, the company reported yet another quarter of record results driven by strong demand for its intelligent power and sensing solutions. It posted a record revenue of $1.74 billion, up 32% year-over-year. Meanwhile, its GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.70 compared to $0.38 in the prior year’s quarter. Safe to say, the company appears to be making sustainable progress in the right direction. All things considered, would you be investing in ON stock?

(NASDAQ:MRVL) shareholders will have a reason to smile today, with the analysts making substantial upgrades to next year's statutory forecasts. Consensus estimates suggest investors could expect greatly increased statutory revenues and earnings per share, with analysts modelling a real improvement in business performance. Investors have been pretty optimistic on Marvell Technology too, with the stock up 16% to US$83.59 over the past week. Could this upgrade be enough to drive the stock even higher?
After this upgrade, Marvell Technology's 26 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$5.9b in 2023. This would be a sizeable 50% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Losses are expected to turn into profits real soon, with the analysts forecasting US$0.69 in per-share earnings. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$5.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.38 in 2023. There has definitely been an improvement in perception recently, with the analysts substantially increasing both their earnings and revenue estimates.
NasdaqGS:MRVL Earnings and Revenue Growth December 4th 2021
It will come as no surprise to learn that the analysts have increased their price target for Marvell Technology 30% to US$98.15 on the back of these upgrades. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Marvell Technology, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$115 and the most bearish at US$50.00 per share. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that the analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.
These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Marvell Technology's past performance and to peers in the same industry. The analysts are definitely expecting Marvell Technology's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 39% annualised growth to the end of 2023 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 8.3% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 11% annually. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Marvell Technology to grow faster than the wider industry.
The Bottom Line
The biggest takeaway for us from these new estimates is that analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, with improved earnings power expected for next year. They also upgraded their revenue estimates for next year, and sales are expected to grow faster than the wider market. Given that the consensus looks almost universally bullish, with a substantial increase to forecasts and a higher price target, Marvell Technology could be worth investigating further.
Even so, the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for the value creation of shareholders. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Marvell Technology going out to 2024, and you can see them free on our platform here..

Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter GAAP results. Revenue was $1.21 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance and represents another record achievement for Marvell. GAAP gross margin was 48.5 percent, GAAP operating loss was $33 million, and loss per diluted share was $0.08.
Revenue grew 13 percent sequentially and 61 percent year over year, an acceleration from the first half of this fiscal year. We saw great momentum in all five of our end markets, with revenue growing both sequentially and year-on-year. Our data center, carrier, enterprise networking, and auto/industrial end markets all achieved record revenue and performed above guidance. Excellent operational and financial execution resulted in revenue 6 percent above the midpoint of our guidance.
Our operations team continues to do a great job in sourcing incremental supply, and we are starting to see the fruits of their labor. Supply was better than expected in the third quarter, and we expect continued improvements as we move into the fourth quarter and next year. The additional capacity has better positioned us to catch up to the growth in demand, which so far has outpaced increases in supply. Moving on to our non-GAAP results for the quarter.
Non-GAAP gross margin was a record 65.1 percent, and we delivered $418 million in non-GAAP operating income. Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record at 34.5 percent. Higher revenue, coupled with stronger gross margin, drove non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.43, 13 percent above the midpoint of guidance, growing 72 percent year over year, which represents phenomenal growth in earnings. These are tremendous accomplishments, and I am very proud of the outstanding execution by our entire Marvell team in driving such strong results.
Let me now move on to discussing our five end markets, starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the third quarter was $500 million, growing 15 percent sequentially and 109 percent year over year, exceeding our guidance. Both the stand-alone Marvell business and the acquired Inphi business delivered strong growth, driven by robust demand from cloud customers. I would note that our on-premise data center business also grew sequentially and year-over-year.
Data center is our most diverse end market with multiple product lines contributing to sequential revenue growth. These include 200-gig and 400-gig PAM4 electro-optics, data center interconnect ZR modules, SSD and HDD controllers, cloud-optimized SoCs, and Ethernet switches. In addition to strong end-market demand, the majority of these product lines are also benefiting from the start of new product ramps, which we expect will continue to drive sustained growth. As an example, in our SSD business, we benefited from a strong ramp of DIY controllers directly to a Tier 1 cloud customer.
Remember, you heard at Investor Day, Marvell has been winning a large number of incremental cloud-optimized silicon designs, and these are now in development. In addition, the design win funnel and level of activity on cloud-optimized silicon engagements continues to accelerate, and we have won -- recently won another socket with our storage accelerator. At our Investor Day, we discussed this new $500 million market for our storage business and cloud storage accelerators and disclosed our first design win with a cloud customer. Now, a key storage partner, KIOXIA, recently announced production availability of their NVMe over fabric SSDs, which will also use our storage accelerators.
These SSDs are for Ethernet Bunch of Flash systems designed for applications such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and high-performance computing. The KIOXIA SSDs connect to the network fabric natively using Ethernet by integrating a Marvell storage accelerator, which converts NVMe into 25-gigabit Ethernet. We are excited to see this new opportunity take shape with multiple customers starting to adopt our storage accelerators. Turning now to Innovium.
During the quarter, we closed the acquisition, adding their cloud-optimized switches to our broad data center portfolio. We're pleased that company co-founder and CTO, Puneet Agarwal, and the R&D team, have become a part of Marvell. We are confident that our combined switch business -- businesses are now well-positioned to be a strong provider of Ethernet switches to data centers, and we see an incredible opportunity ahead for Marvell in this high-growth market. We expect the acquisition of Innovium will result in $150 million in incremental revenue next fiscal year as we ramp switches into a large Tier-1 cloud customer they had won prior to the acquisition.
We are also looking forward to supporting additional cloud customers such as LinkedIn, who are deploying Innovium's TERALYNX-based switches in production across multiple data centers with the SONiC network OS. SONiC is an open network operating system, which provides cloud customers with more choice and interoperability, as well as the ability to scale. We recently announced our commitment to supporting SONiC across both our Prestera and TERALYNX products. Moving on to our expectations for revenue from our data center end market in our fourth fiscal quarter.
Similar to the third quarter, we are expecting another strong performance led by cloud customers across a broad range of products. We expect data center revenue to more than double from a year ago, and we project sequential growth in the double-digits on a percentage basis in the fourth quarter. We are pleased with the strength we are seeing from the cloud end market, which we expect will remain a strong driver of sustained growth for Marvell. Looking out further in time, we are also excited by the immense potential for another phase of growth as large-scale virtual environments, such as Facebook is doing with their metaverse, start to gain traction.
For simplicity, while I will use the metaverse as a general descriptor for this discussion, we expect many different implementations of virtual environments enabled by a broad set of companies and ecosystems. Regardless of the form these environments take, the data sets will be exponentially larger compared to the current internet, which is largely two-dimensional, and latency will need to be extremely low to realistically simulate a real-world environment. As a result, we expect the metaverse will significantly accelerate a number of key trends, which are already occurring in the cloud today, including the need to store huge amounts of data in a secure environment, connected by high-speed electro-optic links to custom compute engines. This next level of massive scaling makes the metaverse an even stronger candidate for cloud-optimized silicon solutions that Marvell is currently enabling.
This meshes perfectly with the core competencies we have already developed across compute, storage, security, networking, high-speed electro-optics, and customization, which are driving our current success. And these are equally applicable to the variety of virtual environments, which we'll develop over time. The metaverse also has the potential to be a killer app for 5G, another area of strength for Marvell. Multiple cloud customers have already engaged with us, as they start designing the architecture of their next generation of data infrastructure to enable a significantly richer set of virtual applications and experiences.
Turning now to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $215 million, growing 9 percent sequentially and 28 percent year over year, exceeding our guidance. Growth was driven by our 5G products ramping at multiple customers. We are also able to improve supply for our wired business to enable sequential growth.
Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect a strong ramp in our 5G business of approximately 30 percent sequentially. And as a result, we project our combined carrier infrastructure revenue across our wireless and wired end markets to grow sequentially in the low-teens on a percentage basis, while year-on-year growth is expected to accelerate to over 40 percent. It's exciting to see the step-up in our 5G business, and we expect significant additional growth over the next several years as 5G adoption continues to grow around the globe, combined with Marvell content gains from designs we have won, but not yet begin -- begun to ramp. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market.
Revenue for the third quarter was $247 million, growing 11 percent sequentially and 56 percent year over year with the majority of the growth coming from stand-alone Marvell products. This performance was significantly better than our expectations as our operations team did an excellent job securing additional supply to better address the increase in demand for our products. From a product perspective, in the third quarter, the continuation of strong year-on-year growth was driven primarily by Marvell's Ethernet networking portfolio. We have been gaining share and benefiting from the very deliberate investments we have made in our enterprise Ethernet switch platform, as well as the combined Marvell and Aquantia PHY portfolio.
In addition, our content has been growing, driven by increase in multi-gig Ethernet adoption. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter for our enterprise networking end market, we project revenue sequentially to be up in the low- to mid-single digits on a percentage basis, and year-over-year growth is expected to remain very strong at approximately 60 percent. We expect the strong growth to be driven by continued share gains from Marvell products, combined with ongoing recovery in the enterprise networking end market. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market, which is served primarily by stand-alone Marvell businesses, revenue for the third quarter was $67 million, growing 16 percent sequentially and 114 percent year over year, driven by ongoing ramps in our auto business.
I'm pleased to report that our team has now driven our auto business to over $140 million annualized revenue run rate in the third quarter, ahead of our prior expectations. We are benefiting from a faster pace of adoption of our Ethernet solutions by auto OEMs, who are prioritizing the production of their latest models, which tend to have higher semiconductor content. We are confident that we are well on our way to driving a multi-hundred-million-dollar revenue stream from our Ethernet -- auto Ethernet business over the next few years. Looking beyond connectivity, our next multibillion-dollar market opportunity for Marvell is in automotive compute.
Our future of technology in cars is all about electrification and intelligence, with embedded security and onboard storage in a fully networked environment. Similar to the rise of optimized silicon and cloud, automotive OEMs are realizing that to differentiate their products and deliver the most value to their customers, they need unique technology and IP to be embedded in compute silicon optimized to their specific platforms. You don't need to look too far to see evidence for this sea change. Recent industry commentary, including from Ford and Volkswagen, talks about their focus on developing internal silicon design expertise, desire to customize off-the-shelf compute, and their intentions to design and develop their own shifts for autonomous vehicles.
Similar to our successful strategy of partnering with hyperscale customers for cloud-optimized silicon, we are confident that our co-development business model and rich IP portfolio is equally attractive to automotive OEMs. In this model, the design is done in true partnership with the customer focusing on the portions proprietary to their platform and Marvell bringing our own unique compute, security, Ethernet networking, and storage silicon IP to the table. The end solution is a semi-custom design, which represents the best of both worlds, allowing our customers to achieve their ambitions and retain control of their road map. In doing so, they could not only preserve their differentiation with a faster time to market, but will also enable a lower level of investment, thanks to Marvell.
We see compute becoming an increasingly important part of our growing automotive business, adding to our very successful Ethernet connectivity solutions. Reflecting this broadening of our portfolio, I'm very pleased to introduce Marvell's new brand for automotive solutions, Brightlane, which includes our gigabit and multi-gigabit Ethernet switches and PHYs for connectivity and our OCTEON processors for compute. At our Investor Day, we have discussed our first major auto compute win based on our OCTEON-Brightlane platform. The semi-custom design is now in development.
We are seeing a significant increase in compute-related activity with additional auto OEMs, both traditional and new market entrants. And I look forward to updating you on our progress in this exciting new long-term growth pillar for Marvell. Turning to the outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter for our auto and industrial end market. We expect strong revenue growth to continue.
We project sequential growth in the double digits on a percentage basis and year-over-year growth to remain above 100 percent. Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $183 million, growing 10 percent sequentially and 20 percent year over year. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to grow sequentially in the low-single digits on a percentage basis and year-on-year growth in the double digits on a percentage basis.
We are benefiting from a strong -- from strong growth driven by our SSD controllers that have targeted at differentiated, sticky, long-lived, and high-ROI applications such as game consoles. In closing, we delivered very strong results for our third quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue in our fourth quarter and next year. Both the acquired Inphi business and the stand-alone Marvell business are firing on all cylinders. In the third quarter, the stand-alone Marvell business delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth close to 30 percent.
The Inphi business performed even better. The midpoint of our guidance for revenue in the fourth quarter implies a similar approximately 30 percent year-over-year growth rate for each of these businesses. We are proud of these results and our outlook for growth in the fourth quarter, which is well above the high end of our long-term revenue growth target of a 15 percent to 20 percent CAGR. Securing capacity for growth remains the highest priority for our operations team even as the supply expansion comes with an increase in input costs.
As we have done throughout the supply crunch, we are working with our customers to adjust prices to offset the impact of these cost increases, which let us jointly benefit from sustained growth. As we look at next fiscal year, we will continue to drive supply improvements, and we expect demand to remain above the high-end of our long-term target model. As a result, we anticipate a sustained period of strong revenue growth for Marvell. From a base of approximately $4.4 billion in fiscal 2022, we expect the combined Marvell and Inphi business to continue growing in fiscal 2023 at the 30 percent year-on-year rate we are currently achieving.
On top of this, we expect an additional $150 million of revenue in fiscal 2023, resulting from the Innovium acquisition. We're also excited about the setup for growth beyond fiscal 2023. At our Investor Day, you heard us describe our participation in end markets collectively expected to grow at a 13 percent CAGR. In addition, we have a number of growth drivers, which we expect will result in our revenue growing faster than our end markets.
We discussed our expectations for a step-up in incremental revenue from the start of new design win ramps. We updated our expectations for revenue from cloud-optimized silicon design wins to ramp to $400 million in fiscal 2024, a year earlier than prior projections. These wins are further projected to double to $800 million in revenue in fiscal 2025. In 5G, starting in fiscal 2024, we expect to benefit from an increase in content at Nokia when we start ramping our 5-nanometer OCTEON-embedded processors into their 5G base station.
Over the same timeframe, our auto Ethernet connectivity business is expected to make significant progress toward driving revenue over $500 million annually, and our electro-optics PAM, Coherent, and ZR portfolio is also projected to remain on a high-growth trajectory. In summary, while we have been delivering strong results for multiple quarters, we are confident that we are still in the early stages of a sustained high-growth period for Marvell, and we are looking forward to reaping the benefits of the investments we have made in our business over the last few years. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue in the third quarter was $1.211 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, growing 13 percent sequentially and 61 percent year over year. Please note, the acquisition of Innovium added approximately $5 million in revenue, which was not contemplated in our original guidance for the third quarter.
Revenue growth was robust from all five of our end markets. Data center remained our largest end market, driving 41 percent of consolidated revenue. Enterprise networking was the next largest with 20 percent of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 18 percent, consumer at 15 percent, and auto/industrial at six percent. GAAP gross margin was 48.5 percent, which included the remaining amortization of Inphi inventory step-up costs.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 65.1 percent of revenue, exceeding the high end of our guidance range primarily due to better-than-expected end market revenue mix. In particular, revenue from our enterprise networking end market was significantly better than our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $621 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $371 million, which included 25 days of Innovium operating expenses of approximately $5 million.
Our GAAP operating loss was $33 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $480 million or 34.5 percent of revenue, an all-time record demonstrating the strong leverage in our operating model while we continue to invest for long-term revenue growth. For the third quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.08. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.43, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance.
Earnings per share grew 26 percent sequentially and 72 percent year over year, driven by strong top-line revenue momentum and the execution on both gross and operating margins. Now, turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $265 million. We returned $50 million to shareholders through cash dividends.
We paid down $151 million of our long-term debt during the third quarter. As of the end of the third fiscal quarter, our long-term debt was $4.5 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was three times and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.7 times. Inventory at the end of the third quarter was $629 million.
$71 million of this inventory balance is from Innovium, including $42 million in step-up cost due to purchase price accounting. We anticipate amortizing this step-up cost over the next two quarters. We have also increased our work in process inventory to support the revenue growth in revenue we are forecasting. In summary, the Marvell team executed exceptionally well, delivering accelerated top-line growth and earnings expansion much faster than revenue growth.
Now, turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Please note, this guidance include expected results from the Innovium business for the full quarter. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.32 billion, plus or minus three percent. We expect our GAAP gross margin in the range of 47.9 percent to 49.8 percent.
We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 65 percent. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $630 million to $640 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $390 million to $395 million, which include approximately $15 million of opex for the acquired Innovium business for the full quarter. This outlook also reflects the increase in investment to support the accelerated revenue growth we are driving across the business, including the launch of multiple new projects tied to the design wins we have discussed in prior quarters.
In addition, we're including a higher amount of bonus accrual, given our strong operating performance well above our plan. As a reminder, looking ahead to the first fiscal quarter of 2023, due to the typical seasonality in payroll taxes, our opex tends to increase from Q4 of fiscal year by high-single digits sequentially on a percentage basis. We expect non-GAAP tax rate of five percent. We expect our basic weighted average share outstanding will be 844 million and our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be 861 million.
As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.03 per share on the lower end to an income of $0.04 per diluted share on the high end. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.48, plus or minus $0.03. Now, let me now close with some directional comments on our investment plan for the next fiscal year. As Matt mentioned earlier, we see continued strong demand across our end markets and improvement in supply to drive our top-line revenue growth above 30 percent in fiscal 2023.
To support both near-term and long-term revenue growth, we are planning to increase our investment levels appropriately, annualize the midpoint of our opex guidance for Q4 for fiscal 2022, which include both Inphi and Innovium for the full period, implies a $1.57 billion baseline opex run rate. From this baseline, we are planning for opex to grow in the high-single digits on a percentage basis in fiscal 2023, substantially lower than our top-line revenue growth. We are increasing our spending to execute on significant design wins and continue to drive process technology leadership, as well as aggressive -- pursue a growing funnel of new design win opportunities within the large $30 billion SAM we discussed at our Investor Day. We are confident we'll continue to drive strong and sustainable long-term revenue growth and deliver earnings expansion much faster than revenue growth in fiscal 2023 and beyond.

Hey, good afternoon, and great results. Maybe just a question. I know you're going to get a bunch on supply, but obviously, it seems like the biggest swing factor into the upside. So, can you talk about that and maybe also just address the enterprise segment? Because I think that was your biggest beat, and you were thinking it would be down.
So, just refresh my memory in terms of why you thought it would be down and maybe just a perspective on, you know, just supply in general. You said that you're signing long-term agreements. You know, at what point do you think you'll kind of get out from under these supply constraints?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Blayne. And what I would lead off by saying is I think the two questions you asked are interrelated, meaning the enterprise strength we saw was really as a result of a pretty big catch-up in the supply. So, on the topic of supply, you know, we're really pleased with the progress.
We, like a lot of other companies, have, you know, been challenged to meet the -- this unprecedented demand. And I'm very proud to say that our team has responded really well. And so, a couple of factors. One is we've driven pretty big transformation in our operations group.
Part of that was signing long-term supply agreements. I'd say equally meaningful, though, was the strategic nature in which we've really engaged over the last nine months with our supply chain base. Our partners understand our opportunity as well as anybody now, and they're really betting on us and they're betting on Marvell. That's helped a lot.
And it's just been strong execution by the team. And so, when you add it all up, really what's happened, Blayne, is the demand has continued to be very, very strong and that's continued even until now. It's really been a story of supply catching up. And what I would note is supply has caught up, you know, a lot, obviously.
But to be honest, we still aren't really making a dent yet in the unfulfilled backlog that's out there. So, it's a two-edged sword. On the one hand, it's great. We're getting more supply.
On the other hand, demand continues to be very strong, and we see that going into next year. But certainly, we'll take the win in Q3 and also the Q4 guide relative to the great job our team has done. And enterprise, as we noted the last time, was really -- we had a very nice Q2 on enterprise. And we were able to actually do -- just again do -- the team has done a great job to get the supply wind up to meet the strong demand.
And then if you actually look into Q4, you've got enterprise up again. And really, the year-over-year story is what -- what's, I think, most impressive. I mean, we're talking about 60 percent year-over-year growth projected in our enterprise segment. Almost all of that is organic, Blayne, and -- well, that will continue to grow next year.
Thanks.

Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Thanks for letting me ask you a question. Matt, I wanted to dive a little bit into the guidance you gave for fiscal '23. That was a little more detailed than I had expected. And it seems like you're exceedingly confident about the revenue growth side of it.
So, can you just talk a little bit more detail on -- it looks like about $5.6 billion in revenue, given the math that you said. If we took the Innovium side out because we all have a decent idea of what's happening there, can you just talk about what the biggest drivers of that growth is going to be year over year? And if something happened that's increased your confidence in your ability to deliver that, whether it be the supply side coming or if you're just willing to talk more about design wins that you have kind of dropped breadcrumbs to us about over the last few calls?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. I think there's a few factors, Ross. The first is, you know, we did lay out our strategic narrative at the Investor Day. So, that was one setup we tried to give investors relative to where the business was heading.
Second is when we look into next year, we're -- we certainly see the demand strength continuing really across all segments. So, that gives us a lot of confidence. That's data center, that's 5G, that's automotive. It's also enterprise and consumer.
Those are backed up with purchase orders that are in place today. So, the backlog we have is very strong. And I think the other point is we really want -- and I really wanted to contextualize the growth that we're seeing in Q3 and Q4 on an organic basis, with Marvell growing 30 percent, you know, Inphi growing 30-ish percent, and that effectively continuing, so that the investment community understood that this wasn't a short-term bump, but rather part of a longer period of sustained growth, which we believe actually had legs even beyond next year. And then the simple math, and I'll let Jean chime in.
But basically, what we said is, you know, just take the pro forma $4.4 billion-ish we'll do this year, if you take our Q4 guide. You know, we believe we'll, you know, we'll grow that 30 percent next year. And then on top of that, you would add Innovium. So, I think your number would be actually a little bit higher when we look out to next year.
Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

The next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the very strong growth and the execution. I actually wanted to talk about the opex side. You know, if I look in the last year, you have basically, you know, added almost $500 million in sales, and opex has just grown about $100 million. And then I look at the guidance you are providing for next year also, that also suggests very strong leverage in the model and EBIT margins that can get into the high-30s.
So, I'm curious, Matt or Jean, what's helping drive that leverage? How are you adding, you know, almost $1.5 billion-plus in sales while keeping opex at these levels? How sustainable is this trajectory of expanding margins?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Maybe I'll start, Jean, or do you want to --
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I'll start.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Actually, why don't you start, Jean? Go ahead.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I'll start it. So, if you look at our investment level as we discussed during the Investor Day, we have a strong leverage because not only our central engineering team really leverage across the -- all the different end markets, we also focus on the cloud-optimized silicon solutions and work with customers. So, we do partner with customers to get customer funding, too. Overall, if you look at R&D investment we have been doing, plus the NRE we get from customer actually is significantly larger.
So, I would say, our team significantly leverage the investment across all different advanced process nodes and also across different end market. That helps us tremendously. And if you look at the opex increase, of course, we acquired both Inphi and Innovium. Year over year, it actually, you know, is going to get to almost $1.7 billion.
That's very much within the target model we are focusing on as our long-term business model. So, it's the leverage that helps us tremendously.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think that was well said by Jean.

The next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Thanks. Jean, inventory was up about $100 million, if I exclude Innovium. And, you know, you did talk a lot about this being WIP and the fact that you're taking WIP up given how much you think you can grow. But I guess the question is really on, you know, your visibility on revenue.
And, you know, I guess I'm surprised that you were able to build that much inventory. And, you know, maybe you can talk about whether delinquencies got any better. Thank you.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Actually, you know, we have improved the supply significantly. However, demand continue to outpace the supply, so we have not made a dent on the delinquency we have as a company. As Matt discussed earlier, if you look at fiscal '23, we see strong demand, a significant revenue ramp across all our end market with our unique product cycles.
So, 30 percent -- over 30 percent year-over-year growth literally, you know? As a matter of fact, if we look into Q1 sequentially, seasonally it will be down quarter. But just for the coming Q1 fiscal '23, we actually see sequential revenue increase, approaching mid-single digits on the basis of a very strong guide for Q4. So, the inventory build, primarily they are all work in process inventory to support not only Q1 revenue growth and beyond the Q1 for the sequential quarter-over-quarter increase in the next year to support the over 30 percent top-line revenue growth.

The next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations, and thanks for letting me ask a question. Matt, one of the key strengths of your businesses is that the design cycles for a lot of your products are fairly long and fairly visible.
And I would argue that the revenue growth that you have confidence in next year, notwithstanding some of the supply constraints, was based upon design wins that you've had for a while. I'm just kind of curious, can you talk about the design pipeline and the momentum in the design pipeline today, and then how you expect it to progress through next year? And my guess is it's going to continue to be strong, if not accelerate. And if that's the case, not wanting to get too far out in front of you, the long-term growth rate you put out in the Analyst Day, why wouldn't that just move up structurally higher? I know it's less than a quarter since you did that. But if you could give us some sense of how you're feeling around the design pipeline.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. John, it's a great question. I think the way I would answer it is, you are correct in that the design cycles for our products are quite long actually and -- but they also come with very long visibility as well. So, the revenue that we've got for next year, those designs are done.
I mean, they've been done for, in some cases, for a year, as an example, like in automotive. So, then you got to go back a couple of years and say, well, what did the design win funnel and pipeline and closure rate look like, say, two years ago or three years ago? And then what is that translating to? What I would comment on is our design win funnel and close rate in the last three years has gone up dramatically each year. And this current-year run track for our sales team is on track for a beyond-record, you know, design win capture. So, the design wins are growing each year.
That is a great leading indicator for us, for sure. And I think to your other question about the long term, look, we did our Analyst Day, we put out a long-term model. There will be ups and downs if you take a long-term view. But I think what we're saying is at least in the short term, i.e., Q3, Q4, also FY '23 and we believe even beyond, we can run, you know, above that model.
And we're very bullish on our business.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Yes, thank you. And let me echo your congratulations. I had a question on 5G. You're expecting 30 percent sequential growth in the January quarter.
Could you just elaborate a little bit on, you know, what's driving that? I do know you have some new customer design wins that are ramping and content growth. But especially as we think of it from a sort of, you know, regional deployment perspective, you know, any more color you could share with us would be great. Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Tore. To your point, yeah, we had, last quarter, said and signaled that we anticipated a step-up from Q3 to Q4 in our 5G business. Now, we've quantified it, which we see it growing 30 percent sequential. So, great step-up, great validation of the thesis in that business.
And what's exciting, I guess, is it's primarily driven by new product ramps at some of the key customers, particularly in the baseband area. And then also geographies, X China, you know, deploying 5G. So -- and we see that growing, you know, pretty strongly throughout FY '23, our 5G business, as we're highly diversified, both by customer, by geographies that those customer service, and then by the content which we have, most of which is still in front of us. If you think about one of our biggest opportunities, is really the transport processor area where we've won an additional customer we outlined a few years ago.
That's going to ramp in 2023 calendar. So, there's a nice layering effect, Tore, but I would say it's certainly nice to see a one quarter step-up. But we certainly see growth, you know, from here.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst

Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer

The next question will come from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong results and execution. I would assume that 16-nanometer is sort of the workhorse volume technology now. The team's 7-nanometer products are ramping strongly, where you've got 200-gig and 400-gig Polaris and Porrima PAM4 products. You've got your Canopus 7-nanometer DSP for data center interconnect ramping.
And then on top of that, your 5-nanometer pipeline is quite strong. What I think you guys said at the Analyst Day, you have 20 tape-ups over the next 18 months. And I think the team has already been sampling a number of different 5-nanometer products. So, when does the team expect 5-nanometer revenues to become a material part of the revenue mix? Is it calendar year '22? Is it more likely '23? And are the first meaningful 5-nanometer revenues going to be more cloud-focused or carrier-focused?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Harlan. Yeah, I think what I'd frame your question around, you know, the process technology road map, where is Marvell today. And you're right, some of those examples are spot-on relative to some of the optical components, etc. But we've got a diversity of process technologies that we use.
Some of those came from different acquisitions. But you're in the ballpark. I think where it leads to is really 5-nanometer, wherein the case of the kind of classic Marvell business, we effectively skipped 7-nanometer, right? So, there was a big investment --
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Yeah.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
In 5-nanometer. That is going to be led by a carrier in 5G. That's where the initial ramps will occur. Those products, you know, are getting ready to go to production.
So, we'll see, you know, revenue in calendar '22 on 5-nanometer for our OCTEON products. But that's the initial ramp phase. It will really kick in more in '23 and '24. And then you'll see some of the DPU products and then a whole host of other 5-nanometer products really hit the market kind of in that '22, '23 timeframe.
The -- effectively, the entire company road map has converged on this 5-nanometer platform from storage to networking to, you know, even the Inphi business is going to move there and take advantage. And so, a little bit pursuant to Vivek's question earlier, we just -- we get tremendous leverage out of this process and technology platform that we put together, that we actually articulated even a couple of years ago at our 2020 Investor Day. And that's really paying dividends relative to managing the opex efficiently and being able to take out a significant number of designs in 5-nanometer that are going to last for a very, very long time. But certainly, it will be 5G first, then carrier, and then you're going to see all the other markets, enterprise, automotive, optical, you name it.
So, this has got a lot of legs behind it.

C.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess I wanted to clarify on the supply side and then ask a question on auto.
So, on the supply side, you know, as you indicated in terms of, you know, roughly $5.9-plus billion for fiscal '23, are you saying that you secured that and then some? Or can you give us, you know, some clarity there? And then your commentary on the auto compute side, very intriguing. I would love to hear more, Matt, in terms of how we should be thinking about the timing of sort of initial design wins and when that should start to materially hit the model. Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Yeah. On the first question on supply, yeah, we feel good about that range we gave for next year. Certainly, there's still a lot of moving pieces, and we've got a lot of execution in front of us.
This is not a lay-up. Things have not eased up. It's not like all of a sudden, supply has loosened. And what I would say is that the growth next year really just comprehends kind of keeping up with demand.
There's still going to be some unsupported backlog probably that we can't quite get to. So, we're working on that as a potential as well. But we certainly feel good about the 30 percent growth and that growth rate continuing, which is really where we were in Q3, that's where we're going to be in Q4. And what we're saying is we anticipate we can keep growing our revenues at that rate when you look out to next year.
But obviously, we're going to try to do even better. On the automotive compute side, yeah, it's pretty new. It's a little bit like some of our other markets, where we gave some initial indications as we were gaining traction, and then the story evolves from there. But, yeah, we're -- I'd say we're well underway on our first design, and the level of activity going on with the automotive OEMs around this topic is kind of off the charts at this point.
The -- I think there's such -- it's almost like a -- there's a renaissance, C.J., I think, in what I would call the infotainment age in -- when automotive OEMs really embrace these consumer technologies. And all of a sudden, you got things like USB chargers in your car, you got, you know, state-of-the-art audio, you got touchscreens, you know, as consumer tech went in. That had a big benefit to semiconductor companies. What we've been saying for a while, and it's coming true now, is that the data-centric, you know, semiconductor products and IPs will be the next wave of growth.
We're seeing that in our networking products now, but it's very much moving to a compute-centric discussion. And there's a whole bunch of ways to skin that cat, but our model will be unique in that we're approaching it very similarly, C.J., to what we do in the cloud market, which is coming in with a broad IP portfolio, partnership-oriented model, build what somebody wants, let them put their stamp on it if they want to, and really customize and optimize for their particular system and use case, and bring all the goodness of all the Marvell IPs with it. So, it's pretty interesting discussions. There'll be more to come there, but we think this is going to be a very large long-term opportunity for the company.

Mark Lipacis -- Jefferies -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Matt, if I think about the kind of portfolio of assets that you've kind of pulled together here, I think about, you know, you have interconnect capabilities with Inphi, processing capabilities with Cavium, networking capabilities from Innovium, and native Marvell. And I'm wondering, to what extent, as your customers are coming to you for semi-custom solutions.
Are they asking you to deliver solutions to them that are, you know, a mix of two or more of those kind of different capabilities? And so, you know, that would be the question for your customers, as well as like how you're thinking about delivering, you know, a complete, you know, optimized, you know, computing solution on the merchant side. And maybe as part of that, could you just, you know, as you have, you know, embraced the semi-custom model, can you share with us your view? Like what does Marvell look like, pick the time, three, five, 10 years down the line? What is a merchant model versus a semi-custom model? What, you know, how do your revenues split along those dimensions? Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Yeah, Mark, I think you highlighted it well. There's a pretty incredible set of assets inside the company now that I would argue is very unique in terms of all of these being under one roof. I would actually add, there's even more.
I think you gave three great examples. I would say our security IP, storage, and I/O. And you're absolutely right, when we engage in our various business models, whether it's a full custom design or a, call it, a semi-custom partnership design with a mix of IP from the customer and ours, every one of those IPs gets put -- puts on the -- gets put on the table. And, you know, we gave an example actually in the prepared remarks about the storage accelerator opportunity, where it's not just a storage product, but it's got CPUs, it's got security, and it's got some pretty advanced network interfaces, especially when you talk about things like going from NVMe to Ethernet, as an example.
So, very unique, and it's part of our value prop and the fact also that we can do this under one roof. And despite the fact that a lot of these IPs we have or these people we have came from other companies, it's a one Marvell culture in our company. And so, when we go and engage, this doesn't look like 12 business units, or, oh, there's the Cavium team. I don't know if somebody has to go work with them, and there's the Innovium team.
There's one integrated go-to-market strategy and technology platform, and it's very powerful. And I think it's going to become even more and more relevant. And I would say, we don't really think about our business, Mark, at this point between pure merchant, pure semi-custom, pure custom. I mean, there's all these different business models in between.
And even our merchant products, what we're finding, like -- let me give you an example in storage, we end up doing a fair degree, for example, on our high-end data center-class SSD controllers now. We're doing a fair amount of customization, particularly on the firmware and the software, as an example, for each individual customer that makes it very, very sticky. And occasionally, we'll spin a metal option off, and we'll give them a certain feature that they want or need. But yeah, in a way, a lot of our business already today is effectively customized in the standpoint that we've really optimized it for the application.
And that could be in the hardware or it could be in the software and the firmware. So, I think that those lines are fairly blurred now is what I would say, Mark, and I think it's good. I think it enables us to stay flexible, and it's enabling us to win, you know, new accounts.

The next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities. Please go ahead.
Srini Pajjuri -- SMBC Nikko Securities -- Analyst
Thank you, Matt. A couple of clarifications actually. First, on the, you know, pricing. I think you mentioned that you've implemented some pricing actions to offset the higher input costs.
I'm just curious where we are in that process and how broadly you're implementing those, and to what extent, you know, that might be helping the top line as we go into next year. And then the second part of the question is, you know, obviously very strong outlook for next year. I'm just curious, given your breadth of products and, you know, end markets that you participate in, I'm guessing there's probably not going to be much seasonality, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on first half versus second half in terms of how you view, you know, the top line playing out next year. Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. How about this? I'll take the first one, and then I'll let Jean talk about the second one. Yeah. So, on the first one -- so, let me take you back on pricing.
It was about this time a year ago when I got a call from our ops team that said, we have some serious issues because we're getting a number of price cost increases from a whole bunch of our different suppliers overseas, and what are we going to do? And this was like, what, and I spent the month of December negotiating, you know, higher cost increases by my supply chain, you know, a year ago. And we then worked and managed to pass those through earlier than the year. Each time we've secured additional capacities, Srini, we end up, in a lot of cases, having to bear a higher input cost. That's been part of the drill as supply has come available.
And so, I would say that this has been a gradual process. It's gone on throughout the year. It continues to go on. I think there's -- there continues to be inflation in the supply chain.
And, you know, our philosophy has been to be real fair about that, be very partner-oriented, not take advantage of it. And so, while it has flowed, you know, through in -- through the top line throughout the year, the biggest benefit of the growth we're seeing is just the raw demand, the design wins, the value that we're capturing. And certainly, there's a slight tailwind on the top line, but it's almost all from demand. And we certainly see that trend continuing through next year.
Jean, do you want to cover the view of '23?
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Yeah. To just follow what Matt just said, right, next year, we see strong demand across all our end market. Frankly, it's supply constrained, you know, when we talk about over 30 percent of revenue growth.
That's a supply constrained outlook of what we're looking at. So, the normal seasonality definitely does not apply here. We see Q1, sequentially, on a very strong Q4 base to increase, you know, approaching mid-single digit. And after Q1, we will see continuous sequential increase.
Supply dynamics is certainly something our team will continue to drive. But absolutely, if we have more supply, we definitely have more demand. We can ship more products to customers. So, you should expect we see sequential increase each quarter for the rest of the next year.

Chris Rolland -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thank you for the question, fantastic update, and quarter. I was going to dig in on the hyperscale custom silicon side as well. Maybe if you guys could talk about in terms of your outlook -- your big outlook there.
How many of, let's say, the Top 7 big hyperscalers are you guys engaging? And it was kind of touched on, but, you know, storage versus networking and optics, where are you guys getting the most interest? I think you kind of covered that. But -- and then finally, this is probably too much to ask for, but in the past, we've had some NREs associated with the -- these hyperscalers. Are those NREs still coming in, or are you guys on your own?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. I think on the first question, I would say we're engaged broadly. The opportunity and the activity, though, is primarily centered around the big four in the U.S. That's where the technology leadership is.
That's where the thought leadership is. But we are -- and I think that's where the biggest drivers of our growth are going to come from. I think a lot of the others will follow. And so, I think there's leverage we're going to be able to get from that, but we're very well-engaged across the board.
And, you know, when we say custom, you're right, it's certainly, you know, custom-compute silicon for different types of workloads and applications, but also storage, networking, optics. It's a quite -- quite a broad range of technologies that we engage with, and security as well. On the NRE front, that continues to be healthy. And that's not just a hyperscale story, that's really broad-based across all of our businesses.
And we get actually really good visibility, because when we start developing these products, custom, semi-custom, whatever the model is, there's a development agreement that comes with that. They're milestone-based. Customer wants to have, you know, wants to have teeth. They want to have skin in the game, so do we.
So, that's typically where the NRE then gets mapped out over a fairly long period in some cases. So, we have a nice road map and a view. And Jean's team actually does a great job of being able to forecast the NRE and manage it, and it continues to grow. That's part of the leverage that we're getting, you know, into next year is the opex is going to grow, but also the NRE is going to grow.
So, that's enabling us to -- we get kind of a double whammy, right? Because while we're growing our opex and we're hiring people and we're staffing up, we're growing the NRE as well. And so, think of that as this incremental spend we've got that's not completely visible, but yet contains very important engineering resource and R&D resource that gets deployed toward high-ROI projects that spit out, you know, several years later. And so, it's a really -- I think it's a virtuous cycle. And our team's done a really good job of managing that as part of the business model.
I would, you know, hit on the final kind of example, on the automotive compute design win we talked about. It was -- it's heavily funded by R&D -- by NRE, excuse me. And again, that's a multi-year project. And it's so critical.
I mean, you basically can't build a car without it. So, you got to imagine, it's going to be really important to have a, you know, have a real, you know, significant contract around that and for us to have a significant co-funding to make it happen. So, it's a pretty important part of the business model, Chris, and it continues to be healthy. Thanks.

Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
Thanks for squeezing me in. Hey, Matt, you gave us a great outlook through fiscal '23. But as you looked out beyond fiscal '23, I think you mentioned, you see another big step-up in the 5G business at Nokia as the 5-nanometer platform starts to ramp. But I'm just wondering, can you give us a sense, is that step-up really Marvell capturing even greater content on your current share of base station to that customer? Or do you think your 5-nanometer platform is allowing you to grab greater share at that customer as the 5-nanometer platforms ramp? Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. Let me give you a broader answer, and then I'll dive into the 5G. So, just as you think about the growth from fiscal '23, next year, to fiscal '24, the biggest overall growth actually and step-up is in the cloud. And you remember, Quinn, at the Investor Day, we outlined this sort of very strong design win activity we had, which was going to result in the $400 million incremental revenue in fiscal '24 from cloud and then going to doubling again the year after.
So, that -- when you think of a step-up, that's where that's coming from. 5G is also kind of right behind, and that's going to be very strong as well. And to your point, one of our key partners and customers there is Nokia, as you mentioned. That in 5-nanometer is where we not only support them on their ambitions around baseband, but also on the CPU side and transport processing side.
And so, that's going to be -- that is content gain. That is new for us that starts at that time. That's all been planned. That's been -- that's all kind of going well and tracking to what we thought.
But I thought it was important to note the timing around that and highlight that we have more legs even in 5G, you know, beyond next year. Because that will just really be the first full year of production there. So, actually, we won't even peak for years after. So, really strong outlook on cloud and 5G in fiscal '24 and beyond.
And then, of course, you got the automotive story layering in, and all that drives a lot of goodness in the model.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
Great. Thank you.

The next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshi Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Thank you for squeezing me in, and congratulations on the very strong results. Matt, I wanted to ask about the enterprise networking business. You talked a little bit about your share growth in Ethernet, I believe. I was hoping you could elaborate on that a little bit, what's driving the success and if you can speak to sustainability there.
And then as my second part, again, sticking to enterprise networking, I think all of us appreciate the secular nature of your business in data center and 5G and auto and industrial. I guess, enterprise networking is perhaps, at least on a relative basis, a little bit more cyclical in nature. With the business growing, you know, kind of in the 50 percent to 60 percent range year over year, how should we think about sustainability of growth as we transition into 2022? Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Yeah. So, maybe I'll answer it in two pieces. The first is -- you're probably asking is, well, what happened? Why? How did you guys do this? And I think if you look back, we've made -- we've had a commitment to enterprise, OK, from day one, when I became CEO.
We never milked the cow, we never took this market for granted, we -- and most of this growth, as you noted, is organic Marvell, right? So, this comes from our Ethernet switch team, which really focused on leadership products, latest process node, very strong software capability from our switch business unit, and a real focus on the enterprise market in new products and new product development, product definition. So, that had a huge benefit that started three or four years ago, and now those designs are ramping. The second is in our Ethernet PHY transceiver business, we've also moved that from being a technology laggard to a technology leader in Ethernet PHYs. And we also did an acquisition of Aquantia, which was a relatively small company when we bought it.
But when we put the two teams together, the combined share that we've been able to drive has been very significant, and the road map we were able to accelerate dramatically. That's one of our product areas as an example that we're driving to 5-nanometer, OK? And then that has all kinds of integration opportunities. So, customers like the road map. They like the team.
They like the story. And that's now showing up. And certainly, the enterprise market is not growing at 50 percent a year, so you have to draw your conclusion. There's been certainly a share shift as customers have adopted our solutions.
And we do believe that this business is going to continue to grow. It will grow next year. It may not grow on the annualized basis at 50 percent, because you're going to start lapping at some point, and we're coming off of a relatively low point from last year. But also remember, our content has gone up on each of these generations, as multi-gig Ethernet becomes much more prevalent, and especially as enterprises are spending again and implementing Wi-Fi 6, which requires high-speed wired internet connect -- Ethernet connections at multi-gigabit.
We're seeing switch ports go up on multi-gig, which has our PHYs attached to it plus our switches. So, there's also a content story here, Toshi. So, I wouldn't exactly say, well, enterprise is like a low-single-digit grower and eventually will trend back there. I think between product leadership, share gain, and then content increase, enterprise can continue to be a winning business for Marvell.
Toshi Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Very helpful.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
And I think that's the last question. Yeah.
Toshi Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Celyad Oncology (NASDAQ:CYAD) stock is heading higher on Friday thanks to some recent news.
Source: Kevin McGovern / Shutterstock.com
The big announcement sending CYAD stock higher today is a $32.5 million private placement. This has it entering into a subscription agreement with an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group for the private placement of 6.5 million shares.
It’s worth pointing out that the private placement prices shares of CYAD stock at $5 each. That’s worth noting since shares of the biotech company’s stock closed out trading on Thursday at $3.64 per share. It’s also an  18.5% premium to the stock’s 30-day volume-weighted average price.
Celyad Oncology is expecting the private placement to close next Wednesday but what does it plan to do with the cash? The clinical-stage biotech company intends to use the money to further its research and development.
Celyad Oncology specifically focuses on “the discovery and development of chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapies for cancer.” That includes its allogeneic CAR T candidates CYAD-101 and CYAD-211, as well as other treatments in the works.
Filippo Petti, CEO of Celyad Oncology, said the following in the news release sending CYAD stock higher today.
“This transformative investment provides an important springboard for the Company and further strengthens our corporate initiatives to advance our novel allogeneic CAR T product candidates. The growth financing will be essential for us to expand our current allogeneic CAR T pipeline by continuing to exploit our differentiated, non-gene edited technologies and armored CAR T franchise.”
CYAD stock is up 38.8% as of Friday morning but are down nearly that same amount since the start of the year.

2021-12-03 00:00:00+00:00,Why Marvell Technology Stock Surged Today,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-marvell-technology-stock-surged-today,,,"What happened
Shares of Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) jumped on Friday after the chipmaker delivered better than expected fiscal 2022 third-quarter results.
As of 3:20 p.m. ET, Marvell's stock price was up more than 17%.
So what
Marvell's net revenue surged 61% year over year to $1.2 billion. The semiconductor company enjoyed strong growth across all five of its major business segments. Revenue in Marvell's data center and automotive/industrial divisions more than doubled, while sales in its enterprise networking, carrier infrastructure, and consumer segments increased 56%, 28%, and 20%, respectively.
Image source: Getty Images.
Notably, Marvell was able to successfully navigate global supply chain bottlenecks at a time when many of its competitors are struggling to obtain the raw materials they need for their manufacturing operations.
During a conference call with analysts, CEO Matt Murphy said:
Our operations team continues to do a great job in sourcing incremental supply, and we are starting to see the fruits of their labor. Supply was better than expected in the third quarter, and we expect continued improvements as we move into the fourth quarter and next year. The additional capacity has better positioned us to catch up to the growth in demand, which so far has outpaced increases in supply.
This operational success flowed to the company's financial statements. Marvell's adjusted gross margin improved to 65.1%, up from 63% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Its adjusted net income, in turn, soared 116% to $364 million, or $0.43 per share. That was well above Wall Street's estimates for adjusted per-share profits of $0.39.
Now what
For the fourth quarter, management expects:
Net revenue of approximately $1.3 billion, representing growth of 63%
Adjusted gross margin of roughly 65%
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.45 to $0.51
Peering further ahead, Murphy sees a promising future for the semiconductor leader.
""While we have been delivering strong results for multiple quarters, we are confident that we are still in the early stages of a sustained high-growth period for Marvell, and we are looking forward to reaping the benefits of the investments we have made in our business over the last few years,"" he said.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).

Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (NASDAQ:OLLI) stock is seeing a poor showing on Friday thanks to the release of its earnings report for the third quarter of 2021.
Source: George Sheldon / Shutterstock.com
The bad news for investors in OLLI stock starts with the retail company’s adjusted earnings per share of 34 cents. That’s a hefty miss next to Wall Street’s adjusted EPS estimate of 47 cents. It’s also a drop from the 65 cents per share reported in Q3 2020.
Adding to OLLI stock’s woes is the retailer’s revenue of $383.5 million. That’s another hit to the discount store when compared to analysts’ estimate of $410.1 million. It also represents a 7.5% fall in revenue year-over-year.
As if things weren’t bad enough, Ollie’s Bargain Outlet also includes guidance for 2021 in its Q3 earnings report. This has it expecting adjusted EPS between $2.30 and $2.35 on revenue of $1.762 billion to $1.772 billion. Neither of those would reach Wall Street’s 2021 adjusted EPS or revenue estimates of $2.75 or $1.84 billion, respectively.

John Swygert, president and CEO of Ollie’s Bargain Outlet, said the following in the earnings report beating OLLI stock down today.
“Our third quarter performance was impacted by greater than anticipated supply chain related headwinds, leading to lower than expected results. While we believe that many of the factors impacting us are transitory in nature and we are taking proactive steps to navigate these challenges, these pressures have continued to impact our business in the fourth quarter.”
To go along with the dismal earnings report, several analysts weighed in on OLLI stock today. Many of them downgraded the stock and cut prices targets after its poor performance during the period.
OLLI stock is down 20.8% as of Friday morning and is down 39.1% since the start of the year.

Futures markets pointed to a relatively flat open after four days of huge swings. Futures contracts on the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) were up just 6 points to 15,995 in a sign of the relative calm on Wall Street on the last day of what's been a crazy week.
However, hiding in plain sight under the index's mild move were two stocks seeing violent swings. DocuSign (NASDAQ: DOCU) investors were awash in share-price losses following the electronic document management specialist's latest financial report, while shareholders in Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) were having big celebrations. Below, we'll look at both reports to see whether they have any clues about when the Nasdaq's market volatility might come to an end.
DocuSign gets executed
Shares of DocuSign were plunging Friday morning, down more than 31% in premarket trading just after 8 a.m. ET. The company that has become the go-to provider for electronic signature services signaled that the factors that produced its immense growth might be ending, and that shocked investors who had thought that the good times could last longer.
Image source: DocuSign.
To be clear, DocuSign's numbers were still impressive. Total sales were up 42% year over year, with subscription revenue rising 44% from year-ago levels. Gross margin levels improved dramatically, rising 5 percentage points to 79%, and adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share were more than 150% higher than they were in the same period a year ago.
However, DocuSign's guidance wasn't all that encouraging. Projections for fourth-quarter revenue were only a few percent higher than the company's actual third-quarter results, showing an expectation for slowing growth. Some investors weren't happy with billings projections either, especially as third-quarter numbers had gone up only 28%.
CEO Dan Springer had a simple warning for DocuSign shareholders, noting, ""we saw customers return to more normalized buying patterns."" If that trend continues, some fear that DocuSign won't be able to keep up the momentum it built during the first year of the pandemic, and today's plunge could be just the beginning of a larger reversal of fortune for the stock.
Shareholders marvel(l) at a rising stock
On the other side of the coin, shares of Marvell Technology jumped more than 22% in premarket trading Friday. The semiconductor company's third-quarter financial results gave investors just about everything they had hoped to see.
Marvell's revenue hit a new record of $1.21 billion, soaring 61% from the year-ago period. The company's data center segment did especially well, seeing sales more than double year over year. Marvell's small but fast-growing automotive and industrial unit also saw massive gains from year-ago levels, and its enterprise networking segment also managed to produce outsize sales growth of 56%.
The semiconductor company's bottom-line numbers were also favorable. Adjusted net income of $364 million was more than twice the $168 million it posted in the third quarter last year. Even with a big jump in outstanding share counts, Marvell's earnings of $0.43 per share were up more than 70% on an adjusted basis.
Marvell also gave plenty of positive guidance, calling for fourth-quarter revenue to rise almost 10% to $1.32 billion and similar gains in earnings to $0.48 per share. That's exactly what investors wanted to hear from the chipmaker, and it bodes well for the stock heading into 2022.
Expect more bumps in the road
Investors want growth, and they have high expectations for it. Companies like Marvell that make the grade can still get big rewards in the market. Companies that fall short, like DocuSign, are getting punished. As long as that continues, the Nasdaq is likely to remain volatile.

U.S. stock futures were little changed in early morning trading Friday ahead of this week’s key economic report. The Labor Department is expected to release the November jobs report at 8.30 a.m. ET. Investors are expecting to see solid jobs growth last month. In particular, economists surveyed by Dow Jones predicting 581,000 jobs added in November. This is likely to be the key focus in the stock market today. After all, investors continue to look for clues as to whether the Fed will increase the pace of its tapering this month.
Meanwhile, Southeast Asia’s largest ride-hailing company Grab (NASDAQ: GRAB) lost one-fifth of its value following its public debt on Thursday. The shares of the ride-hailing and delivery company initially soared. But they then reversed course to close at $8.75 per share on Thursday’s trading. This came after the completion of Grab’s merger with special purpose acquisition company Altimeter Growth Capital. 
Elsewhere, the Senate passed a short-term government funding bill on Thursday night to prevent a government shutdown. Amid a roller-coaster week driven by the Omicron variant, a government shutdown is the last thing investors need to have on their plate. As of 7:17 a.m. ET, the Dow up 0.03%, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures are declining by 0.01%, and 0.03% respectively.
Didi To Delist From The New York Stock Exchange, Plans Hong Kong IPO
Chinese ride-hailing giant DiDi Global (NYSE: DIDI) said it will commence its delisting from the New York Stock Exchange, and make plans to list in Hong Kong instead. Didi’s announcement comes less than 24 hours after the Securities and Exchange Commission finalized rules that allow it delist foreign stocks for failing to meet audit requirements. If anything, this shows that Chinese companies are no longer comfortable with the U.S. as a jurisdiction for their high tech companies because of the regulatory scrutiny and data security issues.
This marks the first high profile Chinese company to exit from the world’s largest stock market five months after the Chinese regulators’ probe into the company. The company pushed ahead with its $4.4 billion IPO plan earlier in June. That’s despite being asked to put it on hold while a review of its data practice was conducted. Following this piece of news, some investors may also wonder if other Chinese tech stocks would follow the same route. For all that, it will also likely discourage other Chinese firms from listing in the U.S. stock market. In the meantime, the likes of Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) could continue to face pressure in the stock market today.
“Didi’s plan to delist in the United States and the listing of Hong Kong stocks I believe will have an obvious impact on location decisions for large technology stocks’ future listings,” said Kenny Ng, securities strategist at Everbright Sun Hung Kai in Hong Kong.

Marvell Technology (MRVL) Stock Surges After Earnings & Outlook Beat
Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) is skyrocketing in pre-market trading today. This came after the chip maker delivered better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. In its fiscal third quarter, revenue came in 61% higher from the same period last year to $1.21 billion. Its earnings per share (EPS) was $0.43 on $1.21 billion. That topped Wall Street’s estimates of $0.38 on revenue of $1.15 billion. But what’s really driving the stock price higher is the upbeat fourth quarter outlook on 5G.
“For the fourth quarter, we are expecting sequential revenue growth of 9 percent at the midpoint of guidance, led by 5G, which is projected to increase by 30 percent sequentially and data center which is forecasted to continue to grow in the double digits on a percentage basis,” the company said.
There’s no doubt that the booming demand for semiconductors used in data centers, 5G wireless networks and other industries has supercharged the company’s top and bottom lines. Given these tailwinds, it shouldn’t come as a surprise why analysts are upgrading MRVL stock. On Wednesday, Susquehanna Bancshares raised its price target to $82 ahead of its earnings. That came as the investment firm sees continued strength in the data centers and 5G space. Considering Marvell’s partnerships with 5G heavyweights Nokia (NYSE: NOK) and Samsung, these should pave the way for the company to tap into a fast-growing opportunity. With that in mind, it becomes easier to see why Marvell could be looking at long-term growth ahead.

DocuSign (DOCU) Stock Plunge As Pandemic Boom Appears To Fade 
E-signature software company DocuSign (NASDAQ: DOCU) just reported its sixth straight period of revenue growth in excess of 40%. Despite the impressive beat, DOCU stock is trading lower in the pre-market trading today. After all, investors appear to be more concerned about what lies ahead. For the fiscal fourth quarter, growth is expected to come in at around 30%. CEO Dan Springer acknowledged that as a disappointment. This came after “exceptionally high growth rates at scale” during the first half of 2020.
“Third quarter revenue growth of 42% year-over-year and operating margin of 22% exceeded our expectations. After six quarters of accelerated growth, we saw customers return to more normalized buying patterns, resulting in 28% year-over-year billings growth,” said Dan Springer, CEO of DocuSign. 
Like it or not, the remote and hybrid working trend is likely to continue in the coming quarters. This comes as the discovery of Omicron prompts fears of renewed lockdowns and travel restrictions. And that could drive demand for DocuSign’s software tools which help organizations sign and manage agreements digitally, instead of physically. No doubt, DOCU stock may be facing some headwinds today. But patient investors who believe in the future of digital signatures and the automating of the agreement process might want to consider buying on dips.

Before the market opens, we have Hibbett Sports (NASDAQ: HIBB), Big Lots (NYSE: BIG), and Bank of Montreal (NYSE: BMO) reporting their earnings. So, whether it is looking at the jobs report, keeping up with Didi’s delisting, or following the barrack of earnings, there is enough to keep you occupied as we wrap up the week.

The company is set to announce its third-quarter fiscal 2022 (FQ3) results today, after market close.
Analyst Weighs In
Ahead of the print, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland looked into the company’s developments and drew some insights into how the Q3 could have been. He found it difficult to predict the performance of each segment because of the recent integrations of the acquired assets of Inphi, Avera, Aquantia, and Innovium.
Nonetheless, continued momentum in Enterprise, Cloud, Gaming, and 5G is expected to have provided an upside to the quarterly performance.
Moreover, strong demand at Samsung and Nokia (NOK) is expected to have been a positive driver. Additionally, the declining share of Huawei in the global 5G market spells good news for Marvell, which serves Huawei competitors Samsung, Nokia, and Ericsson (ERIC).
Rolland was upbeat about the near-term outlook of the company. “Looking forward, we expect Marvell’s 5nm OCTEON 10 DPUs to help sustain data center momentum through 2H and beyond,” he weighed in.
Overhangs Loom Large
Importantly, Rolland observed that worse-than-expected results of Western Digital, a key end customer of Marvell, are expected to have been an overhang on Marvell’s top line. However, another major end customer, Seagate, delivered solid quarterly results this earnings season, which is likely to have partially offset, if not balanced out, the impact from Western Digital.
Then again, weakness in the general PC market and historically conservative Street expectations for the fourth quarter pose as other weak points for the upcoming print.
Additionally, supply disruptions, which have crippled the chip market for some time now, still remain an overhang in the area of Networking. However, Rolland expects Marvell to have “secured enough wafers to at least meet the guide.""
The analyst reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, and raised the price target to $82 from $75. “Overall, we remain strong believers in the long-term growth story,” said Rolland.
Wall Street’s Take
The Wall Street analyst consensus is also quite optimistic about the company, with a Strong Buy rating based on 16 Buys and 6 Holds. The average Marvell price target of $82.28 indicates an upside potential of 15.97%.

2021-11-26 00:00:00+00:00,2 Explosive Growth Stocks That Are Worth Buying Despite Terrific Gains,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-explosive-growth-stocks-that-are-worth-buying-despite-terrific-gains,,,"Shares of Jabil (NYSE: JBL) and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) have delivered outstanding returns to investors in 2021 thanks to the robust growth in their top and bottom lines.
JBL data by YCharts
The impressive thing about these two stocks is that they are still worth buying despite their hot rally this year. That's because Jabil and Marvell could clock stronger gains thanks to a bunch of catalysts. What's more, their attractive valuations mean that investors who have missed the tremendous upside delivered by these two tech stocks won't have to pay through their noses to enjoy future gains.
Let's look at the reasons why you should consider buying Jabil and Marvell Technology.
1. Jabil
Jabil is a contract electronics manufacturer serving several end markets such as mobility, industrial and semiconductor capital equipment, wireless and cloud, automotive, networking and storage, and healthcare, among others. The company delivered $7.4 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 that ended on Aug. 31, 2021, along with adjusted earnings of $1.44 per share. Jabil recorded earnings of $0.98 per share in the year-ago period on $7.3 billion in revenue, indicating that its bottom line increased substantially thanks to fatter margins.
That's not surprising as Jabil remains laser-focused on expanding its core margins. The company delivered a core operating margin of 4.2% last quarter, which was 10 basis points ahead of expectations and an improvement of 70 basis points over the prior-year period. This indicates that Jabil's transition to a subscription-based model in the cloud business is paying off.

For the full year, Jabil had delivered $29.3 billion in revenue, an improvement of 7.4% over the previous year. Its adjusted earnings had jumped to $5.61 per share from $2.90 per share in fiscal 2020. More importantly, Jabil's momentum is expected to continue in fiscal 2022.
Analysts expect $6.36 per share in earnings from Jabil on revenue of $31.5 billion, which is in line with the company's guidance. So, Jabil's earnings are expected to increase by double-digit percentages once again this fiscal year, driven by an anticipated increase of 30 basis points in the company's core operating margin to 4.5%.
Jabil seems to be on track to hit those numbers as it anticipates $1.80 per share in earnings this quarter on $8.3 billion in revenue. However, don't be surprised to see Jabil boost its guidance as the year progresses as the demand for contract manufacturing remains robust in the markets it serves.
For instance, Jabil's revenue from the mobility business increased 27% in fiscal 2021 to $4.2 billion, while the connected devices business recorded a 12.5% increase in revenue to $4.5 billion. The impressive growth in these segments (which accounted for almost 30% of the total revenue) can be attributed to Jabil's relationship with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which produced 22% of the former's top line last fiscal year.
Jabil makes casings for iPhones and iPads, and its Apple relationship is going to be a key growth driver in the coming years. Apple is making a killing in the 5G smartphone market, witnessing solid growth in both shipments and pricing. The smartphone giant has a huge installed base of around 800 million users that are waiting to upgrade to a 5G device, which means that it is likely to crank up iPhone production in the coming years.
So, Jabil's largest customer could continue to move the needle in a big way for the company and may even help it grow at a faster pace. Finally, as Jabil stock is trading at just 14 times trailing earnings and 10 times forward earnings as compared to the S&P 500's average earnings multiple of 28.7, it seems worth buying given the strong pace of its earnings growth and the potential for delivering more upside.
2. Marvell Technology
The booming demand for semiconductors used in data centers, 5G wireless networks, and the automotive industry has supercharged Marvell Technology's top and bottom lines. That's evident from the 48% year-over-year revenue growth Marvell recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which ended on July 31, 2021.
The company's revenue of $1.07 billion was a record, and its adjusted earnings increased to $0.34 per share from $0.21 per share in the year-ago period. Marvell's outlook for the recently concluded fiscal third quarter indicates that its momentum is here to stay. The company's guidance calls for earnings of $0.38 per share on revenue of $1.14 billion at the midpoint. That points toward a massive year-over-year increase of 52% in the company's revenue and earnings.
Now, Marvell stock trades at 22 times trailing earnings despite the company reporting such solid growth in its top and bottom lines. This makes buying the stock right now a no-brainer, especially considering that its end markets are set for secular growth. For instance, the data center market that recorded $434 million revenue in Q2 and grew 62% year over year has a lot of room for growth because of fast-growing applications such as data center switches.
Marvell sees its overall serviceable addressable market (SAM) jumping to $30 billion in 2024 from $20 billion this year. The company's data center opportunity is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24% during this period, while the automotive and industrial markets are expected to record 28% CAGR. The cloud, automotive, and 5G markets together are expected to clock 20% CAGR through 2024.
These sizable end-market opportunities have encouraged Marvell to raise its long-term guidance. The company expects revenue to clock a CAGR of 15% to 20% in the long run, up from its prior estimate of 10% to 15% growth. Marvell also anticipates improved profitability as it forecasts an operating margin of 38% to 40% in the long run, which is an improvement over the earlier estimate of 35%.
Given these tailwinds, it is not surprising to see why analysts expect Marvell's earnings to clock an annual growth rate of 38% for the next five years. As such, Marvell Technology is a top growth stock to buy right now given its attractive valuation, rapidly improving revenue and earnings and impressive long-term prospects.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.
