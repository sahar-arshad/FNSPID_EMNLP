NEW YORK, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Treasury yields fell on Wednesday after Federal Reserve officials steered clear of tightening monetary conditions anytime soon despite expectations of higher inflation, while stocks and the dollar edged higher.
The U.S. benchmark yield was on track to post its first full-session decline in 2021, even as a jump in gasoline prices pushed inflation higher last month. Consumer prices are expected to run hotter in a couple of months when March and April of 2020, which saw very low inflation, fall off the yearly reading.
Several Fed policymakers pushed back against the idea of the Fed tapering its asset purchases any time soon, however.
The climb in yields is expected to resume, partly due to a massive stimulus package from the incoming administration of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20.

The U.S. dollar index rose for the fourth time in five sessions, still not far from near three-year lows hit last week.
The greenback has found support from expectations of a continued economic recovery in the United States, even as countries in Europe resort to lockdowns to fend off a second COVID-19 wave.

Jan 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index closed slightly higher on Wednesday with defensive sectors leading gains as investors waited for details of the next U.S. fiscal stimulus plan and Congress began President Donald Trump's impeachment hearings.
U.S. Treasury yields pulled back after rising for six straight sessions, giving a boost to rate-sensitive defensive sectors such as utilities .SPlRCU and real estate .SPLRCR, while economically sensitive cyclical sectors lagged.
Intel Corp INTC.O advanced quickly, after the chipmaker said it would replace its Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan with VMware Inc VMW.N CEO Pat Gelsinger next month.
Wall Street's main indexes had hit record highs last week on expectations for a hefty COVID-19 relief package even as an attack on Capitol Hill ramped up political uncertainty.
But a day before details of incoming President Joe Biden's fiscal relief plan was due to be announced, investors appeared to pull to the sidelines.
""Investors have been for some time looking to the second half of 2021. They continue to hope for a real reopening,"" said Mona Mahajan, U.S. Investment Strategist, Allianz Global Investors, New York.
Referring to the Treasury yield decline, Mahajan said: ""A day like today is probably natural after a long run. Some of the laggard (stock sectors) are leading.""
As U.S. House of Representatives gathered to consider a second impeachment for Trump after the Capitol invasion by his supporters which left five dead, some investors were watching to see whether impeachment could delay stimulus or other parts of in-coming President Joe Biden's agenda.
""The headlines coming in are causing some near term jitters but it looks like investors are looking past that to the rest of the year,"" said Shawn Cruz, senior market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey.
While utilities and real estate lead percentage gains among the 11 major S&P sectors during the session the biggest losers were the more economically sensitive sectors such as materials .SPLRCM and industrials .SPLRCI.
""Investors are in wait-and-see mode for now ... if you're moving to the sidelines you probably might want to be moving out of cyclicals,"" said Cruz.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 8.22 points, or 0.03%, to 31,060.47, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.65 points, or 0.23%, to 3,809.84 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 56.52 points, or 0.43%, to 13,128.95.
The S&P had expanded its gains temporarily in the late afternoon before losing ground again after the Federal Reserve released its ""Beige Book"" report which showed U.S. economic activity increasing modestly in recent weeks as employment dropped in a growing number of Fed districts due to a surge in coronavirus infections.
Most of the 11 major S&P sectors gained ground. After boasting a record closing high in the previous day's session, the Russell 2000 .RUT pulled back slightly and the S&P growth index .IGX outperformed the value index .IVX.
Earnings reports from big U.S. banks including JPMorgan JPM.N and Citigroup C.N were also on investors minds as they will mark the unofficial start to the fourth-quarter earnings season on Friday.
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's REGN.O shares climbed as the U.S. government said it would buy 1.25 million additional doses of its COVID-19 antibody cocktail for about $2.63 billion. Shares of VMware fell after the Intel news.

Jan 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street's three major indexes were advancing slightly after Wednesday's choppy morning session as investors appeared to be taking a wait-and-see approach while Congress began impeachment hearings.
Intel Corp INTC.O was the S&P's biggest percentage gainer, up more than 7%, after the chipmaker announced the replacement of its Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan with VMware Inc VMW.N CEO Pat Gelsinger next month.
The S&P added to gains later in the afternoon right after the Federal Reserve released its ""Beige Book"" report. It, however, showed U.S. economic activity increasing modestly in recent weeks as employment dropped in a growing number of Fed districts due to a surge in coronavirus infections.
Wall Street's main indexes had hit record highs last week on expectations for a hefty COVID-19 relief package even as an attack on Capitol Hill ramped up political uncertainty.
As U.S. House of Representatives gathered to consider a second impeachment for President Donald Trump after the Capitol invasion by his supporters which left five dead, some investors worried that was whether impeachment could delay stimulus or other parts of in-coming President Joe Biden's agenda.
""The headlines coming in are causing some near term jitters but it looks like investors are looking past that to the rest of the year,"" said Shawn Cruz, senior market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey.
While defensive sectors such as utilities .SPLRCU and real estate .SPLRCR were leading percentage gains among the 11 major S&P sectors, the biggest losers were the more economically sensitive cyclical sectors such as materials .SPLRCM and industrials .SPLRCI.
""Investors are in wait-and-see mode for now ... if you're moving to the sidelines you probably might want to be moving out of cyclicals,"" said Cruz.
By 2:29 p.m. ET (1929 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 72.19 points, or 0.23%, to 31,140.88, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 18.68 points, or 0.49%, to 3,819.87 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 93.67 points, or 0.72%, to 13,166.11.
Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were gaining ground. After boasting a record closing high in the previous day's session, the Russell 2000 .RUT pulled back slightly and gains in the S&P growth index .IGX outperformed the value index .IVX.
David Spika, president of GuideStone Capital Management in Dallas, Texas cited concerns about extremely high valuations and slower than expected vaccine rollouts.
""The expectation is that we'll have a significant increase in earnings and economic growth in 2021, but both are really dependent the vaccine,"" he said.
Earnings reports from big U.S. banks including JPMorgan JPM.N and Citigroup C.N will mark the unofficial start to the fourth-quarter earnings season on Friday.
Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N rose 1.7% after J.P. Morgan upgraded the stock to ""overweight,"" saying cuts in capital spending had put the oil major on track for a stronger performance.
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O climbed 1.3% as the U.S. government said it would buy 1.25 million additional doses of its COVID-19 antibody cocktail for about $2.63 billion.
Shares of VMware fell 7.6% after the Intel news.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 43 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 239 new highs and three new lows.

2021-01-13 00:00:00+00:00,Intel CEO Switch Means Better Days Ahead for INTC Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-ceo-switch-means-better-days-ahead-for-intc-stock-2021-01-13,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Struggling semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced on Wednesday that its CEO Bob Swan would be stepping down effective Feb. 15, and will be replaced by VMWare (NASDAQ:VMW) CEO and former Intel CTO Pat Gelsinger. INTC stock rose more than 7% on the news.
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
The positive INTC stock price reaction makes sense. The CEO switch broadly means that better days are ahead for Intel. Why?
In short, because Swan was a financial guy who wasn’t pushing hard enough on technological innovation and engineering advancements. Geslinger is the exact opposite. He’s an electrical engineer by training who will put the focus back on making Intel the world’s most technologically advanced chipmaker — a title Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have stolen from Intel over the past few years.
With technology back in the driver’s seat, Intel should be able to finally punch back against rising competition, and leverage its unmatched resources to defend its leading CPU market share.
As that happens over the next few years, Intel’s growth trajectory will meaningfully improve. Revenues and profits will start moving higher — not lower. And INTC stock will also start moving higher — not lower.
7 Potential IPOs in 2021 That Could Build Out Your Portfolio
Here’s a deeper look:
Intel Stock: The Right Move
Intel swapping out Swan for Gelsinger is the right move for the struggling semiconductor giant.
Bob Swan is not an engineer. He’s a money guy. He has a Business degree from Buffalo. He’s forever worked in CFO roles. Indeed, before becoming the CEO at Intel, he was the company’s CFO.
There’s nothing wrong with that, per se. But Intel doesn’t need a CFO as its chief man today. Instead, the company needs a CTO. That’s because Swan — while really good at financial engineering, controlling budgets, and preserving margins —  is somewhat “shooting in the dark” when it comes to CPU innovation. This is partially — though not entirely — why Intel has fallen behind AMD in terms of next-gen chip production over the past few years.
What’s the fix?
Push out the money guy. Bring in an engineer. And that’s exactly what Intel is doing.
Gelsinger, unlike Swan, is not a money guy. He’s an electrical engineer by training, with a Master’s in Electrical Engineering from Stanford. He worked at Intel for thirty years throughout the 1980s, 90s and 2000s — and even became the company’s first CTO in 2000.
Under Geslinger’s leadership, Intel will shift its focus back to CPU innovation. That’s a move that could provide a significant lift for INTC stock over the next few years.
Ready to Punch Back
A big part of the bull thesis on INTC stock has been that — whenever this company does finally get it’s act together and push forward on innovation — there is enough firepower here to deliver a big blow to competitors.
Per data from YCharts, Intel has over $18 billion in cash and short-term investment on its balance sheet. Nvidia has about $10 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet. AMD has less than $2 billion. Thus, Intel has more cash than Nvidia and AMD combined to deploy at CPU innovation.
Even further, Intel has over 110,000 employees on its payroll, most of whom are engineers. Nvidia has about 14,000 employees, and AMD has about 11,000 employees (all as of December 2019). So, Intel has more engineering prowess and manpower than Nvidia and AMD combined to deploy at CPU innovation.
In other words, despite its struggles over the past few years, Intel is still the unmatched 400-pound-gorilla in the CPU space.
This gorilla has been laying dormant for years. But, the change in leadership to the former CTO of Intel could “wake up” the gorilla. If so, the potential implications for INTC stock over the next few years are enormous.
Intel Stock Is Undervalued
Intel stock has been persistently cheap for the past several years because the lack of CPU innovation has resulted in sluggish growth trends, which have kept investors on the sidelines.
This set-up positions INTC stock nicely for a multi-year breakout.
A renewed focus on CPU innovation should reinvigorate the Intel growth machine. Sluggish growth trends will reverse course. Flattish revenue growth will turn into 3% to 5% revenue growth. Declining margins will turn into expanding margins. Anemic profit growth will turn into big profit growth.
As all that happens, sell-side earnings estimates will move significantly higher. Just look at where 2022 earnings estimates are today ($4.42) versus where they were a year ago ($6). Clearly, there’s a lot of runway to EPS estimates to regain lost ground.
At the same time, investors will grow increasingly confident on Intel’s long-term growth narrative. The stock’s multiple will meaningfully expand. There is a lot of runway for meaningful expansion here, too. The current trailing earnings multiple (10.5) is almost 30% below the stock’s five-year-average trailing earnings multiple (14.5).
Big earnings growth plus big multiple expansion equals big gains in the INTC stock price. It’s a winning recipe which should underscore continued strength in Intel stock throughout 2021-22.
Bottom Line on INTC Stock
Intel stock has been a dud for several years. New leadership could change that. If it does, the potential upside in still dirt-cheap INTC stock is pretty sizable.

Intel to replace CEO
Chip giant Intel has fallen behind competitors on multiple fronts. The company has watched as rival Advanced Micro Devices staged a comeback, stealing share in the desktop, laptop, and server CPU markets. Manufacturing stumbles have been part of the problem: Intel has faced chronic delays, and the company no longer has any sort of technological edge over third-party foundries.
Intel announced on Wednesday that CEO Bob Swan was stepping down effective Feb. 15. Swan will be replaced by Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO of virtualization software provider VMware. This move comes just weeks after activist investor Daniel Loeb called for Intel to make big changes, including potentially spinning off its manufacturing operations.
Intel said the CEO change was unrelated to the company's 2020 financial performance. The company also said that it expects to exceed its guidance for fourth-quarter revenue and earnings per share and that it will provide an update on its delayed 7nm process technology when it reports its results on Jan. 21.
The management shuffle was welcomed by investors, who sent the stock up about 7.5% by early Wednesday afternoon. Intel stock has languished over the past year due to a variety of factors, including the manufacturing stumbles, a resurgent AMD, and the prospect of ARM-based server chips going mainstream, driven by the pending acquisition of ARM Holdings by NVIDIA.
Even factoring in Wednesday's rally, Intel stock is still down slightly over the past year.
Visa gives up on acquiring Plaid
Credit card giant Visa has abandoned its efforts to acquire fintech company Plaid. Visa announced on Tuesday that the two companies had mutually agreed to terminate the merger agreement. Visa originally announced the $5.3 billion deal in January of 2020.
The U.S. Department of Justice sued to block Visa's acquisition of Plaid in November, filing a civil antitrust suit alleging that Visa was making the acquisition to protect its lucrative debit business. The DOJ said that Plaid was developing a payments platform that would challenge Visa's debit monopoly and that Visa was trying to buy the company to eliminate a potential competitive threat.
Plaid allows apps to connect to consumers' bank accounts. The company's technology powers many fintech apps, making it a leading financial data-aggregation company. The DOJ's lawsuit contends that a money-movement platform offered by Plaid could leverage its existing technology and bank account connections and allow it to disrupt Visa's monopoly.
Visa believes it would have prevailed in court, but the company said it was dropping the effort because a ""protracted and complex litigation will likely take substantial time to fully resolve.""
Shares of Visa were up about 0.8% by early Wednesday afternoon. While investors don't seem to mind that the acquisition fell apart, an eventual disruption of Visa's debit business could hurt the stock down the road.

2021-01-13 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel Names Pat Gelsinger CEO, Sees Q4 Results To Exceed Prior View; Stock Up",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-names-pat-gelsinger-ceo-sees-q4-results-to-exceed-prior-view-stock-up-2021-01-13,,,"(RTTNews) - Intel (INTC) said that it has appointed Pat Gelsinger as its new chief executive officer, effective February 15, 2021. The company expects to exceed its prior earnings per share and revenue guidance for fourth-quarter 2020.
In Wednesday regular trading, INTC was trading at $58.03, up $4.79 or 9.00 percent.
Intel noted that Gelsinger will also join its board, upon assuming the CEO role. He will succeed Bob Swan, who will remain CEO until February 15.
Most recently, Gelsinger served as the CEO of VMware since 2012. Before joining to VMware, Gelsinger was president and chief operating officer of EMC Information Infrastructure Products at EMC. Prior to joining EMC, he spent 30 years at Intel, becoming the company's first chief technology officer and driving the creation of key industry technologies such as USB and Wi-Fi.
Intel expects its fourth-quarter 2020 earnings per share and revenue to exceed its prior guidance. Previously, the company expected adjusted earnings of around $1.10 per share and revenues of about $17.4 billion for the fourth-quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to report earnings of $1.10 per share and revenues of $17.44 billion for the fourth-quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items.
In addition, the company said it has made strong progress on its 7nm process technology and plans on providing an update when it reports its full fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 results as previously scheduled on January 21, 2021.

2021-01-13 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Launches Powerful New Laptop Chips,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-launches-powerful-new-laptop-chips-2021-01-13,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) made a splash in the laptop market last year with its Ryzen 4000 Mobile line of processors. The chips were built on the company's Zen 2 architecture and Taiwan Semiconductor's 7nm manufacturing process, providing exceptional performance and effectively competing with products from chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
Once a significant number of laptops were available, AMD's market share jumped. AMD's chips were in 20.2% of laptops sold in the third quarter of 2020, according to Mercury Research as reported by Tom's Hardware, up from 14.7% for the same period in 2019.
At the CES 2021 technology trade show on Tuesday, AMD announced the next iteration of its Ryzen laptop processors. The Ryzen 5000 Mobile series uses the company's latest Zen 3 architecture, the same architecture used for AMD's most recent desktop chips. The new chips use the same 7nm manufacturing process as their predecessors, so the leap in performance will likely be smaller this time around.
Image source: AMD.
Double-digit improvements
AMD's Ryzen 5000 Mobile family features 13 processors. Interestingly, the two lowest-end chips are built on AMD's previous Zen 2 architecture, likely to keep costs down. The lowest-end Zen 3 processor is the 6-core, 12-thread Ryzen 5 5600U, while the top-tier processor is the 8-core, 16-thread Ryzen 9 5980HX.
Processors with the HX designation are aimed at gamers and creators. AMD claims that the Ryzen 9 5980HX processor provides up to 23% higher single-threaded performance and up to 17% higher multi-threaded performance than the last-gen Ryzen 9 4900H processor.
Below the HX series in terms of performance is the H series, with those processors using a bit less power and featuring lower clock speeds. The HS series brings power consumption down even more, and the U series targets laptops where efficiency and battery life are just as important as raw performance.
AMD is making big promises for these U-series chips. The company claims the Ryzen 5800U, an 8-core chip that should find its way into some higher-end ultra-portables, provides 16% better single-threaded performance and 14% better multi-threaded performance than the last-gen Ryzen 7 4800U. Battery life should also be solid, with up to 17.5 hours of general-usage battery life and up to 21 hours of movie playback.
Devices coming soon
AMD expects the first Ryzen 5000 Mobile notebooks to be available sometime in the first quarter, with over 150 notebooks expected to launch in 2021 featuring the new chips.
Unlike the desktop CPU market where AMD can sell its chips to those who build their own PCs, the laptop market requires AMD to convince original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to design systems around its chips. While AMD's products have caught up to Intel in terms of performance, Intel chips still power around 80% of laptops sold. For consumers who don't follow the industry and know little about technology, buying an Intel-based laptop is the path of least resistance.
Intel unveiled some new laptop processors of its own in recent days. Intel's Tiger Lake-H series won't compete with AMD's best. Instead, the processors will power devices that aim to provide decent gaming performance along with good battery life. More powerful Tiger Lake laptop processors from Intel aren't yet available.
AMD should continue to gain market share this year, but how much it gains depends on the degree OEMs embrace its products. Intel is having no problem selling laptop chips amid the pandemic -- volumes were up 25% year over year for the company in the third quarter. AMD will have to overcome Intel's inertia in the laptop market, which will be easier said than done.
Market share gains won't necessarily translate into a higher stock price for AMD. Shares of AMD are historically expensive after a strong performance in 2020, with the stock trading for well over 100 times earnings. While AMD the company will likely do well this year, AMD the stock is another story.

2021-01-13 00:00:00+00:00,These 2 Comeback Stocks Are Leading the Nasdaq Higher Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-2-comeback-stocks-are-leading-the-nasdaq-higher-today-2021-01-13,,,"2021 has gotten off to a solid start on Wall Street, and the good times continued for the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) on Wednesday morning. As of 10:45 a.m. EST, the Nasdaq was up almost half a percent, with many believing that the index will soon challenge its all-time highs from late last week.
For a long time now, it's been the high-growth leaders of the Nasdaq that have helped power the entire stock market higher. That's left value investors in the dust, wondering if beaten-down stocks would ever have their heyday. Well, at least on Wednesday, market participants are looking closely at some companies that have been on the outs lately. What they're seeing has the stocks moving higher. Let's look more closely at what's pushing Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) upward after a long period of lagging performance.
Intel makes a change
Intel has been a big laggard in the Nasdaq recently. The chipmaker saw its stock drop 17% in 2020, even as most tech giants were adding to impressive gains.
That all changed on Wednesday morning. Intel is up more than 8%, bringing its year-to-date gains to more than 15% for 2021.
Image source: Getty Images.
The catalyst for today's jump was a major change in Intel's leadership. CEO Bob Swan will step down from his role as of Feb. 15, giving way to VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger to take his place at Intel. Investors appear to be excited about Gelsinger's prospects to help Intel recover, given that he's spent 30 years working for the semiconductor giant.
Moreover, Intel gave preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter. The company said it sees sales and earnings per share exceeding the guidance it gave in late October. In addition, Intel is making progress in its efforts to move forward with 7nm chip manufacturing technology, which will be crucial for its future prospects.
Investors have waited a long time for Intel to assert its leadership role in semiconductors, and the company has let its rivals catch up and even surpass it. Now, though, shareholders are hopeful that Intel will get back to the position it once had, commanding the tech industry and joining other big-name tech stocks at the top of the performance charts.
Nikola makes a deal
Shares of Nikola jumped another 12% on Wednesday morning. That added to gains from earlier in the week as investors hope that the electric truck specialist can regain its momentum after a disastrous 2020 that saw the stock drop more than 80% from its highs.
Nikola has gotten an electric rate schedule approved in Arizona that will help it build out its hydrogen-based fuel infrastructure in the state. Specifically, Nikola is targeting the Interstate 10 route between Phoenix and Los Angeles, which has heavy commercial-truck traffic.
That follows in the footsteps of a share-price surge Tuesday following Plug Power's (NASDAQ: PLUG) deal to build out similar infrastructure for light commercial truck use in Europe. Investors in Nikola were pleased to see that a rival's similar plans were gaining traction elsewhere, and they're hopeful that Nikola can stake its claim to share in the growth of the broader industry.
Nikola has to recover from reputational damage last year, which led to the withdrawal of its planned Badger electric pickup truck and the departure of founder Trevor Milton. Going forward, CEO Mark Russell is hopeful that Nikola can participate in the fast-growing market for electric vehicles and hydrogen-fueled power solutions -- and shareholders are increasingly optimistic.

Jan 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes slipped on Wednesday as investors digested a recent run to record highs on hopes of new fiscal package and vaccine rollouts for the coronavirus-ravaged economy, while Intel shares jumped on executive change.
The chipmaker INTC.O said it would replace Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan with VMware Inc VMW.N CEO Pat Gelsinger next month. Its shares gained 7.5% to touch a six-month high.
Shares of VMware slumped 5.5%.
Expectations of a hefty COVID-19 relief package under the incoming Joe Biden administration and hopes of a rebound in corporate earnings this year have eclipsed concerns over signs that the labor market recovery has stalled amid rampant COVID-19 infections.
""The market has discounted the rise in (COVID-19) cases and is really focused on what things look like in the second half of 2020, when vaccines have been widely distributed and the more impaired sectors of the economy are up and running again,"" said Dan Eye, head of asset allocation and equity research at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
""Valuations are stretched in a lot of segments within tech and growth. But that's not the case with a lot of value sectors such as financials, energy ... things are set up very well for continuation of the rotation into value.""
Five of the 11 major S&P sectors rose in early trading with real estate .SPLRCR and utilities .SPLRCU up more than 0.5%.
Investors are watching events in Washington, where the U.S. House of Representatives gathered to consider impeaching President Donald Trump for his role in an assault on American democracy that stunned the nation and left five dead.
U.S. Federal Reserve officials on Tuesday said that concerns about continued violence pose a risk, but the transition to a new administration on Jan. 20 and a likely accelerating vaccine rollout have left them optimistic.
The new Senate will take up further COVID-19 relief legislation as soon as Democrats take control of the chamber, U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer assured on Tuesday.
At 10:08 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 41.68 points, or 0.13%, to 31,027.01, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 4.88 points, or 0.13%, to 3,796.31 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC gained 0.57 points, or 0.01%, to 13,073.19.
Earnings reports from big U.S. banks including JPMorgan JPM.N and Citigroup C.N will mark the unofficial start to the fourth-quarter earnings season later this week. Investors will gauge remarks from executives for clues on corporate America's health.
General Motors Co GM.N added another 2% on top of Tuesday's 6% jump after the automaker announced its entry into the growing electric delivery vehicle business.
Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N rose 0.3% after J.P. Morgan upgraded the stock to ""overweight"", saying cuts in capital spending had put the oil major on track for a stronger performance.
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN.O climbed 1.5% as the U.S. government said it would buy 1.25 million additional doses of the company's COVID-19 antibody cocktail for about $2.63 billion.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.2-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.4-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P 500 posted 33 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 262 new highs and four new lows.

AMD dazzled investors with robust sales of its CPUs and GPUs. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, benefited from soaring orders for new chips.
Both companies profited from Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) misfortunes. Intel's chip shortage, which was caused by a difficult jump from 14nm to 10nm chips, caused PC makers to buy more AMD chips.
Intel's own foundry also fell behind TSMC in the ""process race"" to create smaller and more power-efficient chips. That failure allowed AMD, which outsources its chip production to TSMC, to produce more advanced chips.

That's why AMD and TSMC both easily outperformed Intel, which lost more than 10% of its value over the past 12 months, as well as the benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which advanced nearly 60%. Let's take a fresh look at both chipmakers to see which stock is the better buy.
The differences between AMD and TSMC
AMD is a fabless chipmaker that doesn't manufacture its own chips like Intel. It develops x86 CPUs for PCs and servers, GPUs, and other types of custom chips, but a foundry like TSMC manufactures the chips.
AMD competes against Intel in the x86 CPU market and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the discrete GPU market. AMD controlled 39.8% of the x86 CPU market in the first quarter of 2021, according to PassMark, up from 33.2% a year ago. Intel's share tumbled from 66.7% to 60.2%.
AMD faces a tougher battle against NVIDIA. Its share of the add-in GPU board market dipped from 27% to 23% between the third quarters of 2019 and 2020, according to a report from Jon Peddie Research. NVIDIA's share of the market grew from 73% to 77%. AMD also produces CPUs and custom GPUs for Sony and Microsoft's latest gaming consoles.
TSMC produces chips for many other customers besides AMD, including Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Qualcomm, and NVIDIA. Last quarter, it generated 46% of its revenue from smartphone chips, 37% from HPC (high-performance computing) chips, 9% from Internet of Things (IoT) chips, and the rest from other markets.
In terms of process, 35% of TSMC's revenue came from its current-gen 7nm node. Another 8% came from its next-gen 5nm chips, which just entered mass production last year. The rest of TSMC's revenue came from older chips.
TSMC's only meaningful competitor in the high-end foundry market is Samsung, which also started producing 5nm chips last year. In the low-end market, it competes against smaller and less advanced rivals like GlobalFoundries and UMC.
Which chipmaker is growing faster?
AMD's revenue rose 4% in fiscal 2019 as its adjusted earnings grew 39%. In the first nine months of 2020, its revenue surged 42% year over year -- with 47% growth in its computing and graphics business and 31% growth in its enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (EESC) business -- and its adjusted earnings soared 141%.

AMD attributed that growth to robust sales of its Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs in its computing and graphics segment, with remote work and stay-at-home trends sparking sales of new PCs, and healthy demand for its EPYC data center chips in the EESC segment.
Analysts expect AMD's revenue and earnings to rise 42% and 92%, respectively, for the full year. Next year, they expect its revenue and earnings to grow 27% and 47%, respectively.
AMD might face tougher year-over-year comparisons after the pandemic passes, but the underlying tailwinds remain strong. Strong sales of the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S consoles could also boost its EESC revenue and offset a slowdown in its PC-oriented CPU and GPU businesses.
TSMC's revenue rose 4% in fiscal 2019, but its earnings dipped 2% as it grappled with a slowdown in the saturated smartphone market. It also got off to a rough start in 2020 as the pandemic disrupted the production of chips for smartphones and connected cars. New restrictions against the Chinese tech giant Huawei, which relied on TSMC to produce its in-house chips, exacerbated the pain.
Despite all those challenges, TSMC's revenue still rose 30% year over year in the first nine months of 2020 as orders from top customers like Apple and Qualcomm flowed in, and its earnings surged 64%. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 36% and 60%, respectively, for the full year.
Next year, analysts expect TSMC's revenue and earnings to rise 16% and 12%, respectively, as those orders cool off. However, new orders from Apple, which is replacing Intel's CPUs with its own TSMC-produced chips; the growth of the HPC market; and even outsourced orders from Intel could help it top analysts' expectations next year.
The better buy: AMD
AMD and TSMC are still both great long-term investments on the semiconductor market. But AMD is generating stronger growth with fewer moving parts, and its stock isn't too expensive at about 50 times forward earnings.
TSMC's stock seems cheaper at about 30 times forward earnings, but it's a broader and more diversified play on the entire sector. Its growth could decelerate as softer segments -- like smartphones and automotive chips -- overwhelm its higher-growth HPC business. Therefore, I believe AMD is a slightly better buy than TSMC.

2021-01-13 00:00:00+00:00,"Qualcomm eyes challenge to Apple, Intel with $1.4 billion deal for chip startup",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/qualcomm-eyes-challenge-to-apple-intel-with-%241.4-billion-deal-for-chip-startup-2021-01-13,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Jan 13 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O on Wednesday said it will acquire Nuvia Inc, a chip startup founded by Apple Inc AAPL.O veterans, for $1.4 billion, with plans to put the firm's technology into its smartphone, laptop and automotive processors.
The deal marks a big push by Qualcomm to reestablish a leading position in chip performance after several years of high-profile patent licensing litigation with rival Apple and regulatory authorities.
It also comes amid a change in the helm with Qualcomm announcing this month that Cristiano Amon, its current president and head of its silicon division, will replace outgoing CEO Steven Mollenkopf, effective June 30.
Founded by three of Apple's former top semiconductor executives in charge of iPhone chips, Nuvia has been working on a custom CPU core design that it had said would be used in server chips.
Qualcomm, however, plans a broad use of Nuvia's processors, saying they would power flagship smartphones, next-generation laptops, infotainment systems and driver-assistance systems among other applications.
While laptop makers have traditionally turned to Intel Corp INTC.O for processors, Qualcomm has been supplying PC chips for several years to firms such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O.
“It’s exciting to see Nuvia join the Qualcomm team,"" Panos Panay, Microsoft's chief product officer, said in a statement on the deal. ""Moving forward, we have an incredible opportunity to empower our customers across the Windows ecosystem.""
The deal is also significant because it could help lessen Qualcomm's reliance on Arm Ltd, which is being purchased by Qualcomm rival Nvidia Corp NVDA.O for $40 billion.
Most of Qualcomm's current chips use computing cores licensed directly from Arm, while Nuvia's cores use Arm's underlying architecture but are custom designs. For Qualcomm, using more custom core designs - a move that Apple has also made - could lower some licensing costs to Arm in the short term and make it easier to move to a rival architecture in the longer term.
While Qualcomm and Apple have resolved disputes over Qualcomm's patent royalties, Nuvia and Apple have been at loggerheads.
In 2019, Apple sued Nuvia's Chief Executive Gerard Williams III, alleging Williams recruited Apple employees to Nuvia while he was still employed at Apple. Apple did not sue Nuvia itself, nor did it allege any intellectual property theft, and no trial date has been set.

2021-01-12 00:00:00+00:00,Intel's self-driving car unit plans to step up use of its own radar tech by 2025,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-self-driving-car-unit-plans-to-step-up-use-of-its-own-radar-tech-by-2025-2021-01-12,,,"By Stephen Nellis
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The head of Intel Corp's INTC.O self-driving car subsidiary said on Tuesday the company wants to shift toward using its own radar-based technology and use a single lidar sensor per vehicle by 2025 in a bid to lower the cost of autonomous driving.
Mobileye has taken a different strategy from many of its self-driving car competitors, with a current camera-based system that helps cars with adaptive cruise control and lane change assistance. Those systems are on the road today and are gathering data to help Mobileye map the roads in new cities.
For more advanced systems, the company plans to add both radar sensors, which use radio waves to detect distance from objects, and lidar, a laser-based system that helps self-driving vehicles gain a three-dimensional view of the road. For a planned fleet of so-called robotaxis, which are commercial vehicles meant to ferry around passengers, the company is tapping sensors from Luminar Technologies Inc LAZR.O.
In a presentation a the Consumer Electronics Show, Chief Executive Amnon Shashua said on Tuesday that Mobileye's robotaxis will use multiple Luminar units to gain 360-degree lidar, radar and camera coverage all around the vehicle. The robotaxis rolling out in at least eight cities starting in 2022 will each have four Luminar units, Shashua said in a subsequent question and answer session.
But Mobileye is also developing its own lidar sensor that it plans to start using in 2025 for cars aimed at consumers.
That 2025 consumer system will feature a single lidar unit facing the front of the vehicle, while cameras and a new radar-based system that Mobileye is also developing will cover the entire vehicle. Shashua said Mobileye is developing new ways to process radar data with software that will make radar more powerful. Radar sensors are cheaper than lidar but give a less detailed image.
""The difference between radars and lidars in terms of cost is an order of magnitude,"" he said. ""No matter what people tell you about how to reduce the cost of lidar, radar is ten times lower. We are building lidars, so I know exactly the cost of the lidars.""
In a statement, Mobileye said it plans to continue to use Luminar lidars ""as much as possible"" after introducing its own lidar sensors. Mobileye plans to offer its self-driving technology to automakers as separate components, meaning that automakers could choose a Mobileye system but use Luminar sensors for the lidar units.
Luminar declined to comment.
