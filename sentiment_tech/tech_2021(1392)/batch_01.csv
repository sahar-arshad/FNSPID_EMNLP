NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Old-guard companies are at risk of dismemberment. With titans like General Electric or Toshiba breaking up, bankers will try to run the same playbook in 2022 for technology, energy and automotive firms transitioning their businesses. They should remember that casting out their best shots at staying relevant is a very different proposition from carving up the disparate pieces of an industrial conglomerate.
GE, Japanese giant Toshiba and healthcare firm Johnson & Johnson were at the forefront of a renaissance in corporate splits in 2021, all opting to spin off various units. The theory is that, by allowing their unrelated businesses to stand apart, they can be more efficiently – and more richly – valued by the market.
It seems like an easy enough trick to replicate. A car company primarily making gas-guzzlers could spin out its electric vehicle efforts to win a Tesla-like multiple. An oil company might separate clean energy operations. Or a chip firm with profitable designs should step away from the vast investments required to be a leading manufacturer.
These ideas have all been floated for automaker General Motors, oil major Royal Dutch Shell and chip kingpin Intel, which need to spend big to remodel their legacy business. Spinning out new initiatives might be tempting, especially for those whose profitability is crimped by all that spending. Intel’s shares fell 12% when it said its profits would take a hit as it invests in manufacturing. GM predicts its electric cars will only become as profitable as gas-powered cars in 2030.
But while GE’s healthcare team probably didn’t need a jet engine business under the same roof, GM’s car efforts benefit from integration. The company expects to save up to $30 billion in spending on the path to becoming fully electric by reusing existing equipment and upgrading its current plants, rather than starting from scratch. Intel’s cash flows are the lifeblood of its chip plants. And spinoffs are not a guaranteed winner: DuPont’s spins collectively trade at a lower market cap than the old combined company.
Nonetheless, some of these firms are already testing the waters, like Intel which in December said it would look to list its auto-oriented unit Mobileye. When taking meetings with bankers in 2022, it and others should be wary of offers to separate from the rest of the family jewels.

CONTEXT NEWS
- On Nov. 9, General Electric said that it would separate into three public companies by spinning off its healthcare division in 2023 and its renewable energy and power division in 2024, leaving a company focused on jet engines.
- Subsequently, on Nov. 12, both Japanese conglomerate Toshiba and U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson announced that they would spin off business units. Toshiba will separate its energy and infrastructure business and its devices and storage business into standalone companies, while Johnson & Johnson will split its consumer health business from its pharmaceutical business.

2021-12-31 00:00:00+00:00,September 2022 Options Now Available For Intel (INTC),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/september-2022-options-now-available-for-intel-intc,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options begin trading today, for the September 2022 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 259 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new September 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.55. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $45.45 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $51.60/share today.
Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 9.10% return on the cash commitment, or 12.83% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $50.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $52.50 strike price has a current bid of $4.55. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $51.60/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $52.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.56% if the stock gets called away at the September 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $52.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $52.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.82% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.43% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $51.60) to be 32%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Indeed, the blue-chip bastion of Dow stocks generated a price gain of 19% through Dec. 30. 
To get a sense of what an outlier 2021 was for the blue-chip average, the Dow's 30-year annualized price return comes to 8.7%.

Although the Dow as a whole powered through the pandemic, there's no question COVID-19 factored heavily in deciding the average's winners and losers in 2021, which we list in full down below. Naturally, the pandemic remains a key variable in the minds of Wall Street analysts as they rate the 30 Dow Jones stocks' prospects for 2022. 
Either way, many of this year's best Dow stocks are expected to continue their market-beating ways in the new year.
Take Home Depot (HD, $409.94) and Microsoft (MSFT, $339.32), for example. The Dow's top stocks of 2021 – each up by more than half – are forecast to put up more big gains in the year ahead thanks to a continuation of current trends.
In HD's case, the pandemic led to changes in consumer consumption patterns. Folks stuck at home decided to feather their nests, embrace do-it-yourself (DIY) projects and invest newfound discretionary income into their dwellings. The red-hot housing market also remains a tailwind at HD's back.
MSFT, meanwhile, has become a king of cloud-based services. The rise of remote work accelerated companies' embrace of Microsoft products such as Azure and Office 365. Looking ahead, analysts say enterprise customers are still in the early innings of their digital transformations.

On the other side of the ledger, analysts say some of this year's losers are set to  become 2022's winners. Look no farther than Walt Disney (DIS, $155.93) for an example.
Disney was the Dow's worst stock in 2021, losing almost 14%. The media and entertainment conglomerate was essentially undone by the emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19. Anything that creates uncertainty around the health of Disney's all-important theme parks and resorts – not to mention its filmed entertainment business – is bad for DIS shareholders.

2021-12-31 00:00:00+00:00,The Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy With $300 Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-best-warren-buffett-stocks-to-buy-with-%24300-right-now,,,"One easy prediction for 2022: Warren Buffett and his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) will be as prominent and influential as ever.
One reason for this prominence and influence is Berkshire's closely followed portfolio of publicly traded companies. This is a massive collection, comprising 45 stocks (as of Sept. 30) and nearly $350 billion in total market cap. Of the companies in the portfolio, two relatively inexpensive stocks strike me as standout investments: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Visa (NYSE: V). Let's dig into the reasons why.
Image source: The Motley Fool.
1. Apple
Apple, which currently trades at just under $180 per share, is about to head into the stratosphere. It is not far from a $3 trillion market cap, an unprecedented level not only for any tech stock, but for any publicly traded American business in our history.
That's what happens when a company builds a powerful brand, consistently and cleverly establishes new revenue streams, and exploits a thorough understanding of how to sell premium-priced goods to a devoted mass of customers.
As big and established as it is, Apple keeps finding ways to grow at a robust clip. From its fiscal 2019 to 2021 alone, revenue rose by almost 41% (to almost $366 billion), while headline net income nearly doubled to just under $95 billion. That makes for a nice 26% profit margin, by the way.
The tech giant has an increasing number of levers it can pull to keep those numbers heading north. There is its relatively recent foray into chip-making -- stealing ground from the sluggish Intel -- with the very well-received and powerful M1 chip family. With an army of engineers that's second to none, it should also be competitive in the electric vehicle (EV) game with the Apple Car it's rumored to be developing.
Meanwhile, a big upgrade cycle to 5G technology should continue to juice sales of devices like the enduringly popular and ever-trendy iPhone line. And once carriers like Verizon roll out 5G in a meaningful way, we'll spend even more idle time gazing at our phones and tablets, making it increasingly critical for consumers to have the latest and most up-to-date models.
Apple will remain a hot manufacturer of such products while developing potentially big revenue generators that keep the growth engine humming -- and, by extension, keep that share price on the rise to reach even more all-time highs.
2. Visa
Another long-tail and highly profitable business can likely be found in your wallet or purse right now. It's a good bet that you've got a credit or debit card carrying the Visa brand, because these days there are over 1.1 billion -- yes, billion -- such pieces of plastic in circulation across the world.
Visa doesn't actually issue its branded credit and debit cards -- that duty falls to partnering financial institutions. Instead, it operates the complex global web that is its payment system, ensuring that the payments and resulting fees get routed to the right parties quickly and efficiently.
Visa takes on no credit risk of its own, in contrast to so-called ""closed-loop"" operators like American Express and Discover Financial Services that act as both network operators and issuers. As such, Visa is basically a giant middle-man facilitating transactions across the globe.
And what a middle man! Visa has been clocking net profit margins at around the 50% mark for several years now, most recently posting a 51% figure for its fiscal 2021.
The war on cash is ongoing, but plastic and digital (a segment the company has assertively pushed into, by the way) will continue to be on the winning side.
The more Visa and other card brands are swiped or digitally input, the more the top line grows. In the aforementioned 2021, Visa managed to improve its net revenue by 10% -- not bad for a brand that has been around since before many of us were born.
As we barrel into 2022, Visa will continue to reap the rewards of ever-snowballing eCommerce as a nervous world remains at home to avoid the coronavirus. Once we finally start emerging from our caves on a regular basis, we'll likely spend even more as we go out -- with cards that are, frequently, stamped with Visa's familiar logo.
Numerous economists and analysts are predicting boom times once our current plague fades away. No prizes for guessing which monster payment card processor will stand to gain most handsomely from that situation.

2021-12-31 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Stocks to Play the Data Center Upgrade Cycle in 2022,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-stocks-to-play-the-data-center-upgrade-cycle-in-2022,,,"Facebook's recent corporate rebrand to Meta Platforms has set off a firestorm of media headlines surrounding terms like ""metaverse,"" ""web 3.0,"" and ""cryptocurrencies."" But even before that, lots of organizations had already started upgrading their data centers to get ready for more advanced web-based services and experiences.
A new wave of tech hardware construction is thus underway, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET), and Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT) look like top buys right now. Here's why these are three top stocks to play the data center upgrade push.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. AMD: Gobbling up market share of the web's basic computing unit
It doesn't look like AMD's pending acquisition of fellow chip designer Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX) will get done in 2021, as it's still pending sign-off from regulators in China. Management said it hopes to finalize the $35 billion acquisition in early 2022. Xilinx, which is the leader in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), will open up a new front for AMD as it gobbles up market share from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in multiple areas.
Even should the Xilinx deal get hung up by China (regulators in the U.S., U.K., and Europe have already given the go-ahead), AMD will be just fine. AMD's CPUs for data centers (one of Intel's most important business lines) have been building steam for years. And along with Nvidia, AMD GPUs designed for artificial intelligence are also a key growth driver for the company.
But FPGAs from Xilinx, a flexible chip type that can be reprogrammed at the hardware level, have also been on the offensive. Intel acquired a couple of FPGA firms in recent years, but that segment has mostly stalled out while Xilinx has been growing at a healthy clip. Together, AMD and Xilinx would be a powerful force and help AMD continue to eat away at Intel's massive lead in the semiconductor industry.
Besides sustaining AMD's stand-alone growth momentum, Xilinx will improve AMD's profit margins, and boost research and development spending. Currently, AMD stock trades for 61 times trailing-12-month free cash flow and 44 times next year's expected earnings. This valuation implies another year of rapid growth for the company in 2022, which looks more than viable given the high demand chips are in and the rapid pace of data center upgrades (for example, Meta choosing AMD chips to help power the metaverse). Adding in Xilinx could just be extra gravy. I remain optimistic on AMD's prospects for the long term.
2. Arista Networks: Constructing the backbone of cloud computing
After a few years of struggle, Arista Networks stock was back on the rise in 2021 and set fresh all-time highs throughout the year. The company made a solid rebound from the adverse effects of the U.S.-China trade war that were exacerbated by the early days of the pandemic, and Arista's sales are in strong growth mode once again.
Arista designs open-source switches and other networking equipment. As it's a key ingredient in data centers and other internet infrastructure, a surge in web traffic and cloud computing has Arista's hardware in high demand right now. With order lead times extending well into 2022, management expressed confidence on its lastearnings callthat it will continue to grow in the new year (through the first nine months of 2021, Arista revenue was up 27% year over year).
Along with its hardware, Arista has also been expanding on its library of software solutions for its data center customers. Together, the company provides a full suite of solutions for enterprises looking to build out new capabilities for the digital world, like cloud operation monitoring and security. In total, it makes for an incredibly profitable business. Arista generated $914 million in free cash flow over the last 12 months, a 33% free cash flow profit margin.
As of this writing, the stock trades for 50 times trailing-12-month free cash flow and nearly 42 times next year's expected earnings. It's the highest premium Arista has traded for in years, but given the company's return to double-digit percentage growth, it's not an unwarranted price tag. This is a great stock to own if you think data center construction, the cloud, and other next-gen web experiences will remain a secular growth trend throughout the 2020s.
3. Fortinet: A best-in-class play for security
Cloud-based security software has been all the rage since the start of the pandemic. Firms like CrowdStrike and Zscaler have been top performers in the cybersecurity industry. But Fortinet, often considered a ""legacy"" security firm, is no slouch. For every cloud service, a data center is doing the work somewhere, and that physical asset needs to be secured as well.
Fortinet designs some of the top chips on the market for this purpose. Even during lockdowns and corporate freezes on some spending in year one of the pandemic (2020), Fortinet's hardware sales kept growing. And then in 2021 as data center upgrades picked up pace, the company's product sales segment accelerated (up 40% through the first nine months of the year).
But let's not pigeonhole Fortinet as a hardware company. In fact, nearly two-thirds of its revenue is derived from services -- recurring and very sticky software-based sales that get packaged with the company's best-in-class equipment. Even as cybersecurity needs have evolved with proliferating use of the internet, Fortinet has adapted and maintained fast and steady growth for years. Development of a new wave of IT services bodes well for the company's continued success.
As can be expected from a company that has a long track record of profitable growth, Fortinet stock can be purchased for a premium 48 times trailing-12-month free cash flow and 79 times next year's expected earnings (a higher multiple for next year assumes the company invests heavily in research and development in 2022). Nevertheless, I still like Fortinet for the long haul. Expect some turbulence after shares more than doubled in 2021, but if you are focused on the firm's potential over the next five-plus years like I am, this top data center security play deserves attention.

2021-12-30 00:00:00+00:00,February 2022 Options Now Available For Intel (INTC),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/february-2022-options-now-available-for-intel-intc,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the February 2022 expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new February 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $51.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.88. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $51.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $49.12 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $52.05/share today.
Because the $51.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.69% return on the cash commitment, or 31.29% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $51.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $56.00 strike price has a current bid of 79 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $52.05/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $56.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.11% if the stock gets called away at the February 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $56.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $56.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.52% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.88% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $52.05) to be 32%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-12-30 00:00:00+00:00,This Growth Stock Could Be a Surprise Metaverse Pick in 2022,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-growth-stock-could-be-a-surprise-metaverse-pick-in-2022,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has moved in a different direction since former CTO Pat Gelsinger took the CEO position in early 2021. Among the most pressing problems for this blue-chip stock is a lost technical lead, and addressing this problem will be critical if the company wants to succeed in the metaverse.
However, rivals in the chip industry like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) have received more attention from metaverse investors. Now, with its new strategy enacted, investors will have to determine whether the metaverse can help Intel stage a revival.
Image source: Getty Images.
Intel and the metaverse
Like its peers in the chip industry, Intel has taken a deep interest in the metaverse. It outlined a strategy at the RealTime conference on metaverse technologies. Raja Koduri, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's accelerated computing systems and graphics group, stated that computing capabilities would have to rise by ""several orders of magnitude"" to deliver that computing power at the low latencies required for this environment.
To this end, the company plans to build on its Core, Xeon, and edge processors to promote this environment. The new X architecture, which will include its Arc Alchemist GPU, will further bolster these capabilities.
Challenges remain
Nonetheless, to succeed in the metaverse, management will have to address the red flags for Intel's future. Nvidia's focus on AI and longtime dominance in the GPU market give it natural advantages with the graphics aspects of the metaverse.
Additionally, the metaverse will depend heavily on data centers. Revenue in Intel's data center group (DCG) rose 10% in Q3 compared with the same quarter in 2020. However, Omdia recently reported that AMD earned a record market share in the data center market in September, indicating Intel could struggle in this part of the metaverse as well.
Moreover, even with Gelsinger's moves to improve Intel's technology, product development cycles in the chip industry tend to take between three and five years. Thus, the prospect of whether Intel can stage a comeback remains speculative at this stage.
Still, a comeback is not out of the question. Intel had led the industry technologically for decades, and it continues to generate more revenue than AMD and Nvidia combined. Nonetheless, investors have so far shown little confidence that Intel can come back in this area.
Intel's financials offer little help (at least for now)
Additionally, current financials offer little good news to Intel bulls. In the first nine months of 2021, revenue of just over $58 billion rose by just 1% compared with the same period in 2020. Also, net income during the first three quarters of 2021 climbed by about the same rate to just over $15 billion. Income from gains in equity investments and a lower tax expense helped offset almost a nearly $4 billion increase in operating expenses.
Furthermore, full-year 2021 forecasts call for flat to modestly lower revenue compared with 2020. This may help explain why the stock price has risen by about 10% over the last 12 months, well under the S&P 500 total return of 31% during that time frame. Additionally, Intel has long failed to achieve any kind of valuation premium. Its price-to-earnings ratio stands at about 10, well below AMD's 46 earnings multiple and Nvidia's 92 P/E ratio.
Can the metaverse invigorate Intel stock?
Determining whether the metaverse can help Intel stage a comeback will take time. Despite Intel's leadership actively working to reinvigorate the company, Intel's financials and stock price remain sluggish. Nonetheless, product cycles in its industry take years to play out. Moreover, the fact that AMD and Nvidia surged to a technical lead shows that the competitive battle remains ongoing.
In the end, nobody knows how Intel will perform in the metaverse. Still, with a large base of operations and a low earnings multiple, investors hold a tremendous incentive to take a chance on the tech giant.

The deal, signed in 2020, will allow Intel to focus on its smaller but more lucrative Optane memory business. For SK Hynix, it is the biggest acquisition ever as it seeks to boost its capacity to build NAND chips, used to store data in smartphones and data centre servers.
""This acquisition will present a paradigm shifting moment for SK Hynix's NAND flash business to enter the global top tier level,"" said Park Jung-ho, vice chairman and co-CEO of SK Hynix.
A SK Hynix subsidiary called Solidigm, headquartered in San Jose, California, United States, will manage the newly acquired NAND solid-state drive (SSD) business.
SK Hynix co-CEO Lee Seok-hee will be appointed executive chairman of Solidigm, while Rob Crooke, former senior vice president of Intel, will be appointed CEO of Solidigm, SK Hynix said in the statement.
The second phase of the deal is expected to close in or after March 2025 along with the payment of the remaining $2 billion, and will include SK Hynix's acquisition of Intel's remaining assets in the NAND business including intellectual property and workforce, the statement added.

Consisting “of virtual reality, augmented reality and the internet,” the metaverse refers to a combination of real and computer-based environments. The metaverse is also supposed to have an economic system and enable individuals to visit various locations.
More About the Proposed Metaverse ETF and ProShares
ProShares wants its metaverse ETF to be called ProShares Metaverse Theme ETF. The fund would seek to emulate the performance of the Solactive Metaverse Theme Index, ProShares stated in its filing with the SEC.
Among the stocks in the index are the following large tech firms: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), which was previously called Facebook.
ProShares has launched and managed ETFs since 2006. It currently has many, diverse ETFs, under its umbrella. In October, ProShares launched a Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:BITO) that reportedly became “the first bitcoin futures ETF to go live in the U.S.” following the SEC’s approval of the fund. As of the end of last month, the ETF had net assets of $1.4 billion.
ProShares says that its Bitcoin Strategy ETF “is the first U.S. ETF designed to provide investors an easy way to add bitcoin exposure to [their] portfolios.”
Many Companies Are Becoming Involved in the Metaverse
Dozens of companies are getting involved in the metaverse. In addition to the large tech companies named above, video game makers Roblox (NYSE:RBLX), Niantic, Epic Games and Decentraland (CCC:MANA-USD) are among the firms seeking to build the metaverse.
Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney in October said that the metaverse could eventually become a “multi-trillion” dollar endeavor. For its part, Meta Platforms is looking to invest $10 billion at a minimum just in 2021 on its metaverse projects.
“We are committed to bringing this long-term vision to life and we expect to increase our investments for the next several years,” the company wrote in conjunction with its third-quarter earnings results.

2021-12-29 00:00:00+00:00,Are Strong Financial Prospects The Force That Is Driving The Momentum In Intel Corporation's NASDAQ:INTC) Stock?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-strong-financial-prospects-the-force-that-is-driving-the-momentum-in-intel,,,"Most readers would already be aware that Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) stock increased significantly by 6.1% over the past month. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Intel's ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
How To Calculate Return On Equity?
ROE can be calculated by using the formula:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intel is:
23% = US$21b ÷ US$90b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2021).
The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.23.
What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.
Intel's Earnings Growth And 23% ROE
First thing first, we like that Intel has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 16% which is quite remarkable. This likely paved the way for the modest 15% net income growth seen by Intel over the past five years. growth
We then performed a comparison between Intel's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 15% in the same period.
NasdaqGS:INTC Past Earnings Growth December 29th 2021
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for INTC? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.
Is Intel Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?
With a three-year median payout ratio of 27% (implying that the company retains 73% of its profits), it seems that Intel is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.
Additionally, Intel has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 36% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 15%, over the same period.
Summary
On the whole, we feel that Intel's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals? Click here to be taken to our analyst's forecasts page for the company.

2021-12-29 00:00:00+00:00,China is the ghost at the U.S. antitrust feast,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/china-is-the-ghost-at-the-u.s.-antitrust-feast,,,"Reuters
Reuters


NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The American approach to merger rules has for a while been focused on keeping China out. But President Joe Biden’s new tactic of slowing down corporate consolidation might hand Beijing a gift in disguise. Or at least, U.S. business chiefs are likely to argue as much as they pursue big deals in 2022.
Merger review policy under Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump was repurposed to essentially cut off Chinese acquisitions of U.S. companies in a host of industries, from semiconductors to aerospace and even hotels in sensitive locales. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which can block deals without public explanation, gained a broadened mandate, including new powers to block minority investments. The volume of U.S. deals with Chinese buyers has slumped around 60% since 2017, according to Dealogic, delivering a paltry $5 billion haul in 2021, an otherwise record year for global dealmaking.  
Now, antitrust enforcers are aggressively trying to curtail domestic deals too. But the risk is that by doing so, they stop U.S. companies from being able to compete with foreign rivals. That’s a particular risk in aerospace and defense. An example is Lockheed Martin’s bid to acquire https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/2020/aerojet-rocketdyne.html rocket-maker Aerojet Rocketdyne. The $4.4 billion deal was struck in 2020, but regulators won’t opine on whether it can proceed until 2022. Lockheed boss James Taiclet has warned that the delay puts China at an advantage, saying antitrust concerns are “dwarfed” by the cost of holding back deals.
There’s a precedent for such arguments. When Northrop Grumman bought missile maker Orbital ATK in 2017 for $9.2 billion, the Federal Trade Commission approved the deal despite misgivings https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/1810005_northrop_bureau_statement_6-5-18.pdf, in order to preserve “benefits” for the Department of Defense – which may prefer a stronger supplier than a more fragmented market. The DOD is also involved in reviewing Lockheed’s plans, working alongside an FTC that is now helmed by avowed merger-skeptic https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/07/statement-ftc-chair-lina-m-khan-antitrust-division-acting and Biden appointee Lina Khan.
In 2022, these arguments will spill out of the defense sector and into other industries where chief executives want to grow, and where China is a competitor or disruptor. Take microchips. American chip kingpin Intel was reported in 2021 to be in talks with rival GlobalFoundries, a deal that could vex U.S. antitrust watchdogs. But such a combination could also arguably safeguard supplies if tensions rise between China and chipmaking hub Taiwan. Even sectors like oil and gas could take the position that letting companies merge is a patriotic duty. If the M&A feast continues, expect China to be the ghost in attendance.

2021-12-28 00:00:00+00:00,Will ASML Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2030?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-asml-be-a-trillion-dollar-stock-by-2030,,,"ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) was one of the hottest tech stocks of 2021. The Dutch semiconductor equipment maker's shares skyrocketed nearly 70% over the past 12 months as the global chip shortage highlighted the indispensable nature of its lithography systems, which etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. ASML is the world's largest supplier of lithography systems, and it's the only manufacturer of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems, which are used to produce the market's smallest and most advanced chips.
Semiconductor foundries like TSMC (NYSE: TSM), Samsung, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) need a constant supply of ASML's EUV machines, which cost about $150 million each and require multiple planes to ship, to address the market's insatiable appetite for new chips. ASML doesn't face any competitors in the EUV market for two simple reasons: It's spent more than three decades developing the technology, and it's prohibitively expensive for smaller lithography companies to enter this capital-intensive market.
ASML's market dominance enables it to generate stable revenue growth with expanding gross margins. It also plans to maintain its dominance with new high-NA EUV systems, which will enable the world's top foundries to manufacture even smaller chips over the next few years. Could that resilient business model turn ASML into a trillion-dollar company by 2030?
Image source: Getty Images.
Could ASML triple in value in less than a decade?
Over the past 10 years, ASML's stock has soared about 1,400%. The company is worth 295 billion euros ($334 billion) today, so it would need to triple its market value over the next eight years to become a trillion-dollar company.
Simple math suggests this could easily happen. Between 2010 and 2020, ASML's annual revenue increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%. If it grows at the same CAGR from 2020 to 2030, its annual revenue would more than triple from 14 billion euros ($15.9 billion) in 2020 to nearly 44 billion euros ($49.8 billion) in 2030. Assuming its valuations remain roughly the same, it could join the 12-zero club by the end of the decade.
But that bar could be too low
During ASML's investor day presentation in September, it predicted it would generate 24 billion to 30 billion euros ($34 billion) in revenue in 2025, compared to its prior forecast of just 15 billion euros. The midpoint of that new forecast (27 billion euros) implies ASML's revenue could actually increase at a CAGR of 14% between 2020 to 2025.
However, investors should recall that ASML sandbagged its guidance before. During its investor day presentation in 2016, it predicted it would generate just 10 billion euros ($11.3 billion) in annual revenue by 2020. It easily surpassed that goal by four billion euros. Therefore, investors shouldn't be surprised if ASML exceeds the high end of its own guidance in 2025.
What are the near- to mid-term catalysts?
ASML sold 258 lithography systems, including 31 EUV systems, in 2020. It expects its sales of EUV systems to rise as chipmakers produce more 7nm, 5nm, and 3nm chips. By 2023, it will likely roll out a few high-NA systems to enable foundries to manufacture even smaller chips beyond the 2nm node.
During ASML's last investor day, it presented ""low"" and ""high"" scenarios for the market in 2025. In a low market, the global chip shortage will ease and foundries will purchase fewer systems. In a high market, the secular growth of newer technologies -- such as 5G networks, data centers, cloud services, driverless cars, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices -- will spark a ""super cycle"" in chip demand that will last much longer than previous cycles. Micron's (NASDAQ: MU) latest earnings report suggests that ""super cycle"" will continue long after the industry resolves its supply chain issues.
Here's how ASML's low (24 billion euros) and high (30 billion euros) estimates for its 2025 lithography system shipments currently look:
MARKET SCENARIO
TOTAL SYSTEMS
EUV
HIGH-NA EUV
Low
313
48
5
High
452
70
5
Data source: ASML.
Simply put, ASML's shipments will keep rising, and it will remain a linchpin of the global semiconductor market for the foreseeable future.
What are the longer-term catalysts?
From 2025 to 2030, EUV and high-NA EUV systems will likely account for a growing percentage of ASML's total system shipments. These systems are more expensive than ASML's lower-end systems, and they can be sold at much higher gross margins.
ASML already expects that trend to boost its annual gross margins from 48.6% in 2020 to 54% to 56% in 2025. That expansion should continue throughout 2030, and generate even more cash for its buybacks and dividends.
ASML might suffer a few cyclical slowdowns over the next nine years, as it did during the memory market's downturn in 2019, but its long-term growth prospects still look promising. Therefore, I firmly believe ASML could easily triple in market value by 2030 and become a trillion-dollar company.

2021-12-28 00:00:00+00:00,"5 Reasons to Buy Texas Instruments, and 1 Reason to Sell",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-reasons-to-buy-texas-instruments-and-1-reason-to-sell,,,"Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) has been a resilient stock this year, even as supply chain challenges and inflation-related fears have rattled the tech sector. The semiconductor maker's stock has also consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past three, five, and ten years.
Should investors still buy shares of TI today? Let's examine five reasons to buy this blue-chip tech stalwart -- as well as one reason to sell it -- to decide.
1. It's a diversified producer of lower-end chips
Texas Instruments doesn't produce high-end CPUs and GPUs like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), respectively. Instead, it produces cheaper analog and embedded chips, which support power management, wireless, and data transfer features for myriad devices. These chips aren't very powerful on their own, but they're just as essential as higher-end chips.
Image source: Getty Images.
TI is also more diversified than Intel and Nvidia, which generate most of their revenue from the PC and data center markets, as well as Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), which is tethered tightly to the smartphone market. In 2020, TI generated 37% of its revenue from the industrial market, 20% from the automotive market, 27% from personal electronics, 8% from communications equipment, and 6% from enterprise systems. The remaining 2% came from other markets.
Those end markets will require more of TI's analog and embedded chips to support newer technologies like 5G networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) services, automation platforms, and driverless vehicles. That diversification makes TI a well-balanced play on a wide range of secular growth trends across the tech sector.
2. It manufactures most of its own chips
Like Intel, TI is an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) that designs, manufactures, and sells its own chips. Whereas ""fabless"" chipmakers like Nvidia and Qualcomm outsource all of their production to third-party foundries, TI manufactures its analog chips (which generated 76% of its revenue in its latest quarter) at its own plants. That closed-loop has largely insulated it from the global chip shortage and the traffic jams at TSMC, Samsung, and other third-party foundries.
TI isn't completely immune to the chip shortage, since it outsources the production of its embedded and logic chips (which generated the remaining 24% of its revenue last quarter) to third-party foundries in Asia. Delays at other IDMs and fabless chipmakers could also impact TI's own chip shipments by disrupting the production of completed devices and systems.
Nonetheless, TI still faces less pressure from third-party foundries than its fabless peers. It won't need to aggressively increase its capital expenditures -- as Intel and TSMC have been doing -- to expand its capacity or design higher-end chips.
3. High gross margins
Over the past few years, TI transitioned its plants from 200mm to 300mm wafers. That move reduced its analog production costs by about 40% and boosted its gross margins to industry-leading highs:
Source: YCharts
In other words, chipmakers don't necessarily need to sell the priciest cutting-edge chips to generate the highest gross margins. TI's success indicates it can also sell lower-end chips at high gross margins by leveraging newer technologies to improve its scale and reduce production costs.
4. Shareholder-friendly measures
TI's stable sales and high gross margins enable it to generate plenty of free cash flow (FCF). It also usually returns all of its FCF to its investors through buybacks and dividends. Between 2004 and 2020, TI grew its FCF per share at an average annual rate of 12%. Throughout those 16 years, it reduced its share count by 46% with consistent buybacks while boosting its dividend annually at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26%.
The company currently pays a forward dividend yield of 2.5%, which nearly matches Intel's 2.7% yield. It's also much higher than Nvidia's forward yield of 0.05% and Qualcomm's forward yield of 1.5%.
5. Its post-pandemic recovery
TI's revenue rose less than 1% in 2020 as the pandemic disrupted its chip sales to the crisis-stricken automotive and industrial markets. However, its earnings per share still rose 14% as it bought back more shares.
This year, analysts expect TI's revenue and earnings to rise 24% and 37%, respectively, as those pandemic-related headwinds fade away. Next year, analysts project its revenue and earnings will increase 4% as the year-over-year comparisons gradually stabilize.
The one reason to sell TI: its valuation
Texas Instrument's strengths have made it a popular defensive stock this year as inflation-related headwinds have crushed higher-growth tech plays. But, that reputation has also boosted its forward P/E ratio to 23. That multiple is a bit frothy relative to those of its industry peers. Intel and Qualcomm trade at just 14 and 17 times forward earnings, respectively. Skyworks Solutions, which focuses on similar end markets and secular trends as TI, trades at 14 times forward earnings. Therefore, TI's higher valuation could limit its upside potential in this wobbly market.
TI's stock isn't a bargain, but I believe its strengths easily justify its current valuation. Investors looking for a semiconductor stock that can reliably beat the S&P 500 over the long run should still stick with TI.

Investors on Wall Street have been on edge for a while. You couldn’t guess it from looking at the scoreboard. Because the S&P 500 broke records once more this morning. Clearly investor confidence is waning, but not their risk appetites. Equities like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock are now miles higher than last year.

This makes it difficult for those who are true fans of the stock. Under the leadership of Lisa Sue, the company has improved its financial situation tremendously.
Investors have consequently rewarded AMD through buying its stock, but therein lies the problem. Today’s note carries a cautionary tone, but not against the company prospects. My concern is about the timing for those looking for new investments.
I have no issues with their fundamental success, since demand for tech is increasing at an exponential rate. There is no doubt that chip company services have a long runway ahead. The pandemic sealed that deal, so there are no more holdouts. Everyone had to embrace tech and the internet.
We now need more computer brains than ever. Just the switch into telecommuting alone is a big boost. This is not to mention all the electronic infrastructure to make it happen. Crypto and NFT are strong trends, and they too are driving demand for smart machines.
7 Great Growth Stocks to Buy for January
Clearly the AMD fundamental thesis is as close to a slam dunk as it gets. The next bit will be evaluating its value.
AMD Stock Is a Bit Too Hot
Spending is not my concern here because they are delivering astonishing growth. They can’t do that while cinching their purses. Price-to-sales is an honest measure of value for growth stocks. AMD’s is now approaching 11, which is 30% more expensive than October. So investor expectations are perhaps growing too fast.
I’m not recommending shorting the stock, because it’s not extravagantly expensive. Fast growers demand higher valuations. But it is getting rich relative to its own self. The stock price needs time to consolidate, so that the P/S metric normalizes a bit.
Among its peers, AMD value is right in the middle of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Its 45 P/E is less than half of NVDA and its P/S is one third. Clearly it’s not an outlier among the bunch. Intel is the cheapest of the three, but for now let’s leave it out of the conversation. INTC value is a low outlier, so we shouldn’t penalize AMD for it.
Let’s put some perspective on how we got to these stratospheric levels. AMD stock went into the pandemic from an all-time high 75% higher than August 2019. Then, after a brief pandemic collapse, investors stepped into it with a vengeance. From the March 2020 low to this November high they rallied 354%. So the latest 20% correction was merely a scratch on the paint job.
Patience Is Important Now
Source: Charts by TradingView
From an investment perspective, I would much rather get into the stock under $122 per share. I realize I may have to wait a bit, but there are plenty of stocks to trade meanwhile. Active traders can make use of the shorter-term trading opportunities within AMD too. Shorter-term profit potential is easy with such momentum stocks. There is support at $130 and resistance above. If it loses footing then I will get my chance.
The small-caps have shown extreme weakness of late. Conversely the S&P and the Nasdaq are ready to rally another 15% from here. This shouldn’t happen unless the small-caps also join the party. So, this week we should focus on that to determine the likelihood of another leg higher in the market. If so, then owning AMD stock now would make short-term sense.
In reality, the markets should meander a bit sideways to consolidate. This would be healthy for AMD and other fast runners. There is no urgency to load up on a full-size positions, even in great stocks like this one.
My intentions today were not to be negative about the company. I am merely trying to avoid the easy mistakes when possible. AMD stock now does not present an obvious point of entry, but it will follow the market up.

2021-12-23 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Offers Apology In China Over Xinjiang Province Supplier Statement,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-offers-apology-in-china-over-xinjiang-province-supplier-statement,,,"(RTTNews) - American chip maker Intel Corp. (INTC) on Thursday offered an apology in China after the company's letter asking suppliers not to take products or labor from the Xinjiang region came under severe criticism.
In an annual letter sent to suppliers in December, the company said that it has been ""required to ensure that its supply chain does not use any labor or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region"", following restrictions imposed by ""multiple governments"".
The letter comes in the backdrop of the United States accusing China of multiple human rights abuses in the Xinjiang province, which is home to China's predominantly Muslim Uyghurs. The abuses include forced labor. Beijing has time and again denied these claims.
The Intel letter was published on the company website and in several languages. It led to widespread criticism in China from the state media and social media platforms, who called for a boycott.
In a Chinese statement on Thursday on its official WeChat and Weibo accounts, Intel said that its commitment to avoid supply chains from Xinjiang was an expression of compliance with U.S. law, rather than a statement of its position on the issue. The company said, ""We apologize for the trouble caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners and the public. Intel is committed to becoming a trusted technology partner and accelerating joint development with China.""
Many other big multinationals have also faced pressure over their plans to comply with sanctions related to Xinjiang even while working in China, which is a large market and supply base.
Many users on China's counterpart to Twitter, Weibo, felt that Intel's apology was an attempt at protecting sales in China, with one saying ""a mistake is a mistake! Retract the statement about Xinjiang!""
Intel, which has 10,000 employees in the country, said in its apology that it ""respected the sensitivity of the issue in China.""
Commenting on the issue, China's foreign ministry said ""accusations of forced labor in Xinjiang are lies concocted by anti-China American forces aimed at destabilizing China and hindering its development. We note the statement and hope the relevant company will respect facts and tell right from wrong.""

ROME, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Intel and Italy are intensifying talks over investments expected to be worth around 8 billion euros ($9 billion) to build an advanced semiconductor packaging plant, two sources close to the matter told Reuters.
A deal of this size would secure Italy about 10% of the 80 billion euros the U.S. company is looking to spend over the next decade in Europe on cutting-edge manufacturing capacity to help avoid future shortages of semiconductor chips.
Sources had previously told Reuters that the investment size was in a 4 billion to 8 billion euro range.
As part of this plan Germany, the European Union's largest economy, is in the lead to land Intel's INTC.O planned European 'megafab' plant, although France remains in the running, Reuters reported in October.
Intel declined to comment on Thursday on the talks or the size of an investment it might make, adding that it has not announced any changes to its plans.
Chipmakers are scrambling to boost output after explosive demand for consumer electronics such as smartphones and computers resulting from the work-from-home trend during the COVID-19 pandemic led.
Meanwhile EU countries, where many jobs still rely on industries such as automobile manufacturing, are eager to reduce their dependence on semiconductor supplies from China and the United States after recent supply chain problems.
The proposed Italian factory would be an advanced packaging plant using innovative technologies to weave full chips.
Intel and the Italian government of Prime Minister Mario Draghi are discussing an overall investment of $9 billion over 10 years from when construction begins, the sources said.
Negotiations are complex and Rome wants Intel to clarify its plans for Italy before formalising a package of favourable conditions, especially on jobs and energy costs, they added.
If Rome and Intel clinch a deal, they will then proceed with the choice of a site for the plant, the sources said.
However its CEO Pat Gelsinger earlier this month said he hoped to announce the locations of new chip plants in the United States and Europe early next year.
In April, the Italian government used anti-takeover legislation to block a planned sale of a controlling stake in a local semiconductor equipment maker to China's Shenzhen Invenland Holdings Co. Ltd.

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - U.S. chipmaker Intel is the latest multinational company to struggle with the geopolitics of doing business in China. The $207 billion technology group had to say sorry  to defuse a social media backlash in the People’s Republic after telling suppliers https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/supplier/governance/forms/documents/annual-supplier-letter-english.html they could not use products or labor from the Xinjiang region. 
The company backtracked with a Chinese-language statement on Thursday saying it was complying with U.S. law rather than expressing Intel’s position on the issue. America and other Western countries have accused China of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. 
Intel’s stance is mealy-mouthed. But U.S. companies operating in China can't be seen to take sides. Fashion chain H&M saw PRC sales fall https://hmgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-full-report-PDF.pdf 28% year-on-year in its 2021 second quarter after its statements about Xinjiang triggered a boycott. More than a quarter of Intel’s $78 billion of sales in 2020 came from customers in China. Even $2.9 trillion Apple has to walk a tightrope between Washington and Beijing. One day, one of the giants will fall off. (By Richard Beales)
