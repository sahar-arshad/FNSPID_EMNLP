2021-12-08 00:00:00+00:00,A Mobileye IPO Could Help Intel's Stumbling Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-mobileye-ipo-could-help-intels-stumbling-stock,,,"Chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) paid $15.3 billion for autonomous driving company Mobileye in 2017. Intel saw a huge opportunity at the time, saying that the market for vehicle systems, data, and services could grow to $70 billion by 2030.
Nothing has likely changed about that opportunity as the automotive industry marches toward an electric and autonomous future. Mobileye has shipped over 100 million of its EyeQ chips, which support an array of advanced driver assistance functions. Future versions of EyeQ are expected to support semi- and fully autonomous driving.
What has changed is the premium investors are willing to hand out to any company working on electric cars or autonomous vehicle technology. Tesla is a $1 trillion company, worth more than all the other major automakers combined; graphics chip company Nvidia, which offers a platform that rivals Mobileye, has seen its stock soar over the past few years; and EV upstart Rivian is worth nearly $100 billion despite never selling a single vehicle.

Cashing in on EV and AV froth
The problem with having a valuable, fast-growing, high-potential business within a much larger, slower-growing company is that the market is unlikely to award the larger company a valuation that reflects the potential of that smaller business. The market can't easily put a value on Mobileye, so it doesn't even try.
If Mobileye were a stand-alone company, it would likely fetch a high price. The company has tripled its annual chip shipments and revenue since it was acquired by Intel four years ago, and revenue is on track to grow 40% this year. Mobileye has a good story: It already sells its ADAS systems to major automakers; it generated more than $1 billion of revenue in the first nine months of 2021; and it's got deals in place for its upcoming self-driving system.
By all indications, Intel's acquisition of Mobileye was a success. Unfortunately, Intel shareholders have not reaped any benefits. Intel stock has gone nowhere since early 2018, and it's down more than 20% from its multiyear high.
Intel announced on Tuesday that it plans to take Mobileye public in mid-2022. Intel is not doing this because it wants to rid itself of Mobileye. The company will retain a majority stake, and Intel and Mobileye will continue to co-develop solutions. Intel has no plans to divest itself of Mobileye, and nothing will change about how Intel reports its results.
By taking Mobileye public, Intel simplifies the story for both itself and Mobileye. Mobileye will be a high-growth AV company with huge potential, and Intel will own a large chunk of it. Mobileye could be valued as high as $50 billion, according to Reuters -- about one-quarter of Intel's current valuation. By putting a price on Mobileye, Intel is hoping that its own stock begins to reflect the value of its stake in the AV company.
A bonus to a Mobileye IPO is that Intel will likely raise billions of dollars in cash. The company is doubling down on semiconductor manufacturing, and it will need all the cash it can get its hands on as it builds out new facilities to keep pace with third-party foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
This looks like a smart move from Intel, and it will hopefully have a positive impact on the lagging stock price in the long run.

2021-12-08 00:00:00+00:00,MOVES-Qualcomm's AI chip chief departs to take helm at startup MemryX,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/moves-qualcomms-ai-chip-chief-departs-to-take-helm-at-startup-memryx,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Dec 8 (Reuters) - Keith Kressin, the executive who oversaw Qualcomm Inc's QCOM.O artificial intelligence chip efforts, has left to take the top job at a Michigan-based semiconductor startup.
Kressin has become chief executive of MemryX, founded in 2019 by University of Michigan professors Wei Lu and Zhengya Zhan, the company told Reuters. MemryX is working on its second generation of a chip aimed at helping cameras in places such as cars and factory robots recognize objects, a field called computer vision.
Kressin told Reuters he left Qualcomm, which is nearly tied with Intel Corp INTC.O for the tile of second-largest U.S. chip firm by market capitalization, for MemryX, which has only 30 employees, because he believes the startup solves a key problem in making artificial intelligence work in the real world.
Artificial intelligence models must be ""trained"" using powerful chips in data centers. To be used outside data centers, they must be modified to fit into smaller chips inside cameras or other devices. Those modifications - known as ""hand tuning"" - can be costly and time consuming.
MemryX says it aims to offer a chip that does not need hand tuning.
""You don't need the intervening steps,"" Kressin told Reuters. ""It takes a long time to get traction because the software is so onerous.""
MemryX said Lu, co-founder who served as CEO previously, will remain chairman of the board and become chief technology officer. Kressin has relocated from Qualcomm's home San Diego, California to MemryX's headquarters in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where the startup hopes to cultivate customers among carmakers, who are rapidly adding chips to vehicles.
""A lot of times in tech and AI, you don't talk much about the Midwest,"" Kressin said. ""That was one of the things that drew me here actually - the opportunity in Michigan.""

2021-12-08 00:00:00+00:00,Indian billionaire Ambani says 5G rollout should be nation's priority,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/indian-billionaire-ambani-says-5g-rollout-should-be-nations-priority,,,"NEW DELHI, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Indian billionaire tycoon Mukesh Ambani, who controls India's biggest wireless carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm, said on Wednesday the country should prioritise the rollout of 5G telecommunications and also ensure devices become affordable.
India, the world's second-biggest telecoms market with more than a billion subscribers, must migrate from 2G to 4G and then to 5G at the earliest, Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries RELI.NS and Asia's richest man, said during the Indian Mobile Congress.
""At Jio, we are currently focused on 4G and 5G execution, and broadband infrastructure expansion.""
His comments come a week after a top government official said that India is planning to auction 5G airwaves early next year.
Jio, which counts Alphabet's Google GOOGL.O, Facebook FB.O, Qualcomm QCOM.O and Intel INTC.O among its backers, is confident of being the first to launch 5G services in India, Ambani said previously.
As part of its technology push, Jio has also developed a homegrown 5G solution.
Google, which last year invested $4.5 billion in Jio's parent Jio Platforms, has also said it will help the wireless carrier with tech solutions for its enterprise and consumer offerings as it plans to launch 5G services.
Reliance last month launched a low-cost 4G device jointly developed with Google, priced at 6,499 rupees ($86), as part of a plan to woo first-time smartphone buyers. The device costs 1,999 rupees upfront and users can pay the rest in monthly instalments.

Dec 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rallied strongly on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq surging 3% as investors piled onto beaten-down quality technology stocks, while Intel jumped after plans to take its self-driving car unit public.
The chip giant's INTC.O decision to list Mobileye in the United States in mid-2022 was met overwhelmingly, with its shares 4.5% higher. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX surged 5.0%, bouncing off a near one-month low hit in the previous session.
All of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced, with the information technology sector .SPLRCT, which houses companies like Visa Inc V.N, Mastercard Inc M.N, Salesforce.com CRM.N Apple Inc AAPL.O and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, gaining 3.4%.
The Nasdaq has climbed nearly 4% so far this week, more than recovering all its losses suffered last week when the Federal Reserve's hawkish comments about speedier taper spurred bets about an early interest rate hike next year to curb surging inflation.
""The markets understand that a zero interest rate environment is not going to last forever, that the Fed is going to use a measured approach to raising rates and not just some dramatic balance upwards,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh.
""This is a reflection of what is driving the market. Things that were on sale are being bought, especially those higher multiple stocks.""
Optimistic comments from a top U.S. official about the nature of the Omicron variant and positive data on a COVID-19 drug's efficacy against the latest variant also boosted investors' sentiment.
Shares of Vir Biotechnology VIR.O jumped 4.8% after British drugmaker GSK GSK.L said an antibody-based COVID-19 therapy it is developing with Vir is effective against all mutations of the Omicron variant.
""It (Omicron) doesn't seem as devastating as prior variants and I think all of this is making us move out of the financial doldrums of COVID,"" Forrest said.
The CBOE volatility index .VIX, too, eased from a 10-month high hit last week.
At 12:07 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 537.15 points, or 1.52%, at 35,764.18, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 96.81 points, or 2.11%, at 4,688.48, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 459.76 points, or 3.02%, at 15,684.91.
Shares of mega-cap tech stocks Meta Platforms FB.O, Google-owner Alphabet GOOGL.O, Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Amazon AMZN.O added between 2.0% and 3.1%.
Travel shares continued the momentum, with the S&P 1500 Airlines .SPCOMAIR and the S&P 1500 Hotels, Restaurant and Leisure .SPCOMHRL indexes rising 0.6% and 2.0% respectively.
American Airlines AAL.O added 1.1% after the carrier announced the retirement of Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker.

2021-12-07 00:00:00+00:00,Intel CEO aims to build chip plants with money raised from Mobileye IPO,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-ceo-aims-to-build-chip-plants-with-money-raised-from-mobileye-ipo,,,"By Nivedita Balu and Ben Klayman
Dec 7 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.Owill keep most of the money it raises next year when it sells a stake in its Mobileye self-driving-vehicle components unit in a planned initial public offering, targeting some of those funds to build more Intel chip plants, Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said on Tuesday.
Intel shares were up 4.1% at midday Tuesday after surging as much as 8% during the session, as Wall Street cheered the chip giant's move to take Mobileye public. Gelsinger said the IPO will allow Mobileye to grow more easily as global carmakers spend billions of dollars to accelerate their transition to electric and self-driving vehicles.
""This is the right time,"" he said on a conference call. ""This is a unique asset and we're going to make the right moves to fully realize that potential.""
Gelsinger said Intel will retain a majority stake in Mobileye and will also receive ""the majority of the proceeds"" from the IPO. He declined to specify the size of the stake that would be sold or a fundraising target, but said that ""certainly it will be helpful in our overall aggressive buildout of plants.""
Intel has said it plans to build two chip plants in Arizona, and add other plants in the United States and Europe at sites that have not been announced.
A chip shortage has afflicted industries globally including the auto sector. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration wants Congress to approve $52 billion to expand U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.
Before Tuesday's gains, Intel shares had barely budged this year, vastly underperforming a more than 40% rise in the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX, as the chipmaker struggles to ramp up its technology as rivals have been making more energy-efficient microprocessors.
Mobileye, an Israeli company that Intel bought for about $15 billion five years ago, could be valued at more than $50 billion during its U.S. IPO in mid-2022, a source previously told Reuters. Gelsinger said that value would be set closer to the IPO and he declined to say how much of Mobileye will be sold, repeating Intel would retain a majority stake.
Mobileye has a rich roster of clients, including BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Nissan, Honda and General Motors.
Its technology has been deployed by automakers as they equip their cars with driver-assistance systems or experiment with self-driving technology in their shift toward electric vehicles. Intel expects Mobileye's revenue to grow over 40% this year.
WestPark Capital analyst Ruben Roy liked the deal for the cash and greater strategic focus it could bring Intel. Roy said Mobileye should see compound annual growth of around 25% to 30% over the next several years.

Dec 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes finished Tuesday's session with strong gains as investors shook off some anxiety about the latest virus variant and investors piled into technology stocks that boosted Nasdaq.
Intel's INTC.O announcement of plans to take its self-driving car unit Mobileye public in the United States next year sent its shares soaring and cheered chip investors. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX at one point rose more than 5% after hitting a near one-month low on Tuesday.
Investors were also reassured by some positive news regarding the Omicron variant of COVID-19, which had helped send them fleeing from risk last week.
Before market open, British drugmaker GSK GSK.L said an antibody-based COVID-19 therapy it is developing with Vir Biotechnology VIR.O was effective against all mutations of the Omicron variant.
That news added to the relief rally along with infectious disease official Anthony Fauci's comment on Tuesday that preliminary evidence indicates while Omicron likely has a higher degree of transmissibility it appears to be less severe. Fauci had made similar comments on Sunday.
""A week ago we saw a big scare because of Omicron and over the following week it appeared to be very contagious but less severe than people were worried about,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, said the Glaxosmithkline headline was already ""instrumental to people's sentiment.""
He also cited the Intel news and investor bets that the market would see its traditional December boost, known as the Santa Claus rally.
""There's certainly fears of missing out on the Santa Claus rally,"" said James. ""It's a bigger picture risk-on mentality that's taking hold today.""
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 95.17 points, or 2.07%, to end at 4,686.84 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC gained 455.72 points, or 2.99%, to 15,680.87. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 492.21 points, or 1.42%, to 35,719.24.
The CBOE volatility index .VIX, too, eased from a more than 10-month high last week.
Travel shares continued gaining, though at a slower pace than Monday with the S&P 1500 Airlines .SPCOMAIR and the S&P 1500 Hotels, Restaurant and Leisure .SPCOMHRL gaining.
American Airlines AAL.O rose after the carrier announced the retirement of Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker.
In the semiconductor industry other big gainers besides Intel were Nvidia NVDA.O, Applied Materials and NXP Semiconductor's NXPI.O U.S. listed shares.

When looking at the broader stock market, autonomous vehicle (AV) stocks are likely on the minds of many investors. While the idea behind a driverless car is relatively simple to the human mind, the technology behind it is much more complex. It requires technological advancements in global positioning, digital mapping, computing power, and sensor systems working together to make autonomous driving safe. Furthermore, most autonomous vehicle companies pitch the idea of safer roads and a reduction of human errors while driving. 
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than 10,000 people succumb to drunk driving car accidents in the U.S. Now, imagine if these people had access to safe autonomous vehicles, such human errors would then be out of the equation, wouldn’t it? Earlier today, Stellantis (NYSE: STLA) announced its STLA AutoDrive platform. Developed in partnership with BMW, the platform will offer up to Level 3 autonomous driving capabilities. 
Elsewhere, Ford (NYSE: F) reported earlier this month that it has conducted a trial with a simulated autonomous vehicle at a container port in the UK. The trial aimed to help understand how existing processes and human interactions can work alongside automated vehicles. So, if you believe autonomous vehicles are here to stay, why not take a look at some of the top AV stocks in the stock market today. 
Best Autonomous Vehicle Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] In December 2021
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL)
Ambarella Inc (NASDAQ: AMBA)
Luminar Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: LAZR)
Intel   
Let us start the list with the company making waves in the AV space today, Intel. Traditionally, the company engages in the design and manufacturing of products and technologies. It is also one of the world’s largest semiconductor chips manufacturers and the developer of the x86 series of microprocessors. That said, it has its hands in the AV space through its Mobileye segment. 
With more than 1,700 employees dedicated to developing state-of-the-art technologies in automotive safety and AV solutions, Mobileye stands as one of the global leaders in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Yesterday, Intel announced that it plans to take Mobileye public in the U.S. in mid-2022. This deal could value the Israeli unit at more than $50 billion, according to Reuters. 
According to the company, it also has no intention to divest nor spin off its majority ownership in Mobileye. Not only that, Intel claims that it will continue to provide technical resources to the automaker. Well, an IPO would likely provide the best opportunity to build on its track record for innovation as well as unlock value for shareholders. With that in mind, would you consider INTC stock as a buy right now?

Alphabet
Following that, we have a company that needs no introduction, Alphabet. Most people would know the company through its Google segment that includes Google Services and Google Cloud. But what some may not be aware of is, Alphabet also has a self-driving car project that was started more than a decade ago with the goal of driving autonomously. The project eventually became Waymo. 
Earlier in November, the company began to map in New York City for the first time. Everyone knows that it is the most densely populated city in the country with unusual road geometries. Waymo believes that its Waymo Driver will be able to handle these types of complex and dynamic activities. Should this be a success over time, it would certainly give great confidence to the company that its AV solutions will be able to handle any other major cities in the country.
On top of that, the company’s Waymo Via also expanded its partnership with UPS to autonomous freight movement with Class 8 trucks. This continuous collaboration would fill the demand and need for freight movements during the holiday season. So, this is a great example of how Waymo is creating an autonomous delivery solution that can offer customers unique safety benefits, flexibility, and scalability. Given these factors, would you consider investing in GOOGL stock?

Ambarella
Ambarella is a company that primarily develops low-power system-on-a-chip (SoC) semiconductors. Besides that, it also focuses on creating AI technology that enables edge devices to visually perceive the environment and make decisions based on the data collected from cameras and other types of sensors. 
Now, Ambarella’s automotive solutions are designed for both human and computer vision. It combines high-resolution imaging and neural network processing into a single, low-power embedded platform. These would include front ADAS cameras, smart electronic mirrors, drive recorders, fleet management solutions, and many more. With that said, could the company’s technology play a vital role in the future of autonomous driving? 
Well, the company announced a partnership with China’s Dongfeng Motor Group back in September. The collaboration aims to build a Driver Monitoring System (DMS) based on Ambarella’s CV25 AI vision SoC and development platform. The first mass production of this system is in the Dongfeng Yixuan Max vehicle. With this on board, it will reduce the chance of car accidents, and increase the safety of the driver. All things considered, do you think AMBA stock will have more room to run?

Luminar Technologies
To sum up the list, we have the developer of advanced sensor technologies, Luminar. Essentially, it caters to the AV industry by manufacturing and distributing commercial lidar sensors that measure distance using laser light. It would then generate an accurate three-dimensional map for automotive mobility applications. Given how oversold the company stock is right now, investors are likely keeping tabs on LAZR stock now. 
After all, Luminar did announce last month that its lidar solutions were selected to be part of the sensor suite in the NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) DRIVE Hyperion AV reference platform. The DRIVE Hyperion will utilize one forward-facing long-range Luminar Iris lidar in its Level 3 highway driving configuration. Both companies believe that their technologies are becoming the de facto solution for major automakers. So, they will provide automakers with the most advanced AV development platform. 
On top of that, Luminar also announced its third-quarter business updates in November. During the quarter, the company has successfully developed its alpha version of the full-stack Sentinel solution. The solution demonstrated both advanced automatic emergency braking and assisted highway driving capabilities. In addition, it is also on track for its goal of at least 60% year-over-year growth of its forward-looking order book in 2021. Safe to say, the company has been beating most of its milestones that were set out earlier this year. With that in mind, would LAZR stock be a top AV stock to buy at its current valuation?

Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) climbed on Tuesday after the semiconductor giant announced plans to take its Mobileye autonomous vehicle business public.
As of 2:55 p.m. ET, Intel's stock price was up nearly 4%.
So what
Intel acquired Mobileye in 2017. The Israel-based company is a leading provider of advanced driver assistance and self-driving technology. It has relationships with over 30 automakers and expects to generate revenue growth of more than 40% this year.
""Mobileye has realized accelerated growth and opportunity since joining the Intel family, nearly tripling annual chip shipments, revenue, and the number of employees since the acquisition,"" Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua said in a press release. ""Our alignment with Intel continues to provide Mobileye with valuable technical resources and support.""

Intel intends to give investors a chance to own shares in Mobileye directly via an initial public offering (IPO) in mid-2022, subject to market conditions. ""An IPO provides the best opportunity to build on Mobileye's track record for innovation and unlock value for shareholders,"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said.
Now what
Intel plans to maintain majority ownership of Mobileye following the completion of the IPO. The companies will continue to work together to develop cutting-edge automotive technologies. Intel will also integrate its Moovit mobility solutions business and its remote sensing and radar development teams into Mobileye prior to the IPO.
Looking further ahead, Intel expects semiconductors to account for roughly 20% of a premium vehicle's bill of materials by 2030. The chipmaker hopes to capture a sizable share of this potentially enormous market.

The chipmaker's shares have barely budged this year, vastly underperforming a 40% rise in the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX, as Intel struggles to ramp up its technology and catch up with rivals in making more energy-efficient microprocessors.
Tuesday's gains will help Intel add $17 billion to its market capitalization. Shares of Qualcomm QCOM.O, Nvidia NVDA.O and AMD AMD.O were also up in early trading.
Mobileye, an Israeli company that Intel bought for about $15 billion five years ago, could be valued at more than $50 billion during its U.S. initial public offering in mid-2022, sources told Reuters.
Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers said the valuation puts Mobileye more than 35-times trailing 12 months (TTM) sales, a metric that indicates how much money it has raked in over a year.
Mobileye has a rich roster of clients, including BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Nissan, Honda and General Motors.
Its technology has been deployed by automakers as they equip their cars with driver-assistance systems or experiment with self-driving technology in their shift toward electric vehicles.
""That is what would give a possible high valuation to Mobileye ... that eventually this is going to be something that's deployed to eventually most vehicles around the world,"" Daiwa Capital Markets America's Louis Miscioscia said.
Intel expects Mobileye's revenue to grow over 40% this year.
""Rather than trying to compete with its potential foundry customers in the automotive market, it can serve as a foundry of choice to more automotive chipsets suppliers as well as (auto manufacturers) that may want to adopt its in-house chips,"" Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan said.

2021-12-07 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Plans Mobileye Public Listing – Report,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-plans-mobileye-public-listing-report,,,"Intel (INTC) plans to take its car unit, Mobileye, public, as early as mid-next year. Reuters reports, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the unit could go public in a deal that values it at more than $50 billion. INTC shares rose 3.53% to close at $50.99 on December 6.
Intel is a U.S. company that designs, manufactures, and sells microprocessors, chipsets, and flash memory. It also operates a data-centric business that includes Data Center Group (DCG) and Internet of Things (IOTG).
Mobileye Listing
In addition, Intel intends to retain the Mobileye executive team once it goes public. It also wants to maintain majority ownership after the initial public offering, with no plans divests or spin-off majority ownership. The chip giant will also continue to provide technical resources to the automaker, which currently employees nearly 14,000 workers in Israel.
The strategic partnership has allowed Mobileye to enhance autonomous vehicle development, using the free cash flow it continues to get. Nevertheless, going public is expected to provide the best opportunity to allow the autonomous car company to build its track record on innovation and generate shareholder value.
Intel acquired Mobileye in 2017 in a deal that valued Mobileye at $15.3 billion. With the acquisition, the company strengthened its edge in the push to compete against Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) in the development of self-driving systems.
The push to take Mobileye public comes on Intel’s Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger coming under immense pressure from activist investors to consider spinning off costly chip manufacturing operations. In contrast, the chip giant is looking to enhance its manufacturing capacity to address the global semiconductor shortage worldwide.
Stock Rating
Last month, Citigroup analyst Christopher Danely reiterated a Hold rating on the stock. According to the analyst, weakness in PC demand could persist after two straight years of double-digit growth.
Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 4 Buys, 12 Holds, and 6 Sells. The average Intel price target of $53.90 implies a 5.71% upside potential to current levels.

Stock market futures are in the green in early morning trading on Tuesday. This comes after initial reports provided somewhat positive data on the Omicron Covid variant. In detail, White House chief medical advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci, noted that the severity of the new variant of concern is, well, not as concerning as most initially thought. While Fauci noted that there is data to still be collected, investors appear to be relieved nonetheless. Could this spell the end of the recent bouts of volatility seen across the broader stock market?
To help with this, Morgan Stanley’s (NYSE: MS) fixed income portfolio manager Jim Caron weighed in on the situation. He said, “I know after Thanksgiving [news about Omicron] came out and that created a pretty big volatile event, but I think the initial conditions where valuations were pretty full, we knew the Fed was starting to change course and starting to tighten financial conditions a bit, and that’s going to mean that asset prices are going to have to reprice.” As of 6:47 a.m. ET, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures are trading higher by 1.03%, 1.36%, and 1.89% respectively.

By and large, it seems that demand for MongoDB’s cloud services is rising as more companies bolster their digital infrastructure. CEO Dev Ittycheria notes that Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN) is among its key clients doing so now. Because of all this, MongoDB is raising its revenue and earnings estimates for the fiscal year. It now expects to report a revenue between $846.3 million to $849.3 million for the full fiscal year. That is about 5% higher than its previous guidance. WIth that in mind, could MDB stock end the year on a high?

Microsoft Makes Push For More Annual Microsoft Office Subscriptions
In other tech-related news, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) seems to be gunning for more consistency in its productivity software division. Evidently, the company is planning to raise subscription fees for monthly users by 20%. However, customers that opt to switch towards an annual plan will be in the clear. The real question now is whether this seemingly bold move could play to Microsoft’s advantage in the long run. In theory, this move would help to serve Microsoft in terms of visibility regarding its revenue and customer churn figures.
Not to mention, Microsoft is also bringing more to the table in 2022 with its latest Office updates. Namely, the company is planning to roll out its New Commerce Experience (NCE) software solution among others. Through NCE for Office, Microsoft hopes to make its software more accessible through existing business partners. Additionally, there are also the company’s improvements to its core Windows operating system, and Microsoft 365 bundle to consider. In the larger scheme of things, Microsoft seems to be firing on all cylinders now. Regardless of whether or not you believe in the current reopening trade, MSFT stock could be worth watching now.

Intel Looks To Bring Mobileye Self-Driving Unit Public
Elsewhere, semiconductor chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is making waves in thestock market todaythanks to its latest announcement. In essence, Intel is reportedly looking to take its autonomous driving unit, Mobileye, public via an initial public offering (IPO). For one thing, Mobileye is seeing strong momentum in terms of revenue growth. This is evident as the division has almost tripled its revenues since being acquired by Intel in 2017. As it stands, the current listing could see Mobileye sitting at a value of over $50 billion.
Ideally, the IPO would serve to further highlight the viability of Mobileye’s core business. After going public, the firm will continue to work closely with Intel to advance their collective positions in the global automotive market. CEO Prof. Amnon Shashua said, “Our alignment with Intel continues to provide Mobileye with valuable technical resources and support that has yielded strong revenue along with free cash flow that allows us to fund our AV [autonomous vehicle] development work from current revenue. Intel and Mobileye’s ongoing technology co-development will continue to deliver great platform solutions for our customers.“
All in all, time will tell if the move can further solidify Intel’s presence in the growing automotive chip industry. Nevertheless, with news like this catching headlines, I could see INTC stock gaining attention in the market now.

As of 8:30 a.m. ET, futures on the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) were up 285 points to 16,127, seeking to play catch-up after lagging larger gains from other major market benchmarks in Monday's rally.
Helping to bolster the Nasdaq's fortunes early Tuesday was a big rise in some of the largest tech stocks in the market, led this time by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Yet some investors are looking more closely at a bounce in an electric vehicle (EV)-related stock that has seen a lot of volatility over the past month. Below, we'll see why Intel's making a big move, as well as reveal the name of this EV stock and what's ahead in its future.

Intel gives investors what they want
Shares of Intel were up almost 8% in premarket trading on Tuesday morning. The semiconductor company got a boost not from its core business but from a strategic decision to try to get the market to value one of its subsidiaries more fully.
Intel announced that it would spin off its Mobileye business, with the intent of doing an initial public offering of the unit sometime in 2022. Mobileye is Intel's entry into the autonomous vehicle space, and according to Intel, it has been generating some impressive performance in its early stages. Specifically, Mobileye has shipped more than 100 million units of its system-on-chip product EyeQ, and it has unveiled a robotaxi that it hopes to use as it scales up its testing globally in cities in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
To be clear, Intel will remain financially interested in Mobileye. The chipmaker will keep a majority stake in the autonomous vehicle specialist, and the two companies will keep working together to find synergies in which their development of innovative technology can help each other. Mobileye will keep its leadership and executive team in place as well.
Intel acquired Mobileye four years ago, but the chipmaker has never gotten the kind of valuations seen from smaller companies making similar moves in electric and autonomous vehicle technology. Investors like the idea of letting people own shares of Mobileye directly, and that could prove to be a big windfall for Intel as well.
Go time for this EV stock
Elsewhere in the industry, though, shares of EVgo (NASDAQ: EVGO) were also moving higher, with gains of about 7% in premarket trading Tuesday. The fast-charging system provider got a valuable contract win that many see as potentially pointing toward bigger and brighter things for the company.
EVgo announced Tuesday morning that it had won grants from the California Air Resources Board and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. Under the terms of the five proposed grants for which EVgo received support, EVgo will add five fast-charging locations with a total of 38 charging stalls. One of those facilities will be in Los Angeles, with 18 charging stalls making room for retail drivers and vehicle fleets to facilitate faster conversion toward EV use. With EVgo's technology, the new sites should help most EVs charge up within 15 to 45 minutes.
With the award, EVgo will add to its more than 330 sites and 820 charging stalls across California. The company boasts strong penetration within its home market, stating that more than 80% of California's population lives within 10 miles of a current EVgo site.
EVgo has participated in a wave of interest among EV charging stocks, but its share price has been volatile, nearly doubling in early November but giving back all of those gains since. There's no doubt that building out a charging infrastructure will be an essential element of electric vehicle adoption, but investors still seem unclear whether EVgo or other companies will end up being the big winners from the trend.

Dec 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks looked set to open 1% higher on Tuesday as technology firms bounced back on easing concerns around the Omicron variant, while Intel jumped after plans to take its self-driving car unit public.
Investors cheered the chip giant'sINTC.Odecision to list Mobileye in the United States in mid-2022, sending its shares 7.7% higher in premarket trading. Other chipmakers including Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O, Micron Technology MU.O and Nvidia NVDA.Oalso rose.
U.S. stock indexes closed higher on Monday as optimistic comments from a top U.S. official about Omicron encouraged investors. The CBOE volatility index, too, eased from a 10-month high it hit last week, when fears around the new virus strain and the Federal Reserve's hawkish comments about a speedier taper rattled investors.
""With yesterday's rally, investors are starting to get their minds around the fact that the Fed is likely tapering for the right reasons,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
""And the second thing is that there's been a diminishing economic impact of every new variant of the coronavirus since the pandemic began.""
The bounce underlined a rebound in high-flying growth stocks, which were battered in recent days as investors rotated into sectors like energy, banks that stand to perform better in a tightened U.S. monetary policy environment.
Big Tech stocks Google-owner Alphabet GOOGL.O, Microsoft MSFT.O, Amazon AMZN.O and Apple AAPL.O gained nearly 2%.
Tesla Inc TSLA.O added 3.4% after dropping into bear market territory, or 20% off its record high close, on an intraday basis on Monday.
""We think that in 2022, markets will continue to see periods of optimism and pessimism on both inflation and growth, and flip-flop between those views until there is more clarity,"" said Willem Sels, global chief investment officer, private banking and wealth management at HSBC.

Dec 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Monday argued that competition in the nascent markets for chips in self-driving cars and a new category of networking chips could be hurt if Nvidia Corp NVDA.O carries out its $80 billion purchase of Arm Ltd.
Last week, the regulator said it was suing to stop the deal in which Nvidia, the world's most valuable publicly traded chip firm, is vying to buy U.K.-based Arm from current owner Softbank Group Corp 9984.T. Arm licenses out its computing architecture to semiconductor firms, which use it to design chips for devices like mobile phones.
On Monday, the FTC released a redacted version of its complaint. It said it believes Nvidia's purchase of Arm would hurt competition because hundreds of chip companies that rely on Arm would be hesitant to keep working closely with the British firm for fear of Nvidia gaining access to their product plans.
Since announcing the deal, Nvidia has sought to frame its purchase as a way of making Arm into a more viable competitor to the ""x86"" architecture owned by Intel Corp INTC.O that dominates PCs and data centers. Arm is now used in the central processors for smart phones but not for data center servers.
Nvidia has argued that Intel's x86 architecture has 97.4% market share in data center servers, saying that it will invest in Arm to make it a more viable alternative.
But the FTC complaint on Monday focused instead on new markets where Arm is dominant and where x86 is not currently used. It said that Nvidia and rivals from Intel to Tesla Inc TSLA.O rely primarily on Arm for emerging fields such as self-driving car chips and ""data processing unit"" chips: networking chips that add a layer of security to data centers.
""Nvidia will have the incentive to harm Arm-reliant
(self-driving chip) rivals as opposed to working collaboratively with them to help them succeed, as Arm does today, because Nvidia competes closely against these rivals for major business
opportunities,"" the FTC wrote.
Market definition often plays a large role in deciding antitrust cases.
Nvidia declined to comment beyond a statement issued last week saying it plans to ""work to demonstrate that this transaction will benefit the industry and promote competition.""
Arm executives have told Reuters that Nvidia and Arm plan to create ""firewalls"" to protect any information shared with Arm from being inappropriately used by Nvidia.
Herbert Hovenkamp, who teaches antitrust at the University of Pennsylvania law school, said any firewalls that Arm and Nvidia created would probably fall short.
""The agencies rightfully hate firewalls,"" he said.
