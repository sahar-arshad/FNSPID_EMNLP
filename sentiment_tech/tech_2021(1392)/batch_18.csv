2021-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,"Will Intel's ""Accelerated"" Chipmaking Plans Spell Trouble for TSMC?",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-intels-accelerated-chipmaking-plans-spell-trouble-for-tsmc-2021-08-03,,,"Over the past several years, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has fallen behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) and Samsung in the ""process race"" to create smaller and more advanced chips.
Intel's R&D and manufacturing issues with the 14nm, 10nm, and 7nm nodes resulted in chip delays and shortages, enabling its rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) -- which outsourced is chip production to TSMC's superior foundries -- to expand its market share in the PC and server CPU markets.
Last year, many analysts speculated that Intel would also need to go ""fabless"" and outsource its manufacturing to TSMC to catch up. But earlier this year Intel's new CEO Pat Gelsinger shot down those rumors and doubled down on the chipmaker's first-party foundries with fresh investments.
Image source: Getty Images.
At its ""Intel Accelerated' event on July 26, Gelsinger unveiled a brand new technological roadmap and declared that Intel could catch up to TSMC and Samsung by 2024, then reclaim the process lead by 2025. Those are ambitious goals, but should TSMC -- which remains ahead of Samsung as the world's most advanced chipmaker -- be concerned at all?
How Intel plans to catch up to TSMC
Intel believes it can catch up to TSMC with three main strategies. First, it will boost its capex from $14.3 billion in 2019 to $19 billion to $20 billion this year, with most of that spending allocated toward expanding its domestic foundries and buying ASML's (NASDAQ: ASML) high-end EUV (extreme ultraviolet) machines, which are essential for manufacturing the world's smallest chips.
Second, Intel will rename its upcoming nodes to better reflect their transistor density and overall performance compared to TSMC's nodes. For example, Intel is renaming its 10+ node its ""new"" 7nm node, its old 7nm node its ""new"" 4nm node, and its old 5nm node as the ""new"" 2nm node. Intel can make this shift because measurements of node sizes aren't defined by set industry standards.
Lastly, Intel could consider buying smaller foundries to accelerate its expansion. It's already reportedly mulling a takeover of AMD's former chipmaking unit GlobalFoundries, the world's fourth-largest chip foundry, which could significantly expand its third-party foundry services.
How TSMC plans to stay ahead of Intel
This is how Intel's revised roadmap measures up to TSMC's plans.

Intel's chips are denser than TSMC's, so it routinely claims its 10nm chips are comparable to TSMC's 7nm chips, its 7nm chips are comparable to TSMC's 5nm chips, and so forth.
However, TSMC claims its 3nm (N3) chips -- which have been in development since 2019 -- will be up to 70% denser than its 5nm chips, while consuming up to 30% less power and running up to 15% faster. Even Intel, in an odd twist, will reportedly task TSMC with manufacturing its upcoming 3nm CPUs in 2023 before it launches its own 3nm CPUs.
TSMC will also likely outspend Intel to maintain its lead. It intends to boost its capex from $17.2 billion in 2020 to roughly $30 billion this year, then collectively spend approximately $100 billion over the next three years. It also recently teased a potential breakthrough in the development of 1nm chips.
Intel might gain some support from government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe, but TSMC has also secured U.S. government subsidies for its new plant in Arizona -- a decision Gelsinger loudly protested. In an Intel-sponsored article on Politico, Gelsinger pointed out that TSMC would still produce its most advanced chips in Taiwan instead of the U.S., and that ""foreign chipmakers vying for U.S. subsidies will keep their valuable intellectual property on their own shores.""
Taiwan's own government will also likely subsidize TSMC's expansion to keep it ahead of Intel, since it needs TSMC to serve as the country's most valuable bargaining chip in its relationship with the U.S., as well as its most effective deterrent to a Chinese invasion.
Why TSMC shouldn't be too concerned ... yet
Intel is making bold promises about challenging TSMC and helping the U.S. become a leading manufacturer of chips again. But it probably can't outspend TSMC without big government subsidies -- and some of those subsidies are already flowing to TSMC as part of the escalating tech war between the U.S. and China. TSMC is also ASML's largest customer, so Intel could struggle to secure enough high-end EUV machines to achieve its lofty expansion goals.
Intel's rocky track record of delays and shortages will also likely prevent TSMC's top customers -- which include Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), AMD, and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) -- from switching chip manufacturers. Therefore, TSMC's investors shouldn't be worried about Intel's ambitious plans yet -- but they should still keep an eye on its progress over the next few years.

2021-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,Tech Companies Are Facing a Global Chip Shortage: 3 Tips for Investors,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tech-companies-are-facing-a-global-chip-shortage%3A-3-tips-for-investors-2021-08-03,,,"The semiconductor industry has found itself in a massive supply side shortage situation since the summer of 2020. The industry was already primed for tightness before the COVID-19 pandemic rolled in, due to the long-running trade tension between Beijing and Washington.
When the health crisis arrived, it worsened the situation in two ways. Manufacturers had to deal with the same coronavirus-based operating challenges as everyone else. At the same time, demand for many chip-studded types of electronics surged in the era of working and generally staying at home.
Finally, a terrible drought swept over Taiwan in early 2021, making it difficult for the many chip-building factories on the island to get their hands on large amounts of ultra-clean water.
The chip shortage is holding many industries back, as equipment ranging from smartphones to modern cars to medical devices require lots of freshly built semiconductor chips. Investors across nearly every sector need to keep an eye on the chip shortage because it changes the business landscape in many ways. Here are three important tips that should help you get a handle on the semiconductor shortage and its challenges.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Yes, this shortage will affect you. And you, and you, and you.
Data-crunching chips are more important than ever in a wide range of devices. The current production challenges place direct limits on the production volumes of cars, phones, drones, toys, medical devices... you name it. And the issue strikes equally across each industry -- there are no shortcuts or workarounds available when every competitor in a given sector needs the same chip.
Here's how consumer robots specialist iRobot (NASDAQ: IRBT) CEO Colin Angle described the chip shortage effects in last week's second-quarter earnings call:
Our competition tends to use a greater percentage of Chinese local componentry which has slightly different availability dynamics, but it only takes one component to stop you from building a robot. And even our competitors' designs require componentry which will be hard to come by. So it's difficult for us to truly model the extent to which they are going to be impacted, beyond that we know they will be impacted to some degree.
In other words, this is everybody's problem, even if some rivals have access to a few alternative chip sources. One missing component still cramps the whole unit-building process.
2. This will take a while
In his own second-quarter call two weeks ago, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger explained how he expects the semiconductor industry's recovery to play out.
While I expect the shortages to bottom out in the second half, it will take another one to two years before the industry is able to completely catch up with demand. IDM 2.0, which combines our internal manufacturing capacity with the use of third-party foundries, best positions us to weather these challenges and work with our ecosystem partners to build a more resilient supply chain. With major fab construction projects underway in Oregon, Arizona, Ireland and Israel, we are investing for the future. But we are also taking action today to find innovative ways to help mitigate industry constraints.
Intel is not only investing in additional production capacity in order to boost its own chip-building efforts but is also selling some of its manufacturing services to fabless chip designers. Mobile processor veteran Qualcomm is an early win for that strategy, and more will surely follow.
But these build-outs take time, especially when there is a global pandemic and regional climate challenges to deal with. The semiconductor industry will get back to business as usual, just not anytime soon.

3. It's not always bad news
The sectorwide ramping of manufacturing lines obviously leads to strong demand for chip-building equipment and materials. As Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) CEO Gary Dickerson saw it in his second-quarter earnings call, the shortage actually underscores the global need for more efficient manufacturing systems in the semiconductor industry.
Current capacity shortfalls in some areas of the market show the highly efficient, just-in-time supply chains that have served the semiconductor industry well for the past two decades may not be the most effective strategy going forward. There's a clear desire for the chip industry to build more resilient and flexible supply, including more regionally distributed capacity as the strategic importance of the semiconductor supply chain is increasingly acknowledged at a national level. It's also important to recognize that we're still in the early innings of major secular trends that will play out over the next decade and drive the semiconductor and semi-equipment markets structurally higher.
So Applied Materials expects the high demand for advanced chips to stick around long after the shortages have subsided. Investors agree with his analysis, driving Applied Materials' stock 121% higher over the last 52 weeks. Companies like iRobot and Intel plot their recovery plans these days, while Applied Materials and other back-end infrastructure experts enjoy fantastic results as we speak.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) said its iPhone and iPad sales could suffer this year as it tries to meet incredible consumer demand for its devices amid the shortage for basic electronics components.
However, the day after Apple's latest quarterly update, chip designer and Apple supplier Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) said it was making progress getting extra supply up and running. This could be good news for Apple shareholders and could be key for the company delivering better-than-expected revenue this summer.

Apple's ""quarter-to-quarter"" supply chain problem
Apple CEO Tim Cook said the current supply constraint issue is being taken ""quarter-to-quarter"" right now. But Cook and CFO Luca Maestri did provide some specifics to whet investor appetite during the third-quarter fiscal 2021earnings call(for the three months ended June 30, 2021).
Specifically, Maestri provided general sales guidance for Apple's final quarter of fiscal 2021 calling for ""very strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth."" However, the rate of increase is expected to be lower than the 36% pace set during Q3. Apple expects to get less of a boost from foreign currency exchange rates and its services business (which includes advertising, which is lapping depressed marketing activity last year during initial economic lockdowns).
But another reason for Apple's decelerating sales growth is a big one: Greater chip supply constraints this summer than what the world's largest consumer electronics business experienced during Q3. Maestri said the constraints will primarily affect the iPhone and iPad (Apple's primary breadwinners). In April, on the previous earnings update, Cook and Maestri had explained they were expecting supply constraints for Q3 to affect revenue by $3 billion to $4 billion.
Among other issues, Cook said Apple is paying more than they'd like to get parts delivered, and the resulting sales effect this summer will be even higher than the $3 billion to $4 billion laid out a few months ago.
Apple was able to flex its global supply chain muscle and mitigate some of those issues in the spring, but even for a company as large as Apple (total revenue was $81 billion in Q3), this chip shortage is having an effect on the top line.
Qualcomm to the rescue?
Just a day later, mobile chip leader Qualcomm beat shareholder expectations for its spring quarter. Qualcomm is a hardware giant in its own right, providing circuitry designs of some sort for a vast majority of smartphones on the market around the globe. It has its own robust supply chain developed with chip fabricators, and it was able to bring additional supply online to help it beat financial projections over the last three months.
New Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said this on theearnings call
We're still on track to materially improve supply by the end of the calendar year. We're securing incremental capacity across both leading and mature nodes and optimizing the allocation of our products across the global supply chain.
Good news for Apple? It sure could be. For now, Qualcomm is still supplying Apple with 5G mobile network modems -- a key ingredient in the iPhone 12 lineup. Apple is using the $1 billion modem business acquisition from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) last year to develop its own hardware in-house, but for now, the iPhone is still a Qualcomm customer. If Qualcomm and other chip designers can continue to clean up supply chains, perhaps the multi-billion-dollar effect on Apple's hardware sales won't be as bad as currently anticipated.
Granted, Qualcomm has lots of customers, and Apple's move to bring more chip designs under its own purview could be an incentive for Qualcomm to prioritize other smartphone makers. Nevertheless, Qualcomm waxing positive is good news for the whole smartphone industry as it ramps up production to meet demand as 5G network adoption starts to go mainstream this year.
Plus, though shipping costs and short chip supplies are weighing, Apple still notched one of the best gross profit margins on product sold (43%, up from 38% last year) in its history last quarter.
For tech titan Apple, the global chip shortage is a manageable problem, but Qualcomm's improving supply could help in the coming months. Apple stock trades for 26 times trailing 12-month free cash flow -- a reasonable valuation considering the company's outlook for double-digit revenue growth.

2021-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Marvell Technology Group vs. Broadcom,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-marvell-technology-group-vs.-broadcom-2021-08-03,,,"Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) have delivered strong upside to investors in the past year thanks to catalysts such as the deployment of 5G wireless networks, increase in data center capacity, higher usage of chips in the automotive industry, and the booming demand for 5G smartphones.
But if investors had to choose just one of these two high-flying chipmakers, which one should they buy?
MRVL data by YCharts
The case for Marvell Technology Group
Marvell is a high-growth company that's benefiting from its presence in lucrative niches. The company's revenue increased 20% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to $832 million. Its earnings jumped to $0.29 per share from $0.18 per share in the year-ago period, driven by the nice jump in the revenue as well as stronger margins.
Marvell recorded an adjusted gross margin of 64.3% during the quarter, up from 62.8% during the year-ago period, continuing its trend of consistently improving the margin profile over the past year.
The good part is that Marvell is just getting started. Its Q2 revenue guidance of $1.065 billion would translate into 46% year-over-year growth, with the acquisition of chipmaker Inphi expected to add $215 million to the company's top line during the quarter. What's more, Marvell's adjusted gross margin estimate of 64% is an improvement over the year-ago period's figure of 63.3%.
Analysts expect Marvell to maintain this impressive momentum for the next two fiscal years. The company's revenue is expected to jump nearly 42% this year and more than 19% next year. Its earnings are expected to hit $1.39 per share in fiscal 2022 and $1.85 per share in fiscal 2023, up from $0.92 per share last year. However, don't be surprised to see Marvell maintain such robust growth in the long run.

The company is helping telecom carriers deploy 5G networks across the globe, supplying its chips to the likes of Nokia and Samsung. The South Korean giant announced earlier this year that it has developed a chip platform with Marvell that will be deployed in 5G networks from the second quarter of 2021. Samsung is using the chip platform to power its massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) radios that are in tremendous demand in the 5G era.
Allied Market Research estimates the MIMO market could clock a compound annual growth rate of 35% through 2027. The Samsung partnership gives Marvell a ticket to attack this huge market as the Korean company has won deals to deploy 5G networks in the U.S. and Japan and is now conducting trials with telecom carriers in Europe.
Nokia, on the other hand, controls 25% to 30% of the 5G radio access network (RAN) outside China, according to the Dell'Oro Group. Last year, Nokia struck a partnership with Marvell to develop 5G radio technology, which should pave the way for the latter to tap into another fast-growing opportunity.
Throw in the catalysts in the storage space, which is doing well thanks to the strong demand for enterprise hard-disk drives and solid-state drives, and it becomes easier to see why Marvell is poised for long-term growth.
The case for Broadcom
The growing demand for semiconductors has helped Broadcom switch into a higher gear. The chipmaker's 2021 fiscal Q2 revenue increased 15% year over year to $6.6 billion, while adjusted earnings per share jumped to $6.62 per share from $5.14 per share in the prior-year period.
Broadcom gets its revenue from two segments -- semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. The semiconductor business is the one that's moving the needle in a big way for the company, as it produced nearly 73% of the top line in the second quarter. The segment recorded 20% year-over-year revenue growth during the quarter to $4.8 billion. The semiconductor business derives its revenue by supplying chips to the networking, broadband, server storage, wireless, and industrial end markets.
The good part is that Broadcom is witnessing solid momentum across all of these end markets. The broadband business, which accounted for 18% of the company's semiconductor revenue in Q2, recorded a 28% year-over-year revenue increase on the back of increased infrastructure investments by service providers to boost connectivity. The chipmaker expects this momentum to continue as service providers upgrade broadband infrastructure to next-generation technologies.
For instance, next-generation 10G passive optical networks (PON) account for only 30% of the overall network. Meanwhile, cable operators in the U.S. are now deploying next-generation modems to enable faster broadband speeds. In all, Broadcom expects the broadband investment cycle to continue into 2022.
The networking business is the next big growth driver of the semiconductor systems business, producing 32% of the segment's revenue last quarter. Broadcom saw 10% year-over-year growth in this segment on the back of robust demand from hyper cloud data centers and telecom companies. Looking ahead, Broadcom expects hyper cloud infrastructure providers to upgrade their infrastructure and drive further growth in the routing business.
However, the enterprise segment has been a weak link, with revenue from the segment down 16% last quarter. The good news is that Broadcom sees a recovery in this business thanks to the deployment of new server chip platforms from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.
And finally, the wireless business that accounted for 34% of semiconductor revenue last quarter is in fine form. The segment recorded 48% year-over-year growth last quarter as Broadcom saw higher-than-expected demand. The company also recorded content gains in Wi-Fi chips and wireless connectivity chips used in smartphones.
It is worth noting that the wireless segment seems capable of sustaining its high levels of growth as Broadcom is supplying chips to 5G smartphone OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), such as Samsung and Apple. The iPhone maker is one of Broadcom's key customers as it has struck an agreement with the latter to buy $15 billion worth of smartphone chips through the second half of 2023. And given that the 5G smartphone market is set to record explosive growth in the coming years, Broadcom could turn out to be a top 5G stock in the long run.
The verdict
Both companies are sitting on solid growth drivers that could help them deliver sustained upside to investors, but Broadcom seems to have an edge.
First, Broadcom's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 8 makes it cheaper than Marvell, which trades at 13 times sales. (Marvell's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 45 is also on the expensive side compared to Broadcom's multiple of 23.)
Second, Broadcom sports a dividend yield of almost 3% as compared to Marvell's yield of just 0.4%.
Additionally, Broadcom's supplier relationship with smartphone giants Apple and Samsung will allow it to take advantage of the 5G smartphone market's rapid growth, an area where Marvell will miss out, as it exited this business years ago. Of course, Marvell stands to gain from the 5G infrastructure market, but Broadcom isn't going to miss out on that opportunity either: It too has partnered with Nokia to make chips for 5G base stations.
All of this makes Broadcom a better long-term bet, especially considering its cheap valuation and juicy dividend.

2021-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,Infineon CEO warms to idea of TSMC plant in Germany,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/infineon-ceo-warms-to-idea-of-tsmc-plant-in-germany-2021-08-03,,,"By Douglas Busvine
BERLIN, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Infineon IFXGn.DE Chief Executive Reinhard Ploss on Tuesday supported the idea of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) 2330.TW building a chip fabrication plant in Germany, expressing a clear preference for its technology over that of Intel INTC.O.
""It would be an interesting idea to have TSMC in Germany,"" Ploss told reporters, while declining to comment directly on reports the dominant contract chip manufacturer was in talks on building a plant there.
Responding to the reports, TSMC said last month it was too early to say whether it would build a semiconductor plant in Germany and that talks were in their early stages.
TSMC has flagged plans to build new plants in both the United States and Japan as part of a broader move to locate production closer to key clients to reduce risks arising from tensions between Taiwan and China.
Industry sources say TSMC has been in talks with a group comprising Infineon, Robert Bosch ROBG.UL and NXP NXPI.O on building a plant to serve their need for mature chip formats used in core markets like the automotive industry.
Speculation has centered on the possibility that TSMC would site a new facility near Dresden, the hub of Europe's largest semiconductor cluster. Infineon and Bosch both have plants in Dresden.
All three have declined to comment on potential cooperation with TSMC, which comes as EU industry czar Thierry Breton is pushing for multi-billion-dollar investments to double Europe's share of global chip production over the next decade.
Ploss, asked about a push by Intel INTC.O CEO Pat Gelsinger to win EU aid for a leading-edge plant in Europe, said the U.S. chip maker didn't have a close technological fit with Infineon. By contrast, TSMC did.
""The technology that TSMC produces is closer to ours,"" he said in response to a reporter's questions. Infineon earlier reported results for the fiscal third quarter that showed tight capacity constraints weighing on sales growth.

Tech giants have shown tremendous growth over the past year despite the pandemic and the chip shortage. There is no stopping the growth of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock this year as well.
Source: Fabio Alcini / Shutterstock.com
The company recently reported Q2 results and showed its strength in the competitive industry. AMD stock climbed 7% after the results.
The company managed to beat analyst expectations for the quarter. It is currently trading at its all-time high of $106. AMD stock has the potential to march ahead and become a top leader in the tech industry. 
I have always been bullish on AMD stock and strongly believe that the company will beat Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) over the years. I recommended a buy before the Q2 earnings.

6 A-Rated, Safe Stocks to Buy With Dividends
AMD stock has grown 1300% over the past five years and is up 28% over the past year. The company has laid a very strong foundation and has the potential to soar to new highs and a lot of credit goes to the CEO Lisa Su.
Let’s take a look at the earnings in detail to understand the strength of the company. 
Stellar Q2 Results
Advanced Micro Devices earned 63 cents per share with a sale of $3.85 billion in the second quarter. The company beat analyst estimates who had forecasted earnings of 54 cents per share.
The increase in revenue was driven by Computing and Graphics Processing unit segment. The sales increased by a whopping 99% year-over-year, and the earnings increased by an impressive 250% year-over-year.
Further, the company reported a 48% percent gross margin and an operating income of $81 million. The increase in revenue led to a significant rise in operating income. 
The profit stood at $710 million in the quarter as compared to $157 million a year ago. More than 20% of the revenue came from “Data Center” which is booming and is expected to grow. Even if there is a decline in PC demand, AMD’s business will not slow down. 
AMD has a cash balance of $3.79 billion and the cash from operations stood at $952 million as compared to $243 million a year back.
The company reported an impressive free cash flow at a record $888 million. It reflects high liquidity and financial stability.
AMD will be able to use the cash to expand its product portfolio and invest in research and development activities. 
Rival Intel reported a noticeable decline in revenue for the quarter which led to a dip in Intel stock.
The company has a bullish forecast for the next quarter, clearly indicating that it is taking the market share of server chips from Intel. AMD forecasts revenue of about $4.1 billion for the third quarter, which is an increase of about 6% quarter-over-quarter. 
It has also raised the annual outlook and expects a 60% increase in revenue, up from the earlier forecast of 50%. The company expects to achieve business growth through all the verticals. 
The Bottom Line on AMD Stock
Pandemic or not, AMD will continue to grow and the demand for its products is only going higher. The company has made a lot of progress with its products and is firing on all cylinders.
Its market share is growing with the passing year and the company is poised to become one of the best tech companies in the world. 
The gross margins are beginning to grow and the share growth will continue throughout the year. I believe AMD stock won’t look back and is only going higher. 
Not to forget the Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) acquisition that will come to a close by the end of the year and will benefit AMD significantly. 
It is one stock to buy and hold forever.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-08-02 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks to Sell after Disappointing Earnings,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-sell-after-disappointing-earnings-2021-08-02,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Every earnings season introduces equities to a period of sifting. Profit-producing, expectation-beating companies are pulled higher while those who miss the mark fall lower. My last foray into earnings results yielded a gallery of beauties to buy. Today’s message throws a bone to bears by highlighting three stocks to sell after they dared to disappoint the Street with their latest results.
Finding them wasn’t hard. Their punishment is on full display, in the form of outsized down gaps following their respective announcements. But it wasn’t just the one day that provides fuel for my bearish argument. The lot of them are also in downtrends, submerged beneath all major moving averages.
When you combine bearish technicals with underwhelming earnings, it’s a toxic combination that usually spells lower prices.

6 A-Rated, Safe Stocks to Buy With Dividends
Enough with the pitch, on to the picks. The three stocks to sell here are:
Pinterest (NYSE:PINS)
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Let’s move into analyzing each price chart and mapping out an options trade.
Stocks to Sell After Earnings: Pinterest (PINS)
Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade
Pinterest was a market darling in the wake of the pandemic. Stuck-at-home consumers took to the web to scratch their shopping itch, and that benefited Pinterest greatly.
But what 2020 gave, 2021 is trying to take away. PINS stock has been incredibly volatile this year and has been stuck in a sloppy and wide eight-month range. Friday’s near-20% slashing is returning shares to the lower end of the range.
Support near $54 beckons as the next logical target. It marked the turnaround point for last quarter’s earnings-driven sell-off and should serve as a magnet now that we’re so close. To profit, consider buying short-term put spreads.
The Trade: Buy the Sep $60/$55 put spread for $2.45 or better.
Caterpillar (CAT)
Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade
Caterpillar’s response to earnings wasn’t near as dramatic as PINS. But by falling nearly 3% on Friday, the industrial giant still qualified as a disappointment. Couple that pounding with CAT’s ongoing downtrend, and it provides a tempting target for bears on the prowl.
I wouldn’t go piling in Monday morning, though. Friday’s intraday bounce created a lower wick off of support at the 200-day moving average. And this is the second time the closely followed smoothing mechanism has halted a sell-off.
As such, it’s probably best to wait until prices break $205 before pulling the trigger. The next support zone lies at $200, so we have a $5 window for prices to cruise lower after support gives way. I’d love to forecast a bigger target, but bears need to take quick profits when they get them given the continued strong backdrop for equities.

7 Growth Stocks to Buy to Make Early Retirement a Reality
The Trade: Buy the Sep $200 put for around $5.
Stocks to Sell After Earnings: Intel (INTC)
Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade
Intel brings up the rear of today’s stocks to sell as one of the ugliest semiconductor charts out there. It’s a shame because the semiconductor industry chart is actually a stone’s throw from record highs. Sadly, Intel hasn’t participated at all for the past five months. Its last two earnings announcements gave sellers all the reasons needed to abandon ship. Tack on all the competitors in the space that boast far better fundamentals and technicals, and it’s a wonder why anyone still wants to buy INTC.
Since last week’s whack, prices have been consolidating. I’m looking for downside resolution to the pausing pattern. You could use a break of Friday’s low ($53.25) as a quick trigger or wait for a push below the pivot low of $52.30 if you need more confirmation.
The Trade: Buy the Oct $52.50/$50 put vertical for around 90 cents.

Warren Buffett Stock Ideas
About Warren Buffett: Warren Buffett is considered by many to be the greatest investor of all time. As the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 for decades, and in the process has become one of the world's richest men. (Forbes puts his net worth at $37 billion.) Despite his fortune, Buffett is known for living a modest lifestyle, by billionaire standards. His primary residence remains the gray stucco Nebraska home he purchased for $31,500 nearly 50 years ago, according to Forbes, and his folksy Midwestern manner and penchant for simple pleasures -- a cherry Coke, a good burger, and a good book are all near the top of the list -- have been well-documented.
About Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends. Validea offers both stock analysis and model portfolios based on gurus who have outperformed the market over the long-term, including Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham, Peter Lynch and Martin Zweig.

2021-08-01 00:00:00+00:00,2 Tech Stocks to Buy After Blowout Earnings Results,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-tech-stocks-to-buy-after-blowout-earnings-results-2021-08-01,,,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) reported great earnings results recently, but upcoming catalysts indicate there's more growth ahead.
Here's a review of key highlights from both companies' latest round of results, and why both stocks are great buys.
Image source: Apple.
1. Apple
Apple started to see a lift in sales a year ago after the pandemic sent everyone scrambling for new computers and tablets in order to remain productive at home. That momentum stayed with the company after the successful launch of the iPhone 12 in the fall and continued through the fiscal third quarter in June.
Apple reported a record for the quarter ended in June of $81 billion in revenue, up 36% year over year. Earnings per share came in at $1.30, beating the consensus analyst estimate by 30%.
""We're only in the early innings of 5G, but already its incredible performance and speed have made a significant impact on how people can get the most out of our technology,"" CEO Tim Cook said. The next iPhone launch could see high demand, too. Reports surfaced recently that Apple had bumped up production orders by 20% for the iPhone 13.
While the chip shortage is expected to dampen near-term sales growth, management said during the recentearnings callthat revenue should be up by double-digit rates again in the quarter containing September, although it will be lower than fiscal Q3.
Most importantly, another strong iPhone launch would be huge for Apple's growing services business. Apple now has 700 million paid subscriptions on its platform -- nearly four times the level it had in 2017. For the nine-month period ending in June, Apple finished with $50 billion in services revenue, up 28% year over year.
Apple is an iconic consumer brand with a highly satisfied installed base of users. Investors should feel safe buying and holding this tech stock for the long haul.
2. Advanced Micro Devices
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices have soared over the last five years. The chipmaker has been running circles around Intel, but AMD's revenue growth kicked up another notch a year ago, just before Sony and Microsoft launched new game consoles, which are powered by custom chips from AMD.
Image source: Advanced Micro Devices Q2 2021 earnings presentation.
In the second quarter, revenue soared 99% year over year, with earnings per share coming in at $0.58, up 346%.
AMD's segment that includes semi-custom chips used in game consoles posted a massive 183% jump in revenue growth year over year. The company credited strong demand for its EPYC server processors and increasing demand for game consoles.
The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S have been in short supply since launching last fall and have only sold a small fraction of the total installed base of the previous generation (PS4 and Xbox One). The upgrade cycle in the console market is a major catalyst for AMD in the near term, especially with the holidays right around the corner.
Meanwhile, AMD continues to see strong demand for its Radeon Instinct data center graphics processors. AMD also ramped production of Ryzen embedded central processing units (CPUs) and Radeon RDNA 2 graphics processing units (GPUs), which are being used in Tesla's in-dash infotainment systems for the latest Model S and Model X vehicles.
With all the uncertainty around the economic recovery and COVID-19, not many companies are confident enough to issue specific full-year guidance, but AMD sees a clear path to more growth. It raised its 2021 outlook for revenue to grow approximately 60% year over year.
The stock jumped after the Q2 earnings report, but one analyst sees the potential for the stock to reach $150, which is nearly 50% above the current share price. Given AMD's outlook, the analyst might be right.
Long-term, AMD appears to be in great shape. While Intel has experienced delays in launching its 7-nanometer chips, AMD has given investors a specific product road map through next year, including its plans to launch the 5-nanometer ""Zen 4"" EPYC processor to keep the pressure on its larger rival. This chip stock has legs.

2021-08-01 00:00:00+00:00,Why Don't Investors Care About IBM's Chipmaking Breakthroughs?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-dont-investors-care-about-ibms-chipmaking-breakthroughs-2021-08-01,,,"Earlier this year, IBM (NYSE: IBM) claimed to have developed the world's first 2nm chip technology. That sounded like a remarkable achievement, since Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) -- the world's most advanced chipmaker -- only started mass producing 5nm chips last year.
But investors shrugged and the news was quickly forgotten, just like IBM's introduction of the world's ""first"" 7nm chip in 2015 and 5nm chip in 2017. Meanwhile, IBM's stock declined more than 10% over the past five years as it struggled to expand its higher-growth cloud businesses rapidly enough to offset the sluggish growth of its legacy software, hardware, and IT services divisions.
Image source: IBM.
Let's take a look back at Big Blue's chipmaking breakthroughs, why investors were indifferent to those milestones, and whether or not these announcements actually matter to the company's future.
IBM's oft-overlooked chipmaking business
IBM once designed and manufactured PowerPC CPUs, which emerged from the AIM (Apple, IBM, and Motorola) alliance in the 1990s. The AIM alliance introduced PowerPC as an alternative chip architecture to challenge Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) dominance of the CPU market.
The alliance collapsed in the mid-2000s after Apple switched its Macintosh computers from PowerPC CPUs to Intel's CPUs. But IBM continued to design new Power chips, and the architecture lived on in the OpenPOWER foundation -- an open source consortium that counts IBM, Alphabet's Google, the Chinese server maker Inspur, and the Russian server maker Yadro as its platinum members.
IBM manufactured Power chips until 2014, when it agreed to pay GlobalFoundries $1.5 billion to take over the unprofitable unit. It also agreed to exclusively use GlobalFoundries to produce 22nm, 14nm, and 10nm chips for its own hardware. However, GlobalFoundries gave up on developing 10nm and 7nm chips after AMD, its former parent company, outsourced its most advanced chips to TSMC instead.
GlobalFoundries' decision sparked a lawsuit from IBM, which had expected the foundry to manufacture 10nm and 7nm Power chips for its Power System servers. That clash caused IBM to abandon GlobalFoundries and outsource the production of its newer Power chips to Samsung instead.
Today, IBM's Power CPUs are mainly confined to its Power Systems business, one of the three main pillars (along with its IBM Z mainframes and storage systems) of its Systems business. IBM generated $6.98 billion in revenue, or 9% of its top line, from its Systems business last year.
Why IBM's chip advancements are largely meaningless
IBM's creation of a 2nm chip would be significant if it could mass produce and sell them on its own, or install them into its own Power systems. But IBM doesn't manufacture its own chips anymore, it already shares its chip designs with other companies through the OpenPOWER consortium, and its most advanced 7nm Power chips are produced by Samsung -- which certainly can't mass produce 2nm chips yet.
In other words, IBM's 2nm chip is just a lab experiment. IBM claims that compared to modern 7nm chips, its 2nm chips can boost performance by 45% at the same power levels, or deliver 75% more power at the same performance levels. It also claims its chips are slightly denser than TSMC's upcoming 3nm chips, which are scheduled for mass production next year.
But shortly after IBM revealed is 2nm chip, TSMC fired back with a report detailing its own theoretical breakthrough with 1nm chips. However, TSMC doesn't expect to actually hit that milestone anytime soon -- it plans to mass produce 2nm chips in 2023, but anything beyond that is uncharted territory.
So what should IBM's investors focus on?
IBM's development of a 2nm chip sounds impressive, but it ultimately means nothing. Instead of being distracted by that flashy headline, IBM's investors should focus on three main things.
First, they should see if its cloud revenue, which rose 19% to $25.1 billion last year and accounted for over a third of its top line, continues to rise. Second, they should see if IBM's renewed focus on hybrid cloud deployments and AI services -- accelerated by its takeover of Red Hat two years ago -- will feed that growth and widen its moat against the public cloud giants.
Lastly, investors should focus on IBM's upcoming spin-off of Kyndryl, which will remove the slow-growth managed infrastructure services division from IBM's core business. That move could streamline the ""new"" IBM and enable it to aggressively expand its hybrid cloud and AI businesses -- but it could also result in lower dividend payments in the future.
Keeping track of these three things will help investors determine if IBM's stock is undervalued at 12 times forward earnings. Anything else, including its claim of creating the world's smallest chip, is just noise.

2021-07-31 00:00:00+00:00,2 Popular Stocks to Avoid in the Second Half of 2021,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-popular-stocks-to-avoid-in-the-second-half-of-2021-2021-07-31,,,"As an investor, it's easy to fall into bad habits. For instance, one of the most common mistakes is buying a stock based on momentum or hype. AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE: AMC) is a perfect example. Despite a deterioration in its fundamentals, AMC stock is up 1,770% this year as of this writing.
Alternatively, it's often tempting to invest in a market leader, even after the tide has turned. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is good example. The company still leads the semiconductor industry, and the stock looks relatively cheap. But Intel's future is questionable.
Here's why I plan to avoid both of these stocks.
Image source: Getty Images
1. AMC Entertainment Holdings
Last year, the pandemic forced AMC to close its movie theaters, driving attendance and revenue down 79% and 77%, respectively. Moreover, those numbers haven't improved in 2021. In fact, attendance and revenue dropped 89% and 84%, respectively, in the first quarter.
So, why has the stock skyrocketed? Retail investors (who call themselves ""apes"") have banded together to buy the stock in volume, in the hopes of triggering a short squeeze. To garner support, they've taken to social media like Reddit and Twitter, spreading misinformation to fuel what appears to be a massive pump-and-dump scheme.
Here's the truth: AMC's business is on the brink of bankruptcy. To stay afloat during the pandemic, the company issued new equity at a furious pace. In fact, the outstanding share count has surged 380% since Dec. 31, 2019. Even so, AMC's balance sheet still shows $5.4 billion in long-term debt and $4.9 billion in lease liabilities, but just $813 million in cash and equivalents.
If attendance doesn't improve dramatically in the near term, AMC will be forced to restructure its liabilities, either through bankruptcy or liquidation. And in both cases, shareholders would lose everything.
Perhaps the most compelling reason to avoid AMC comes from the company itself. In a recent 8-K filing with the SEC, management said: ""We believe that recent volatility and our current market prices reflect [dynamics] unrelated to our underlying business."" The statement explicitly warns investors to avoid the stock unless they are prepared to lose all or a significant portion of their investment.
That's why I wouldn't go anywhere near this stock. Moreover, if I did own shares, I'd be selling hand over fist right now.

2. Intel
Intel is the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer in terms of revenue, and the company dominates the market for central processing units (CPUs) in laptops, desktops, and data center servers. Even so, Intel has lost some prestige in recent years.
Specifically, a series of manufacturing problems forced the company to delay its 10nm processors on several occasions. In fact, chips that were slated for release in 2015 didn't actually reach the market in volume until 2019.
Unfortunately, Intel's problems didn't end there. Last year, the company pushed its 7nm chips back to late 2022 (or early 2023), once again citing manufacturing problems. Meanwhile, rival foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company lapped Intel, producing 7nm chips in 2018, and 5nm chips in 2020.
Not surprisingly, Intel has lost ground in the x86 CPU market.

These problems continued to haunt Intel in Q2 2021, as evidenced by its mediocre financial performance. Revenue came in at $19.6 billion, slightly lower than the prior year, but its data center business was the real problem. In this segment, sales dropped 9%, and that came on the heels of a 20% decline in the first quarter.
Going forward, I question Intel's ability to outperform the market. The company faces tough competition across all of its business segments, especially in its data center and client computing groups.
Moreover, persistent manufacturing problems continue to put Intel at a disadvantage. Last month, the company pushed production of its 10nm server chip (Sapphire Rapids) back to 2022. Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices is set to debut its 5nm EPYC Genoa chip during the same year. Intel is clearly falling behind its very capable competition. That's why I plan to avoid this stock.

2021-07-31 00:00:00+00:00,Why You Might Be Interested In Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) For Its Upcoming Dividend,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-you-might-be-interested-in-intel-corporation-nasdaq%3Aintc-for-its-upcoming-dividend,,,"Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase Intel's shares before the 5th of August to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of September.
The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.35 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.39 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Intel has a trailing yield of 2.6% on the current stock price of $53.72. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Intel's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.
Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Intel paid out a comfortable 30% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Fortunately, it paid out only 34% of its free cash flow in the past year.
It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.

NasdaqGS:INTC Historic Dividend July 31st 2021
Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?
Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Fortunately for readers, Intel's earnings per share have been growing at 13% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share are growing rapidly and the company is keeping more than half of its earnings within the business; an attractive combination which could suggest the company is focused on reinvesting to grow earnings further. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.
The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Intel has increased its dividend at approximately 8.2% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.
To Sum It Up
Is Intel worth buying for its dividend? We love that Intel is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.
On that note, you'll want to research what risks Intel is facing. Be aware that Intel is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is a bit concerning...
We wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see, though. Here's a list of interesting dividend stocks with a greater than 2% yield and an upcoming dividend.

2021-07-30 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why AMD's Acquisition of Xilinx Is Such a Great Deal,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-amds-acquisition-of-xilinx-is-such-a-great-deal-2021-07-30,,,"AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD) pending acquisition of Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX) is another reason AMD is a buy. Xilinx, the leading designer of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), recently reported its fiscal 2022 first-quarter results (for the three months ended July 3, 2021) showing the company is back in growth mode and generating plenty of profits. AMD is getting a great deal here and opening up a new front against longtime rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
Xilinx goes for a reasonable selling price
On its last quarterlyearnings call AMD CEO Lisa Su said its takeover of Xilinx is still expected to be complete by the end of this year. As a reminder, each Xilinx shareholder will get 1.7234 shares of AMD for every share of Xilinx they own. As of this writing, Xilinx's market cap is at just over $36 billion (to AMD's nearly $128 billion). So what is AMD actually getting from this deal?
Image source: Getty Images.
During its last quarter, Xilinx reported revenue of $879 million, up 21% from a year ago and putting the company on track to break its all-time high it last notched back in 2019. The company has been down in the dumps the last couple of years due to complications from the U.S.-China trade war followed by the coronavirus pandemic. But it's back on the rise as its data center, automaker, and broadcasting customers are in need of multipurpose and customizable chips like the FPGAs Xilinx specializes in.
Xilinx also reported free cash flow of $373 million in the quarter, an incredible 42% free-cash-flow profit margin. This isn't just a one-off eventl Xilinx consistently generates high rates of profitability from its semiconductor designs. After the last report, Xilinx has reported $1.19 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months. AMD's purchase price thus values Xilinx at about 30 times trailing 12-month free cash flow. Given the smaller company's growth and high rate of profitability, it's a pretty reasonable deal for AMD.
A great prize to add to the AMD ecosystem
Here's where things really get interesting, though. AMD of course expands the number of chips it can offer its customers with Xilinx, and takes on Intel on the FPGA front (Intel purchased FPGA companies Alterra in 2015 and Omnitek in 2019). But in spite of its relatively diminutive size, Xilinx is able to shell out lots of cash on research and development -- 28% of revenue on R&D in its last quarter alone. AMD spent 17% of its revenue on R&D in the comparable period.
For AMD, which has caught up with its peers on the technological front and is now in a leadership position on many counts, adding Xilinx to the mix will help it build on its efforts to design cutting edge semiconductors for consumer electronics and cloud computing. Xilinx's higher profit margins will elevate AMD's post-merger (AMD free cash flow margin was 23% according to its last report, to Xilinx's 42%), and along the way the two companies said they expect to be able to cut annual costs by an additional $300 million per year once the integration is complete.
Put simply, the $36 billion AMD will pay out in new stock for Xilinx is a big price tag for the scrappy semiconductor company, but the reasoning pencils out. Besides helping it break into new markets in a splashy way, Xilinx will help AMD continue to elevate its development of chips all the while increasing profit margins over time. It's one of the reasons AMD stock looks like a buy to me right now, and a reason I'll also hold on to the new AMD shares received from the merger by the end of this year.

Tesla: Changing the game
Most people think of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) as a pioneer in the field of electric vehicles (EVs). That is true enough; Tesla was the first car company to be built for EVs from the ground up, and its success has forced the rest of the auto industry to develop its own plug-in electric models.
And the company is still a leader in that sector. Many carmakers have announced that they will abandon the fossil-fuel market and refocus entirely on electric cars. They have a bit of catching up to do, though. Tesla delivered nearly 183,000 Model 3 and Model Y cars in the first quarter of 2021 and another 201,000 units in the second quarter. By comparison, Ford (NYSE: F) sold a total of 13,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs in the first half of the year. That's the most popular electric vehicle in America that is not made by Tesla, according to Car & Driver.
And that's the whole point of Tesla's market-leading EVs. CEO Elon Musk really wants Tesla to lead the world into sustainable power production and consumption, with Tesla eventually becoming a global provider of large-scale battery packs and alternative power production systems. Weaning the auto industry from oil-based fuels is an important first step toward that goal, and the car sales form the foundation of Tesla's financial platform from which it can launch more energy-focused business ideas.
Tesla explained all of this in great detail 15 years ago, but Musk's long-term plan isn't always obvious to every investor. As a result, the stock is prone to wild swings on news of a temporary nature, while the big picture continues to evolve. Today, Tesla shares are trading 28% below January's all-time highs. Meanwhile, both sales and free cash flows have doubled over the last three years:
TSLA revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months.
Tesla might not look like a value investment by traditional metrics such as price to earnings or price to sales, but the stock is deeply undervalued in the context of skyrocketing sales and a laser-like focus on long-term success. That's a bargain in my book.
Intel: Down but not out
Semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has been struggling with chipmaking technology issues in recent years, giving rival processor designers a rare opportunity to build more-advanced chips in factories operated by third-party manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) or Samsung Semiconductor.
That unfortunate situation could have been disastrous for Intel, and investors have certainly acted as if the company's salad days are over. Intel shares are trading 22% below their 52-week highs, including an 8% drop in the last month alone. You can pick up shares at the deeply discounted valuation of 12 times trailing earnings. Market makers are expecting the worst.
However, the bears should take another look at Intel's manufacturing situation. The chip sector is deep into a global supply shortage, which limits the manufacturing volumes for everybody. The pandemic boosted the global demand for electronic devices in support of work-from-home setups and home entertainment, and chip production was already constrained by the Chinese-American trade war. On top of all that, a terrible drought hit Taiwan this year, making it difficult for the many semiconductor factories on the island to find the super-clean water they need.
These industrywide challenges gave Intel some breathing room, because the company runs its own manufacturing plants in places like Arizona, Oregon, and Ireland. Taiwanese droughts are not an issue for this company. Now, Intel is throwing its hat into the ring as a third-party chipmaker itself, with firm technology-node plans stretching five generations ahead in the next four years.
Intel is investing $20 billion in its U.S. manufacturing operations and another $20 billion in European chip-building expansions over the next several years. Rumor has it that the company wants to buy privately held chip foundry GlobalFoundries in a $30 billion blockbuster deal, too. Furthermore, Intel argues that its manufacturing technologies of any particular size are comparable to smaller trace widths from any other manufacturer. For instance, the so-called Intel 7 process may rely on 10-nanometer traces but should be compared to the 7-nm platforms from Taiwan Semi or Samsung due to its highly optimized transistor architecture.
Talk is cheap, of course, but Intel is putting its money where its mouth is and has already landed a huge chip-building client in mobile processor giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM). This year is starting to look like a springboard from which Intel launches into another period of technical leadership and strong shareholder returns.

The company still managed to put up a strong showing despite the competitive challenges it has been facing from rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).
Chipzilla's results, delivered after the bell on July 22, comfortably exceeded the higher end of its guidance range, and management also raised its full-year outlook. One might think a performance like that would have been just what Intel shareholders wanted to see after the company started the year on a disappointing note. However, the beat-and-raise report failed to excite Wall Street, and Intel stock dropped in its wake.
Are investors overly negative about the chipmaker's prospects these days? Or is their pessimism reasonable given the challenges ahead?

Intel's Q2 numbers exceeded expectations
Intel's revenue increased 2% year over year in Q2 to $18.5 billion while adjusted earnings per share jumped 12% to $1.28 per share. These numbers are impressive considering management had originally guided for earnings of just $1.05 per share on $17.8 billion in revenue.
Even better, management raised its full-year revenue outlook by $1 billion to $73.5 billion, indicating that the company is witnessing an uptick in demand. In the client computing group (CCG) -- Intel's largest source of revenue last quarter -- revenue increased 6% to $10.1 billion, driven by a sharp spike in demand for notebook and desktop processors.
More specifically, sales of Intel's desktop processors shot up 15% while notebook processor volumes increased by 40%. Overall, the volume of client processors it shipped increased 33%.
What's more, CCG's operating margin grew by 7 percentage points to 37%, and its operating income increased by 32% to $3.8 billion. Management credited these improvements to lower inventory reserves as well as lower production costs on the company's 10-nanometer nodes.
However, it seems investors are focusing more on the problems revealed in Intel's latest quarterly report -- issues that could impact its performance in the long run.
Don't overlook the red flags
CCG produced nearly 55% of Intel's total Q2 revenue, so the segment is going to have a big influence on the company's direction. However, when one takes a closer look, it becomes clear that all is not well in the CCG division.
For instance, Intel's notebook processors' average selling price (ASP) was down 17% year over year. The ASP on desktop chips also dropped 5%. Those lower averages prices were the result of a rising proportion of small-core offerings in the mix. In other words, Intel is relying on lower-margin processors to drive overall sales growth. This is nothing new, as the company seems to have lost pricing power to AMD and is therefore pursuing the low-hanging fruit in the processor market to drive sales.
Wall Street is of the opinion that Intel's CCG sales growth was a result of aggressive ordering by original equipment manufacturers, which may have pulled forward demand. If that's the case, it could impact the company's sales in the holiday period. Once chipmakers are able to ramp up production and end the shortage of computer processors in the market, Intel is likely to find itself on the back foot, especially considering the manufacturing delays that are likely to push it further behind on the technology curve.
AMD's Ryzen processors, on the other hand, are selling like hotcakes despite their premium pricing, thanks to their advanced manufacturing process.
Meanwhile, the performance of Intel's data center group (DCG) confirms that the company is losing ground to AMD. That segment's revenue was down 9% year over year to $6.5 billion while operating margin contracted by a whopping 14 percentage points. Management blamed this terrible performance on the ""competitive environment,"" which isn't surprising, as AMD has been eating away at its server market share. That trend is likely to continue.
Intel has delayed the debut of its 10-nanometer Sapphire Rapids server platform until next year, while AMD is expected to move to a 5-nanometer server chip in 2022. This could result in further market share losses for Intel in the server segment.
All of this indicates that Intel isn't out of the woods yet as AMD is stifling its two primary growth drivers. The tech giant's latest earnings report does have some silver linings, but it still has a long way to go to complete its turnaround. That's why it would be a good idea to stay away from Intel stock. If it is going to become worth buying again, the company will first need to regain its pricing power and reclaim the market share it has been losing.

2021-07-28 00:00:00+00:00,Intel vs. AMD: Which Semiconductor Stock Is a Better Pick?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-vs.-amd%3A-which-semiconductor-stock-is-a-better-pick-2021-07-28,,,"Semiconductors are proving to be the engines that drive the electronics world of today, as they are being used in different applications. These include 5G, data centers, Internet of Things (IoT), mobiles, and automotive applications.
A Fortune Business Insights report indicated that while the semiconductor market was worth $425.96 billion last year, it is expected to grow to $803.15 billion in 2028. This indicates a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.6% between 2021 and 2028.
Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, let us compare two semiconductor companies, Intel and AMD, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)
Intel’s products include processors that power PCs, a stand alone system-on-a-chip (SoC), a multichip package, and memory and storage products.
In Q2, Intel reported adjusted revenue of $18.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year, and surpassed internal guidance by $700 million. Adjusted EPS came in at $1.28, exceeding internal guidance by $0.23 and beating the consensus estimate of $1.06.
Around two days back, INTC unveiled a process and packaging technology roadmap. The company’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, stated that Intel was accelerating its “innovation roadmap to ensure we are on a clear path to process performance leadership by 2025.”
Intel’s 20A process technology is expected to ramp up in 2024, while Intel 18A is currently in development and expected to debut in 2025.
However, Jeffries analyst Mark Lipacis reasoned that given the company’s poor execution when it came to transistors over the past five years, “which led to loss of transistor leadership in 2018, we think investors will be skeptical until INTC delivers on this plan.”
In other news, the company announced a new naming structure for its process nodes, “creating a clear and consistent framework to give customers a more accurate view of process nodes across the industry.”
The analyst noted that the new node naming structure would result in a better comparison with Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. (TSM) and Samsung and will eliminate confusion when it came to the names of the process nodes.
The analyst has a Hold rating and a price target of $52 (2.2% downside) on the stock.
Intel also announced the first two customers for its Intel Foundry Services, including Amazon’s Web Services (AMZN) and Qualcomm (QCOM).
The company expects to partner with QCOM when it comes to its 20A process technology, while Amazon will be the first customer to use Intel’s packaging solutions. (See Intel stock chart on TipRanks)
Again, Lipacis pointed out that investors would be skeptical “here as well until these customers actually start shipping in volume.”
However, the analyst believed that Intel’s advanced packaging technologies, like EMIB and Foveros, had “the potential to offer differentiated capabilities.” But Lipacis also expected that these businesses would likely “put downward pressure on INTC gross margins.”
For FY21, INTC plans to spend between $19 billion to $20 billion in capex. According to Lipacis, the company plans to spend $23.5 billion in capex for its facilities in Arizona and New Mexico and intends to announce more facilities in European Union and the U.S. by the end of the year.
The analyst thinks that this will further drag down margins in the range of 50% to 55% beyond 2021. Lipacis added, “Intel also reiterated its plans to use 3rd party foundry capacity and become a leading foundry edge foundry to serve customers globally. We believe this strategy will also prove to be dilutive to gross margins.”
Turning to the rest of the Street, consensus is that INTC is a Hold, based on 9 Buys, 11 Holds, and 8 Sells. The average Intel price target of $60.86 implies a 14.4% upside potential to current levels.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Yesterday, AMD delivered stellar Q2 results with revenues of $3.85 billion, a jump of 99% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings soared 250% to $0.63 per share year-over-year and beat the Street’s estimate of $0.54 per share.
In Q3, AMD has projected revenues of $4.1 billion (plus or minus $100 million), representing a sequential-quarterly increase of 6%, driven by solid growth in its data center and gaming businesses.
Following the strong Q2 results, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh raised the price target from $107 to $110 (20.8% upside) and reiterated a Buy on the stock. Rakesh noted that AMD saw continued strength in Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) demand with strong adoption for the company’s Milan data center and cross-over from its earlier generation Rome data center.
AMD raised its non-GAAP gross margin outlook for Q3 from 47% to 48%. Based on AMD’s guidance for operating expenses (opex) to be 25% of revenues for FY21, Rakesh expects softening of operating margin in the second half of the year. (See AMD stock chart on TipRanks)
The analyst added, “We have noted AMD potentially needs to increase its field support to compete with INTC.”
Datacenter revenues made up more than 20% of the company’s total revenues in Q2. Rakesh noted that meanwhile, Intel’s Q2 data center revenues were $6.5 billion, up 16% quarter-over-quarter. AMD noted at itsearnings call “We believe that the data center business will continue to be a strong driver for us into the second half of the year.”
Analyst Rakesh noted, “Although AMD's lead times are >20 weeks vs. INTC at 1-2 weeks and we believe AMD's server share gains are supply constrained heading into 2H21, AMD noted it has been making progress to alleviate constraints.”
The analyst stated that next year seems to be “a Server roadmap battle.”
He reviewed the upcoming servers from AMD’s competitors and commented, “INTC’s Sapphire Rapids delay into 1H2022 is expected to drive a better competitive roadmap and close some gaps with AMD’s Milan and 5nm Genoa, though we believe AMD currently retains the performance lead.”
The analyst added that he believes that AMD is well-positioned, with strong demand trends for its ""7nm [nanometer] or 5nm Server chip roadmap ahead of INTC.""
Turning to the rest of the Street, consensus is that AMD is a Strong Buy, based on 11 Buys and 2 Holds. The average AMD price target of $114.27 implies a 25.5% upside potential to current levels.
Bottom Line
While analysts are sidelined on Intel, they are bullish about AMD. Considering the business transformation that Intel is going through, analysts seem to be in a wait-and-watch mode with the company.
Even Jeffries analyst Mark Lipacis’s channel checks and analyses have indicated that AMD is likely to “build on its momentum from market share gains in the 1st quarter of 300bps and 150bps of CPU [central processing unit] revenue share QQ in dual servers and notebooks.”
Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, AMD seems to be a better Buy.

WASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - A bipartisan panel in the U.S. Congress on Tuesday blasted U.S.-based corporate sponsors of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, including Coca-Cola, Visa Inc and Airbnb, accusing them of putting profits ahead of accusations of genocide in China.
Republican Representative Chris Smith said in a hearing of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China that the sponsors needed to reconcile their ""ostensible commitment to human rights"" with subsidizing an Olympics where the host country is ""actively committing human rights abuses.""
Smith asked each of the executives representing Airbnb ABNB.O, Coca-Cola KO.N, Intel INTC.O, Visa Inc V.N and Procter & Gamble PG.N whether the Beijing Olympics should be relocated or postponed due to concerns over human rights violations. All of them declined to opine, or said they had no responsibility over site selection.
""We do not make decisions on these host locations. We support and follow the athletes wherever they compete,"" said Paul Lalli, Coca-Cola's global vice president for human rights.
When asked about the U.S. government determination that China was committing a genocide against Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups, only Steve Rodgers, executive vice president and general counsel for Intel, said he believed it.
""I've read the State Department report. I've studied it, and I believe its conclusions,"" Rodgers said, drawing praise from Republican Senator Tom Cotton for his ""straight answer.""
Other executives said they respected the U.S. government's conclusions, but would not weigh in on the matter.
The executives represent the five U.S. companies that have sponsorship commitments running through the Beijing Games under the official Olympic Partner (TOP) Program.
Rights groups, researchers, former residents and some Western lawmakers and officials say Chinese authorities have facilitated forced labor by detaining around one million Uyghurs and other primarily Muslim minorities in camps since 2016.
President Joe Biden's administration agreed with a determination by the former Trump administration that the detention camps and other abuses amounted to genocide.
China denies wrongdoing, saying it has set up vocational training centers to combat extremism.
Liu Pengyu, spokesman for China's embassy in Washington, said the commission was ""obsessed with making up all sorts of lies to vilify China"" and that China had every confidence it would host an outstanding Olympic event.
'YOU ARE AFRAID'
Cotton called testimony at the hearing ""pathetic and disgraceful.""
""Obviously, every one of you, with the exception on occasion of Mr. Rodgers, was sent here with orders not to say anything that could offend the Chinese Communist Party,"" he said.
Democratic Representative Tom Malinowski rebuked David Holyoke, Airbnb's head of Olympics and Paralympics partnership, for not being more outspoken about criticism toward the Chinese government that it has prevented Uyghurs and Tibetans from obtaining passports and identification cards that would allow them to travel freely and register at hotels.
""In China we are required to follow local laws and regulations,"" Holyoke said, adding that ""human rights are core to our values.""
""You're just completely absolving yourself of responsibility for being complicit in abject discrimination,"" Malinowski said.
Asked repeatedly by Malinowski if Coca-Cola would specifically condemn any Chinese government abuses against Uyghurs, Lalli said without mentioning China: ""We respect all human rights.""
Malinowski noted that Coca-Cola was willing to wade into U.S. politics and condemn voting rights restrictions in its home state of Georgia, but would not criticize China's government.
""You are afraid of them in a way that you are not afraid of critics in the United States. I think that's shameful,"" Malinowski told Lalli, adding that it was ""absolutely clear"" that the company refused to criticize Beijing for fear it would harm its profits in China.

2021-07-28 00:00:00+00:00,"ANALYSIS-Apple, AMD navigate chip shortage with focus on profitable products",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-apple-amd-navigate-chip-shortage-with-focus-on-profitable-products-2021-07-28,,,"By Stephen Nellis and Subrat Patnaik
July 28 (Reuters) - The global chip shortage has grounded major automotive factories to a halt but pushed technology giants to become more flexible by diverting existing supplies to their most profitable products, analysts and executives said.
Apple Inc AAPL.O said on Tuesday chip shortages had mostly affected its iPad and Mac products in its last quarter, but would start to bite into its mainstay iPhone business, its best seller and major profit driver, in the current quarter.
""We'll do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances we're dealt,"" Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in a post earnings conference call.
The comments provide an insight into how Apple, known for its deft supply chain management through long-term supply deals with Broadcom Inc AVGO.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, is dealing with the shortage ahead of the crucial holiday quarter when it sells millions of its new line of flagship phones.
Some analysts believe Apple could be prioritizing chip supplies for its new phones during the July-September quarter, which is typically the sleepiest for iPhone sales as shoppers hold out for upcoming models.
""I think it largely reflects the timing of new product releases, specifically related to new iPhone launches in September,"" Angelo Zino, an analyst with research firm CFRA, said of Apple's warning.
Even in normal times, he said, ""new phone cycles typically start off supply constrained given the high demand needs ahead of the holiday selling season.""
And even within Apple's current lineup, the company is likely to direct the supply chain pain to its least lucrative products, said Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint Research.
Its flagship phones also drive revenue from paid subscription services and accessories like AirPods.
""Assuming Apple prioritizes the iPhone 12 family, it probably affects iPads, Macs and older iPhones more,"" Fieldhack said.
The global chip shortage stems from a combination of factors including the fallout from last year's COVID-19 shutdowns and factories struggling to meet demand for semiconductors, which have become omnipresent in an increasingly digitized world.
The supply squeeze took the auto industry by surprise. Car makers like Ford Motor Co F.N and General Motors Co GM.N had to halt production lines for their popular pick-ups at a time when demand was booming as economies started to open up.
The auto industry relies almost exclusively on chips from a few manufacturers, so-called foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) and South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS. The shortage has exposed this reliance on overseas suppliers as an Achilles' heel for many companies.
STRATEGIC FOCUS
Technology companies, the traditional consumers of semiconductors, have been more nimble.
Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O, which makes central processor chips for PCs and data center servers, has also been redirecting supplies.
The company, which has a new family of chips that outperform offerings from larger rival Intel Corp INTC.O, has steadily made gains in unit sales market share against the chip giant, which retains more than 80% of the overall market.
AMD has responded to limited industry capacity by focusing on selling only its most profitable chips, leaving the lower end of the market to Intel, said Dean McCarron of Mercury Research, which tracks market share among chipmakers.
Intel has also been struggling with its own set of challenges with manufacturing in recent years, causing it to fall behind AMD and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O.
""We're focusing on the most strategic segments of the PC market,"" AMD CEO Lisa Su told investors on a conference call.
""We believe that the data center business will continue to be a strong driver for us into the second half of the year.""

2021-07-27 00:00:00+00:00,"Dow Jones Falls Below 35,000 on Boeing and Tech Stock Sell-Offs, Delta Variant Worries",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dow-jones-falls-below-35000-on-boeing-and-tech-stock-sell-offs-delta-variant-worries-2021,,,"So much for another record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) was down 232 points as of 2:03 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, back below 35,000 just one trading session after hitting a record high. Shares of beleaguered semiconductor maker Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) were down almost 4%, with fellow tech giants Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) down almost 2%, and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) off 1.5% or more ahead of earnings reports after market close this afternoon.
Shares of aerospace giant Boeing (NYSE: BA) were also off more than 2% today, joining broader stock market declines as investors once again weigh the implications of the delta coronavirus variant taking a bite out of what has been a very strong global economic resurgence.

Tech giants tumble ahead of anticipated earnings, coronavirus worries
Tech stocks are in a bit of a sell-off, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT: XLK), which tracks all of the tech stocks in the S&P 500 Index, down 2% at this writing and the worst-performing sector in the index. Looking at the Dow Jones' tech components, they're all trading lower today.
Intel's post-earnings sell-off continues. Since it reported earnings after market close on July 22, shares are down more than 6%. Today's move lower for Intel is likely tied to this afternoon's earnings release from AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), which is expected to report continued market share gains from Intel.
For Apple and Microsoft, which will report after the market closes today, their declines are likely tied to today's broader market declines, with both companies expected to deliver record results. The NASDAQ Composite and Russell 2000 indexes are both down nearly 2% at this writing, as investors continue to weigh the risks of the ongoing surge in COVID cases due to the delta variant potentially upending a global economic recovery.
3M beats expectations, raises full-year outlook
3M (NYSE: MMM) reported second-quarter results before trading opened today, with revenue up 28% to $8.9 billion, and earnings up 15% to $2.25 per share. For the first six months of the fiscal year, earnings are up more than 19% to $5.36 per share.
Based on these strong results, and expectations that business will continue to be strong for the rest of the year, management boosted its full-year outlook. It expects full-year sales will grow 8.5% at the midpoint of guidance, with full-year EPS of $9.90 at the midpoint. At the end of the prior quarter, management was expecting sales to grow 6.5% for the full year, and EPS of $9.45.
Healthcare execs cautiously optimistic about the delta variant
The delta variant is a significant threat to the unvaccinated, as well as some higher-risk individuals who have been vaccinated, according to healthcare experts. However, executives of pharma and medical device companies Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) and Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG), and healthcare (and Dow Jones component) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) all had generally positive things to say about the limited risk the variant is likely to have for their prospects.
Two things are particularly compelling about the comments from these three companies' CEOs. First, they're all leaders of healthcare businesses with expertise that should make them better at measuring the delta variant's risk than leaders of other companies are. Second, none of these companies count on a coronavirus therapy or vaccine for a major portion of their business. (Johnson & Johnson's coronavirus vaccine is a tiny contributor to its overall business.)
Put it together, and that's helpful for investors more broadly. It's not the same as saying that we shouldn't expect a market crash, or that there will be a perfectly healthy and uninterrupted economic recovery, but it is helpful in factoring in the near-term risks of the delta variant.
