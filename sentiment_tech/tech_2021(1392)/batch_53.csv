2021-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Marvell Technology Group vs. Broadcom,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-marvell-technology-group-vs.-broadcom-2021-08-03,,,"Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) have delivered strong upside to investors in the past year thanks to catalysts such as the deployment of 5G wireless networks, increase in data center capacity, higher usage of chips in the automotive industry, and the booming demand for 5G smartphones.
But if investors had to choose just one of these two high-flying chipmakers, which one should they buy?
MRVL data by YCharts
The case for Marvell Technology Group
Marvell is a high-growth company that's benefiting from its presence in lucrative niches. The company's revenue increased 20% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to $832 million. Its earnings jumped to $0.29 per share from $0.18 per share in the year-ago period, driven by the nice jump in the revenue as well as stronger margins.
Marvell recorded an adjusted gross margin of 64.3% during the quarter, up from 62.8% during the year-ago period, continuing its trend of consistently improving the margin profile over the past year.
The good part is that Marvell is just getting started. Its Q2 revenue guidance of $1.065 billion would translate into 46% year-over-year growth, with the acquisition of chipmaker Inphi expected to add $215 million to the company's top line during the quarter. What's more, Marvell's adjusted gross margin estimate of 64% is an improvement over the year-ago period's figure of 63.3%.
Analysts expect Marvell to maintain this impressive momentum for the next two fiscal years. The company's revenue is expected to jump nearly 42% this year and more than 19% next year. Its earnings are expected to hit $1.39 per share in fiscal 2022 and $1.85 per share in fiscal 2023, up from $0.92 per share last year. However, don't be surprised to see Marvell maintain such robust growth in the long run.

The company is helping telecom carriers deploy 5G networks across the globe, supplying its chips to the likes of Nokia and Samsung. The South Korean giant announced earlier this year that it has developed a chip platform with Marvell that will be deployed in 5G networks from the second quarter of 2021. Samsung is using the chip platform to power its massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) radios that are in tremendous demand in the 5G era.
Allied Market Research estimates the MIMO market could clock a compound annual growth rate of 35% through 2027. The Samsung partnership gives Marvell a ticket to attack this huge market as the Korean company has won deals to deploy 5G networks in the U.S. and Japan and is now conducting trials with telecom carriers in Europe.
Nokia, on the other hand, controls 25% to 30% of the 5G radio access network (RAN) outside China, according to the Dell'Oro Group. Last year, Nokia struck a partnership with Marvell to develop 5G radio technology, which should pave the way for the latter to tap into another fast-growing opportunity.
Throw in the catalysts in the storage space, which is doing well thanks to the strong demand for enterprise hard-disk drives and solid-state drives, and it becomes easier to see why Marvell is poised for long-term growth.
The case for Broadcom
The growing demand for semiconductors has helped Broadcom switch into a higher gear. The chipmaker's 2021 fiscal Q2 revenue increased 15% year over year to $6.6 billion, while adjusted earnings per share jumped to $6.62 per share from $5.14 per share in the prior-year period.
Broadcom gets its revenue from two segments -- semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. The semiconductor business is the one that's moving the needle in a big way for the company, as it produced nearly 73% of the top line in the second quarter. The segment recorded 20% year-over-year revenue growth during the quarter to $4.8 billion. The semiconductor business derives its revenue by supplying chips to the networking, broadband, server storage, wireless, and industrial end markets.
The good part is that Broadcom is witnessing solid momentum across all of these end markets. The broadband business, which accounted for 18% of the company's semiconductor revenue in Q2, recorded a 28% year-over-year revenue increase on the back of increased infrastructure investments by service providers to boost connectivity. The chipmaker expects this momentum to continue as service providers upgrade broadband infrastructure to next-generation technologies.
For instance, next-generation 10G passive optical networks (PON) account for only 30% of the overall network. Meanwhile, cable operators in the U.S. are now deploying next-generation modems to enable faster broadband speeds. In all, Broadcom expects the broadband investment cycle to continue into 2022.
The networking business is the next big growth driver of the semiconductor systems business, producing 32% of the segment's revenue last quarter. Broadcom saw 10% year-over-year growth in this segment on the back of robust demand from hyper cloud data centers and telecom companies. Looking ahead, Broadcom expects hyper cloud infrastructure providers to upgrade their infrastructure and drive further growth in the routing business.
However, the enterprise segment has been a weak link, with revenue from the segment down 16% last quarter. The good news is that Broadcom sees a recovery in this business thanks to the deployment of new server chip platforms from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.
And finally, the wireless business that accounted for 34% of semiconductor revenue last quarter is in fine form. The segment recorded 48% year-over-year growth last quarter as Broadcom saw higher-than-expected demand. The company also recorded content gains in Wi-Fi chips and wireless connectivity chips used in smartphones.
It is worth noting that the wireless segment seems capable of sustaining its high levels of growth as Broadcom is supplying chips to 5G smartphone OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), such as Samsung and Apple. The iPhone maker is one of Broadcom's key customers as it has struck an agreement with the latter to buy $15 billion worth of smartphone chips through the second half of 2023. And given that the 5G smartphone market is set to record explosive growth in the coming years, Broadcom could turn out to be a top 5G stock in the long run.
The verdict
Both companies are sitting on solid growth drivers that could help them deliver sustained upside to investors, but Broadcom seems to have an edge.
First, Broadcom's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 8 makes it cheaper than Marvell, which trades at 13 times sales. (Marvell's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 45 is also on the expensive side compared to Broadcom's multiple of 23.)
Second, Broadcom sports a dividend yield of almost 3% as compared to Marvell's yield of just 0.4%.
Additionally, Broadcom's supplier relationship with smartphone giants Apple and Samsung will allow it to take advantage of the 5G smartphone market's rapid growth, an area where Marvell will miss out, as it exited this business years ago. Of course, Marvell stands to gain from the 5G infrastructure market, but Broadcom isn't going to miss out on that opportunity either: It too has partnered with Nokia to make chips for 5G base stations.
All of this makes Broadcom a better long-term bet, especially considering its cheap valuation and juicy dividend.

2021-07-22 00:00:00+00:00,September 3rd Options Now Available For Marvell Technology,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/september-3rd-options-now-available-for-marvell-technology-2021-07-22,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available today, for the September 3rd expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new September 3rd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $57.00 strike price has a current bid of 51 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $57.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $56.49 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $57.70/share today.
Because the $57.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.89% return on the cash commitment, or 7.59% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $57.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $58.00 strike price has a current bid of 73 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $57.70/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $58.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 1.79% if the stock gets called away at the September 3rd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $58.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $58.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.27% boost of extra return to the investor, or 10.74% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $57.70) to be 44%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-07-14 00:00:00+00:00,Why Marvell Technology Group Stock Jumped 23% in the First Half of 2021,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-marvell-technology-group-stock-jumped-23-in-the-first-half-of-2021-2021-07-14,,,"What happened
Shares of semiconductor designer Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) jumped 23% during the first half of 2021, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
After a couple of years' worth of chip industry hardship (first from the U.S.-China trade war, followed by the start of the pandemic), sales are rallying strongly this year. Marvell's revenue increased 20% year over year to $832 million during its fiscal 2022 first quarter (which ended May 1), and management indicated it sees more upside ahead due to a global shortage of chips.
So what
Marvell specializes in data processing units (DPUs -- chips that coordinate the flow of information in large computing systems like data centers and mobile network infrastructure) and related hardware. It's been steadily expanding its portfolio of tech circuitry with new designs that can handle high-end workloads like cloud-based artificial intelligence and advanced driver-assist systems in vehicles.
It also completed the acquisition of Inphi at the end of April, building on its DPU lineup with circuitry that can handle the actual high-speed transfer of data in a computing system.

Excluding the $22 million in sales it recognized from Inphi at the tail end of the first quarter, Marvell's stand-alone sales were up 17% from the same period a year ago. The company is expecting its business (excluding Inphi) will continue to grow by a similar rate in the second quarter and could accelerate in the second half of the year as 5G network construction continues and companies spend to upgrade their data centers and other network equipment in support of new cloud computing capabilities.
Now what
Management's specific guidance for the second quarter calls for revenue of $1.065 billion. Of that total, $215 million is expected to come from Inphi, which would represent a 23% increase from a year ago when the network hardware outfit was still on its own. The remaining revenue ($850 million) will be made up of Marvell's existing business and represents about a 17% year-over-year increase.
Marvell's profitability will dip as it starts to digest the cost of acquiring and integrating Inphi into its operation, but the addition of the higher-growth and higher-profit-margin hardware firm will boost Marvell's overall financial strength in the long term. This is a top semiconductor industry stock to keep an eye on as its data center, telecom, and automotive markets grow at a steady clip in the years ahead.

New challenges like remote workforces, talent shortages, and an accelerated need to build more digital-first systems have many organizations scrambling to update their operations. Artificial intelligence software can automate these new processes, and help companies keep up with the fast-changing world we live in. As a result, tech researcher Gartner expects global spending on ""hyperautomation"" (read: AI software and systems) to reach nearly $600 billion in 2022, up from about $530 billion this year.
AI is already a huge industry, and there's plenty more growth to be had out there. Three stocks operating in this space that are worth a look in July are Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL), Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Let's find out a bit more about these three stocks with AI connections.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Marvell Technology: New data systems require a new type of chip
Marvell specializes in the design of chips that coordinate the movement of large amounts of data. Leading semiconductor companies have been scooping up smaller rivals in recent years to consolidate the market as customer needs get increasingly complex, and Marvell has emerged as one of the leaders on this front. Its data processing units (DPUs) and ethernet technology play important roles in data centers and other complex computing systems, and the company is expanding its share of the silicon industry.
Data centers and the cloud services they enable have become a basic computing unit. Marvell DPUs are some of the most advanced chips on the market, able to handle the massive amounts of information needed to train and deploy AI and other large software systems. But big data crunching functionality isn't just the realm of data centers anymore -- these days, the equipment enabling 5G mobile networks, connected industrial equipment, and automobiles are also types of mini data centers and need computing power in real-time at the source of data collection. Marvell's portfolio of circuitry (which includes the recently acquired connectivity hardware outfit Inphi) is well suited for all of these diverse tasks.
Marvell's revenue increased 20% year over year during the first quarter (up 17% when excluding $22 million in sales from Inphi during the period). Profitability is expected to dip in the short term as the Inphi takeover is absorbed, but management expects its most recent acquisition to boost the bottom line overall in time. Free cash flow over the last 12-month stretch was $523 million, for a free-cash-flow profit margin of 17%.
This is a historically low profit margin for Marvell, but the new tech and research Inphi brings to the table will eventually pay off. Marvell stock currently trades for 74 times trailing 12-month free cash flow, a long-term value for this growing data and connectivity provider thanks to its temporary bottom-line hit. With a new upgrade cycle underway for data centers and mobile networks and things like cars increasingly reliant on computer systems, Marvell is a top player in the semiconductor universe right now.

2. Micron Technology: This is a new digital memory market
Speaking of semiconductor stocks, Micron is another top play on automation-enabling hardware. After all, training a computer to mimic the decision-making process of a human being requires not just the coordination of massive amounts of data, but also somewhere to store all of that information. That's where Micron's stable of digital memory chips comes in.
Memory is one of the most basic staples of the computing industry. Because of this commoditized status, companies like Micron that design and manufacture memory chips have historically been very volatile. Periods of booming sales and profits are followed by lean times -- and often accompanied by losses. As a result, Micron stock has been highly volatile as it has followed these boom-bust cycles over the years.
However, management has taken steps to address this. It has been focusing its attention on the most advanced data needs of its customers and exiting lower-margin parts of the industry. This focus on higher-order memory chips (including AI in areas like data centers, smartphones, and advanced driver assist systems in cars) is starting to pay off. During the last cyclical downturn that started in late 2018 (hastened by the U.S.-China trade war) and continued through 2020 (during the initial economic lockdowns at the start of the pandemic), Micron barely dipped into free-cash-flow negative territory. Now back in growth mode and with plenty of demand in the decade ahead, this chipmaker is in great shape.
Revenue was up 37% year over year in the last quarter to $7.4 billion, and adjusted net income more than doubled to $2.2 billion. The run isn't over, either. In the final three months of its current fiscal year (which ends at the beginning of September 2021), the company expects revenue to be about $8.2 billion, close to the all-time high last reached back in 2018. Shares trade for just over 13 times expected current fiscal year adjusted earnings per share. With a global chip shortage keeping sales on the rise for the foreseeable future, it isn't too late to pick up this digital memory leader.

3. Apple: A proven winner finding a breath of fresh air
Marvell and Micron are both behind-the-scenes companies enabling AI, but Apple is helping put the power of software automation into the hands of consumers, small businesses, and other organizations that put Apple devices to work. Sales are booming across product categories. The flagship iPhone 12 is the first-ever 5G network-ready device, new MacBooks feature Apple's own in-house-designed M1 processors, and the Watch is unlocking new innovations on the digitally connected health and wellness front. Though this is already one of the largest publicly traded companies on the planet, Apple is still growing at a fast pace through its technology leadership.
Among the biggest tech companies out there, Apple looks like quite the deal right now at just 27 times trailing 12-month free cash flow. Revenue surged 54% higher year over year in its quarter ended in March 2021. And while there could be a slowdown in the next period (which will be lapping the initial effects of the pandemic from last spring, offset by product supply constraints from the global reopening of the economy), Apple's business is otherwise firing on all cylinders at the moment.
Paired with long-term growth of sales and profitability, Apple is also returning massive amounts of cash to shareholders. It increased its quarterly dividend by 7% and added $90 billion to its share repurchase program.
Apple is the most powerful consumer electronics company on the planet, and AI-powered devices and services will be a promising new front in the decade ahead. Armed with $87 billion in net cash, equivalents, and investments on its balance sheet, this is still a core stock to build a portfolio around.

he semiconductor space has advanced dramatically over the past year, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digitalization across all sectors. As the semiconductor industry grapples with surging demand, transparency into the supply chain is critical, according to Mike Splinter, chairman of Nasdaq's board of directors.
""The companies that make semiconductors have to have extraordinary visibility through their supply chain, and transparency and dialogue would really help,"" Splinter, who also serves as a director on the board of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), said during an interview with Nasdaq Global Markets reporter Jill Malandrino at a recent visit to the Nasdaq MarketSite. 
The demand for semiconductors has been building amid the rise of new technologies – from 5G and streaming to artificial intelligence and advanced driver assistance systems. However, as Splinter noted, while demand has increased, only a few companies can make the most advanced semiconductors, resulting in widespread shortages. Already this year, several automakers, such as Ford, as well as phone manufacturers, have had to adjust their production levels due to the chip shortage.
""To make a smartphone or a computer, you need many different kinds of semiconductors. So that's why the whole industry is moving to try to attack that shortage, build more capacity and get those chips in the marketplace, so we stave off the shortage,"" said Splinter. 
As the industry works to increase supply, Splinter acknowledged that improved transparency from the end-users about how they're viewing demand is ""critically important,"" as developing a semiconductor fabrication plant is quite expensive – roughly $20 billion, he estimated – and takes several years to build and begin production.  
""Now there is a confluence of different applications and technologies that need semiconductors like never before, so I think there's going to be very, very strong demand in these next few years,"" Splinter said. ""The opportunities are tremendous."" 
As investors gauge the rapid development of this space, Nasdaq offers a leading benchmark for the semiconductor industry: the PHLX Semiconductor Sector IndexTM (SOXTM). The index is modified market capitalization-weighted and composed of companies primarily involved in the design, distribution, manufacture, and sale of semiconductors. Some of the securities in the index include Marvell Technology (MRVL), Qualcomm (QCOM), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA) and Texas Instruments (TXN), plus 25 others. 
Since its launch in 1993, SOX has become one of the best-known and most widely tracked subsector indexes. Leading asset managers from across the globe license SOX to create their ETFs, including Invesco in the U.S. (SOXQ), Cathay in Taiwan (00830) and Mirae Asset Management in Korea (381180).

Breaking out to new highs almost daily, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is the darling of the technology sector.
Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.com
NVDA outpaced Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which is slowly finding new yearly highs, and 28 out of 29 analysts rate it as a buy, according to Tipranks.
Still, the average price target is $763, which suggests no near-term upside.
Revenue momentum continues to rise, so expect Wall Street to raise their price targets after Nvidia’s next earnings report.

7 Best Value Stocks to Buy If You Need Some Market Stability in Your Life
On June 28, Nvidia said it would create the industry’s first AI-on-5G lab with Google Cloud.
This would speed the development of AI Everywhere. The pair will enable network infrastructure players and AI software partners to adapt various 5G and AI applications.
The lab will offer Nvidia accelerated computing hardware and software platforms and Google Cloud’s Anthos platform. Platform development starts in the second half of this year.
The partnership will further widen Nvidia’s addressable market in the AI and 5G space.
It also raises awareness of Nvidia’s Aerial software development kit on the BlueField-2 A100. That is a converged card having GPUs and DPUs. It also has Nvidia’s 5T for 5G solution.
Nvidia’s extended support for Arm-based CPUs is a positive development. Customers get more choices on the 5G ecosystem.
ARM Acquisition and NVDA Stock
Nvidia is waiting for regulators to approve its $40 billion acquisition of ARM.
Three big companies — Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), and MediaTek — publicly supported the deal. Conversely, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is ready to invest in ARM if the deal collapses.
Qualcomm would benefit from taking ARM. The company failed to acquire NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) a few years ago. In the last year, NXPI shares rose by 80% from yearly lows.
Furthermore, as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) takes its chip design and production in-house, Qualcomm’s market shrinks.
Shareholders will need to wait for regulators to approve the Arm acquisition. Once that happens, Nvidia’s market share will grow.
This will lift Nvidia’s revenue and increase its profits. The company’s cash flow may grow so much that dividends will rise from 64 a cent, which is below a 0.1% yield.
Crypto Still Has a Role
The cryptocurrency’s $64,000 peak did little to hurt NVDA stock. Markets are anticipating bitcoin and Ethereum to rally back, eventually.
Cryptocurrency miners will still need more Nvidia GPUs. This will pressure supply and keep prices at high levels. Nvidia’s profit margins will expand as a result.
Nvidia’s launch of a new anti-crypto mining GPU to replace the RTX 3060 is only symbolic.
The prices of gaming GPUs are still through the roof. Plus, they are out of stock. Gamers have to wait for months to get a new Nvidia card.
Investors can expect that the market will face GPU shortages for at least another six months. The pandemic, higher cryptocurrency mining and supply chain disruptions earlier this year will keep GPUs in short supplies.
Media sites reported that AMD and Nvidia are making improvements to alleviate the chip shortage. Still, this is only speculation. Online retailers are still out of stock on Nvidia products. Those who have inventory are selling at prices far above their MSRPs.
The Risks Are Minimal
Nvidia scores more than 80/100 on growth and quality. Its value score is 65/100, according to stockrover.
Valuation risks only matter if Nasdaq faces a stock market correction. That came and went in Feb. 2021. Without any market headwinds, Nvidia’s valuations will not matter.
The cloud computing and consumer markets are growing briskly. Investors will get rewarded by buying NVDA shares at any price.
Sure, a sudden steep drop in cryptocurrency is possible, but a bear market is unlikely if history is a guide. That will lead to a supply shortage and excess demand for Nvidia cards.

Each company has its reasons for supporting the acquisition. Still, the widespread consensus is that this acquisition will help accelerate innovation and adoption of the Arm-based technology, which can fuel the growth of numerous companies.
The excitement of the upcoming stock split and the backing for the Arm acquisition by major semiconductor companies has fueled the stock price to reach new levels. Now NVIDIA could risk seeing a downturn in stock if any negative news comes out toward the acquisition.

Before I get into my take on Nokia (NYSE:NOK), I should start with a disclosure. Among the myriad topics to cover in the equities sector, telecommunications may be my least favorite. So I’ll gladly declare that you should take my opinions about NOK stock with a massive grain of salt.

That said, the general consensus regarding its bullish argument appears to revolve around its comeback potential. As you know, the prior presidential administration’s crackdown on China’s Huawei due to security concerns shut the telecom giant out of key markets. Right there, you have a compelling fundamental argument for NOK stock, though the nuance of geopolitics makes it tricky.
But just as importantly, Nokia may benefit handsomely from a long overdue pivot. As InvestorPlace Markets Analyst Joanna Makris pointed out, years ago, “Nokia fumbled badly by choosing programmable chips, called FPGAs, for its wireless radios.” She went onto explain the following:
Although former CEO Rajeev Suri saw it as a key differentiator at the time, FPGAs are far more expensive than ASICs, which are made by semiconductor firms like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL). They also consume more power. For Nokia, this decision has resulted in profit margin erosion and a reputation for inferior 5G equipment.
Now, Makris wrote, “Nokia is making a U-turn. The company has overhauled less than 40% of its equipment to ASICs,” though the “transition won’t be fully complete until the end of next year.” You can look at this dynamic from two angles. On one hand, “Nokia still has a long way to go before its costs go down.”

On the other hand, it’s the necessary step that the company needs to make. And betting on NOK stock now while everyone else is fearful or skeptical can lead to big gains down the line.
Technical Posture for NOK Stock Perplexingly Vague
This is not an easy investment to make. To be sure, betting on solid publicly traded companies that encountered rough waters offers tremendous upside potential. Once those waters fade, the equity unit will likely jump higher.
But the problem with NOK stock is that the headwinds are not ones you should dismiss outright. Makris further makes an excellent point in that while the bulls celebrate Nokia’s positive pivot, its competitors have not made that costly mistake.
Imagine qualifying last in a race. You have the opportunity to pass several competitors. But at the end of the race, you might only end up in the middle of the pack. On the other end, those who qualified higher wouldn’t have passed as many folks but their efforts would result in a superior ranking.
That to me seems to be where NOK stock currently sits. Earlier efforts are encouraging but Nokia only ended up passing back-markers. Now it faces the real competition, which makes the investment narrative both intriguing and frustrating.
Looking at the technicals, I don’t get an easier read. Indeed, the technical interpretation matches the fundamental implications behind NOK stock.

Based on the time-of-writing price of $5.10, NOK stock made a strong impression. On a year-to-date basis, shares have gained 31%. To be fair, it’s down nearly 6% over the trailing week. Still, the shares pushed higher, preventing a retest of its long-term support line.
Nevertheless, the challenge with Nokia stock is that it remains mired in a bearish trend channel that dates back to the start of the Great Recession. From the analysis above, the current price point isn’t enough to break above the channel. Therefore, we’re left in limbo: will it or won’t it?
Treat Nokia Like a Coin Toss
There’s an argument to be made that since the first quarter doldrums of 2020, the rise of NOK stock has been robust and confidence inspiring. I won’t necessarily disagree. It’s possible that Nokia shares can rally from here.
Still, I must say that we’ve seen this story before. In the second half of 2016, NOK attempted to break out of a declining trend. It was successful but it failed to break above the resistance line of the aforementioned bearish trend channel. Then, the novel coronavirus pandemic happened and everything went back to square one.
So, will this rally spark a different outcome now that the pandemic is fading in many parts of the world? This is where I go back to Makris’ argument. Yes, the rally is encouraging but it’s also true that the competition did not incur the missteps Nokia did. Therefore, I’m going to be on the skeptical side of things.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 18 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Marvell Technology Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $42.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $70.00. The standard deviation is $7.866.
But the whole reason to look at the average MRVL price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with MRVL crossing above that average target price of $56.67/share, investors in MRVL have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $56.67 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

In-line with my previous predictions, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) stock continues to grow.

The company has rapidly accelerated as its products and execution have greatly improved under its new CEO.
Moreover, the company continues to have multiple, strong, positive catalysts, while the valuation of NOK stock remains reasonable.
Still, the company is also facing multiple challenges and tough competition. So while I remain upbeat on the shares overall, I don’t expect them to double or triple in the near-term or the medium-term.

7 Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold for a Golden Retirement
Conversely, Nokia is very unlikely to lose a great deal of market share anytime soon, making the stock a very good tech name for more conservative investors.
A Closer Look at NOK Stock
In a July 2000 column on NOK stock, I discussed a number of steps that the Finnish company was taking to improve its technology.
When it came to powering 5G systems, the company, I wrote, was switching from Field Programmable Gate Arrays or FPGAs, which are very expensive, large, and energy-intensive, to cheaper, much more efficient SoCs.
Nokia was working with Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM), Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to upgrade its 5G processors. Since then Nokia has made a great deal of progress on those initiatives.
According to a March 23  Light Reading article, Nokia’s phaseout of FPGA chips was well underway, boosting its networks business margins significantly.
Specifically, the unit’s gross margin reached 37% in Q4 of 2020,  up from 29% at the end of  2019.
Nokia’s 5G chips are catching up with those of its rivals, and the disparity should disappear next year, a Nokia executive told Light Reading.
Huawei and Nokia
In another previous column on NOK stock, I predicted that the Trump Administration’s efforts to prevent America and its allies from using the products of Nokia’s major Chinese competitor, Huawei, would help Nokia.
I believe that both Nokia’s technology upgrades and Huawei’s difficulties have contributed to the recent improvements of Nokia’s financial results and to the Street’s more upbeat view of NOK stock.
More specifically, in Q1, Nokia’s operating income came in at 431 million EUR, much better than its operating loss of 76 million EUR during the same period a year earlier.
The company’s fixed network sales soared 49% year-over-year,  and it expects the revenue of its entire Network Infrastructure unit to climb 4% YOY.
In Q1, Nokia’s companywide net sales climbed 9% YOY, and its operating margin rose to 10.9%. In North America, Greater China, and India, its net sales increased by at least 10% YOY, and it added a total of 63 new enterprise customers YOY.
Last month, signifying the Street’s improved view of Nokia,  a Morgan Stanley analyst upgraded his rating on the company’s shares to “overweight” from “equal weight.”
He advised investors to dump Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) stock in favor of Nokia’s shares, as he thinks that the margin gap between the two companies would probably narrow.
The company’s strong Q1 results indicate that CEO Pekka Lundmark is improving the company’s performance.
The 17% YOY decline in its sales, general, and administrative spending last quarter, along with the improvements in its margins, suggest that the CEO is  cutting unnecessary costs at Nokia.
Despite Nokia’s marked technology improvements, Ericsson remains at least even with Nokia in most technology, and Huawei is still a tough competitor in many areas of the world.
Meanwhile, Lundmark indicated that Nokia’s 2020 loss of its 5G business at Verizon (NYSE:VZ) would negatively impact its results for the remainder of 2021.
The Bottom Line on NOK Stock
Since my June 15 column on Nokia, the company’s shares have climbed about 18%. It continues to have strong, positive catalysts.
As a result, I believe that the shares are well-positioned to deliver similar or slightly better gains over the next year or so. Therefore, I recommend that conservative investors buy the shares.

5G stocks may be a relatively new theme to the stock market but smart investors are already keeping tabs on the industry. While it may be true that 5G is rapidly expanding, it may not be mainstream until a few more years. With that in mind, could this imply that the growth potential is still abundant in this industry? So now begs the question, how is 5G better than 4G? It is just an upgrade across the board. 5G is significantly faster, more capacity, and significantly lower latency than 4G. Furthermore, it is a unified platform that supports new services such as mission-critical communications and the massive Internet of Things (IoT).
We can see telecommunications companies such as Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) making moves to ensure relevance in the 5G space. The company announced that its customers can trade in an old phone and get a new 5G phone for free with select plans. This goes to show how competitive the 5G market is and companies are going all out to stay ahead. Another 5G company that has been making waves recently is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). In brief, Nvidia has been advancing its AI-on-5G unified platform to accelerate the digital transformation of enterprises across all industries. Given how dependent we are on the internet, speed and reliability are everything. So, let us take a look at some of the top 5G stocks in thestock market today  
Best 5G Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] Right Now
QUALCOMM, Inc (NASDAQ: QCOM)
Skyworks Solutions Inc (NASDAQ: SWKS)
T-Mobile US Inc (NASDAQ: TMUS)
Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MRVL) 
QUALCOMM, Inc 
Let us start the list with the wireless technology company, Qualcomm. Essentially, it engages in the development, launch, and expansion of technologies like 5G. The likes of which are used in mobile devices and other wireless products. Besides that, its technology and products are also used in the automotive, computing, IoT, and networking industries. QCOM stock has climbed by almost 45% over the past year.
According to an article in The Telegraph last week, the company appears to be interested in investing in Arm Holdings. This is in the event if the proposed acquisition by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) does not go through. This is because Arm Holdings’ technology is widely used in the world’s premium smartphones. So, whichever company gains access to its tech may be primed to dominate the industry moving forward.  
During the second quarter, the company reported an impressive earnings report. Its revenue came in at $7.93 billion, an increase of 52% year-over-year. Furthermore, its net income skyrocketed to $1.76 billion, a 276% increase compared to a year ago. It is also noteworthy that the company acquired the world-class CPU and technology design company, NUVIA for $1.4 billion in the same quarter.

Another company that contributes to 5G technology would be Skyworks. The company designs, develops, manufactures, and markets semiconductor products. Its Sky5® is a highly flexible, customizable solution that meets the challenges of 5G wireless communications. In practice, Skyworks employs its wares across multiple core end markets.

Skyworks will acquire the infrastructure & automotive business of Silicon Labs in a $2.75 billion all-cash deal. This acquisition is significant as it could accelerate and bolster Skyworks’ expansion into the automotive industry.

T-Mobile US Inc 
Next, we have the mobile communications services company, T-Mobile. For those unfamiliar with the company, it offers voice, messaging, and data services in the postpaid, prepaid, and wholesale markets. Furthermore, it also provides wireless devices which include smartphones, tablets, and other communication devices. The company’s stock has been steadily rising over the past year. It has climbed by over 35% within one year. 
Last Thursday, T-Mobile announced an upgrade to its groundbreaking Connecting Heroes program. First responder agencies are assured unmatched network access to help their critical communications. If the network is too crowded during an emergency, non-emergency traffic drops to make way for first responders’ critical communications. Despite it being a free service, some could argue that it would attract public attention and also illustrate the company’s confidence in its network speed.  
Furthermore, the OnePlus Nord N200 5G is coming to T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile. In fact, it is the only wireless provider where customers can get this new device. T-Mobile is clearly promoting the use of 5G phones as much as possible. After all, the majority of Americans could not enjoy the 5G experience as they do not possess a 5G device. All things considered, would TMUS stock make its way to your portfolio?

Earlier this month, Marvell introduced the industry’s first 1.6T (Terabits per second)  Ethernet PHY with 100G PAM4 electrical inputs/outputs (I/Os) in 5nm. According to Marvell, the demand for increased bandwidth in cloud data centers to support massive data growth is driving the transition towards 1.6T in the Ethernet backbone. As it stands, this is the only solution that’s available in the market today to support the transition of the industry to 100G serial electrical signaling on high-density switches and optics. In a nutshell, Marvell’s latest innovation allows leaders in the cloud industry to operate at greater capacities. 
Moreover, the company started the fiscal year on a strong note. Marvell completed the acquisition of Inphi Corporation in April, bolstering its 5G-focused portfolio further. In its first-quarter earnings report, the company reported revenue of $832 million, representing a growth of 20% year-over-year. CEO Matt Murphy also appears optimistic about Marvell’s future as he believes that this is the “beginning of a multi-year growth cycle.” So, would this make MRVL stock a top 5G stock to watch now?

(NASDAQ:MRVL) shareholders if they were a little worried about the fact that Willem Meintjes, the Chief Accounting Officer recently netted about US$535k selling shares at an average price of US$53.51. That's a big disposal, and it decreased their holding size by 23%, which is notable but not too bad.
Marvell Technology Insider Transactions Over The Last Year
The Executive VP, Mitchell Gaynor, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$910k worth of shares at a price of US$46.84 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$54.27). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 31% of Mitchell Gaynor's holding.
All up, insiders sold more shares in Marvell Technology than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!

Does Marvell Technology Boast High Insider Ownership?
For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Marvell Technology insiders own about US$231m worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.
What Might The Insider Transactions At Marvell Technology Tell Us?
An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To assist with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Marvell Technology.
Of course Marvell Technology may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.
For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions, but not derivative transactions.

*Stock Advisor returns as of June 7, 2021
This video was recorded on June 11, 2021.
Chris Hill: We've got the latest headlines from Wall Street. Nobel prize winner Daniel Kahneman is our guest and, as always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar. But we begin with the market in general, the S&P 500 hit a new all time high this week. This comes amid growing concerns about inflation, and yet, Ron Gross, to borrow from Taylor Swift, investors are shaking off those inflation fears. But should they?
Ron Gross: I think a little bit of concern is warranted. Prices are clearly higher from food to cars, to energy, real estate. Some of this is transitory as the economy reopens. But the question is, will all that stimulus money that was pumped into the economy plus the fed's quantitative easing programs lead to more sustained inflation? Supply chain problems, labor shortage have added to the increase in prices we're seeing now. Again, it's cars and it's even your burrito at Chipotle. It's very widespread and I do think some higher prices are here for a while. Are we looking at a repeat of the 1970s? I don't think so. I certainly don't hope so. But Deutsche Bank, a bit of an outlier here, thinks perhaps so, inflation is more likely to persist in their opinion. It's going to lead to a crisis in the years ahead. But again, they are the outlier. The conventional wisdom is that a lot of this is transitory.
One other problem to keep an eye on, wages are not keeping up with inflation. We definitely should watch that, but I am glad to see the Fed's recent announcement that it will begin to taper its quantitative easing program, it's bond buying program in August or September. It's important to start unwinding some of that stimulus. It'll be interesting to watch if the fed eases up or changes their minds and their willingness to tolerate inflation that is higher than 2%, which was previously their line in the sand.
Hill: But have you seen anything so far that makes you think, you know what? Maybe I shouldn't be buying stocks right now.
Gross: No, primarily because stocks are a pretty good place to be even in an inflationary environment. Certainly there are specific sectors that will benefit more than others, commodities, banks, industrials, energy. But just in general as prices are rising, stocks are a pretty OK place to be.
Hill: Let's move on to some earnings. Chewy's first quarter results were better than Wall Street was expecting, but the goodness was quickly overshadowed when the pets products retailer warned about supply chain issues and shares of Chewy down more than 5% on Friday, Jason?
Jason Moser: Well, speaking of inflation and supply chain issues. It's not just semiconductors, Chris. Yeah, I think Chewy represents a very powerful combination here of not only growing the customer base, but growing wallets as well. You want to be aware of these types of opportunities and it seems that Chewy is really becoming. What I mean by this is, over the last two years, the company's increased their active customer base by about 75%. That means a large part of their customer base is still very much in the beginning stages of that relationship. For context why that matters, Chewy customers historically spend over $400 with the business in their second year compared to approximately 700 in their fifth year and almost $900 in their ninth year. It's something worth keeping in mind and given the nature of their market that they pursue in pets, there is some durability there I think, but when we look at the actual quarter itself, really strong results. They added 4.7 million net active customers up to 31.6%. Ended the quarter now with just under 20 million active customers. If you look at sales, net sales were up 32% from a year ago to $2.14 billion. Autoship continues to gain a little bit more of that share. Those sales were up 34.4%. Autoship now represents almost 70% of total sales for this business and customers continue to spend more as well. Hey, bonus, positive net income, Chris, not even adjusted, just a positive net income and they're raising full year 2021 net sales guidance. That's going to be about 25% top-line growth there for the year. A lot of things to really like. I wouldn't read too much into the markets trepidation here. It seems like this business is really executing.
Hill: Huge first quarter results from RH, the home furnishings retailer, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, had profits and revenue higher than expected. They raised guidance for the full fiscal year and shares of RH up more than 10% as we run. You've really got to tip your hat to what they are doing.
Gross: A firing on all cylinders report, if I ever seen one, Chris. Let's not forget they are anniversarying some pretty weak pandemic numbers. But still this is pretty exciting and we've talked about the performance of the stock before over the last five years up more than 2,500% as they really transform their business and this quarter is no exception. The net revenue is up 78%, adjusted gross margin up 550 basis points, operating margins up 1,200 basis points as 1.2% and now standing at 22.6% operating margins for specialty furniture retailers is pretty darn impressive. Adjusted net income of 375%. The CEO pointed out several unique things about their business model that's been allowing them to put up these results and then I buy into them, I think they make sense. It's not a very seasonal inventory business. They have similar inventory throughout the year. Limited fashion risk, their modeling, their designs don't change yearly or quarterly. It's more on a multiyear basis. They've got a very impressive membership model that they moved to several years ago. Some, including me, were a little skeptical about it. It's worked out really nicely and there is now a luxury brand right up there with some of the higher brands that you would recognize. That's really accruing to the bottom line. They increase their guidance, as you say, revenue growth in fiscal '21 expected to be 25%-30% versus a prior outlook of 15%-20%. They're growing. They see accelerating growth in fiscal '22 and beyond. They're launching the new digital portal. They're expanding internationally. They think they can be at $20 billion to $25 billion global brand in their current form and that's up from where we are now at the $3 billion business. So perhaps some really strong growth runways ahead.
Hill: Marvell Technology is not in the superhero business. They are in the semiconductor business and business appears to be good these days. Shares up more than 5% this week after first quarter profits came in higher than expected. Jason, the stock is close to an all time high. How good is it going at Marvell these days?
Moser: Well, this is a really attractive way for folks to invest in the 5G opportunity. If you hold onto these shares long enough, Chris, you may feel like a superhero. With that said, you could be forgiven if this company was off of your radar over the last five or so years because the top-line really hasn't gone anywhere as we have seen so much saturation in the mobile market. But R&D as a percentage of revenues average about 35% annually since 2016 for these guys. It's because they've been investing in just this very 5G opportunity and it's starting to pay off. The management is now targeting 10%-15% top-line growth over the next several years thanks to key growth drivers and 5G Cloud automotive. You look at the numbers, net revenue for the quarter $832 million was up 20% from a year ago. Gross margins look strong at 64.3% and if you look at that revenue growth of 20% it was 17% organically if you exclude the recent Infi acquisition that they just closed on. I think that's going to be a good one that will expand their capabilities here. But the business itself is really divided into two primary segments and networking, which grew 21% from a year ago. Storage revenue, which grew 17% from a year ago. Infi really gives them more exposure on that storage and data center side.
Management did note a pause in China's 5G investments. There is some exposure there, but that exposure is decreasing. This is a company that's diversifying its revenue stream geographically speaking and customer wise as well just to put some numbers around that. They traditionally have relied on Western Digital, Toshiba, and Seagate as primary customers. That was about 45% of total revenue just a couple of years ago. Now, those numbers are down considerably below 30%. All in all, I think this is a company that's made a lot of investments, really excited to see what they've got in store for the next decade.
Hill: Coming up, we've got retail restaurants and a hot IPO. If you're an investor, you're right where you should be. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here with Jason Moser and Ron Gross. Wall Street was expecting Dave and Buster's to report a loss in the first quarter but the restaurant and entertainment chain surprised the analysts with an actual profit Ron, [laughs] shares of Dave and Buster's up 7% this week.
Gross: Yeah. Back to pre-pandemic levels up 50% year to date, which just brings them back to pre-pandemic. This report was not a great report but it was one that was moving in the right direction, that's not bad. They began the fiscal first-quarter with 76% of their 141 stores opened. Almost all of their restaurants, the stores are open now. Most stores were opened during the quarter under reduced hours and capacity limitations. This is nothing new to the COVID story obviously. Revenue was up 66% but again, obviously anniversarying pandemic level revenue. They've provided us with comparisons to 2019 which a lot of retailers, a lot of restaurants have been doing, I appreciate that. If we compare it, the Q1 of 2019 revenue was actually down 27%. Again, much more of a true picture there than a 66% increase.
Overall, comparable store sales declined 35% when you compare it to the first quarter of 2019, so it's just very important to get a good picture of what's going on there. But as you said, net income totaled $20 million. That's compared to about $40 million in 2019. Again down but still profitable ended the quarter with only $20 million in cash, not a great balance sheet there but they do have $340 million of liquidity available to them. I'd like to see the balance sheet a little bit stronger there. Their guidance was pretty good. Business recovery momentum has continued through the first five weeks of the second quarter. Again, on the right track, moving in the right direction.
Hill: Monday.com, the work management software company, made its public debut on Thursday. The stock was priced at $155 and finished the day up a little bit more than 20%. Jason, I feel like monday.com and their investment bankers really hit the sweet spot for IPOs. It was up a decent amount but not so much that they left a lot of money on the table.
Moser: That's what you like to see. I agree, totally. I can see the potential in a business like this for sure. It's not one where I feel it all compelled to get it on the ground floor though I think it's worthwhile for investors just to be patient and learn about this one. The business itself they say they democratize the power of software so that organizations can easily build software applications and work management tools that fit their needs. They call this work OS. I would assume it's just a work operating system. It's a building block. It's no code and low code building blocks to help companies build essentially bespoke software for what they need. The value proposition seems to be that the workplaces tend to shape themselves based on pre-packaged software that they are given and monday.com is ultimately trying to let the workplace shape the software based on what it needs. That's great. I think that makes sense to a degree but there's a lot of software out there today. To me, one of the bigger challenges in any company is having the hands of the few inside the company building solutions for the many. Because people work differently and that seems like it's only going to become more of the case now. But the company is doing something right, they've closed 130,000 customers, very proud of their culture as matter, they say that's why they win. I would hope they can maintain that culture, the risk that you run there as companies get bigger, culture changes. But all-in-all, interesting business and nice to see the day had such an uneventful introduction to the public markets.
Hill: A bold branding choice. When you think about Monday, as a brand, Monday doesn't always invoke wonderful feelings.
Moser: I was going to lead with that Chris, but decided to try to be a little bit more optimistic. But yeah, I see monday.com, I start thinking about Garfield and I might just go to a dark place.
Gross: I don't like Mondays.
Hill: Solid end to the fiscal year for Casey's General Stores, fourth quarter profits and revenue came in higher-than-expected, despite that shares of Casey's down 5% this week. I don't know, Ron, this seems like one of those businesses that really stands to benefit from more Americans getting on the road this summer
Gross: 100%, yeah, this was a solid report but as you imagine investors weren't impressed, perhaps looking for stronger guidance. But these numbers look pretty good to me, so total sales up 31% inside the store revenue up almost 15% inside same-store sales up almost 13% as guest counts steadily improve as the pandemic subsides, obviously inside margins improved by 100 basis points. Then when we get into fuel, the picture changes a little bit. Fuel gallons sold were up 10% but fuel gross profit was down 11%. That's primarily due to really very high fuel margins achieved last year as a result of all the supply and demand shocks that were going on in the earlier stages of COVID. Net income is down 33% during a difficult time obviously, but the numbers look pretty good to me. They closed on $580 million acquisition of Buc-ee's convenience stores, not a chain that I'm familiar with.
Hill: Big in Texas.
Gross: Big in Texas, exactly right. They're also closing on the acquisition of 49 Circle K stores in Oklahoma. They've got both organic growth as well as acquisition growth on the table here, which will bode well for the coming quarters and end years.
Hill: Interesting to see that expansion because in different parts of the country, people are in some cases very loyal to their brand. In the Mid-Atlantic region, it's Wawa, and in the Midwest it's Casey's.
Gross: Yeah. I love a good Wawa, I've never been to Casey. Their new stores, as you said, are also Illinois and Nebraska is big for their new acquisition. They're adding about 94 stores. There are 79 dealer locations. But you know people are loyal, some folks love sheets, some people love as you said, Wawa. I love a good slurpee myself.
Hill: Shares of Stitch Fix up 15% this week after the company's third quarter loss was smaller-than-expected. Revenue was also higher-than-expected. I don't know, Jason, this seems like one of those quarters that if you're a shareholder, it wet your appetite but they're moving in the right direction. They still need to do more.
Moser: I feel like you really just encapsulated this dilemma that I have with this business. It was a strong quarter hats off to them. It's very hard for me to see them being able to repeat this performance reliably and consistently. I mean, fashion it's just too fickle even for a ""data company"" like this one. But let's give credit where credit is due. Again, it was a strong quarter. You look at net revenue $535 million was up 44%. Now it was a bit of a coiled spring. It's certainly understandable but it's not something investors should get used to. They're guiding for 22%-24% revenue growth here in their company's fourth-quarter. Active clients, 4.1 million now, that was up 20% from a year ago and net revenue per active client, however, down slightly $481, it's down 3% from a year ago. To me this is a business trying to figure out it's optionality. They've introduced things like a fixed preview where you can actually get an idea of what you are getting before you get it. The big question for me, it's really going to be on the direct buy from them. Now, clients can engage with direct buy that's something that takes this business model in a fundamentally different direction. Not to say that that's a bad thing, but it's something that they're going to have to work yet. It's going to be something that will be a little bit challenging. Just fashions just too fickle for me to really be able to get too convicted about this business.
Hill: Real quick new CEO takes over August first for Katrina Lake. How long would you give a new CEO? At least a year, right?
Moser: I would absolutely give her a year. Maybe it does feel like they have a plan they're executing. It is just going to be a matter of whether these new features and investments actually bear fruit.
Hill: I don't know about you, but the first time I had heard of Daniel Kahneman, it was in Michael Lewis's best-selling book, The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed Our Minds. That book explored the partnership between Kahneman and Amos Tversky, two Israeli psychologists who created the field of behavioral economics. In 2002, Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for the work that's done with Tversky. He's written several books, including the best-seller, Thinking, Fast and Slow. Kahneman latest book is Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment. It explores why we make bad judgments and how to make better ones. Recently, Motley Fool Senior Analyst Maria Gallagher caught up with Daniel Kahneman to talk about the wisdom of crowds, the wisdom of the markets, and how noise applies to investing.
Maria Gallagher: When we're talking about investing, there is an incredible amount of information that we get about companies on a minute-by-minute basis. If you think about the wisdom of crowds affects, like you say in the book, it averaging the independent judgments of different people tend to improve accuracy, so you would think that the information investors get separately and then the average of those, generally the stock price, would be about that correct price, but also like you speak about in the book, there are wise crowds, and then there are crowds that follow tyrants, crowds that believe in magic. So, as we're thinking about investing and being a part of these crowds, how can you tell if a crowd is a wise crowd? How can you figure it out with all of this information that we're getting?
Daniel Kahneman: Well, in general, very few people would want to. It's how to think that the market is not wise. The market probably has a lot of wisdom in it. It's extremely difficult to beat the market because of the feature that the market integrates judgments of the large number of people. People who think that they can beat the market, most of them are expensively wrong. There are a few, very few who are able to do this, mostly with mathematical tools, but individuals who have just the feeling that they can do it, had better take a shower.
Gallagher: So then, when you think about this too, so you have that the market has this large crowd, and then don't you have those subsections of crowds if you see things like the rise of Reddit or of means stocks? Within these subsections of people, do you think that there is the general wise crowd, and then within it depending on who you're talking to, you maybe talking to people who are wise or not wise?
Kahneman: Well, certainly there are what we see, and that's in large part due to social media. You can get a crowd that decides on a different valuation of the stock as happened recently, and whether to doubt whether they are wise or unwise, that is difficult, that accounts really pass judgment on it. In general, you would say that the larger the market, the closer it is likely to be statistically, to be more or less wise, more or less efficient, and deciding that you can beat it, is a risk that you're taking.
Gallagher: Interesting. Through all of your research on noise, is there an industry you found to be either the noisiest or the least noisy?
Kahneman: Actually, when we looked at it from the little information we have, and this is really the study of noise in some way, we always knew that there is noise because methods of judgment by definition, we expect some disagreement. What we didn't know is how much noise there is. So the motivation for the book was that wherever there is judgment, there is noise and much more of it than you think, because it's a surprising amount of noise that justifies an effort in that direction. Now, this is fairly recent. It's recent for us certainly, that wherever we look in terms of profession, we found way more noise than we had expected, and sadly way more noise than people in that field had expected. We find it an underwriting, you find it in the evaluation of business propositions by venture capitalists, you find it in loan approval, you find it in patent approval, and you find it in medicine, and I've already mentioned symptoms seen. So wherever we looked, we found a lot of it, and even in fingerprint reading. Now fingerprint reading is much less noisy than underwriting. But even there, there is some noise, people disagree more than almost anyone would think. Anything that involves judgments, you can be virtually certain will involve noise.
Gallagher: Wow. So now the natural question is, what should we do to reduce noise? In the book it talks a lot about noise hygiene, so can you explain a little bit about how that works?
Kahneman: Well, one obvious way of reducing noise is taking judgment out of the equation, by imposing rules or algorithms. But we know, and when that happens, because algorithms are noise-free, when you present the same problem to an algorithm on two occasions, you'll get the same answer, which isn't true when you ask two underwriters. One way of dealing with noise is to play algorithms, but of course, for the firm, for the next few decades, we can be certain that human judgment is still going to be the most important source of important decisions. There we have a suggestion that we call decision hygiene, and it's the deliberately off putting term because the same hygiene has no glamour to it. It's like washing your hands. Like washing your hands, you don't know what germ you're killing, and if we're successful, you'll never know, and so those will address procedures that you've got to trust and adopt and follow, and there is a list of them.
Now, the simplest of them is to take more than one judgment. Because when you average judgments, you can be mechanically certain if the judgments are independent of each other, that averaging reduces noise. So that's one piece of advice. The other piece of advice is independence. Keep, if you're averaging judges, make them independent. If you look at different aspects of the problem, make the judgments or the different aspects independent of each other. Another idea that's related to this is breakup problems to the extent you can into fact-based narrower assessments, and that's the key, delay intuition. Intuition is the global view that people have that gives them confidence that they've got it and that their decision is right. You don't want to do without intuition, but intuition tends to jump to conclusions, and so so you are better off by delaying intuition, looking at the various facets of the problem, and when you have the whole profile of the problem, then and only then, let your intuition free in integrating the information. Those are some of the examples of decision hygiene, there are more.
Gallagher: How does one delay intuition? Because I would imagine if I'm interviewing a candidate and I'm breaking it down, I'm asking the same questions, I'm putting into the sheet, these are going to be, I'm going to rank them in some numerical way. If my gut tells me like [...], I don't really like them, and I keep filling out the form, how do I delay that gut feeling?
Kahneman: Well, the gut feeling is going to be much attenuated when you are collecting information. Another thing that happens is that when you conduct an interview in what is called the non-structured way, then what happens is you get your gut feeling and you spend the rest of the time confirming your gut feeling by asking questions that effectively lead the candidate to confirm your initial hunters. When you have a structured set of dimensions, the gut feeling is less pronounced and it doesn't affect the intermediate judgments because they're fact-based, and so you give yourself an opportunity to be surprised. You give yourself an opportunity to discover either good things or bad things that were not expected on the basis of your first impression. That is an advantage. Whenever you're surprised when you collect information, you are very likely to have learned something. The way our mind works, we resist surprises. We tend to go with our intuition and confirm it, and that leads to the lowest end to bias by the way.

I'm thinking Facebook, Google [Alphabet], Spotify, Apple, or on the flip side, if the other aspects add up, does it matter if you don't, particularly like the service or product?"" It's a great question, Jason, because there are great investments to be had in businesses that for one reason or another rub people the wrong way. You can look at a business like Comcast, which for years was routinely at or near the top of the list of the worst customer service brands in America. Over the long haul, that's been a stock that has rewarded shareholders.
Moser: Yeah, I agree. It is a great question. I feel like we could have an entire show just centered around this question because it is not one simple answer. I mean, it does depend. I think it's very easy to fall into the trap of loving a product and then thinking, therefore, it's a good investment. Even the other way around, hating something and thinking, ""Oh, that must be a bad investment,"" and just clearly isn't always the case. I mean, Twitter for example. I mean, yeah, for a very long time I had a bullish outlook on it because it just seems so relevant to people continuing to use it and it just conveys so much information in real-time. The Twitter blue thing was the straw that broke Campbell's back. Because I feel like all of those things that they are asking me to pay for, I feel like those are the things they should have been developing here over the last five, six, seven years that they just didn't. Then it makes me question management and makes me question vision. Costco, I mean, I want to go to a Costco like I want to nod a hole in the head. But I fully recognize the fact that 100 million families here in the country love the experience apparently, and so being able to divorce yourself from your personal feelings and just recognizing the merits of the business. It's not an easy thing to do, it's an important skill to develop though.
Gross: Yeah. I take great pleasure in owning, over long periods of time, companies that I appreciate and Costco is one of them, actually. Disney would be another example. Then conversely, I don't think I would enjoy being an owner of a company for five or ten years that I didn't think was doing a good job, or didn't make the world a better place, or didn't make a product or service that I agreed with. The one thing to be careful about is those are all typically consumer product-related companies, and so you'll miss out on some great investments in cloud or biotech or tech in general that you don't come across in your average daily life. Just to exclude them because you don't have any personal exposure to them on a daily basis would be a mistake. But as Peter Lynch would say, finding companies that you use that you'd love are a great place to begin an investing journey.
Hill: Well, and it's an opportunity, particularly as you said, Ron, consumer-facing businesses, to do your own boots on the ground research to see what the stores are like? Are they crowded? What is the staff like? All that sort of thing. But it is important to make sure that you're not alone, that you're not on an island. Like you're the person who loves this, there have got to be ways to checkout like, ""Wait a minute, I'm the only one who loves this or do other people love it as well?""
Gross: Yeah, I loved my Kodak camera. Boy do I love that? [laughs] It seems I'm the only one.
Hill: Let's get to the stocks on our radar, our man behind the glass Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question. Jason Moser, you're up first, what are you looking at this week?
Moser: Yeah, one I've talked about on the show before, one that I've recommended and I own, a company called Masimo, ticker is M-A-S-I. It's a medical device company that has traditionally focused on non-invasive monitoring. Started with monitoring oxygen levels in the blood, but they have evolved into much more as technology has allowed. But the business itself has a lovely razor blade model. They get those units in the hospitals installed and then they can sell these consumables. Over the last 10 years, the razors, the installed base machines, they've shipped approximately 2.2 million of these razors. In that just as they tremendously installed a base that really ramps up those switching costs as time goes on and the adhesive sensors, those consumables, the blades that they're very high margin and that's something that they will continue to sell as long as they keep those machines installed. Something very similar to an intuitive surgical, if you will. But they've developed a terrific new platform with a safety net, multiple applications that capitalizes on the growth in remote healthcare telemedicine. Innovative Founder leader there with Joe Kiani, just a lot of things to really like about this business. I think it's a little bit overlooked right now due to some tough year-over-year comps from the COVID pull-forward. But there is sequential growth here. That's a very positive sign and one that I'm very encouraged by here, very excited about the future of this company.
Hill: Dan, question about Masimo?
Dan Boyd: Chris, more of a comment. Masimo, great medical stuff. Awesome, great. But let's think about Massimo, the clothing line, real quick.
Moser: Yes.
Boyd: I don't even know if it exists anymore, but it was big in the '90s. I just remember I knew this older kid in my neighborhood growing up, he was Ian, that was his name. He was always really cool. He had cool glasses and he always wore a Massimo T-shirt. That guy was just really cool.
Moser: Yeah. Well, hey, listen, they sold that stuff like hotcakes and target day and it was popular for a time. I'm not sure where it is right now, but like I've told you before, my sartorial sensibilities are not the greatest.
Gross: If you're listening, Ian, please write to us.
Hill: Radio@fool.com is our email address. I don't know. Moser, it seems like it could be a tuck-in acquisition that Masimo makes just to get all those brands under one roof.
Gross: Now we're talking.
Moser: I like the way you're thinking.
Hill: Ron Gross, what are you looking at this week?
Gross: I'm looking at Accenture, ACN, a name derived from the phrase accent on the future, Accenture. Provides consulting technology and outsourcing services in more than 120 countries. You may recall it began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm Arthur Andersen. Remember the days where they were big six accounting firms, I don't know where they've gone. But this company has actually been incorporated in Dublin, Ireland since 2009, so some changes to the company over the years, but they produced steady growth, strong cash flow. They've got a reliable dividend all thanks to their long term relationships with clients. They have newer focus areas like cloud security, supply chain, and digital manufacturing. Those are all seeing really solid growth even as their traditional consulting business advances a bit more slowly, which is not really surprising. In addition to their organic growth they consistently make acquisitions to spur growth, enter new markets, that's really good, but it also can be a risk. Keep an eye on their capital expenditures as it relates to acquisitions. They've raised their dividends for the last 15 years. We love to see the current yields of 1.3%.
Hill: Dan, question about Accenture?
Boyd: I was going to make fun of the name accent on the future, but I was thinking about it just now, and Accenture is probably the best they could have done. I mean, what do you get? Fuacc, accture? [laughs] There's nothing there except for Accenture, so I got to say good on them.
Gross: I believe that was an employee who won a contest, who recommended that name. Glad you like it, Dan.
Hill: Two very different businesses, Dan. You've got one you want to add to your watch list?
Boyd: Chris, you know I love a good employee contest, I'm going to go with Accenture.
Moser: I hope that employee got some options or something for winning that contest.
Hill: No kidding, right? Hopefully they got more than just a gift certificate or something like that. All right, Jason Moser, Ron Gross, guys, thanks for being here.
Moser: Thanks, Chris.
Hill: That's going to do it for this week's edition of Motley Fool Money. The show is mixed by Dan Boyd. Our producer is Mac Greer. I'm Chris Hill. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-06-15 00:00:00+00:00,My Top Growth Stock to Buy in June,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/my-top-growth-stock-to-buy-in-june-2021-06-15,,,"Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) looked like an enticing bet going into its first-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings report thanks to a bunch of powerful catalysts, and the company didn't disappoint. The chipmaker bested Wall Street's estimates as its top and bottom lines shot up remarkably, while the outlook was solid enough to send the stock higher after the earnings report.
Robust demand from several fast-growing end markets gave Marvell a nice boost during the quarter, a trend that's likely to continue for a long time to come. Let's look closely at the factors driving Marvell's growth and see why it is one of the top growth stocks you can buy right now.
Image source: Getty Images.
Marvell Technology's terrific growth is here to stay
Marvell's revenue jumped 20% year over year to $832.3 million in Q1, easily clearing the consensus estimate of $806.7 million. Adjusted earnings came in at $0.29 per share, a substantial increase over the prior-year period's figure of $0.18 per share and ahead of the $0.27 per-share analyst estimate. The results were better than what Marvell was anticipating.
The acquisition of Inphi that was completed toward the end of the quarter gave Marvell's top line a shot in the arm. However, it is worth noting that the chipmaker did well even on a stand-alone basis. It reported $810.5 million in revenue excluding Inphi's contribution, which exceeded the company's guidance of $800 million, driven by the growth of its networking and storage businesses.
The networking business recorded 26% year-over-year growth during the quarter and accounted for 60% of the total revenue. Excluding Inphi's contribution, Marvell's networking revenue was up 21% on the back of growth in the 5G and cloud networking markets. Marvell's 5G business did well on the back of ""standard and semi-custom product shipments to Samsung and Nokia,"" which isn't surprising as these two companies are winning big from global 5G deployments.
Meanwhile, the demand for Marvell's data processing units was strong last quarter, which isn't hard to believe given the massive potential in this market. The chipmaker's enterprise business also put in a solid performance, recording double-digit growth once again despite a soft spending scenario. Marvell expects enterprise spending to recover later in the year. Throw in the fact that Marvell is winning new business in the switching and data center markets, and it's easy to see why the company anticipates its networking business to keep growing at high rates.
Marvell expects networking revenue to increase in the high teens on a year-over-year basis this quarter. Including Inphi's contribution, the year-over-year growth is expected to hit 70%. Marvell says that Inphi will add $215 million to its revenue this quarter and prove accretive to the company's adjusted earnings. More importantly, the chipmaker expects Inphi to grow at a higher pace than Marvell thanks to the ""demand for high-speed connectivity inside and between data centers and in the carrier market.""
All of these catalysts are expected to drive stronger growth in the networking business in the second half of the year.
The storage business also chipped in with a nice showing during the quarter. Revenue increased 17% year over year and accounted for 36% of the top line, driven by an increase in demand for solid-state drive (SSD) controllers and nearline drives deployed in the cloud. Marvell expects the storage business to clock yet another quarter of growth in the mid-teens in Q2 . Given that the cloud storage and the SSD markets are expected to grow at annual rates of 22% and 15%, respectively, Marvell's storage business can keep growing at impressive rates for a long time.
It isn't too late to buy the stock
Marvell's Q2 outlook provides further evidence that this is a high-growth company. It expects $1.06 billion in revenue at the midpoint of its guidance range, up 46% year over year. The adjusted gross margin is expected to increase 70 basis points year over year to 64%. The adjusted earnings of $0.31 per share would be a major improvement over the year-ago period's figure of $0.21. Wall Street was expecting $0.30 per share in earnings on $841 million in revenue.
What's more, analysts expect Marvell to clock annual earnings growth of over 35% over the next five years, handsomely outpacing the 13% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) seen in the last five years. The chipmaker looks well placed to deliver such strong earnings growth in the future thanks to the opportunities it is sitting on, which is why investors looking to add a tech stock benefiting from the 5G rollout and data center investments should consider buying Marvell Technology Group.

2021-06-10 00:00:00+00:00,MRVL July 30th Options Begin Trading,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mrvl-july-30th-options-begin-trading-2021-06-10,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available today, for the July 30th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new July 30th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $48.00 strike price has a current bid of 10 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $48.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $47.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $50.64/share today.
Because the $48.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.21% return on the cash commitment, or 1.52% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $48.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $51.00 strike price has a current bid of 36 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $50.64/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $51.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 1.42% if the stock gets called away at the July 30th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $51.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $51.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.71% boost of extra return to the investor, or 5.19% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $50.64) to be 44%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Among the names elevating the small-cap index was Stitch Fix (SFIX, +14.1%), which popped after the online styling service reported a slimmer-than-expected per-share loss and stronger-than-forecast revenues. Workhorse Group (WKHS, +11.8%) and Casper Sleep (CSPR, +16.2%) were among other the Russell's other massive gainers.

Also grabbing the spotlight was mid-cap Clover Health Investments (CLOV, +85.8%) – the ""meme stock"" du jour – more than doubling in price at its session peak today.
While small caps and meme stocks made big moves, it was another muted session for the blue-chip indexes, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average declining marginally to 34,599 and the S&P 500 gaining less than a point to 4,227.

Generac Holdings (GNRC, +6.3%) got a lift today after KeyBanc upgraded the power generator producer to Overweight from Sector Weight (equivalents of Buy and Neutral, respectively). Analysts said GNRC is likely to benefit from grid-stability issues, and that a recent pullback creates an attractive valuation for the large-cap stock.

""Demand for housing climbed higher in the months following the onset of the pandemic,"" say economists at BofA Global Research. ""This has left builders to scramble to respond. The result: home prices and building costs have surged higher.""
It's not only home prices that have soared (+13% year-over-year in May); valuations for housing stocks have jumped, too. And with the housing shortfall in the U.S. now at nearly 4 million homes, according to mortgage-finance firm Freddie Mac, homebuilders and housing-related stocks could have more room to run.
We've compiled a list of housing stocks that could see more tailwinds from the extreme imbalance in supply and demand. This group features several traditional homebuilders, as well as other companies providing products and services within the housing space.

As we begin another week of trading, investors would be focusing on economic figures given last week’s mixed labor market update. Should negative updates slow the current gains in reopening stocks, tech stocks could be in focus in the stock market again. Now, as most investors would know, 2021 has not been the best year for the industry. This would especially be the case when you contrast it with tech’s performance in 2020. However, given that most of the biggest names in tech have taken a breather, some investors may see opportunity. After all, the growth story for tech companies remains a solid one given the fast-paced nature of the industry.
For example, we could look at tech giants such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Over the weekend, the company received the all-clear from U.S. antitrust regulators to acquire Nuance Communications (NASDAQ: NUAN). According to Microsoft, the company is looking to close the massive $16 billion deal by the end of 2021. Ideally, this deal will significantly bolster Microsoft’s cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities across the healthcare industry among others. Elsewhere, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos will reportedly be on the first commercial space flight of Blue Origin. Bezos’ space company continues to make headlines thanks to the billionaire tech mogul’s latest announcement. Evidently, the tech industry continues to power on regardless of how tech stocks perform in thestock market today On that note, here are four to consider for your watchlist this week.

Investors and analysts alike would be paying close attention to Apple in light of this event. The conference will primarily also focus on software as the company previews upcoming updates for its operating systems that power all of its products.

In late April, the company also reported record second-quarter financials. In it, Apple reported quarterly revenue of $89.6 billion, up 54% year-over-year. It also posted earnings per diluted share of $1.40. A majority of this quarter’s revenue came from international sales. For these reasons, will you consider adding AAPL stock to your portfolio?

3D Systems Corporation
Last but not least, we will be looking at 3D Systems. For the uninitiated, it is a South Carolina-based company that, as the name suggests, is in the 3D printing business. In fact, it is the pioneer in the field of 3D printing, bringing the innovation to the market over 30 years ago. Now, the company is a leading name in the additive manufacturing industry, empowering customers to create innovative products.
According to 3D Systems, the company’s core end markets include the health care and industrial markets. Seeing as the applications for 3D printing continue to expand, investors could be eyeing DDD stock now. Even now, DDD stock is looking at gains of over 180% year-to-date.
If anything, things could be looking up for the 3D printing market. According to a recent research report by ReportLinker, the global 3D printing healthcare market could grow to $2.53 billion through 2025. This would mark a compound annual growth rate of about 18%. In the medical space, 3D printing tech is being directed towards printing functioning organs. Notably, this would fill in a gap in markets where there is a shortfall in organ donors. Given 3D Systems’ current standing in the industry, investors looking to bet on 3D printing would turn to DDD stock. Would you do the same?

*Stock Advisor returns as of June 7, 2021
We closed the acquisition of Inphi on April 20, 2021. Therefore, the results we reported today for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 include the results from the Inphi business for 10 days of the fiscal quarter. Revenue from the acquired Inphi business is reported within our networking product group. To provide a direct comparison to the first fiscal quarter business outlook we provided in ourearnings callon March 3, we have provided a table in our earnings press release, which breaks out Marvell stand-alone non-GAAP results for the first quarter, excluding partial quarter results from the acquired Inphi business.
We are providing Marvell's stand-alone non-GAAP results on a one-time basis. As a reminder, there are no GAAP results for stand-alone Marvell. Matt and Jean's first-quarter commentary will primarily focus on the non-GAAP results from the stand-alone Marvell business as it relates to the guidance we provided on our March 3 call understated otherwise. Please note that the financial outlook for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 includes expected results from the acquired Inphi business for the full quarter.
On the subject of revue reporting, as you know, we currently report revenue in three broad product groups: networking, storage, and other. However, as you may recall, during our Investor Day presentations, we also describe our addressable opportunities by end market. This market focus will provide more information and transparency about the key growth drivers of our business and was received positively by the investment community. We are now taking steps to align our external revenue reporting to our end markets.
We believe this will provide investors with a better and more granular understanding of our business. Accordingly, we will discontinue reporting revenue by product group and instead, we will report revenue from the following five end markets: data center, carrier, enterprise networking, auto industrial, and consumer. Please note, we will implement this change starting next quarter when we report results for our second quarter of fiscal 2022. In that earnings release, we will report revenue by end market for the second quarter and provide historical end market revenue data for the preceding seven quarters.
Mass discussion of business results and expectations are also transitioned to this end market view. In our second-quarter earnings results, on a one-time basis, we will provide revenue results under both the current product group process and the new end market process. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. Matt?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our first-quarter GAAP results for the combined company. Revenue for the combined company was $832 million. GAAP gross margin was 50.2% and loss per diluted share was $0.13.
I'm now going to review stand-alone Marvell non-GAAP results, excluding those of Inphi. We began fiscal 2022 on a strong note, delivering solid results in the first quarter, driven by the strength of our core businesses and continued operational excellence. Marvell stand-alone revenue for the first quarter was $810 million, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue grew 17% year on year, driven by robust growth in both our networking and storage businesses.
Higher revenue, coupled with stronger gross margin and lower operating expenses drove non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.02 above the midpoint of guidance to $0.29. Non-GAAP EPS grew 61% year on year, demonstrating the significant operating leverage in our business model. I'm pleased that Marvell delivered the fourth straight quarter of double-digit year-on-year revenue growth despite industrywide supply constraints that have tightened considerably over the same time period. In fact, our year-on-year growth rate accelerated in the first quarter on strong and growing demand across all our end markets, and I'm pleased that our operations team rose to the challenge in a difficult environment.
But we have more work to do. The majority of our products are proprietary and sole-sourced, and demand for our solutions continues to grow. We need to support our customers with a flexible supply chain capable of delivering the upside demand within a reasonable lead time, something that has not been feasible this year. To further improve our supply, Chris Koopmans, who has played an instrumental role in Marvell's ongoing transformation, has been appointed as our Chief Operations Officer to lead our global operations and supply chain organization, in addition to his current role leading marketing and business operations.
Chris is leveraging his deep understanding of our markets and customers to prioritize and align supply to our key growth initiatives. We are extending our planning horizons, strengthening strategic supplier partnerships, and using our balance sheet where appropriate, to build more flexibility. Our suppliers value Marvell's focus on data infrastructure as a source of sustainable growth, driven by favorable secular trends compared to other cyclical end markets. And as a result, they are excited to partner with us.
Looking to the second half of this fiscal year, we are confident that we have secured sufficient supply to enable accelerating year-on-year revenue growth for stand-alone Marvell, above that of the first half. We expect supply to further improve next fiscal year. In a few moments, I'll discuss Inphi's business, where we also expect strong revenue growth throughout the year. Moving on to our merger with Inphi and related organizational changes.
We received regulatory approval to merge with Inphi in April, earlier than originally anticipated, and began integrating the talented Inphi team. We have emerged from this transaction as a U.S. corporation, which we believe better positions the combined company for long-term success. Reflecting the larger scale and broader scope of Marvell, several key Inphi executives have my direct staff.
Loi Nguyen and Nariman Yousefi will manage the Inphi businesses and have also increased their scope to include additional Marvell businesses. Laurence Tse, Inphi's central engineering leader, will manage Marvell's analog and mixed-signal organization. In addition, Raghib Hussain has taken on a broader elevated role as president, products, and technologies, to drive strategy alignment and growth across the company. Similar to our prior acquisitions, we expect the infusion of Inphi talent will add scale and further strengthen the capabilities of the combined company.
We have built a world-class management team with deep technical expertise, vast industry experience, and a proven track record in driving growth and value creation. Let me move on now to discussing our two businesses in more detail. Networking. First, for Marvell stand-alone networking, revenue grew during the first -- revenue during the first quarter was $476 million, consistent with our outlook for strong growth.
On a sequential basis, revenue grew 9%, underpinned by growth in all key product lines with the exception of 5G ASICs. However, overall 5G revenue continued to grow, marking our seventh straight consecutive quarter of growth. Year-on-year growth was a very robust 21% in networking with solid contributions from multiple end markets. In 5G, growth was driven by standard and semi-custom product shipments to Samsung and Nokia, partially offset by a decline in ASICs as deployments in China paused.
In cloud networking, we continue to benefit from strong customer demand for our smartNIC DPUs. In automotive, we are growing rapidly with our Ethernet product shipping into multiple model year 2021 vehicles. Our enterprise networking business also delivered solid results, extending the double-digit growth trend established last year despite a soft end market. This performance is a result of our expanding market position, driven by our refreshed Ethernet switches and multi-gigabit PHYs.
To the extent the enterprise spending recovers later this year, that would be another tailwind to our business. Not only are we winning and ramping in the access, aggregation, and core switching markets, we are also making in-roads in the data center with our feature-rich and scalable multi-terabit family of switches. As a reminder, these products leverage a modular architecture to deliver multiple capacity points from 3.2 terabits per second to 12.8 terabits for a broad range of data center applications. We have been winning new sockets and expect these design wins to start contributing meaningfully of higher levels of revenue next fiscal year.
Let me now discuss the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 for our networking business. This outlook includes revenue from Inphi's complete electro-optics platform comprised of their industry-leading PAM and coherent DSPs, high-performance broadband analog drivers, and TIAs highly integrated silicon photonics and data center interconnect modules. For the second quarter, we anticipate networking revenue to grow just over 70% year on year. Let me walk you through the growth expectations from the Marvell and Inphi businesses implicit in this guidance.
We expect Marvell's stand-alone networking to drive strong year-on-year revenue growth in the high teens on a percentage basis and be up slightly on a sequential basis. Similar to the prior quarter, we expect broad growth from multiple products offset a pause in China 5G. This outlook reflects ongoing supply constraints, which have been more acute for our networking products. However, as I discussed earlier, we believe we have line of sight to supply improvements later this year and next year to support our growth plans.
As we look forward, we expect a strong second-half ramp compared to the first half in stand-alone Marvell's networking business, including an acceleration in our 5G business from both our own product ramps and an increase in 5G adoption in the U.S. and other regions. From the acquired Inphi business, we expect approximately $215 million in revenue in our second fiscal quarter. I am very pleased that at this level of revenue, we expect the Inphi business will be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings in the first full quarter as a combined company.
We expect this business to drive strong growth above Marvell's growth rate benefiting from the demand for high-speed connectivity inside and between data centers and in the carrier market. Let me briefly discuss Inphi's data center growth drivers. Inside data centers, as demand for bandwidth continues to increase, a generational shift is under way from traditional NRZ signaling to more advanced Pulse Amplitude Modulation, or PAM, which enables a significant increase in bandwidth. This is one of the biggest changes in data center connectivity, and Inphi is leading this industry transition.
Inphi is the largest provider of PAM4 DSPs to the optical connectivity market, having shipped millions of devices. As the market continues to transition to higher speeds, 400 gig adoption has been accelerating. And last year, we started sampling our next-generation 800-gig solution, which is seeing strong traction with customers. In collaboration with Microsoft, Inphi pioneered pluggable transceiver technology to directly interconnect regional cloud data centers at lower cost, complexity, and power compared to traditional optical transport solutions.
The first product, COLORZ, use PAM4 technology to enable 100 gig per wavelength, which could be multiplexed to support up to 4 terabits per second of bandwidth over a single fiber for data center interconnect or DCI applications. This product has been shipping in volume and established Inphi's leadership in this category. Building on the success of COLORZ, which was deployed primarily by one hyperscaler last year, Inphi introduced COLORZ 2, the industry's first pluggable transceiver compatible with the 400ZR industry standard, which enables 400 gig per wavelength using coherent technology. We expect to maintain our leadership position in the DCI market and project that COLORZ 2 deployments will start this year.
With an industry-standard now in place, we see multiple hyperscalers and additional customers adopting pluggable ZR technology, which creates a significantly larger revenue opportunity for our DCI platform. Turning now to our storage business. Storage revenue for the first quarter was $303 million, growing 17% year on year and declining 7% sequentially. Results were better than our expectations as we benefited from stronger demand for SSD controllers.
The stellar year-on-year results were driven by ramps in our custom DIY SSD controller programs and ongoing growth in cloud demand for nearline drives, which benefited from -- benefited our HDD controllers and pre-amplifiers. The sequential decline was primarily due to our Fiber Channel business. Looking to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect storage to deliver another strong performance driven by the nearline HDD and data center SSD markets. We are projecting revenue to grow year on year in the mid-teens and in the double digits sequentially on a percentage basis.
Our recent results and expectations for ongoing growth reflect the significant transformation of our storage business. In our HDD business, data center has become the largest revenue contributor relative to other markets. Our preampflier business is now ramped up to an annualized run rate of over $50 million, and we believe that we can more than double this run rate. We are continuing to step up the technology cadence for our SSD controllers, and we recently introduced the industry's first PCIe Gen5 SSD controller family designed to address the data movement and security challenges in cloud infrastructure.
We are excited to collaborate directly with hyperscalers and NAND vendors to bring this leading solution to market. In addition, I'm pleased to announce that a key NAND OEM has chosen to partner with Marvell to develop custom PCIe Gen 5 and Gen 6 SSD controllers for their enterprise and cloud solutions. The Gen 6 product will be built on our five-nanometer process. In the storage market, this is a quantum leap and process node cadence and is a testament to Marvell's advanced technology platform.
We expect to leverage the leading-edge IP we are developing to be deployed in additional advanced node storage solutions. Our strategy to refocus this business on the data center market has been a huge success. Data center has grown to over 60% of storage revenue from less than 20% in fiscal 2017. In closing, we had a great start to fiscal 2022, and I'm very excited about the growth prospects in front of us as a combined company.
When we announced the acquisition of Inphi, we increased our long-term target model for revenue growth to 12% to 16% annually. I'm pleased that our recent results and near-term expectations are, in fact, currently trending above the high end of this target range. This is primarily due to our own product cycles, combined with sustainable secular growth trends in our data infrastructure markets. The acquisition of Inphi has increased our exposure to the data center, which is our largest end market.
And within that, cloud is the largest growth opportunity across Marvell, significantly bigger than our 5G opportunity. Inphi has already established a strong position within cloud, addressing an opportunity growing at a 60% plus CAGR. The Marvell organic opportunity in cloud is also substantial, which we are addressing with our merchant, semi-custom, and flexible ASIC model for compute, networking, acceleration, security, and storage applications. At our Analyst Day last year, we discussed this opportunity growing at an expected 19% CAGR to over $5 billion by calendar 2023.
The adoption of ARM processors in servers continues to gain traction, and this further increases our cloud opportunity. We expect cloud revenue for the combined company to grow rapidly. As Marvell's five-nanometer products come to market, we expect a substantial step-up in our cloud revenue. I'm very pleased to report that we have been recently awarded a number of significant design wins, leveraging our advanced technology platform.
Respecting customer confidentiality, we will not be in a position to discuss any specific win. They are with multiple customers across a variety of applications and business models. We expect these products to start ramping into production in calendar 2023, achieving peak revenue in the calendar 2024 to 2025 time frame. As I approach my five-year anniversary at Marvell, I've never felt stronger about our growth prospects, and I'm grateful to all our employees who have worked hard to transform the company to position us for what we believe will be a very exciting future.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our GAAP results for the first quarter for the combined company followed by Marvell's stand-alone non-GAAP performance and conclude with our outlook. Please note, our GAAP financials include 10 days of results from the Inphi business and the impact of purchase price comping items, share-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, vehicle segment, and acquisition-related costs.
Revenue was $832 million. GAAP gross margin was 50.2%. GAAP operating expenses were $500 million. GAAP operating loss was $82 million.
GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.13. Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory at the end of the first quarter was $538 million, which include the impact of setting up Inphi's inventory by $187 million due to purchase price accounting. We amortized the $40 million of this step-up into cost of goods sold in the first quarter, and we anticipate amortizing the remaining balance by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
During the quarter, we paid $140 million in cash for fees related to the Inphi transaction. Excluding those one-time payments, our cash flow generation from operations would have been $100 million. As a reminder, our cash flow generation has seasonality and tend to be lower in our first fiscal quarter due to the payment for annual cash bonus to employees. In the first quarter, we distributed $41 million to shareholders in dividends.
We exited the quarter with $523 million in cash and short-term investments. Our long-term debt was $4.7 billion and currently carries the blended interest rate of approximately 2.5%. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.9, and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.4, based on combined pro forma EBITDA. We continue to have a strong investment-grade credit profile.
Our capital allocation priorities over the next 12 months are to maintain our current dividend level and utilize our free cash flow to pay down debt used for the acquisition for Inphi. We believe we can drive strong revenue growth and free cash flow generation to quickly achieve our target ratio of two times gross debt-to-EBITDA. I'll now move on to stand-alone Marvell non-GAAP results. As Ashish had noted earlier, we are providing stand-alone Marvell results on a one-time basis this quarter because our previously provided financial outlook for the first quarter excluded any impact of the Inphi acquisition.
Reconciliation of our stand-alone and combined performance, as well as GAAP to non-GAAP results available in our press release. Stand-alone Marvell revenue in the first quarter was $810 million, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Networking represented 60% of our revenue with storage contributing 36%. Revenue from other accounted for 4%.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.3%, above our guidance and the 150-basis-point improvement from a year ago, primarily due to better product mix and our team's continued effort to drive operational excellence. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $297 million as we continue to tightly manage our expenses while investing for growth. Non-GAAP operating margin was 27.7%, an 810-basis-point increase from a year ago, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business model. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.29, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.02, and is up more than 60% year over year.
Let me now comment on our plan for operating expenses going forward. After closing the Inphi acquisition, the starting pro forma operating expense trend rate for the combined company was approximately $375 million per quarter. We expect our operating expenses to grow annually in the range of 4% to 5% as we continue to invest to support our long-term growth, including incremental R&D spending for Inphi. However, we expect to more than offset this operating expense growth through deal-related synergies.
We expect total cost of synergies for $125 million from the Inphi acquisition with approximately $100 million coming from operating expenses. The midpoint of our second-quarter opex guidance of $372.5 million includes $10 million of synergy achievement on a run rate basis. We expect to achieve half of our targeted opex synergy exiting fiscal 2022 and the full synergy realization by the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We'll continue to be disciplined in allocating resources and expect to drive revenue growth significantly higher than opex growth to deliver strong earnings expansion.
The remaining $25 million of cost synergies will come from cost goods sold, which we expect to start to take effect in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and be fully realized by the third quarter of the same year. Our team has a strong track record of integration execution from prior acquisitions. I'm very confident about our synergy achievement plan. Now turning to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which included a full quarter of Inphi.
We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.065 billion, plus or minus 3%. At the middle point of this outlook, we expect approximately $250 million of revenue contribution from the Inphi business. As Matt mentioned earlier, at this level of revenue, we expect the Inphi business will be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings. We expect our GAAP gross margin in the range of 34.8% to 37.5%.
We project our non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 64%. In a tight supply environment, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin in the near future to remain around this level, subject to product mix change in any given quarter. We project our GAAP operating expense to be in the range of $633 million to $643 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $370 million to $375 million.
Following the Inphi acquisition, the company domicile changed from Bermuda to Delaware. Based on tax deductions and credits we have, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 5% for the remainder of the fiscal year. And the current tax laws, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to increase by approximately 100 basis points each year for the next couple of years. We expect other expenses will be approximately $34.5 million, which include interest expense of $33 million.
We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 822 million. And our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be $835 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP loss per share to be $0.37, plus or minus $0.04. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share to be $0.31, plus or minus $0.03.

Questions & Answers:

Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And our first question today will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the results. Matt, I'm just sort of curious, when you look at sort of this quarter and the guide, can you help us better understand relative to your ability to capture supply? Did deficiencies grow this quarter? You did a nice job in the core networking business growing almost 9% sequentially, but I'm trying to get a sense as to whether or not demand continues to outstrip supply.
And if you could help us understand, is this a wafer issue? Or are there other issues? And as you think about resolving them in the back half of the year, why so confident?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Great, John. Thanks for the question. Yes, we're very happy with the results in networking.
I mean, as you pointed out, that was a sequential number. So clearly, business has been very, very good for us in networking. And certainly, year over year, to do 20% plus is great. The demand, John, continues in Q2 and beyond.
We're continuing to work on improving the supply on our networking products. As it turns out, and as you've probably seen, the complexity on our networking business in terms of the manufacturing, cycle time supply chain is much more complex and challenging than on the storage side. So we've been able to meet some more of the upsides on storage than we have networking. But no, John, business continues to be strong.
We do have line of sight to the supply improving in the second half, which is encouraging. And that's why we're continuing to be very bullish about the outlook for our overall networking business because the demand is clearly there, and we've now got supply coming online in the back half, as well as into next year. So things are improving for sure.
Operator
And our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. Matt, I had one more and to kind of extend that question into the second half visibility from two aspects. One is the supply aspect, that is supply coming online gradually. Or are you planning to see perhaps a faster improvement on the supply side? And the other perspective on this is how much of your second-half growth, fiscal year growth is dependent on enterprise and China 5G recovery, which have tended to be quite volatile?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Vivek. Yeah. I think -- look, in this environment, in general, supply is coming in, not in large chunks. Although I would say given the ramp we had been planning for some time, in our case, you know, we do see more significant amount of supply coming in, in the second half.
So that will improve, and we have visibility of that, both on the wafer side, as well as on the back-end side. And at the same time, as we ramp our supply position, as I mentioned to John, the demand side continues to outstrip our ability to supply at all, but we're making good progress there. On your second question. In both cases, both in enterprise, as well as China 5G, those are not comprehended to have market-related comebacks in that time frame.
On enterprise, as you've seen, I mean, we've been growing that business well above double digit for some time, including in our Q1, and we do anticipate that to continue. Now that's mostly on the back of our own product cycles, OK? And we've been very successful, I think, in our enterprise and campus switching, also in our PHY business. And so that continues. So that's -- and by the way, and what's been viewed as a very soft market, both by the OEMs, as well as other semiconductor peers.
So if that end market improves with return to work and vaccinations improving, that would be a pretty significant tailwind on our business. As it relates to 5G in China, maybe just to kind of frame it in the bigger picture, I think, first, our own team internally, I want to give them credit, they did a good job for, in the first half, telling us last year that the mapping out the digestion phase, which is what's happened, so that's actually been in line with our plan. And we're not necessarily counting on a big recovery in that in the second half. If it does, that would be great.
But just to frame it, Vivek, in the bigger picture, the -- our 5G business and exposure in China is actually less than 20% of our overall 5G business, both now and even going forward. And in fact, it probably slowly becomes a smaller percentage over time as our new OEMs ramp up and some of these other initiatives kick in. So again, either of those two came back very strong, that would also be a tailwind on our business.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks, Matt.
Operator
And our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Thanks a lot, Matt, I know it's probably early to ask this question, but can you give us a sense of sort of what kind of synergies you might see on the revenue side? I know you're not putting any of those into the model, but can you talk about that? And then I guess also, Jean, I was just wondering if you can talk about what the normalized gross margin is. I know you're guiding to 64%, but it sounds like that's still being hampered by some constraints. So I'm kind of wondering what is the right normalized number if you didn't have those. Thanks.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Tim, I'll take the first part, and then we'll hand it to Jean. So yes, as you noted, you know, historically, we've -- just by practice, not tried to articulate or size revenue synergies when we announced the deal. It's just very hard to do. And quite frankly, it's very hard to even measure in the rearview mirror.
But that being said, you know, on all of these transactions we've done, we can look back and we can actually point to cases where one plus one was way over two. And it kind of comes in two pieces. The first is really what I would call the customer revenue synergy, Tim, which would be we have products that we can sell, for example, into 5G or the cloud, and Inphi, in this case, would as well. And in those discussions, the notion that we can be a better supplier together really comes together.
I mean if you remember back in the -- after the Cavium transaction, I think that was very significant, what happened with -- in 5G and with Samsung, where together, we were able to get effectively the whole platform, where a part we had actually very little content. So I do -- I'm very encouraged by what we see. I think customers really like the combination to a person, and those are very strong. And I believe we will see cases we can point to.
It's already under way. The second part of it is really more of a technical one, which is how do we actually incorporate the intellectual property of the two companies, put it together, and deliver better solutions. Those discussions are also going well, in particular with the Inphi SerDes, IP as it relates to our ASIC business, our road map into co-packaged optics, and our vision of optics everywhere and not just copackaging and with the switch, but also in things like AI and ML ASICs and DPUs. So that's going to be a very critical piece of the puzzle as we enter these complex markets and more and more the connectivity moves to electro-optic solution.
So that, I think, Tim, is -- we're very, very excited about all that. I think it's going to work out very well on both of those fronts I mentioned. Let me hand it over to Jean to cover the second question.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Tim, on your gross margin question, as you remember, when we announced the Inphi deal, we actually guided the combined company gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 66%. We are actually very pleased with our Q1 gross margin performance. Marvell stand-alone actually achieved 64.3% under a very tight supply chain environment. As we said before, Inphi actually is accretive to our gross margin.
I think the dynamics, as all you know, is supply chain is very tight. And we are trying to really manage it through the supply chain challenge, but we do think the combined company with the Inphi margin higher than 65%, we're going to trend higher going forward when we combine both companies, drive the top-line revenue growth.
Operator
And our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Blayne Curtis -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst
Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious on the storage outlook, I heard you say nearline in SSD. Is that kind of the seasonal ramp of DIY and any other drivers to point out? And I'm just curious on fiber channel spend kind of yoyo.
Is that going back in July as well?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Great question, Blayne, on storage. So a couple of things. So on the SSD side, yes, that's actually multiple DIY programs now.
Those are kicking in, in various end markets, and we see that trend being obviously way up year over year this year, but growing strongly into next year. So I think that strategy to really work closely with some of these system-level OEMs, whether it be in the cloud or other applications, it's a pretty compelling business model. So that one is going well. On the cloud or on the nearline side, yes, I mean, I think if you just look at the performance of these large cloud properties and how they're performing in terms of their own revenue growth, there's certainly a scaling that goes on with storage.
So the need for increased capacity in cold storage continues. We're well-positioned with that with our controllers and our preamplifers actually, which is a new revenue stream for us as well. So that's still continuing, and that's very strong. And then finally, the fiber channel, it was one of our most stable businesses, Blayne, going back even when Cavium owned it, even when it was QLogic, it.
Certainly have a lot of choppiness this year with manufacturing supply disruptions in Southeast Asia. That's been -- that's started to stabilize. Actually, fiber channel grew quarter over quarter and will continue to get better. And we hope that that will -- just by design, that should be a much more stable business.
So yeah, overall, just I think you've heard in my remarks, I mean, we're just -- it's been a journey on the storage side, and I've just got to thank our entire team for fundamentally transforming a business, which, if you go back five years ago when I showed up, and this wasn't just me, the whole management team, this was a business that was highly concentrated, HDD controllers only, selling all into two and a half-inch notebooks, OK? And that was sort of the story and the melting ice cube people were worried about. And so I'm very proud of the team when I fast forward five years, and we've now got greater than 60% of our storage business in data center and these high-performance applications and then really the bulk of the balance being in very sticky, stable markets. And the exposure to things like notebooks being de minimis, I think it's been a great transformation story. And the fact that we're having calls talking about our storage business growing double digits and continuing to do that is a great effort.
And by the way, we're not milking this business either. I mean, we've been very aggressive to move our platform to five-nanometer, which effectively jumped at least a node for most people, probably for most people with two or three nodes. But for these high-performance applications, Blayne, especially in the data center, you get tremendous power savings by doing this. So that's going to be a first step into a broader platform of products in storage, as well as in our traditional networking businesses like processors and switch chips.
Blayne Curtis -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst
Thanks, Matt.

And our next question will come from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks a lot. Looking forward to hearing the end market split last quarter, so thanks proactively for doing that. Matt, I want to go to the networking business again.
And the last four quarters has kind of been up 10% then flat, up 10% and now guided flat again. Overall, year-over-year growth is really, really strong. So no complaints, but is that lumpiness something that's just inherent to the markets that you're addressing? Was it supply driven? And perhaps more importantly, you talked about an acceleration in the back half of the year. Can you just talk about a few of the Marvell-specific drivers that will allow that acceleration? And do you expect that lumpiness to go away as the breadth of the business improves internally and with the addition of Inphi?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Great questions. So just quickly on the first one. Actually, we're -- I'm pretty excited about moving to the end market reporting.
I think it's going to give investors a much clearer view of our growth drivers. It actually reflects how we think about allocating the capital of the company. I mean I've actually managed the company from a market-based philosophy from the very beginning. And so to now be able to show you our data center business, there's also peers that report those numbers, so it will give investors a sense of our relative growth rates.
And then carrier, you can capture our 5G anyway. So I think that will be a real positive thing for everybody. On the networking side, it's interesting, Ross, that individually, some of these businesses are inherently lumpy. I mean I think we all know that the carrier telecom-type businesses tend to be lumpier than others.
That being said, when you blend actually our combined networking businesses across things like enterprise and carrier and even right now, automotive is reported in our networking, actually, from an end demand standpoint, you do get a smoother profile, which has all been up into the right by the way. I think in the last year, the dynamic on the quarterly moves has been more supply related than it has been just, hey, networking was up and then everybody kind of slowed down together and everybody is up. Actually, business has been very strong, Ross, since last year. If you recall, we started growing the company double digits year over year in Q2 of last year.
So we've been on this double-digit growth rate. Now we're -- it's actually accelerating. And during this time frame, if we could get more supply, it would probably look a lot -- look smoother, if you will. But I think you're right to integrate it over maybe a few quarter period, first half, second half, or even one-year period to get the full view just because the manufacturing cycle times of some of these products can be several quarters.
So if you get upside, there's a time to react. But no, if you just sort of blended end demand, Ross, you'd see a very steady increase. And the nice thing is we have a very diversified business in networking. So it's spread across all these end markets, as I mentioned.

And our next question will come from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Thank you very much, Matt. I wanted to ask about a comment you made at the top of the call, which was you're feeling really confident about just starting a new phase of a multi-year growth. I just wanted to double-click on that. What are the underpinnings of that confidence? Can you talk a little bit about the design wins you have on the cloud side? And then you also gave a bit of a hint when you talked about cloud being a much larger opportunity than 5G.
Just kind of frame that discussion in -- with that in mind as well.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Ambrish. I mean I would say both in the relative near term, OK, and over the next several years. I actually break it into three phases. There's the sort of second half of this year, looking into next year and the year after, and then I would say, out a few years beyond that.
I think -- and I didn't quite answer Ross' question, but I'll weave it in here. His last one was what do you see in the second half? So in networking, for example, I mean, we have the 5G ramp for us will pick up, will accelerate. That's primarily due to increased adoption in the United States and deployments there plus design wins that we have won several years ago ramping into production. You've got a very strong Marvell business in the cloud with our SmartNIC product line, that's been growing very, very nicely and will continue in the second half.
I'm surprised no one asked the question about Inphi yet, but we're very pleased to guide two 15 for Inphi in Q2, which is, I think, well above what anybody thought. That business is also going to continue to accelerate in the second half, both on the intra-data center business in PAM4, as well as the 400 ZR ramp, which we think will be meaningful next year, but also starting this year. And then finally, as I mentioned, the Ethernet switch and PHY business, you could also throw automotive in there. I mean we got almost all of these growth drivers we mentioned continue.
So that's right in front of us. I think what I get very excited about, as you alluded to, is the design win momentum in the company has been extremely strong. And probably -- not probably, as strong as I've ever seen it in the past five years I've been here and any kind of prior record I could find. And those are things that, as we noted in my remarks, would be designs we win now that would ramp up starting probably in calendar '23, '24 and then go beyond that.
And that's also -- you should kind of tie it together with that was when our five-nanometer platform will be really in full production across multiple end customers, end markets, and end applications. So that's one that kind of layers on top of all of this and candidly, would extend beyond what we talked about at the last Investor Day. So I think if you draw a line between here and there, there's all kinds of goodness in different areas, Ambrish, but I think we're feeling really good about the investments we made. I think the acquisitions that we did position us really well and they fit together in their own way.
And I think -- and finally, I would say that the customer go-to-market, our brand promise to our customers, the way we engage, the way we partner resonates really well in this environment. And we're just -- we're viewed as a very credible and reliable partner with scale now, especially with Inphi and to really deliver the most complex critical products that our customers need.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Matt, I'm sorry, just a clarification. This design win momentum does not include Inphi. So that would be on top of this, right? So this is what you're talking about, the organic business has been working on, right?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. This is just Marvell, stand-alone. So all those comments on largest sort of design win type achievement we've seen plus the funnel, that's all from the organic Marvell business, OK? Starting next quarter, we're going to have the Inphi team in our results and in our internal results in terms of our design win funnel and momentum. But yeah, they've done a great job, too.
I mean that's the whole other story. But I'm just saying stand-alone Marvell with our five-nanometer platform and our 5G cloud strategy, automotive, all the things we articulated at the Investor Day, pre-Inphi, that's all tracking the in line or better than we thought.

And our next question will come from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Good afternoon, and congratulations on the results and outlook. On the newly acquired Inphi business unit, it looks like inside cloud data center upgrade to 200- and 400-gig PAM4 optical connectivity is accelerating as we move into the second half with two more cloud titans just starting to upgrade cycle. And then on top of that, it looks like the first one or two cloud titans are starting to fire on the data center to data center DCI optical upgrade, the new 400-gig ZR standard. As you mentioned, the team has a strong leadership position in both of these areas.
Are you guys already starting to see this ramp in your bookings or backlog for the second half or maybe even some of these already starting to fire here in the July quarter? And it seems like we're still in the very early innings of both of these upgrade cycles, but just wanted to get your views.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Harlan. Yeah. No, I think we are -- to start maybe at the end first.
We're in the early innings of both these upgrade cycles. I think your commentary overall is right. Both of those are accelerating. On the PAM side, I would say probably by the end of '23, certainly between -- if you draw a line between now and the end of -- I'm sorry, calendar '22, our fiscal '23, you'll see most of this conversion from these legacy NRZ solutions move over.
And that's still a decent amount of the connections today. So there's a big lift between now and then. That's pretty exciting. And then, of course, you've got other hyperscalers around the world outside the U.S.
On 400 ZR, that is also just at the beginning phases. I think that's going to be much more broad, obviously, than COLORZ was, which was 100 gig, and it was really for one customer. And that is -- both of those, we have strong backlog, bookings, visibility, heads down to plan the supply and to plan the ramp. So those are very much intact, which was really part of our deal thesis for doing it in the first place.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

And our next question will come from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Christopher Rolland -- Susquehanna Financial Group -- Analyst
Thanks for the question. Matt, you did mention the pause in spending -- 5G spending, and you also did talk about China as well. But I was wondering if maybe we could talk about some of the other geographies, how they're ramping. And then in terms of your 5G lead customers, how close do you think we are to a full run rate in terms of their ramps? Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Yeah. No, I think in general, the 5G momentum is quite strong. I think, obviously, you saw the impact on people last year with China, which was very meaningful.
And that will, by the way, over time, we're debating, is it second half or when is it? But those deployments will obviously continue. They're not done. Then the U.S. is really, I think, where we're going to see a lot of traction this year.
India is a little more unclear. I think the latest is certainly trials will be conducted at the end of this year. Candidly, I think, with impact of COVID-19 in the country that's probably delayed things. We saw that last year.
If you remember, there was supposed to be a much larger U.S. build-out and COVID delayed that. We're watching that. But no, I think, overall, it's been a very meaningful technology transition.
And so we were -- we think that's going to be very broad. We've still got a ways to go, to be honest with you. There's a lot in front of us relative to getting to full run rate with the full platform at our two lead OEMs. In one case, we have the platform, but they're really ramping their business based on the geographies that they participate in.
And then with our second customer, those chips are still -- a lot of those are in development, although our first products are ramping very nicely, and we're pleased to see that both those companies are participating very actively in the global 5G rollouts. So that was all positive. And yeah -- and by the way, I mean, even with China stays flat, as I mentioned, it's -- we do see a very strong second half for our 5G business. And we just came off our seventh quarter in a row of growing that business sequentially.
So it's been a real tailwind for us. I did want to just make one comment before we move to the next question. I actually misspoke earlier, there was a question about fiber channel. And I think it was Ross about it being lumpy.
So I had my quarters off. So it was down -- fiber was down in Q1. That was part of the lumpy down. It's going to be up in Q2, and then we anticipate it -- unless there's some other disruptions, that should be a generally flat business going forward.
And obviously, in the scheme of things in the combined company, I don't -- and reported by end market, I don't anticipate we're going to be having lots of discussions about fiber channel anymore. But if something happens, we'll let you guys know.

And our next question will come from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Gary Mobley -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. On the topic of COVID spreading in different geographies, I guess we get a little tick-up in Taiwan. I'm wondering if you can share with us based on your conversations with your supply chain, whether or not you're possibly facing any production interruptions out of that region.
And then, Jean, given the different moving parts in the opex, the 5% growth as you articulated over the long term and then the leaving in at the $125 million of synergies, when would you expect the quarterly opex to bottom, whether in absolute terms or relative terms that $372.5 million Q2 guide? Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Gary, I'll take the first one. I think it's -- I think you're just highlighting a very important reminder for everybody on this call, who I believe probably everybody here is calling in from the United States, where things are opening up and things are feeling like they're getting back to normal. And as you point out, we're monitoring very closely the situation, not only in Taiwan.
Obviously, we don't have production in India, but many chip companies have significant India operations in terms of R&D. You've got other countries in Southeast Asia that are having outbreaks. Malaysia would be one. So we're watching this very, very closely.
It's been just an unprecedented year between weather and the virus on the supply chain. But we're watching it, and that's -- we've comprehended as much as we could on any of these things into our guidance. We do that every quarter. But certainly, it's a dynamic situation.
I mean we had a water issue in Taiwan recently. I guess, with the recent improvement there, some of that's backed off. So yes, it's something we've got to watch and manage very dynamically, Gary, but we've comprehended all of that in our outlook. Jean, do you want to answer the second question?
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. OK. Gary, on the opex side, given the opportunities and the revenue momentum we have been seeing in front of us, we definitely want to continue to invest. The 5% increase for next year, really, it's incorporated the Marvell side, for regular increase, we typically at the 2% to 3%.
But on the Inphi side, there are tremendous opportunities, so the R&D investment is higher. So we are looking really just the next year. And on the synergy side, we talk about the $100 million opex synergy achievement. The way to think about it is exiting fiscal '22, we should be able to achieve 50% of that $100 million run rate synergy.
And then as you know, Q1 always seasonally opex is a little bit higher because of payroll increase in Q1 than Q2, Q3. By the Q3 time, we should get the to the run rate, which achieved the full synergy at the same time, contemplated the increase, offset the increase of the year over year. In the longer term, you should expect us to continue to focus on to grow revenue significantly faster than opex so we can expand the earnings quickly.

And our next question will come from Quinn Bolton with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst
Two for Matt. First, sort of near term, Matt, with supply, line of sight to supply increases in the second half of the year, have you been able to stabilize lead times to customers? And then my second question is kind of a longer term. With the ramp of 400- and 800-gig modules in the data center, that business potentially being even bigger than 5G for you, are you starting to get questions from customers about Marvell developing its own internal switch fabric? Or are customers happy for you to partner on SerDes and optical co-packaging and other opportunities without owning the switch fiber?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Great. Thanks, Quinn. Yes, on the first one, yes, certainly, we have, as I mentioned, line of sight on our supply through the end of the year and encouraged by what we're seeing also for next year as well.
Look, lead times are very extended for everybody at this point. We've asked our customers for significant backlog to -- and not only the backlog, but really the detailed sort of discussion behind the backlog relative to what are the drivers, how much of it is for buffer, or how much do you have now? What are your plans so we can get better line of sight to allocate the material? And we've also worked with many of them and are in the process of doing that to really firm up those orders relative to their ability to reschedule and cancel them, but we're giving them time to sort of figure that out. So I think that's been a healthy exercise, but lead times are not coming down. They're extended, not because we want to keep them extended, but the supply chain given the -- just the volume on it, there's just queues and you just have to make sure you plan for that.
And then on the data center side, we certainly have many of the key pieces, if not almost all the key pieces to really be a big player in the cloud infrastructure side with our ASICs, with the PAM products you mentioned, I mean, O-RAN, all kinds of things. On the switch side, it's an interesting discussion because we're very aggressively promoting and developing a co-packaged optics solution that will be very much open source for the industry. So we want to be an enabler of that. We think that's going to be a good thing, whether somebody wants to do their own ASIC or co-packaged it with a partner.
And that's a discussion that we're having. I think we're encouraged because when you look at our -- and I noted in my comments, we introduced about 18 months ago, our multi-terabit Switch family, where just as -- for a reminder, these are at 3.2, 6.4, and 12.8 terabits per second. It's a modular design architecture. Now it's fully featured, which has its advantages in many applications because that's really what customers want.
On the other hand, there's a lot of optimization you can do if you really want to do a high-end switch for just speeds and feeds. And I think everything is on the table in terms of looking at all that in the context of Inphi coming in, in particular. And those are just some very active discussions we're having. But the road map notwithstanding, we're extremely pleased with this high-end platform that we announced, it's done really well in the market.
Revenues ramping significantly, and it's going to have a very good year next year and beyond. So I think that was a good investment that we made. And that really positioned us, Quinn, as a full provider from SMB switches to enterprise and campus, which is core in aggregation, all the way into the fully featured data center-type applications. So it would be logical for us to consider, you know, broadening the portfolio there.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst

Our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko.
Srini Pajjuri -- SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc. -- Analyst
That's SMBC Nikko. I have a clarification question. Matt, first, on the outlook for the networking segment, if my math is correct here, I think you're guiding Inphi to be up at least mid-teens sequentially. And your core networking business, you said it's going to be up slightly.
So I'm just trying to understand, is the difference primarily on the supply side? Or is it the demand, if you can clarify that? And then my second question, more of a longer-term question. You mentioned ARM servers and obviously, you've been the leader in that market for a long time. And there's been a lot of buzz, as you mentioned lately, and some of your peers are also announcing design wins. So my question is, when can we expect to hear from Marvell in terms of the design wins and revenue contribution from that market?
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Srini, maybe I'll answer your first question on the Inphi guide, right? So what we guide for Q2 combined company Inphi revenue, we said, is about $215 million. So in Q1, we only had $22 million of Inphi business. So you really cannot compare sequentially year over year, if you look at $215 million Inphi revenue, it means almost 24% year-over-year increase. On the Marvell side, I would say we guided basically, as Matt has said earlier, slightly up sequentially for the Marvell networking.
So if you add Marvell networking plus Inphi's $215 million, that's what our guide for Q2 networking business. I'll let Matt answer the -- your second question.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, that's right, Jean. And I mean I think the bigger picture, Srini, on the first one is just the blend of these two businesses are growing around 20% a year on networking kind of plus, right? So it's a very strong performance. And I noted the issues earlier on our side. On ARM, it really is a trend that's been happening.
We certainly have a lot of capability in this area. There's a lot of confidentiality around this market. I can't really comment on us or the other people because I think it's also a little dangerous at times to talk about things. Is it a development type of opportunity? Is it a real production thing? So I think we -- and our pivot and our business model last year was really to move this business from being one where, in a lot of ways, our Thunder product line really was a prototype type of capability that we enabled the whole industry on.
But in the end, what we found is nobody actually wanted to buy the standard products. So we're very pleased with the pivot we made. We have -- we believe, the best set of IP true ability to stitch together these very large, high-end complex processors. I mean if you think about the things that we're doing for 5G or for networking or even what we built on Thunder, we have a second to none capability there.
And you should just assume that we're very active in this market, but in a different kind of a business model where we engage directly with these customers, there's an NRE type of arrangement. We build them exactly what they want. And the use cases and the benefits of moving to ARM are significant. And I think publicly, it's out there, the instances that are being moved more and more with an AWS platform to Graviton, which is their own, we obviously don't participate in that, but it's just a great proof point for the industry.
It's real and it's happening, ARM and infrastructure, and we're -- our view is we would be the leading company for anyone to talk to about not only be able to design the chip and productize it but then to supply it in the kind of volumes that's required. It's -- that's a key part of the equation now.

And our next question will come from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just some clarification regarding the additional supply.
And with that additional supply coming on, at what point do you expect to be back at the level where you're shipping all your customers' orders? Do you think you get there by the end of the second half? Or is that going to take longer?Just following on from that, we've heard from a lot of others, obviously, with the tight supply conditions, order visibilities stretching out customers, or placing orders for in advance. It sounds like from your prior comments that you're not forcing those customer orders to be noncancelable at this point. Maybe just clarify that a little more and talk about what additional visibility that gives you going forward.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Yeah, Chris. Thanks for the question. As I noted earlier, you know, we've been growing this company double digits since a year ago, and it's only accelerating.
And as we've done that, that's been great. But candidly, we haven't made a real dent in the delinquency. And in fact, I think our business momentum is growing, but I think the demands on us are growing even faster than our supply. So we're working hard on it.
But I would say anybody that tells you in this industry that they know when this is going to get better, like, hey, it's going to happen in a quarter. It's going to -- I don't think that you're probably getting a realistic answer is my view. I think it's very dynamic. It's unprecedented.
And at this point, there are so many industries that are up and to the right and everybody is clamoring for product that -- but we're working on it. And like I said, we're the type of company, Chris, that I think we're more focused on the long term, slow and steady, keep cranking it out every quarter, keep blocking and tackling through this time period. and keep making sure our customer are up. And then on your second question, no, we are ensuring that we have protection and not only protection, but I would say mutual commitment with our customers around the supply.
So we do have a large portion of our backlog, which is only getting more, to be honest, that is noncancelable. We are being somewhat flexible around building in some reschedule capability. Maybe you can do it once. And we're trying to work with our customers on this, but we're having to make commitments, especially with the growth that we see in front of us, which I'm very comfortable doing, but I also want to have the backstop of my customers.
And this environment has created a dynamic where pretty much the CEO level at all of our major accounts, they're willing to engage in this type of discussion, activate their materials teams, and get everybody together so that we can plan this thing as a combined team, a Marvell team and a customer team versus two independent entities off doing their own thing and the era of customers being secretive about their volumes or hiding the ball or not one you're doing just in time, that's kind of all-out the window at this point. And so the visibility is pretty good that we're getting, but we are ensuring that we -- when we're making commitments, we've got some backstop from the customers that want the product.

And our next question will come from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Yeah. Hey, guys. First of all, congratulation on solid results and also being so clear about all the numbers. It really helps us out.
I had a question, Matt. I was wondering if you could break down your networking business. Let's say, just even for core Marvell organically, the split or rough color between 5G, cloud, and enterprise. And also if Nokia is -- is it running at ramp? Or has it got still room to run from here?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, Harsh, all of your wishes are going to come true next quarter because we're going to break out for you in detail the data center business of Marvell, which is going to have the cloud data. We're going to break up the carrier, which you'll be able -- we'll build it. And we'll talk to all of these, by the way, right? So you'll be able to get a sense of the moving pieces of 5G.
We're going to have an auto industrial, which is -- obviously, the big growth there is going to come from the automotive. And then our enterprise networking, which I think is a great proxy as well. So I think we're going to give you what you want, and we're going to give you seven quarters of history, and we're going to guide it. So you'll be like a kid in a candy store.
And then on the second question on Nokia, yes, that's still ramping. You've heard their commentary. They're ramping up. We're kind of replacing their legacy solutions within their -- they have their recharge portfolio.
We're part of that. They talk openly about sort of replacing FPGAs with recharge. So we're just part of that growth. And then, of course, we've got future opportunities where we're going to intersect with them with new sockets over time.
So that's still in a ramp phase though. It's still early.
