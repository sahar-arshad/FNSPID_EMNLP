2021-10-04 00:00:00+00:00,"GlobalFoundries shows revenue jump, smaller loss in U.S. IPO paperwork",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/globalfoundries-shows-revenue-jump-smaller-loss-in-u.s.-ipo-paperwork-2021-10-04,,,"By Niket Nishant and Anirban Sen
Oct 4 (Reuters) - Chipmaker GlobalFoundries revealed a jump in revenue in its filing for a stock market flotation, setting the stage for a blockbuster finish to a record year for initial public offerings in the United States.
GlobalFoundries, which is owned by Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co, has not set terms for its listing yet, but it could seek a valuation of about $25 billion, Reuters first reported in August.
The IPO, one of the most hotly anticipated deals of the year, is expected to round out a record year for flotations, after several other big names such as Robinhood Markets Inc HOOD.O, Coinbase Global Inc COIN.O and Roblox Corp RBLX.N capitalized on the capital markets boom earlier in 2021.
Alongside electric-vehicle maker Rivian's stock market debut, GlobalFoundries is expected to headline an unusually crowded year-end IPO schedule, as companies look to make the most of sky-high investor appetite for listings of high-growth tech companies.
During the pandemic, the broader industry that includes automakers and electronics producers has been crimped by a global shortage of chips, which has fuelled manufacturing delays.
GlobalFoundries' revenue had been in decline since 2018, but over the past 12 months its growth rebounded as worldwide demand for chips sky-rocketed.
""Although the supply-demand imbalance is expected to improve over the medium-term, the semiconductor industry will require a significant increase in investment to keep up with demand,"" GlobalFoundries said in the filing. (https://bit.ly/2YgEJuh)
The chipmaker has been consolidating its product lines and announced plans to expand into new factories in the U.S. and Singapore. GlobalFoundries plans to build a second factory near its Malta, New York, headquarters, and spend $1 billion to boost output.
The company's net revenue for the six months ended June 30 was $3.04 billion, up nearly 13% from a year earlier. Net loss in the same period narrowed to $301 million, from $534 million a year earlier.
GlobalFoundries was created when Mubadala bought Advanced Micro Devices Inc's AMD.O manufacturing facilities in 2009, and later merged it with Singapore's Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd.
The company, which makes radio-frequency communications chips for 5G, automotive, and other specialized semiconductors, counts Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom Inc AVGO.O among its customers.
GlobalFoundries was initially targeting a listing in late 2022 or early 2023, but moved up the timetable to capitalize on the current IPO boom, people familiar with the matter said.
TAKEOVER TARGET
GlobalFoundries' decision to file for an IPO is a clear sign that it is not eager to accept a potential merger with Intel Corp or other potential buyers during the current chip boom.
The Wall Street Journal reported in July that Intel Corp INTC.O was weighing a buyout of GlobalFoundries. It stopped short of making a formal offer, Reuters reported in August.
GlobalFoundries was concerned such a tie-up would upset some of its key customers that are Intel's rivals, Reuters previously reported.
GlobalFoundries is the world's third-largest foundry by revenue behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS, but ranks second when factoring out Samsung's foundry business that makes chips for other elements of the South Korean firm.
The U.S.-based chipmaker, which has invested about $23 billion to build five manufacturing facilities across three continents since the company was started in 2009, has about 10,000 patents, according to its filing.
GlobalFoundries plans to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""GFS"".
Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities, J.P. Morgan, Citigroup and Credit Suisse are the lead underwriters for the IPO.

September brought about a 12% correction in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. That merely reverted it back to the neckline from which it broke out a month ago. Overall, it is still outperforming its two major stock rivals. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have already given back 20% from their recent highs.

My thesis today is that the bulls have a short-term opportunity. Also, that there is no need to panic out of NVDA stock for the long term. However, I acknowledge that it is occasionally vulnerable because of how fast it rallied to these levels.
Losing that much in NVDA stock does not guarantee it can’t fall further. The stock broke out in a 40% rally from June. Therefore, there’s still room to give back some, but not alone. I doubt that it will correct without the markets in general also faltering.
If the equity markets hold up, this one will continue to shine
Pace-Setter Role
Source: Charts by TradingView
Consensus is that fundamentally this is the pacesetter of the group. The whole sector is under pressure from supply constraints, yet the VanEck vectors semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) is up almost 50% in one year. Nvidia stock constitutes 10% of the SMH and it’s up 20% more. AMD is also up but only half as much, like the S&P 500. INTC lags far behind in single digits.
7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for October
Clearly, investors perceive NVDA as the cream of the crop. It makes for a long-term investment thesis but not with a full-size position starting now. Building it over time makes sense, or actively trading around the edges shorter term.
Both strategies work in spite of what some experts might try to tell you. In theory, buying and holding forever works. Don’t take my word for it, NVDA stock is up 1,400% in five years.
Since this is a momentum stock, skillful short-term investors have dozens of opportunities to profit from big rallies and corrections.
What makes sense is a strategy that blends both without taking obvious excessive risks. Chasing a rally late opens the investor to potential immediate losses. In this case, the stock has already given back the mid-August rally. The risk of being too late has greatly diminished. There is room for it to fall into $190, which would make for excellent starting zone throughout. These have served as baselines for two rallies of 15% or more.
Every prior breakout line presents an opportunity for the bulls to find support on the way down. There was a significant one in June but far below price at $160 per share. I never say never because stocks fall even if not through their own fault. Meaning it might be inconceivable for Nvidia stock to correct another 15%, but it could happen with the right circumstances.
NVDA Stock Thesis
My overall assumption is still bullish on the markets, so I expect Nvidia to find footing. My conviction level is medium just because of extrinsic reasons. I don’t believe that the world has a good handle on its current macroeconomic fundamentals. There are too many new situations, especially from experimental monetary policies.
In other words, the experts are not really that. They might know a lot, but no one has seen this scenario before. I am conscious that I don’t know what I don’t know, so I should be cautious. The cliche statement of “cautiously optimistic” fits perfectly here.
The recent round of earnings reports were mostly strong. The negative stock reactions came in spite of that because of unrealistic expectations. The ongoing correction in the markets is somewhat worrisome, but it’s not yet an absolute top yet.
With so much stimulus money floating around, it will continue to work for a while longer past the Federal Reserve’s taper. Besides, the Fed suggested that they are still our friend. If the markets get in trouble, they will step back into it.
Valuation is not a concern even though NVDA stock is not cheap. It doesn’t need to be for as long as management is delivering rapid growth. Even then, profitability is also improving. Critics should not fault it for carrying a premium versus its competitors. If the stock markets are higher in the future, this one is also winning.

2021-10-04 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why the Chip Shortage May Hurt Chipmakers Like NXP and TSMC in 2023,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-the-chip-shortage-may-hurt-chipmakers-like-nxp-and-tsmc-in-2023-2021-10-04,,,"On the off chance that you're unaware, the world is in the grips of a microchip shortage. Technology-intensive goods ranging from automobiles to smartphones to solar panels (just to name a few) are being adversely impact by the supply crunch. Semiconductor manufacturers like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI) are working hard to catch up with demand, including investing in new production capacity. But it's still not been enough. The end result? Microchip makers can pretty much charge whatever they want for their wares, yet revenue is still crimped by a lack of inventory.
The response to the supply shortage, however, could be setting up a huge future problem that's difficult to see in the present. Namely, the massive investments being made in greater production potential right now set the stage for a price-killing chip glut in 2023.
Image source: Getty Images.
A self-induced glut awaits
That's the argument being made by technology market research outfit IDC, anyway. Late last month the company said this year's likely 17.3% growth of the undersupplied semiconductor market would ""normalize and balance"" by mid-2022. Then, in 2023, there's a ""potential for overcapacity"" as ""larger scale capacity expansions begin to come online toward the end of 2022.""
It admittedly sounds a bit insane, given the current environment and shortage rhetoric. But know that IDC isn't the only organization warning the world of this possibility. Bond and equity markets research name Moody's is worried too. In August a report published by Moody's on the matter explained, ""The [Chinese] government's semiconductor industry investment plans could lead to fierce competition, resulting in overcapacity of certain types [of chips]."" That report went on to warn that ""overcapacity is a particular risk at the fabrication stage as a result of the large amount of capital spending needed to set up fabrication plants.""
Although Moody's specifically pointed to China's role in expanding the industry's output, it's hardly going to be solely responsible for any oversupply issue. Intel is spending $20 billion to build two new semiconductor foundries in Arizona and has earmarked nearly $100 billion to expand its chipmaking capacity in Europe. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is planning to spend $100 billion over the course of the next three years to beef up its output volume. Samsung (OTC: SSNLF) is ponying up more than $200 billion to expand its capacity.
At least one big name in the industry may somewhat see the prospective problem, however.
That name is Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN). Its third-quarter guidance issued as part of its second-quarter report posted back in July wasn't exactly better than expected. More notably, although the company already has a great deal of production capacity, Q3's revenue guidance of between $4.40 billion to $4.76 billion isn't remarkably better -- given the high-demand and COVID-crimped supply at the time -- than last year's Q3 revenue of $3.82 billion. The outlook loosely suggests the headwind is already starting to blow. As Raymond James analyst Chris Caso put it, ""management likely suffers from a lack of confidence at the macro level, despite what clearly continues to be tight supply conditions,"" perhaps articulating the impending challenge in a way that Texas Instruments itself couldn't.
Think ahead, because stock prices are forward-looking
OK, fine. Too much semiconductor manufacturing capacity is on the horizon, but it won't be a problem for at least a year, and possibly two years. These names are poised to perform well in the meantime, right?
Maybe. Or maybe not.
While the demand is clearly solid and the need for chips isn't likely to ebb anytime soon, the stock market doesn't operate so straightforwardly. It's predictive in nature, meaning stocks have a way of reflecting what's likely to happen in the future as much as (if not more than) what's happening in the present.
And there's the rub. A chip glut is probably part of our foreseeable future, even if we don't know exactly when it will become readily evident. IDC reckons equilibrium will be found sometime next year, but a year is a long time. Investors as a group could see that writing on the wall anytime between now and then, and start repricing these stocks accordingly.
Bottom line? This isn't a call to sell any and all foundry/fab names right now, to be clear. It is a suggestion, however, to go ahead and put this brewing headwind on your mental radars. Once it starts to blow against these stocks, it could stiffen in a hurry.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is finally getting the credit it deserves.

Despite the company turning in stellar quarter after stellar quarter, NVDA stock just wouldn’t budge. In fact, After topping out on Sept. 2, 2020, shares were essentially flat (down less than 1%) as recently as May 20, 2021. 
For some investors, that’s one of the most frustrating things. The company reported several excellent quarters in that stretch. Guidance continued to climb, as did analysts’ expectations, Nvidia’s GTC conference in May was impressive and the company finally split its stock. 
A stock split shouldn’t be a catalyst, but it often is. Just look at the way Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) traded in August of 2020. 
In any regard, despite all this great news, NVDA stock mostly traded sideways. Well, patient investors were eventually rewarded. Now’s not the time to give up on Nvidia though. Here’s why.
Secular Growth
Long-term secular growth is the No. 1 reason that Nvidia has been one of my longest-held stocks. It helped that I have attended the company’s GTC’s conferences in the past. Not that it gave any sort of “insider” looks into its offerings. But it allowed me to see first-hand just what the company was doing and how its products were accelerating multiple industries all at once. 
If I’m being honest, maybe that’s a form of confirmation bias and I was only seeking information that confirmed my own beliefs. Perhaps it wasn’t. It doesn’t matter now, as the company has delivered on those expectations – and then some. 
Its products are fueling strong growth in autonomous driving, datacenters, artificial intelligence and machine learning, gaming, graphics, computing power, supercomputing, drones, robotics and more. 
All of these end markets not only represent growth, but they represent long-term secular growth. The difference? Regular growth – also known as cyclical growth – may be a nice boost for a few quarters or a few years, but eventually wears off. Secular growth just keeps going. 
When I look at these end markets, that’s what I see – long-term growth that will just keep going. 
Analysts expect 54% revenue growth this year to $25.75 billion and 65% earnings growth to $4.14 per share. That’s after 52% revenue growth last year. 
However, consider this. As of Jan. 1. and despite all the momentum Nvidia had coming into this year, analysts expected just over $16 billion in sales. That estimate now – as it says above – sits at almost $26 billion. 
For next year, analysts currently expect 13% revenue growth to $29 billion. At the start of this year, those expectations were a hair under $20 billion. Could they be too conservative again? 
We’re talking about a company that did $10.9 billion in sales in fiscal 2020 and that’s forecast to do almost $30 billion in revenue in fiscal 2023. Now’s not the time to give up on NVDA stock.
M&A Provides Value for Nvidia Shareholders
That last section was kind of long, so we’ll keep this one short and sweet. When Nvidia makes M&A moves, it tends to be quite accretive to its business. 
In April 2020, Nvidia closed on its $6.9 billion acquisition of Mellanox. For the deal, the company said, “Once complete, the combination is expected to be immediately accretive to NVIDIA’s non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow.”
It was the company’s largest acquisition and Nvidia outbid Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to get it. That said, the company didn’t overpay for Mellanox, which provided strong value for its shareholders. 
Will Arm be the same way, despite it coming with a much loftier price tag at $40 billion?
I look at the Arm deal in one of two ways. First, if the deal is approved, Nvidia will go from virtually unstoppable to actually unstoppable, as Arm has such a great business and a huge portfolio of products. It even includes Apple as one of its clients. 
On the flip side, regulatory approval is the largest risk here. If it fails, then Nvidia keeps a huge swath of cash on its books and can pursue other opportunities. That said, Nvidia has proven that it can create value with its acquisitions and I would expect Arm too as well if it gains regulatory approval.

Maybe I am wrong with this one, but I firmly believe that Nvidia is on its way to a $1 trillion market capitalization in the future. Back in March, I said NVDA stock was a steal below $50. I didn’t know how close we were to the bottom, but I knew Nvidia’s business too well and knew it was undervalued. 
We are up a great deal since then and Nvidia has been a relative strength leader, up 60% so far this year. 
In the short-term, I’d like to see NVDA stock find its footing here in the $205 to $210 area. Not only does it have the 10-week and 50-day moving averages here, but it’s also the prior breakout spot. 
If the stock breaks down further, the 21-week moving average isn’t out of the realm of possibilities. A real sell-off could land it down around the 200-day moving average, which has been a great buying opportunity over the last few years. 
Regardless of what NVDA stock does in the short term, I am a buyer for its long-term potential.

More details on Validea's John Neff strategy
About John Neff: While known as the manager with whom many top managers entrusted their own money, Neff was far from the smooth-talking, high-profile Wall Streeter you might expect. He was mild-mannered and low-key, and the same might be said of the Windsor Fund that he managed for more than three decades. In fact, Neff himself described the fund as ""relatively prosaic, dull, [and] conservative."" There was nothing dull about his results, however. From 1964 to 1995, Neff guided Windsor to a 13.7 percent average annual return, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return during that time. That 3.1 percentage point difference is huge over time -- a $10,000 investment in Windsor (with dividends reinvested) at the start of Neff's tenure would have ended up as more than $564,000 by the time he retired, more than twice what the same investment in the S&P would have yielded (about $233,000). Considering the length of his tenure, that track record may be the best ever for a manager of such a large fund.

2021-10-02 00:00:00+00:00,Is Micron Technology Stock a Buy?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-micron-technology-stock-a-buy-2021-10-02,,,"Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) stock dropped in the two following days after it announced its fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 earnings. The memory chipmaker beat estimates, but concerns about capital spending and rising supply prompted investors to unload shares. Although Micron can continue to benefit from the current chip shortage and remain a leading memory chip company longer-term, investors face questions about whether that success will translate into gains for the chip stock.
Image source: Getty Images.
How Micron performed
For the fourth quarter of 2021, revenue climbed 36% to almost $8.3 billion. Net income surged 175% higher during that period to over $2.7 billion as the company limited operating expense growth during that time to only 5%. Full-year 2021 revenue of $28 billion rose 29% compared with 2020. This solid revenue growth allowed net income to expand by 116% during that period to $5.9 billion, as operating expense increases remained minimal throughout the year.
While Micron did not project beyond the first quarter of 2022, the company expects between $7.45 billion and $7.85 billion in revenue. Hitting the midpoint of this range would amount to a 33% year-over-year increase.
However, both that projection and the report on earlier quarters hint at a critical concern. The fact that the company only projected one quarter into the future could indicate that the company may struggle to match the numbers beyond Q1.
Why the numbers should concern investors
This worry points to moves by Micron and its peers that should eventually end the chip shortage. Amid the current shortfall, chipmakers all over the world, including Micron, have begun expanding capacity. As a result, Micron expects to spend between $11 billion and $12 billion on capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 on research and increasing production, well above the $9.7 billion allocated in 2021.
Moreover, one of its biggest competitors, Samsung, has pledged to spend $146 billion on product development and foundry expansion over the next three years, according to SDxCentral.
While Micron and its peers will likely not struggle to sell more memory chips, the production capacity expansion highlights the adverse effects on shareholders as Micron stock cools off. Micron's share price depends more heavily on chip pricing than a semiconductor stock such as Nvidia or Intel.
Due to higher demand for chips stemming from artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things, the 2018 price drop did not affect Micron stock as severely. Instead of falling below $10 per share as it did in previous price cycles, the 2018 low came in at approximately $28 per share. Still, this was a 56% drop from its 2018 high of around $65 per share. An equivalent drop from the 2021 high of $97 per share would take Micron to approximately $43 per share, well below the $70 per share price as of the time of this writing. The sharp swings in memory prices over time make Micron a deeply cyclical stock.
Should investors consider Micron?
Micron stock has prospered amid the memory chip shortage that arose amid the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with companies all across the chip industry increasing capacity, supply will likely rise, causing chip prices to fall. The history of Micron stock points to significant selling when such a phenomenon occurs. Thus, while Micron should remain a leading provider of memory chips, investors may have to brace for more near-term declines and reduced long-term gains.

If you want a better-than-average return on your investment, you need to find growth stocks that have already proven themselves and have business models that point to reasons for continued growth.
Start with MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX), companies whose shares have risen more than 10% this year and more than 100% over the past five years.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. MercadoLibre is just getting started
MercadoLibre is often called the Amazon of Latin America, it is an e-commerce and fintech giant. The company, which started out as an Argentine company in 1999, is now in 18 countries in the region. Over the past five years, Mercado Libre has seen a quarterly revenue increase of 637% and share growth of nearly 800%.
The company just completed its second quarter on June 30, reporting record numbers in revenue and volume. MercadoLibre said it had net revenue in the quarter of $1.7 billion (figures were reported in USD), up 102.6% year over year. Also, sales volume was $7 billion, up 46% over the same period in 2020.
The company has especially been strong in Argentina and Mexico, two countries where it has seen triple-digit percentage increases in revenue in the quarter, year over year.
MercadoLibre also generated net income of $68.2 million, compared to $55.9 million in the same period last year. The growth in the number of COVID-19 cases in Latin America, while tragic, has increased conversion toward more e-commerce and online payment systems. Last year, an estimated 13 million people in Latin America made an online purchase for the first time.
The poor roads and difficult terrain make it costly to ship products throughout South America. In many ways, this provides MercadoLibre a moat over new entrants in the region, such as Amazon. The company, whose shipping arm is known as Mercado Envios, bought Kangu, a Brazilian logistics company that operates in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, giving it more delivery vehicles and personnel in key nations. The transaction was completed in August for an undisclosed amount.
What makes MercadoLibre a great long-term stock is it has only begun to scratch the surface of the capability of e-commerce in South America. One report by OMR Global puts the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for e-commerce in the region to be 25.6% over the next six years. Making it, a stock with long-term potential and one for investors to buy.
2. Advanced Micro Devices has a bright future
Demand for semiconductor chips has gone through the roof since the pandemic started. Primarily there's been a surge for the company's central processing and graphics processing units. Several things have driven this surge, the 5G rollout, the growth of cloud computing, and increased purchases of laptops and tablets. These things will likely still be there long after the pandemic is over.
The CAGR for the global semiconductor market, according to a report by Fortune Business Insights, is expected to be 8.6% over the next seven years and to become an $803.15 billion market during that period. That's great news for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) investors. The stock is up more than 15% for the year and 1,520% over the past five years.
The company has had double-digit revenue growth for seven consecutive quarters. In the company's second-quarter report, it said it had revenue of $3.85 billion, up 99% year over year. Gross profit was $1.83 billion, up 116% year over year and 15% higher than the first quarter of 2021. Net income was reported as $710 million, up 352% over the same period in 2020. The company said it expected revenue in 2021 to be up 60% over 2020. Additionally, the company reported its highest free cash flow of $888 million for the second quarter compared to $152 million in the same period in 2020.
The company is also putting its extra cash to use to return value to stockholders and to spur more growth. It initiated a $4 billion share repurchase program in May. And the company stated that it is on track to complete its $135 billion acquisition of Xilinx, known for making programmable logic devices, by the end of the year. The Xilinx deal should help AMD better compete with Intel in the data center side of its business that runs digital applications.
Likely AMD's biggest advantage is that making semiconductors is expensive. It must be done in sterile environments, using cutting-edge machinery, and the science of microchips is changing so fast that it's difficult for new companies to come along and catch up in terms of market share. That's a great moat for existing chipmakers, particularly AMD.
3. Seagate Technology is ahead up in the cloud
Seagate Technology is a global leader in data storage, making portable hard drives and SSD external hard drives, essential elements for laptops and cloud computing. The company's stock is up more than 38% this year and more than 106% over the past five years.
On July 2, the company closed its 2021 fiscal year and all of its numbers were above last year's. Annual revenue was a reported $10.6 billion, up 1.6% year over year. While the operating margin was 14% compared to 12.4% in 2020. And net income was $1.3 billion, up 30.8% over 2020. The company's fourth-quarter revenue of $3 billion was its best quarter in six years.
The company signed a multi-year deal last month with Zoom Video Communications for the videoconferencing company that will allow Zoom customers to use Seagate's Lyve Cloud platform to store meeting recordings. This helps Seagate's business because it shows a high-profile client sees the benefits of the Lyve Cloud storage-as-a-service.
Although Seagate's shares have not shown as much momentum the past three years as the other two companies mentioned here, it seems to be catching fire this year. According to Seagate data, the rise of cloud computing has accelerated the need for mass storage devices. In 2015, 25% of data was stored in the cloud. By last year, 40% of data was stored in the cloud. Certain trends, such as the rise of autonomous vehicles, smart factories, and human genomics research, have boosted the need for cloud computing.
Another reason to like Seagate stock is it is well-priced, with a price-to-earnings ratio of only 15.46. It also has something the other two stocks don't: a dividend -- and a generous one at that. The company raised its dividend by 3% to $0.67 a share in October 2020 and its current yield is 3.18% at Wednesday's share prices. With all the evidence, this stock shows great potential in the changing world.

2021-10-02 00:00:00+00:00,Better Semiconductor Stock: ASML vs. Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-semiconductor-stock%3A-asml-vs.-intel-2021-10-02,,,"ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are two of the most important semiconductor companies in the world. ASML is the top supplier of photolithography systems, which are used to etch circuit patterns into silicon wafers. Intel is the top producer of CPUs for PCs and data centers.
ASML is also the world's only provider of high-end EUV (extreme ultraviolet) systems, which are used to manufacture the world's smallest chips. That's why it's a key partner for Intel, which owns a small stake in ASML, as well as its top foundry competitors TSMC and Samsung.
Image source: Getty Images.
ASML and Intel both attracted a lot of attention throughout the global chip shortage, which started in late 2019 and worsened throughout the pandemic. But over the past three years, ASML's stock surged about 300% as Intel's stock rose less than 15%.
ASML benefited from the market's insatiable appetite for new photolithography systems, while Intel struggled with ongoing shortages, delays, and manufacturing issues. Let's take a fresh look at both companies and see if ASML remains a stronger investment than Intel.
ASML continues to fire on all cylinders
ASML's revenue rose just 8% in 2019 as the global glut in memory chips curbed the market's appetite for new systems. However, its revenue increased 18% in 2020 as the memory market stabilized and the top foundries boosted their capacity to cope with the surging demand for new chips.
ASML's earnings per share increased just 1% in 2019, but jumped 38% in 2020 as it sold more higher-margin EUV systems. Its total EUV sales rose 60% and accounted for 32% of its full-year revenues.
In the first half of 2021, ASML's revenue rose 45% year over year as its EPS soared 110%. Analysts expect its full-year revenue and earnings to grow 35% and 58%, respectively, as TSMC, Samsung, and Intel install more EUV systems. All three foundries are spending billions of dollars on building new plants, and a lot of that money will flow to ASML.
Next year, analysts expect ASML's revenue and earnings to increase 15% and 22%, respectively. Its growth will likely decelerate as the chip shortage ends, but its business should keep expanding over the long term as it rolls out its next generation of high-NA EUV systems -- which will be used to manufacture chips that are even smaller than today's tiniest chips.
Intel prepares for a painful turnaround
Intel's revenue grew just 2% in 2019, but rose 8% in 2020 as it shipped more PC and data center chips throughout the pandemic. The shift to remote work boosted demand for new PCs, while the heavier usage of online services forced data centers to upgrade their hardware.
Intel's adjusted EPS rose 6% in 2019 and grew 9% in 2020. However, it boosted its EPS with billions of dollars in buybacks throughout both years instead of allocating that cash toward improving its R&D and manufacturing capabilities. That trend worried investors, since Intel had already fallen behind TSMC and Samsung in the ""process race"" to create smaller and more advanced chips.
In the first half of 2021, Intel's revenue dipped 1% year over year as its EPS fell 18%. Those declines can be attributed to its market-share losses to AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) in the PC and data center markets, as well as tough comparisons to the pandemic's initial impact a year ago.
Analysts expect Intel's revenue and earnings to decline 6% and 10%, respectively, this year. Intel's new CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took the helm in February, plans to aggressively expand Intel's manufacturing plants to reclaim the process lead from TSMC by 2025. That's an ambitious goal, but there's no guarantee that it will succeed and reverse its market losses to AMD -- which currently outsources the production of its chips to TSMC's superior foundries.
The obvious winner: ASML
ASML trades at 47 times forward earnings, while Intel has a much lower forward P/E ratio of 11. However, ASML's near-monopoly in photolithography systems, its role as a linchpin of the global semiconductor market, and its robust growth rates all justify that higher valuation. Meanwhile, Intel's stock deserves a lower valuation because it faces a grueling uphill battle against TSMC and AMD.
Intel's downside potential could be limited at these levels, but ASML has a lot more upside potential -- especially as the global chip shortage drags on and highlights the importance of its EUV systems.

CNBC reported today that Dutch machinist ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML), which manufacturers the machines that make the chips for so many of our high-tech gadgets, is predicting a boom in its business over the next four years, and even beyond.
As ASML customers such as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Samsung race to expand their capacity to churn out chips, they're spending freely at ASML. The company predicts revenue will surge as much as 69% to $28 billion by 2025, with gross margins rising past 54%.
This is great news for ASML and probably great news for chipmakers like Intel, TSMC, and Nvidia, too, because it only makes sense for them to be spending so much money buying machines from ASML if they see such strong demand for their chips.
Now what
But here's what's giving Nvidia investors a case of nerves today: All of this spending to increase capacity also means that the end of the chip shortage is approaching more rapidly than it otherwise might.
Elon Musk, for example, has predicted that the semiconductor shortage that was expected to last into 2023 will instead turn out to be only short term. Market analyst IDC predicts we could even begin seeing the shortage easing before 2021 is over, reaching balance by the middle of 2022 and flipping over to overcapacity in 2023.
And with ASML predicting 11% annual revenue growth through 2030 as chipmakers buy more and more machines, a new semiconductor glut could actually end up lasting longer than the shortage did.

It’s rare that I’m so enthusiastic about a single stock, but the value proposition investors can get with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) right now is almost irresistible. To put it bluntly, if you’re not already holding INTC stock, you ought to seriously consider it.

It’s not easy to convince people of this at the moment—because the Intel share price has basically gone nowhere since May.
But the game of investing is ultimately won by those who have the most patience. As long as you believe in the company, there’s no reason to give up on INTC stock.
Besides, as America and the world face a semiconductor shortage, Intel is making strides in solving the problem. As we’ll see, the company is doing its part to help bring the supply chain back into balance while rebuilding U.S. leadership in this crucial industry.
A Closer Look at INTC Stock
In reference to Intel, I recall a clever quote from InvestorPlace contributor Dana Blankenhorn: “The former chip industry leader is now cheap as chips.” That quip is still true today. From May through the end of September, INTC stock has stayed near $53, giving prospective investors many chances to get in while it’s still in the $50’s.
10 Hyper-Growth Stocks to Be Careful of as We Near a Correction
Don’t forget about the time in April when the buyers showed what they’re capable of. They ran the Intel share price all the way up to $68.49 before letting the sellers regain control.
Now that INTC stock has come back to earth, it’s a great time to remind everyone of what you’ll get with your investment. For one thing, you’ll get an extraordinary dividend yielder. In fact, Intel pays out a forward annual dividend yield of 2.57%—not too shabby for a tech company nowadays.
What you’ll also get is a terrific value. INTC’s trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 11.87, which is markedly low at a time when most technology stocks aren’t super cheap.
Intel Is Ramping Up with RAMP-C
To demonstrate Intel’s commitment to making America the world’s top microprocessor manufacturer, the company recently announced a crucial agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense. Reportedly, Intel will provide commercial semiconductor foundry services in the first phase of the Rapid Assured Microelectronics Prototypes – Commercial (RAMP-C) program. RAMP-C’s purpose is to facilitate the use of a U.S.-based commercial semiconductor foundry ecosystem in order to build tech parts and products for the DoD.
Intel notes that more than 80% of leading-edge manufacturing capacity is concentrated in Asia today—thus leaving the DoD with limited onshore access to essential semiconductor foundry technology. In other words, the importance of RAMP-C goes far beyond the impact on Intel’s bottom line. There’s a national security angle at work here.
Breaking Ground on Two New Factories
Along with the news concerning the RAMP-C program, Intel’s stakeholders should cheer the news of a groundbreaking ceremony in the western U.S. Specifically, Intel just established two new microchip factories in the state of Arizona. This  $20-billion project is intended to bolster U.S. semiconductor leadership. Hopefully, it will also help to restore geographic balance to the global microchip supply chain.
These two new factories will be named Fab 52 and Fab 62. With these additions, Intel’s Ocotillo campus will house a total of six “fabs” (fabrication plants). The payoff might not be immediate since the two new fabs aren’t expected to be fully operational until 2024.
However, prospective stakeholders should know that the new fabs will manufacture Intel’s most advanced process technologies. These will include the Intel 20A chip node, which features the company’s RibbonFET and PowerVia innovations.
The Bottom Line for INTC Stock
INTC stock offers investors a solid dividend yield and excellent value for a tech stock in 2021. That should be enough to convince you to invest, but there’s another benefit to consider: Owning shares of Intel is, in effect, investing in America’s comeback as a semiconductor manufacturer.
And so, in a time when microchips are in short supply, Intel is stepping up and delivering solutions.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-09-30 00:00:00+00:00,INTC November 12th Options Begin Trading,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intc-november-12th-options-begin-trading-2021-09-30,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the November 12th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new November 12th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $53.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.25. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $53.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $50.75 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $53.57/share today.
Because the $53.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.25% return on the cash commitment, or 36.00% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $53.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $54.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.06. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $53.57/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $54.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.65% if the stock gets called away at the November 12th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $54.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $54.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.85% boost of extra return to the investor, or 32.61% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example above is 35%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $53.57) to be 33%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-09-30 00:00:00+00:00,"ANALYSIS-From chips to ships, shortages are making inflation stick",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-from-chips-to-ships-shortages-are-making-inflation-stick-2021-09-30,,,"By Dhara Ranasinghe and Sujata Rao
LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Soaring gas prices, staff shortages, a lack of ships -- price pressures globally may be picking up faster than anticipated, challenging the view that inflation will prove transitory.
Central bankers, while adamant inflation will subside, are starting to concede it may stay higher for longer as a range of issues push up the prices of goods and services and lift future inflation expectations.
Their conclusions will ultimately determine how quickly policymakers unwind the trillions of dollars of monetary stimulus unleashed to ease the COVID-19 crisis.
""Will central bankers be more focused on growth and be a ""bit behind the curve""? Or will they be more concerned about inflation and take the punchbowl away quickly?,"" said Charles Diebel, head of fixed income at asset manager Mediolanum International Funds.
Here are five key elements in the inflation debate:
1/ GASFLATION
European TRNLTTFMc1 and U.S. NGc1 gas prices have soared more than 350% and more than 120% respectively this year. Oil LCOc1 is up around 50% and Goldman Sachs expects Brent crude to hit $90 a barrel by end-2021 from around $80 currently.
Gas and electricity make up 4.8% of the euro area harmonised-inflation (HICP) basket used by the European Central Bank. Rabobank reckons the price surge is a separate 'shock' that could add 0.15 percentage points (ppts) to its 2.2% euro zone inflation forecast for 2021 and another 0.25 ppts to 2022's 1.8% projection.
Many economists see higher gas prices as here to stay, due to slowing U.S. output, rising costs of carbon emissions permits for polluters and curbs on the usage of dirtier fuels.
In China, where factory inflation hit 9.5% in August, power cuts have slashed output of goods from cement to aluminum.
These outages are a risk to end-users such as those in auto supply chains, Morgan Stanley said, noting ""cost-push inflation and tightening upstream supply that could affect downstream production and profits.""
2/ CHIPFLATION
Semiconductors, or chips as they are known, are tiny but are having an outsized impact on global factories. At General Motors GM.N alone, chip shortages are seen cutting Q3 vehicle deliveries by 200,000, while falling output has sent used-car prices spiraling.
Chip prices have risen and semiconductor giant Taiwan's TSMC 2330.TW is mulling further hikes of up to 20%. That will ripple across everything from electronics to cars and phones to washing machines. But chipmakers themselves face higher input costs from commodities to power.
""It does seem likely that these semiconductor shortages are going to persist into next year,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds, senior European economist at Capital Economics.
Or beyond. Intel's INTC.O CEO predicts chips will comprise a fifth of a car's cost by 2030, from 4% in 2019 as vehicles become self-driving or electric.
3/ FOODFLATION
Global food prices rose 30% year-on-year in August, an index compiled by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation shows -- a sign of broadening price pressures.
While higher agricultural commodity prices are behind the jump, JPMorgan analysts also attribute food price inflation to pandemic-related pressures such as logistics disruptions and transport costs.
In emerging markets, where food makes up a large chunk of inflation baskets, there is more pressure to tighten monetary policy. It is less of a problem for developed nations but price rises look inevitable for items such as soft drinks and snacks.
4/GREENFLATION
Stringent rules to guide the transition to a greener future are blamed for stoking 'greenflation', for instance by shutting out polluting factories, vehicles, ships and mines, in turn reducing the supply of key goods and services.
Prices for European carbon emission allowances, have doubled this year to 65 euros a tonne. A price of 100 euros would lift European retail power prices 12%, adding 35 bps to headline euro zone inflation, Morgan Stanley estimated in June.
There are other examples. Falling ship orders due to upcoming rule changes on fuels may be a tailwind for shipping rates that have already surged 280% this year .BADI.
NatWest attributes the commodity rally at least partly to the shift to greener technologies raising mining and production costs.
All this may not fully have seeped into inflation calculations. For instance, markets see euro area inflation hitting 2% only after a decade, Danske Bank sees ""upside risks to inflation expectations...once implementation of the green transition gathers momentum"".
5/ WAGEFLATION
As prices rise, so do expectations of future inflation among consumers, who accordingly demand pay hikes.
The wage growth picture is mixed. U.S average hourly earnings jumped 0.6% in August and U.S. five-year inflation expectations are running around 3%, surveys show.
In some UK sectors, earnings have risen as much as 30% this year. Euro area labour costs fell in Q2 but inflation as well as inflation expectations are rising.
""Maybe markets are a little bit extreme in their pricing, but I'm not recommending investors should fade that move,"" Societe Generale senior rates strategist Jorge Garayo said.
""When we go into next year, that will be the big test.""

LUXEMBOURG, Sept 30 (Reuters) - A 4.34 billion euro ($5 billion) European Union antitrust fine was based on flawed calculations, Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google said on Thursday, urging Europe's second-highest court to scrap or reduce what it said was not an appropriate penalty.
Google was fined for using its Android mobile operating system to thwart rivals and cement its dominance in general internet search from 2011, in the largest penalty meted out to any company found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules.
""The fine that was imposed, a staggering 4.34 billion euros, was not appropriate,"" Google's lawyer Genevra Forwood told the five-judge panel of the General Court on the fourth day of a week-long hearing, which is taking place three years after the European Commission sanctioned the company.
""The problem is not the headline-grabbing fine per se. The problem is how the Commission reached that figure,"" she said.
Forwood said there was no anti-competitive intent in Google's actions nor could it have known that its conduct was an abuse based on EU case law and there was no precedent for it.
""So it was wrong for the Commission to impose any fine at all, let alone turn up the dials to reach its biggest fine ever,"" Forwood said.
She also took issue with the EU competition enforcer adding a 11% gravity factor to Google's fine compared with 5% for Intel INTC.O in 2009 in a separate case.
""Even if this Court considers that a fine is appropriate, it would only be proper to turn the dials right down,"" she said.
However, the European Commission's lawyer Anthony Dawes said Google ""simply could not be unaware of the anti-competitive behaviour of its practices"".
""Infringements committed negligently are no less serious than those committed intentionally,"" Dawes said, adding that the fine was just 4.5% of Google's revenue in 2017 versus a 10% cap allowed under EU rules.
A verdict is likely to come next year. The case is T-604/18 Google vs European Commission

Sept 28 (Reuters) - Buyers of Apple's AAPL.O new iPhone 13 face longer-than-expected delivery times because of a wave of COVID-19 infections in Vietnam, where components for the device's new camera module are assembled, Nikkei Asia said.
The disruption, which could ease as soon as mid-October, is linked to a constriction in supplies of modules for the phone's four models, as a significant number of components are assembled in Vietnam, it said, citing people familiar with the matter.
The latest iPhone 13 models have an advanced camera that allows more light in to capture sharp images in low-lit areas and also offers a transition focus from foreground to background in the same frame.
Several users and Apple's partners, such as Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N and Best Buy BBY.N, have highlighted delays after pre-ordering began in September due to a shortage of supply and high demand, with analysts warning of one of the longest waiting times for the phone in recent years.
Apple relies on more than a dozen factories that manufacture components in Vietnam, which has been grappling with a rise in infections since April, mostly in its business hub Ho Chi Minh City and neighboring industrial provinces.
Some of these factories in Vietnam are operated by LG Display Company Ltd 034220.KS, Intel Corp INTC.O and Foxconn Technology Group 2317.TW.
Meanwhile, Apple suppliers in China have suspended production at some factories for a number of days to comply with tighter energy consumption policies.

The Dallas-based computing stalwart, founded in 1951, is still growing revenue, earnings, margins, and cashflow at an impressive clip. It's also returning more of its fortunes to shareholders, recently announcing a 13% increase in its annual dividend.
A business unto itself
Texas Instruments makes specialty chips for electronics designers and manufacturers worldwide, a focus that gives it a wide and stable economic moat, according to Morningstar analysts. Competitors can't easily encroach upon its business because these products require unique engineering and customer relationships that take years to develop.
Image source: Texas Instruments.
Among its many products, including its iconic calculators, the company makes analog chips that convert real-world conditions into digital signals. They communicate measurements such as temperature, speed, sound and electrical current for digital electronics so they can communicate with the real world. Texas Instruments also makes embedded processors -- specialized microprocessors used to control electrical or mechanical functions in all kinds of devices.
Texas Instruments's semiconductors are widely used in the automotive industry and in ubiquitous power management systems, helping the company consistently rank among the world's top 10 semiconductor producers. These specialty chips carry higher margins than typical memory chips, and they're in wide demand.
By the numbers
Texas Instruments has been reporting impressive financial results. For the second quarter, it posted $4.58 billion in revenue, a 41% increase year over year. In a press release, the company attributed the gains to ""strong demand in industrial, automotive, and personal electronics.""
Net income was up 40% to $1.93 billion. The company hasn't announced the release date for its third-quarter earnings, but it's estimated to be on Oct. 19. Its guidance for the third quarter, however, was in about the same range as its second quarter, leaving some market observers uninspired for the moment. It's important to note, though, that the company has a history of underpromising and overdelivering on guidance. Over the long term, the company's likely to continue its cash-gushing ways.
Texas Instruments has returned $3.9 billion to shareholders over the last year through dividends and stock repurchases. The company has raised dividends for 17 consecutive years from 2004 to 2020, by an annual average of 26%. It also has reduced its share count by 46% during that same period, raising the value of outstanding shares.
As generous as the company has been to shareholders, it's not stretching its balance sheet to do so. The company says it has enjoyed 12% annual growth in free cash flow per share from 2004 through 2020.
Risks of doing business
Texas Instruments boasts a strong balance sheet and a wide economic moat, two factors that give any company plenty of wiggle room.
Its primary risks are related to production and shifts in market demand for its products. This includes the costs of raw materials, utilities, and manufacturing equipment and services. The chip industry overall, for instance, is still trying to overcome shortages and supply chain disruptions from the pandemic.
Another risk for Texas Instruments is that it must always keep pace with technological innovations, since it supplies the circuits for ever-improving electronics. It has done so for years, but in an industry characterized by disruptors, that's always a high-risk pursuit.
For what it's worth
Texas Instruments currently trades around $200 per share, with a 12-month-trailing price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 28. That's well below some of its peers, such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) with a PE of 38, and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) with a PE of over 37. But valuations are all over the map in this industry. Chip giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has a PE of nearly 77, while Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) carries a PE of about 12.
Texas Instruments also has one of the highest price-to-sales ratios among the large chipmakers, but that's to expected with a more specialized line of products, and it has the highest profit margins of all the chipmakers at over 40%.
For the long-term investor, Texas Instruments has survived the test of time, keeping pace with unpredictable technological disruptions for decades, and it's well-positioned for repeat performances in the future.
As a mature company that is still increasing revenues and earnings, and sharing its largess through dividends, it offers a rare combination of safety, steady income and growth.

AMSTERDAM, Sept 29 (Reuters) - ASML Holding NV ASML.AS, one of the key suppliers to computer chip makers, increased its financial forecasts on Wednesday and said it would have revenue growth of around 11% annually through 2030 amid booming demand for its products.
In a pre-market statement, the company estimated revenue would hit 24-30 billion euros ($28 billion-35 billion) in 2025 with gross margins up to 55%. That compares with the previous forecast of a 15-24 billion euro range in the same year, at gross margins of at least 50%.
""Global megatrends in the electronics industry, supported by a highly profitable and fiercely innovative ecosystem, are expected to continue to fuel growth across the semiconductor market,"" ASML said in a statement.
The company's top executives are due to appear at an investor event Wednesday at which they may detail plans to increase production, as semiconductor makers scramble to address the global chip shortage and expand to meet future demand. ASML is operating at maximum capacity to supply major chip makers such as TSMC 2330.TW, Samsung 005930.KS and Intel INTC.O.
""ASML and its supply chain partners are actively adding and improving capacity to meet this future customer demand,"" it said.
ASML makes lithography systems, large machines that use energy beams to map out the tiny circuitry of computer chips. Its most cutting-edge tools cost 160 million euros each and sit at the heart of semiconductor fabrication plants.
At second quarter earnings in July, ASML forecast a 35% increase in sales to nearly 19 billion euros in 2021, at gross margins of better than 50%, putting it past the lower end of its 2025 range of goals.
The company's stock has reflected its strong outlook with a market capitalization around 272 billion euros, making it Europe's largest technology company.
Even after a 7% fall it its share price amid Tuesday's sell-off, ASML shares are up 67% in the year to date and more than 110% in the past year, strongly outperforming the sector.

Shares of semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) dropped 4.3% as of 11:30 a.m. EDT on Tuesday -- and sure, most stocks on the stock market are down today. (The whole S&P 500 is off 1.8%.) But in the case of Nvidia in particular, there may be a good reason why investors are nervous.
The company is a supplier of chips for everything from mining cryptocurrency to performing artificial intelligence tasks to playing video games. It's that last field of business that may be worrying investors today. As Game Rant reports, ""While graphics cards have become near impossible to acquire during the pandemic"" (depriving Nvidia of revenue and profits it might otherwise have earned were it able to satisfy all the demand that is out there), its rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) ""has largely kept its cutting-edge CPUs in supply.""
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
If that's the case, and if it's a trend that continues, then there would appear to be a chance that Intel will gain back market share that it might have lost to Nvidia during the pandemic. As my colleague Jose Najarro noted last month, Nvidia gained 2 percentage points worth of market share sequentially last quarter, but ""Intel is expected to release Alchemist, its high-performance GPUs, in the first quarter of 2022.""
Right now, Game Rant reports that Intel's ""11th generation Core processors are ready and waiting for PC gamers to purchase as needed, available at retail prices."" And based on information released by MSI, Game Rant infers that Intel may announce its 12th generation of Core processors, ""which include the top-of-the-line Intel i9-12900K,"" as early as Oct. 27, and begin selling the chips on Nov. 4.
Now what
But is that really such horrible news for Nvidia? While I admit I'm not thrilled with the valuation of Nvidia stock (75.5 times earnings and counting), I'm not sure this news is as bad as investors may be assuming it to be.
On the one hand, yes, copious supply of 11th generation chips, and the imminent arrival of a more powerful 12th generation, would seem to bode well for Intel's business, and may help the chip giant to steal back some market share it has lost to Nvidia in quarters past. On the other hand, the global semiconductor shortage is still a thing -- and it won't be erased by a month or two of new Intel chip sales.
At worst, I expect that Intel's introduction of new 12th generation chips will work to moderate supply worries in the chip world, and help to move us toward a world of ""normalization and balance"" between chip supply and demand by mid-2022, as experts have predicted.
That hardly sounds like a disaster scenario for Nvidia.

I have pointed this out before and will do so again, because Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock is known for making massive moves to the upside in a short period of time, then consolidating for several months or quarters.
AMD) logo outside of a corporate building"" width=""300"" height=""169"">
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
AMD stock recently repeated this pattern, ripping to new highs last month. However, it has since come back under pressure. 
After consolidating in a wide range for almost a year, AMD stock ripped higher by more than 34% in just six trading sessions. That came on a high-volume burst, which led the stock to all-time highs. 
Still down 15% from this highs though and this stock has many bulls rethinking their long position. Not to worry though. Like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD continues to enjoy long-term secular growth, while at the same time, eating into Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) market share. 
Breaking Down Advanced Micro Devices
Why do I like AMD stock? Well, it’s pretty simple: The growth. 
The company sports trailing 12-month revenue growth of roughly 75%. For the current year, consensus expectations call for almost 60% growth. However, the issue of 2022 and beyond then crops up. Forecasts call for 17.5% revenue growth in 2022 and 13% growth in 2023.
First, that’s several years of double-digit revenue growth and 17.5% is certainly nothing to balk at. That said, after growing revenue by 45% in 2020 and with forecasts calling for 60% growth this year, 17.5% is going to feel like a real slow down. 
7 Clean Energy Stocks Trading Too Hot at the Moment
Or at least the market could interpret it like that.
My issue is that analysts have been woefully conservative with AMD. The same is true for Nvidia. Listen up, because this part is important. 
Despite knowing how much momentum AMD was riding as it entered 2021 — undeterred by the novel coronavirus pandemic — analysts expected less than $10 billion in revenue for this year. That figure is now at almost $16 billion!
At the start of this year, analysts expected next year’s revenue to be around $12 billion. That figure is already north of $18 billion. In a span of just a few quarters, these estimates have exploded higher. The same thing happened for fiscal 2020 before it was in the books. 
So my argument is, why bet against a winning entity? AMD clearly has the formula for growth, even if the estimates can’t keep up. 
AMD Does More Than That
It’s not just revenue growth that has me excited here. CEO Lisa Su has done so much to turn this company around over the years. 
Revenue in 2017 stood at $5.3 billion, while the trailing 12 months boasts sales of $13.3 billion. That’s up 150%, which is great. But operating income in the same periods stand at $204 million and $2.5 billion, respectively, a more than 10-fold increase. 
Net income exploded from $43 million in 2017 to $3.43 billion. The increases have resulted in booming free cash flow and margin. It’s also allowed the company to pay down debt, which has gone from $1.4 billion at year-end 2017 to just over $500 million at year-end 2020. 
It also put AMD in position to acquire Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) for $36 billion in an all-stock deal. 
That will have an impact on AMD stock in the intermediate term, but it should only help bolster AMD’s financials in the future. Speaking of the stock price, let’s look at the chart.

A look at the chart shows the explosive rally the stock underwent in late July and early August. Just for a minute, forget all the revenue growth and positive developments in the company’s financials. Instead, just look at the volume on that spike. 
AMD stock exploded higher in six straight sessions with incredible volume. To me, that says “accumulation” by the big institutions. 
The stock then gave use a pretty orderly “ABC” correction back down to the 50-day moving average and the former all-time high at $99.23. Now pressing higher, the bulls are regaining control.
I want to see that the stock can clear the 21-day moving average downtrend resistance, but as long as it stays above $99.23, it looks OK on the long side. Above $107.50 puts $114.50 in play, followed by $120-plus.

Alibaba Group 9988.HK CEO Daniel Zhang, a prime target of the broad crackdown, told a conference organised by China's top internet regulator that his company's $15 billion plan to boost common prosperity in China was ""steadily advancing"".
Common prosperity - China's term for narrowing the gap between rich and poor - is ""not just a number"", Zhang said, stressing the importance of helping local talent in poor regions to ""teach a man to fish"".
The World Internet Conference in Wuzhen in eastern China is organised by the Cyberspace Administration of China. The conference in the past has drawn such foreign executives as Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, but overseas attendance was hurt this year by COVID-19 protocols and souring U.S.-China relations.
Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O CEO Cristiano Amon, Intel Corp INTC.O, INTC.O CEO Patrick Gelsinger and Tesla Inc TSLA.O founder Elon Musk provided taped remarks.
China's regulatory crackdown has hit sectors from cryptocurrencies and the internet, to entertainment, education and property, wiping hundreds of billions off the market value some of its largest companies and putting investors on alert over who may be next.
The listing of Alibaba's financial affiliate was halted and the e-commerce giant was fined a record $2.75 for anti-competitive behaviour.
Policymakers and executives at the conference did not address the crackdown directly, though Liu He, China's vice premier, said the digital economy can at times stifle competition.
Common prosperity has re-emerged as a slogan this year after President Xi Jinping used it in public remarks.
Xiaomi Corp 1810.HK CEO Lei Jun called on large tech companies to help more small and midsize firms, saying they must ""not let any group fall behind"".
In videotaped remarks, Neil Shen, the founding partner of Sequoia Capital China, which has backed tech giants such as ByteDance and Didi Global Inc DIDI.N, praised a planned tech bourse in Beijing as helping smaller firms.

Sept 24 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O on Friday broke ground on two new factories in Arizona as part of its turnaround plan to become a major manufacturer of chips for outside customers.
The $20 billion plants - dubbed Fab 52 and Fab 62 - will bring the total number of Intel factories at its campus in Chandler, Arizona, to six. They will house Intel's most advanced chipmaking technology and play a central role in the Santa Clara, California-based company's effort to regain its lead in making the smallest, fastest chips by 2025, after having fallen behind rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW.
The new Arizona plants will also be the first Intel has built from the ground up with space reserved for outside customers. Intel has long made its own chips, but its turnaround plan calls for taking on work for outsiders such as Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O Amazon.com's AMZN.O cloud unit, as well as deepening its manufacturing relationship with the U.S. military.
""We want to have more resilience to the supply chain,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger, who earlier in the week attended a White House meeting on the global chip shortage, told Reuters in an interview. ""As the only company on U.S. soil that can do the most advanced lithography processes in the world, we are going to step up in a big way.""
Gelsinger said it was too early to say how much of the new plants' capacity would be reserved for outside customers. He said the plants would produce ""thousands"" of wafers per week.
Wafers are the silicon discs on which chips are made, and each can hold hundreds or even thousands of chips.
Intel rival TSMC has also purchased land to build its first U.S. campus in Phoenix, not far from Intel's location, where TSMC plans up to six chip factories, Reuters previously reported.
Gelsinger said Intel plans to announce another U.S. campus site before the end of the year that will eventually hold eight chip factories.

2021-09-24 00:00:00+00:00,The Best Stocks to Buy During the September Sell-Off,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-best-stocks-to-buy-during-the-september-sell-off-2021-09-24,,,"The S&P 500 has lost its momentum in September, which may not seem surprising as the month has been historically poor for the stock market. As it turns out, the S&P 500 has declined 0.5% on average during September since 1950, but this time the decline has been steeper thanks to other factors that have spooked investors and triggered a sell-off.
^SPX data by YCharts
As seen in the chart above, the index has recovered some of the ground it had lost during the September sell-off. However, it is still down more than usual, which means that there's an opportunity for investors to buy some great companies at cheaper valuations. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Bandwidth (NASDAQ: BAND) are two of the best stocks you might consider buying right now. Let's see why.
Advanced Micro Devices
AMD stock lost a lot of ground in the first three weeks of September before bouncing back in recent sessions, but you can still buy it at a relatively cheap valuation right now.
AMD data by YCharts
The stock was trading at nearly 40 times trailing earnings in the last week of August. Investors can now scoop up this high-growth company at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37, which is quite attractive considering that AMD was trading at nearly 124 times earnings in 2020. Given that AMD is on track to record more vigorous growth in 2021 than last year, while the stock trades at a relatively cheap valuation, buying this tech stock right now is a no-brainer.
AMD expects 60% revenue growth in 2021, a solid step up from 2020's annual revenue increase of 45%. And analysts expect AMD's impressive growth to continue over the next couple of years.

There are several reasons why AMD could keep growing at a robust pace. First, the company still commands a fairly humble slice of the x86 processor market, where it has been consistently taking share away from sector leader Intel. According to Mercury Research, AMD's share of the overall x86 processor market increased 4.2 percentage points year-over-year in the second quarter of 2021 to 22.5%.
AMD still has a lot of room to increase that modest market share, and Wall Street expects it to do precisely that through 2024 thanks to the technological advantage it enjoys over Intel's chips.
However, this isn't the only reason to be bullish about AMD. The company is also well-positioned to tap into the booming market for gaming consoles, as it supplies chips to Sony and Microsoft for the PlayStation 5 (PS5) and the Xbox Series X/S. Sales of these consoles are expected to soar in the coming years.
The PS5, for instance, is expected to clock 67 million units in annual sales by 2024, compared to just 4.5 million units last year. The Xbox Series X is also expected to step on the gas with sales of 37 million units in 2024, an increase from 3.3 million units last year. The addition of Valve's Steam Deck to AMD's portfolio of gaming console customers will further boost the chipmaker's prospects in a market that's expected to clock 15% annual growth through 2026, according to Mordor Intelligence.

Meanwhile, AMD is also breaking into the data center graphics card market, which is currently dominated by Nvidia. AMD's data center GPUs (graphics processing units) are gaining traction thanks to the demand from high-performance computing (HPC) customers. As a result, the company's revenue from data center GPUs more than doubled year-over-year in the second quarter.
AMD expects further growth in this segment, which currently produces a very small portion of its revenue. The company pointed out in January this year that its first milestone would be to clock $500 million in data center GPU sales, and the massive sales improvement last quarter indicates that it could be on its way to achieving that target. In fact, AMD expects data center GPU sales to double in 2021. The good news for AMD investors is that the data center GPU market could grow at 43% a year through 2026, hitting $26 billion in revenue, according to a third-party estimate.
So AMD stands to gain from several fast-growing trends in the long run, which makes it a top growth stock to buy in the wake of the September sell-off.
Bandwidth
Shares of cloud communications specialist Bandwidth have pulled back substantially in September.
BAND data by YCharts
This has created a solid opportunity for investors looking to buy a fast-growing company at an attractive valuation. Bandwidth clocked 57% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of 2021 to $120.7 million. Adjusted net income shot up to $0.32 per share in Q2 from $0.13 per share in the year-ago period.
Bandwidth's terrific growth was driven by a mix of higher customer spending and an increase in customer count. The company exited Q2 with 3,051 active customers for its communications platform-as-a-service (CPaaS) offerings, a jump of 61% over the year-ago period. Additionally, Bandwidth's active customer base increased its spending on the company's services. This is evident from the dollar-based net retention rate of 114%, which compares Bandwidth's revenue from the same cohort of active customers on a year-over-year basis.
More importantly, Bandwidth looks all set to maintain its terrific momentum. The company has upgraded the midpoint of its 2021 revenue guidance to $485.8 million from $474.6 million earlier. It now expects $0.73 per share in earnings, compared to the expectation of just $0.51 per share at the start of the year.
The upgraded revenue guidance means that Bandwidth now expects full-year revenue growth of 41%, while earnings are also on track to increase substantially from the prior-year period's figure of $0.55 per share. It wouldn't be surprising to see Bandwidth sustain such high levels of growth in the long run, as the CPaaS market is still in its early stages of growth.
According to IDC, the CPaaS market generated $4.2 billion in 2019. That figure is expected to jump to $17.7 billion by 2024, translating into a compound annual growth rate of 33%. Bandwidth's growth indicates that it is outpacing the industry it operates in. That's why it would be a good idea to take advantage of the pullback in Bandwidth stock.
The stock is trading at 5.6 times sales, which is much lower than last year's average of 12.7. What's more, Bandwidth's price-to-sales ratio is lower than that of industry peer Twilio, which trades at 25 times sales and recorded 67% year-over-year growth last quarter. With a far lower valuation and comparable top-line growth, Bandwidth offers a much better value proposition compared to Twilio right now, making it an attractive bet thanks to the September sell-off.

WASHINGTON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - The White House is pressing automakers, chip companies and others to cooperate in a bid for more information about the ongoing semiconductor crisis that has forced cuts to U.S. auto production, but made clear on Thursday that the industry needs to take the lead to solve the problem.
Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, who along with Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, met on Thursday with semiconductor industry participants, told Reuters that strong action was needed to address the chip shortage.
""It's time to get more aggressive,"" she said. ""The situation is not getting better, in some ways it is getting worse.""
Participants in Thursday's meeting, which followed meetings in April and May, included Detroit's Big Three automakers, plus Apple AAPL.O, Daimler DAIGn.DE, BMW BMW.DE, GlobalFoundries, Micron MU.O, Microsoft MSFT.O, Samsung 005930.KS, TSMC 2330.TW, Intel INTC.O and Ampere Computing.
The White House said the administration ""reaffirmed that industry needs to be in the lead in resolving the supply chain bottlenecks that are occurring due to the global chip shortage.""
Raimondo said a voluntary request Thursday for information within 45 days on the chips crisis is about boosting supply chain transparency and to ""get more granular into the bottlenecks and then ultimately predict challenges before they happen.""
She warned that if companies did not answer the voluntary request ""then we have other tools in our tool box that require them to give us data. I hope we don't get there. But if we have to we will.""
Automakers from General Motors Co GM.N to Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T to Chrysler parent Stellantis NV STLA.MI have slashed output and sales forecasts due to scarce chip supplies, made worse by a COVID-19 resurgence in key Asian semiconductor production hubs.
Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares, who participated in the White House virtual meeting, said the automaker will cooperate with the information request, but added in a statement that ""broad participation from the entire semiconductor supply chain will be critical for these efforts to be successful.""
Some attendees told Reuters privately they were concerned the transparency measures could require disclosing pricing information that many companies regard as corporate secrets.
Raimondo also delivered the message to the companies privately that the government would mandate information sharing if necessary.
The White House also said several U.S. agencies would manage a new early alert system ""to proactively manage potential semiconductor supply chain disruptions linked to public health developments in key trading partners.""
Participants were concerned about how to disclose such information while still complying with reporting requirements of publicly traded companies, a participant said.

She added that she was ""optimistic that we could make some incremental progress in the next handful of months"" by boosting supply-chain transparency. ""There's a lack of trust in the supply chain. There's probably some over-ordering going on, you know. There might be some ... suppliers sending chips here because they can make more money, instead of here.""
Companies attending the virtual White House meetings include Detroit's Big Three automakers, plus Apple Inc AAPL.O, Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, BMW AG, GlobalFoundries, Micron MU.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Samsung 005930.KS, TSMC 2330.TW and Intel Corp INTC.O.
A group representing major automakers said the industry and semiconductor companies are ""working diligently to resolve the global chip shortage as quickly and efficiently as possible ... and to strengthen transparency and resiliency in the automotive semiconductor supply chain.""

WASHINGTON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - The White House will discuss ways to overcome a semiconductor chip supply crisis that is cutting auto production around the world in a new round of meetings with major companies on Thursday.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and White House National Economic Council director will host companies including Detroit's Big Three automakers General Motors GM.N, Ford Motor F.N and Stellantis STLA.MI as well as Apple AAPL.O, Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, GlobalFoundries, Micron MU.O, Microsoft MSFT.O, Samsung 005930.KS, TSMC 2330.TW and others including Intel Corp INTC.O Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger.
The White House plans to release a voluntary request for information this week to get better information on the chips problem from industry and potential solutions to supply chain issues.
The administration is seeking comments within 45 days to get details about ""supply and demand, inventory, ordering and customer segments,"" a Biden administration official told reporters Wednesday.
""We have other tools in the tool kit to survey firms and require information,"" the official said, saying they would first seek voluntary efforts.
Another official told reporters the Biden administration also plans to stand up a voluntary ""early alert system for COVID-19 related shutdowns to microelectronics manufacturing around the world,"" gathering information from U.S. embassies, impacted businesses and others.
The administration wants to ensure it is ""maximizing our technical and material assistance to these locations to keep key semiconductor manufacturing facilities and other important facilities up and running.""
Rising COVID-19 infections have slowed output at parts factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, compounding a global shortage of auto chips.
Last month, the economy minister for Taiwan, a major chip maker, said it was doing all it can to address the global shortage of semiconductors.
The issue has taken on a strong diplomatic hue as Taiwan scrambles to reassure the United States, its most important international supporter and arms supplier, that it is doing all it can, especially at a time when Taipei is facing increased military pressure from China, which views Taiwan as its own.
Last week, data firm IHS Markit said semiconductor shortages and delayed packaging and testing of chips will cause production of global light vehicles to drop by five million this year. Some automakers think the crisis may last until late 2022 or into 2023.
Automakers from GM to Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T have slashed output and sales forecasts due to scarce chip supplies, made worse by a COVID-19 resurgence in key Asian semiconductor production hubs.
GM earlier this month cut production at most of its North American production.
Other companies attending Thursday including AMD AMD.O, Applied Materials AMAT.O, Medtronic MDT.N and Siemens SIEGn.DE.
The White House wants Congress to approve $52 billion to boost U.S. production of semiconductor chips.
