July 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were set for a subdued open on Thursday after data showed an unexpected rise in weekly jobless claims, while a steady flow of positive earnings reports offered markets some support.
The Labor Department's report showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased by 51,000 to a seasonally adjusted 419,000 for the week ended July 17. Still, the number likely does not suggest a material shift in labor market conditions, with another month of strong job growth expected in July.
Investors have been closely following the health of the jobs market on which the Federal Reserve's monetary policy hinges, especially after a series of higher inflation reading recently sparked fears about a sooner-than expected paring of policy support as the economy reopens.
A shift in attention to corporate earnings and the so-called value stocks have helped Wall Street recoup most of its declines from earlier in the week that were triggered by concerns about the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus.
""The market is realizing that it's very unlikely that this variant is going to have a similar outcome to the original pandemic,"" said Tom Mantione, managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management in Stamford, CT.
""We've got a lot of runway to the U.S. economy both in the labor market and earnings, and now is the time to be buying the dip. If you weren't buying on Monday, you were kind of missing the point.""

The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So before you buy or sell Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), you may well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling.
What Is Insider Selling?
It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, rules govern insider transactions, and certain disclosures are required.
Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. As Peter Lynch said, 'insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise'.
Intel Insider Transactions Over The Last Year
In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when insider Robert Swan bought US$1.5m worth of shares at a price of US$56.09 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$56.23. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices.
Intel insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!
NasdaqGS:INTC Insider Trading Volume July 22nd 2021
Intel is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.
Does Intel Boast High Insider Ownership?
For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Intel insiders own 0.04% of the company, currently worth about US$101m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.
What Might The Insider Transactions At Intel Tell Us?
It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Intel shares in the last quarter. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. With high insider ownership and encouraging transactions, it seems like Intel insiders think the business has merit. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Intel. For example - Intel has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.
Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.
For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions, but not derivative transactions.

2021-07-22 00:00:00+00:00,PREVIEW-Intel's foundry ambitions could be slowed by lack of deal targets,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/preview-intels-foundry-ambitions-could-be-slowed-by-lack-of-deal-targets-2021-07-22,,,"By Stephen Nellis
July 21 (Reuters) - For Intel Corp INTC.O Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger, an obvious strategy in his high-stakes bid to make the company a player in producing chips for others would be a transformational acquisition, analysts say.
But there is just one problem - a dearth of acquisition targets for Intel to buy.
The conundrum came into focus last week when the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel was considering a purchase of chipmaker GlobalFoundries for $30 billion. Intel reports earnings Thursday, and despite a booming PC market, analysts expect a 9.8% drop in sales to $17.8 billion as Intel loses share to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O.
Buying a foundry would give Intel ""real customer support people, as opposed to technologists who have mainly been told what to do by management,"" said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive officer of VLSI Research. ""It took Samsung 10 years to build up a foundry business.""
But analysts question the price tag for GlobalFoundries, and conflicts could arise because some of the foundry's major customers, such as AMD, compete against Intel.
GlobalFoundries Chief Executive Tom Caulfield told Reuters on Monday he plans to take the chipmaker public in 2022 as previously planned and dismissed talk of an Intel deal. A person close to Mubadala Investment Co., the Abu Dhabi state investor that owns GlobalFoundries, told Reuters earlier this week there are no active discussions with Intel.
Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with research firm Bernstein, pointed out that if Intel wants to buy a large foundry and cannot buy GlobalFoundries, there would be few other options.
Two of the next largest players, China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp 0981.HK and Taiwan's United Microelectronics Corp 2303.TW, would almost certainly be off-limits for political reasons.
Hutcheson said that if Intel cannot buy a foundry business, its only other option may be to go after smaller chip firms that still own some of their own factories, like On Semiconductor Corp ON.O and Analog Devices Inc ADI.O.
AMORTIZATION TRANSFORMATION
For decades, Intel aimed to make the world's fastest computing chips. That focus on the cutting-edge meant that Intel discarded older chipmaking technology - called ""process nodes"" in the industry - relatively quickly.
But most of Intel's would-be rivals in the foundry industry take a different approach, keeping older technology around to make cheaper chips for customers who do not require the latest technology.
""TSMC does an excellent job of keeping process nodes for many years,"" said Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at TIRIAS Research. ""When they build a new fab, they keep the old ones humming along.""
Intel's ability to buy, build or re-purpose foundries for outside customers even as it tries to regain its competitiveness in advanced chips may prove a tall order at a moment when the industry is stretched globally for talent, equipment and materials.
""There may be internal limits to how many facilities Intel can bring up,"" said Dean McCarron, president of Mercury Research, which tracks market among chipmakers. ""Clearly they want more capacity - as does the rest of the planet.""

July 21 (Reuters) - For Intel Corp INTC.O Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger, an obvious strategy in his high-stakes bid to make the company a player in producing chips for others would be a transformational acquisition, analysts say.
But there is just one problem - a dearth of acquisition targets for Intel to buy.
The conundrum came into focus last week when the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel was considering a purchase of chipmaker GlobalFoundries for $30 billion. Intel reports earnings Thursday, and despite a booming PC market, analysts expect a 9.8% drop in sales to $17.8 billion as Intel loses share to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O.
Buying a foundry would give Intel ""real customer support people, as opposed to technologists who have mainly been told what to do by management,"" said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive officer of VLSI Research. ""It took Samsung 10 years to build up a foundry business.""
But analysts question the price tag for GlobalFoundries, and conflicts could arise because some of the foundry's major customers, such as AMD, compete against Intel.
GlobalFoundries Chief Executive Tom Caulfield told Reuters on Monday he plans to take the chipmaker public in 2022 as previously planned and dismissed talk of an Intel deal. A person close to Mubadala Investment Co., the Abu Dhabi state investor that owns GlobalFoundries, told Reuters earlier this week there are no active discussions with Intel.
Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with research firm Bernstein, pointed out that if Intel wants to buy a large foundry and cannot buy GlobalFoundries, there would be few other options.
Two of the next largest players, China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp 0981.HK and Taiwan's United Microelectronics Corp 2303.TW, would almost certainly be off-limits for political reasons.
Hutcheson said that if Intel cannot buy a foundry business, its only other option may be to go after smaller chip firms that still own some of their own factories, like On Semiconductor Corp ON.O and Analog Devices Inc ADI.O.
AMORTIZATION TRANSFORMATION
For decades, Intel aimed to make the world's fastest computing chips. That focus on the cutting-edge meant that Intel discarded older chipmaking technology - called ""process nodes"" in the industry - relatively quickly.
But most of Intel's would-be rivals in the foundry industry take a different approach, keeping older technology around to make cheaper chips for customers who do not require the latest technology.
""TSMC does an excellent job of keeping process nodes for many years,"" said Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at TIRIAS Research. ""When they build a new fab, they keep the old ones humming along.""
Intel's ability to buy, build or re-purpose foundries for outside customers even as it tries to regain its competitiveness in advanced chips may prove a tall order at a moment when the industry is stretched globally for talent, equipment and materials.
""There may be internal limits to how many facilities Intel can bring up,"" said Dean McCarron, president of Mercury Research, which tracks market among chipmakers. ""Clearly they want more capacity - as does the rest of the planet.""

To make a comparison to football, IBM (NYSE:IBM) is the Dallas Cowboys of technology. How do I mean? Well, both IBM and the Cowboys are overrated. They haven’t won a title in a quarter century and they’re not going to do it this year. Their system is stale, yet somehow they still have fans. All around, IBM stock represents a disappointment.
IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building."" width=""300"" height=""169"">

Basically, both the Cowboys and IBM are living in the past. The Cowboys revere football icon Tom Landry while actually being run by Jerry Jones. Similarly, IBM still reveres its 20th century leaders while still feeling the effects of former CEO and current executive chairman Virginia Rometty.
This much became clear when Jim Whitehurst, who brought IBM a new cachet with Red Hat in 2019, announced his departure. Rometty and the IBM bureaucracy outmaneuvered him, installing Arvind Krishna as CEO. Now, the company is still behind the ball.
IBM Stock: Rometty’s Bad Plays
Rometty — who became CEO in 2012 after a career in marketing — compiled one of the worst executive records of the last decade in my opinion.
For starters, like Randall Stephenson of AT&T (NYSE:T), she prioritized the dividend and missed the cloud — a trillion-dollar opportunity. Additionally, like Jeff Immelt of General Electric (NYSE:GE), she covered up poor performance with happy talk and buybacks. Then finally, like Brian Krzanich of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Rometty ran off talent until the cupboard was bare.

7 Great Momentum Stocks to Buy Before July Ends 
When I was young, IBM dominated technology just like the Cowboys dominated football. They literally made Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and used it to crush Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in PCs. Their style was to bring in suits who assured clients they could handle all of their computing. Their Jimmy Johnson (another football icon) was Lou Gerstner, who made IBM a consulting company. Gerstner even wrote a book about it called Who Says Elephants Can’t Dance. 
Whitehurst also has a book, The Open Organization, which describes how successful companies today must be run from the bottom-up as much as the top-down. Tech companies must also be partners with their customers, Whitehurst notes, not their overlords. The book was a direct challenge to the way IBM does business.
When the company bought Red Hat, I was ready to buy IBM stock, thinking it would mark a transformation. However, Rometty and others have shown that’s not happening.
Why IBM Looks Good
Of course, IBM stock still looks good right now because everything in tech looks good. Today, shares are up 12% year-to-date (YTD) and have paid out $3.27 per share in dividends. The second-quarter earnings looked good as well. Now, investors are hoping that, by spinning off its services business as Kyndryl,  IBM can be great again.
But that’s not going to happen. Kyndryl has signed an expensive lease atop One Vanderbilt. It’s a sales office, meant to over-awe clients with its power. That’s the IBM way. But Kyndryl is just an outsourcer like Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH), which has also gone nowhere this year.
And the rest of IBM? It will be a minnow among giants. Dell (NYSE:DELL), which is similar to the company and owns most of VMWare (NYSE:VMW), is up 31% YTD. Likewise, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) — the faux cloud company that Silicon Valley loves to hate — is up 39% YTD.
Of course, the “hybrid cloud” is a great idea, but IBM can’t execute on it. After all, Dak Prescott is also a good quarterback, but that doesn’t mean he can carry the team.
The Bottom Line on IBM Stock
If one word can be used to describe IBM today, it’s Watson.
Watson was named for the company’s legendary CEOs, Tom Watson Sr. — who created IBM —  and Tom Watson Jr., who made IBM a computer company. It was supposed to become a dominant artificial intelligence (AI) engine.
In the end, though, Watson was just Apache Hadoop with a fancy front-end. Hadoop was an interesting idea, but a business failure.
When it comes down to it, IBM needs to be recycled, like its old upstate New York manufacturing plants need to be recycled. My guess is that it will be, after the company has flailed a bit as this latest incarnation. Its cloud will become a real estate investment trust (REIT) like Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) and Red Hat will be spun out on its own. Retirement liabilities will be made to disappear.
But IBM won’t be taken out for nearly the $126 billion it’s worth today. That’s because, in my opinion, Virginia Rometty has become the Jerry Jones of technology. She’ll win eight games and lose eight games, then call it a success. Consider that before investing in IBM stock.

The Nasdaq had climbed half a percent as of 11:15 a.m. EDT today, bringing it once again to within about 1% of its record closing high from last week.
The Nasdaq is full of technology stocks, and many of them have put in outstanding performance over the past year. In particular, many investors are looking at the semiconductor industry as a key driver of growth in tech, especially given the current supply-and-demand issues that are leaving buyers scurrying to find much-needed semiconductor chips. That's a big part of why semiconductor companies are the hottest stocks in the Nasdaq on Wednesday, and they could remain in favor for quite awhile.

Big gains for chip companies
Investors found strength in many different niches of the semiconductor space. Big companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) gained ground, rising 5%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) was up more than 2% in advance of its release of earnings results later this afternoon. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) also picked up more than 1% on the day.
Some of the biggest gains were reserved for companies specializing in semiconductor equipment. Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT), KLA (NASDAQ: KLAC), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) all climbed 3%, while Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX) picked up 4%.
Solid earnings from ASML
Some of the enthusiasm for the industry came from ASML, which released its own second-quarter 2021 earnings this morning. It reported a 21% rise in total sales compared to the year-ago quarter, led by sizable gains in both sales of equipment systems and service revenue. Earnings jumped more than 40% year over year to 2.52 euros ($3) per share.
One sign of strong demand came from ASML's bookings numbers . Net bookings were more than double ASML's sales, allowing the company to build up a nice backlog of 17.5 billion euros ($20.6 billion) that should promote further growth for the rest of the year and beyond. Indeed, the semiconductor equipment maker said it sees sales rising more than 30% sequentially in the third quarter.
ASML also treated shareholders well, announcing a new stock repurchase program that could have the company spending up to 9 billion euros between now and the end of 2023. That's likely only to add to the huge gains in the stock recently.
Plenty of opportunity
The semiconductor industry is notoriously cyclical. When shortages of semiconductor chips occur, chipmakers dramatically boost their production capacity in order to meet short-term demand. Once the shortage eases, companies are left with much higher capacity without corresponding demand, which usually causes chip prices to plunge. In response, profits fall, and semiconductor companies have to retrench and curtail supply, setting the stage for the next set of cyclical chip shortages.
Over time, you can see the rises and falls in most semiconductor stocks that result from these cycles. But overall growth has generally made the ups more substantial than the downs. That's created great long-term opportunities for investors who are willing to handle the likelihood of significant share-price declines at some point in the future when current shortages go away.

2021-07-21 00:00:00+00:00,"Despite A High Valuation, Surging Demand Makes Nvidia Stock A Smart Bet",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/despite-a-high-valuation-surging-demand-makes-nvidia-stock-a-smart-bet-2021-07-21,,,"Having jumped nearly 4x from its low in March 2020, at the current price of $758 per share, we believe Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) has further upside potential. Nvidia stock rose from $200 in March 2020 to $758 currently, much more than the S&P which increased by around 95% from its lows. Further, the stock is up around 2.5x from the level it was at before the pandemic. Despite that, we believe Nvidia stock could rise around 10% to regain its recent high of $835, driven by expectations of continuing demand growth and stellar Q1 2022 results. Our dashboard What Factors Drove 468% Change In Nvidia Stock Between 2018 And Now? has the underlying numbers behind our thinking.
Nvidia’s stock price rise since 2018-end came due to a 42% increase in revenue from $11.72 billion in FY 2019 to $16.68 billion on an LTM basis (Nvidia’s fiscal year ends in January). Despite a 2% rise in the outstanding share count over this period, RPS (revenue-per-share) jumped 40% from $19.30 in FY 2019 to $27.00 over the past 12 months.
Meanwhile, Nvidia’s P/S (price-to-sales) multiple rose from 7x in 2018 to 29x currently, but we believe that the company’s P/S ratio has the potential to rise further in the near term on expectations of continuing demand growth and a favorable shareholder return policy, thus driving the stock price higher.
Where Is The Stock Headed?
The global spread of coronavirus and the resulting lockdowns have led to a rise in online activity and driven the shift toward working from home. This has led to a rise in demand for Nvidia’s GPU products from the computing and gaming segments, as well as from the data center segment. This is evident from Nvidia’s Q1 2022 earnings, where revenue jumped to $5.66 billion, up strongly from $3.08 billion in Q1 2021. While COGS rose at the same rate, the company was able to keep R&D and SG&A expenses in check, which led to operating income doubling to $1.96 billion. A marginal drop in the effective tax rate saw EPS jumping more than 2x to $3.08.
Further, we believe the company will continue seeing strong revenue growth in the medium term, as data center and GPU demand is expected to stay strong. Additionally, if Nvidia continues to successfully control operating expenses, profitability could rise further in the near to medium term. This will raise investor expectations, driving up the company’s P/S multiple. We believe that Nvidia stock can rise around 10% from current levels, to regain its recent high around $835.

The Dow Jones, which is comprised of 30 profitable, time-tested, multinational businesses, has become a barometer to gauge the health of the U.S. stock market.
It's also home to some serious value, at least according to a handful of Wall Street analysts and investment banks. Wall Street's high-water one-year price target for each of the following four Dow stocks implies upside ranging from 48% to as much as 58%.
Image source: Getty Images.
Intel: Implied upside of 55%
To begin with, at least one Wall Street analyst foresees some significant upside in semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). According to Robert W. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra, Intel could hit $85 a share, representing upside of 55% over the next year.
Among Gerra's chief arguments is that Intel will likely make a big acquisition to shore up its Foundry Services operations. It just so happens that The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Intel is tinkering with the idea of a $30 billion deal to acquire GlobalFoundries, a specialty chip-production company that Advanced Micro Devices spun off back in 2008. Going the acquisition route would emphasize Intel's renewed commitment to keep chip production under its own control, rather than outsource it. Depending on geopolitical or supply and demand concerns, that could become a major competitive edge for Intel.
Even though personal-computing chip demand tends to ebb and flow, the future for Intel will likely hinge on data centers. Despite a double-digit percentage decline in data center revenue in the first quarter, demand for storage, processing, and software solutions are only going to increase over the long run as businesses make the shift online and into the cloud. Intel's road will undoubtedly be bumpy as it spends big bucks on 7nm chip innovation, but it should prove well worth it.
An $85 price target may well make sense for Intel, but likely not over the next year.

Walgreen Boots Alliance: Implied upside of 48%
Healthcare stocks are also expected to get in on the action. Pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) has a high-end price target of $68 from analysts at Robert W. Baird. This portends up to 48% upside over the next 12 months.
The bullishness surrounding Walgreens likely has to do with the company's ongoing multipoint turnaround plan. By fiscal 2022, Walgreens should be realizing more than $2 billion in annual cost savings, yet at the same time will benefit from hefty investments in digitization. Although online sales only comprise a small portion of total sales, direct-to-consumer is an area of considerable growth opportunity for the generally slow-growing pharmacy chain.
Perhaps even more exciting is the partnership between Walgreens Boots Alliance and VillageMD. This duo plans to open as many as 700 full-service clinics (co-located in Walgreens' stores) in more than 30 markets throughout the United States by mid-decade. Whereas most in-store clinics cater to vaccines or a sniffle, doctor-led full-service practices inside Walgreens have the potential to facilitate repeat business and drive patients right to Walgreens' high-margin pharmacy.
As a shareholder, I'm enthusiastic about Walgreens' future. But I suspect it'll take longer than 12 months to reach $68.

Dow Inc.: Implied upside of 58%
When it comes to Dow stocks with supercharged return potential, chemicals company Dow Inc. (NYSE: DOW) takes the cake. If the Street-high price target of $95 were to come to fruition, Dow would return 58% for its shareholders over the coming year.
The biggest growth driver for Dow is going to be a continued U.S. and global recovery (Dow has a manufacturing presence in 31 countries). If economic activity continues to pick up, not only will the company recognize strong demand for its packaging, specialty plastics, performance materials, and coatings, but this demand will actually improve pricing power for Dow's material solutions. The first quarter saw demand and pricing power improve across all operating segments.
Beyond just growing demand, Dow is taking other actions to improve its bottom line. The company has invested aggressively in digitization, while at the same time restructuring its operations to eventually reduce costs by approximately $300 million on an annual basis. Perhaps most important, capacity expansion for its material solutions will allow Dow to meet increased demand as the U.S. and global economy heat up.
The bottom line is that Dow is a solid cyclical operating model that'll deliver incremental profit improvements in the years that lie ahead. But as a generally slower-growth business, $95 seems far too aggressive a price target over the coming 12 months.

Chevron: Implied upside of 54%
Lastly, at least one Wall Street investment bank is counting on a gusher of a year from integrated oil and gas giant Chevron (NYSE: CVX). If the high-end price target of $152 proves accurate, Chevron could gallop higher by 54% over the coming year.
To state the obvious, Chevron benefits from its integrated operating model. Even though higher crude prices are more favorable given the juicier margin potential of its upstream (drilling and exploration) operations, the company is hedged by controlling petrochemical plants and refineries (downstream operations). When the price of crude declines, the input costs for its downstream operations fall, as well, pushing profitability and margins higher.
The Chevron growth story also can't be told without making mention of its generally superior balance sheet. Whereas most major oil stocks are weighed down by debt, Chevron's debt-to-equity of 34% is considerably lower than many of its peers. When combined with aggressive capital expenditure reductions in the near-term, Chevron looks to have considerably better financial flexibility than other oil majors.
Ultimately, Chevron's success will be dependent on a continued rebound in the U.S. and global economy. While history does indicate that periods of economic expansion usually last years, Wall Street's high-end price target should, once again, be taken with a grain of salt over the next year.

Shares closed up 1.1% at $55.24 on July 21.
Mobileye chose New York city for testing as the city presents unique challenges, including aggressive drivers, jaywalking, double parking, famously bright city lights at night, and construction sites. Hence, successful testing would mean that its self-driving car is capable of handling the most difficult driving environments. (See Intel stock charts on TipRanks)
Mobileye is also testing its self-driving cars in Detroit, Munich, and Israel and expects to start testing in Tokyo, Shanghai, and Paris soon.
Currently, Mobileye is the only autonomous vehicle company to have secured a permit to test drive in New York City. The company has shared an unedited video of one of its test drives on its website.
Yesterday, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a price target of $60, implying 8.6% upside potential.
Rolland believes that Intel has set the bar too low for Q1 earnings expectations and therefore thinks the results will be positive.
Intel is scheduled to report second-quarter results on July 22, followed by an event to update its process and packaging roadmaps. Rolland cautions investors about increased volatility during these two events.
Overall, the stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 9 Buys, 9 Holds, and 7 Sells. The average Intel price target of $62.35 implies 12.9% upside potential to current levels. Shares have gained 11.2% year to date.

2021-07-20 00:00:00+00:00,Is Nvidia About to Replace Intel in the Dow?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-nvidia-about-to-replace-intel-in-the-dow-2021-07-20,,,"The stock market bounced back hard on Tuesday, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) did quite well. Up 1.5% as of 12:45 p.m. EDT today, the Nasdaq is actually up slightly on the week after a big roller coaster ride.
Many investors follow the Dow Jones Industrial Average more closely than the Nasdaq. Just six stocks out of 30 Dow components are listed on the Nasdaq, but they include some of the biggest tech companies on the planet. Nevertheless, one recent move could make it more likely that the Dow will replace one of its older Nasdaq stocks in favor of a newer and much larger rival. Below, we'll look at Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) to see if it's ready to join the Dow and replace its competitor Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
Image source: Getty Images.
Making the case for Nvidia
Back when Intel joined the Dow in the late 1990s, it was the undisputed powerhouse of the chip industry. Its groundbreaking x86 microprocessor designs had become the standard for personal computers, and the tech boom had put PCs on the cutting edge of innovation.
Today, though, Intel has fallen behind, while Nvidia has moved forward with innovations of its own. The latter's graphics processing units have become favorites not only among video gamers but also for those requiring their superior processing power for other applications, such as cryptocurrency mining. As a result, Nvidia's market capitalization is now roughly twice that of Intel.
Nvidia never would have been able to be considered for the Dow when its stock price was above $800 per share. That's because the Dow is a price-weighted index. Nvidia would instantly have had more than twice the influence of any other single stock in the average, making it a nonstarter as a potential addition to the Dow.
Now, though, Nvidia's 4-for-1 stock split has finally taken effect. As a result, the stock's price has moved to around $185. That's a perfect amount for a new Dow component to take its place within the average.
Intel has no Dow influence anyway
Some will inevitably argue that Intel is still an extremely strong player in technology and doesn't deserve to lose its place in the Dow. Intel has been able to sustain its track record in areas like data servers, and it still plays a big role in the PC industry.
Yet where it has fallen behind is in chips for mobile devices. Nvidia and others took the lead in that market, and Nvidia's proposed acquisition of ARM Holdings would give it a big leg up not only on Intel but also the rest of the semiconductor industry.
Also, from a Dow standpoint, Intel has almost no influence over the average anyway. Its share price of $55 makes it the third-least-influential stock of the Dow 30, with a weighting of barely 1%. Nvidia would fall in the middle of the Dow pack, with roughly 3% to 3.5% weight.
Coming soon?
The managers of the Dow have been busy, making changes to seven Dow components on five separate occasions in the past four years. It's definitely possible that they'll move again if they see Intel as having lost the semiconductor wars.
Joining the Dow would be a mark of distinction for Nvidia. But even if it doesn't happen, investors can take heart in the fact that the GPU giant has already proved its superiority over Intel.

A week ago, I saw Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) priced at over $800/share and suggested traders take profits. 
Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.com
Since then, NVDA stock is down nearly $100/share. (Don’t know my own strength.) It’s due to fall further on July 19. This means there’s a new question. When do you get back in?
Nvidia shares fell for two reasons. First, China burned the Bitcoin market, meaning a lot of high-end graphics cards are hitting the secondary market.  Second, rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) launched a $30 billion bid for Global Foundries, the Arab-backed chip-making foundry.
Neither move changes Nvidia’s fundamentals. Those older boards will be quickly absorbed by gamers, who have been waiting for this opportunity. The global chip shortage is far from over. Intel isn’t even Nvidia’s foundry. That would be Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), which I also wrote about recently. 
Taiwan Dominance
Despite its saber rattling, China is not about to invade Taiwan.

That’s because calling Taiwan the Saudi Arabia of semiconductors is to dramatically understate the case. More than half the world’s high-end microprocessors are made in Taiwan. TSMC, as it’s known, isn’t sharing the technology that let it extend Moore’s Law to its logical conclusion, circuits closer together than strands of DNA. China has tried to steal it, hiring TSMC engineers, but it has been unsuccessful. Intel hasn’t cracked it either. TSMC’s new factory in Arizona will use it, but that factory will just supply a tiny portion of demand, for big customers like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
On top of that, Nvidia and AMD (NYSE:AMD), which dominate the design market, both have CEOs born in the same small Taiwanese city of Tainan. The family of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang moved to Oregon when he was a child. (AMD CEO Lisa Su’s family moved to New York when she was 3.) Immigrants, they get the job done.
Nvidia made its mark processing graphics for video game consoles and has moved into processing for data centers. (Bitcoin was always a sideline.) The long-term plan is to complete the purchase of England’s ARM Holdings, now controlled by Softbank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) and dominate in microprocessors. As Cloud Czars like Apple move to order their own chips, they’re licensing basic designs from ARM. The microprocessor market, worth $100 billion in 2020, is projected to be worth nearly $160 billion by 2025.  There seems nothing that can keep Nvidia from dominating it.
Global Threats for NVDA Stock
Of course, as I noted last week, Nvidia is a very pricey stock. Even with its recent fall it had a market cap of about $740 billion, on estimated 2021 sales of under $20 billion. It could go down further and still be expensive.
Analysts at Tipranks are still flogging Nvidia, and those surveyed by Yahoo have only lately begun urging caution. The stock is due to split 4:1 on July 19, so if you look at the stock charts tomorrow don’t panic.
The Bottom Line on NVDA Stock
Since I’m the one who called the turn down, I should probably be the one to call the turn back up.
My guess is that the new post-split Nvidia bounces off $175 ($700 pre-split) but you don’t have to rush back in. (It was up slightly on July 19.)
I also own Intel shares, and I like their new CEO, Pat Geisinger. His moves are no threat to Nvidia. Support from the Biden Administration, desperate to on-shore the industry, means he should be able to squeeze profits from the foundry.
China also remains desperate to get TSMC’s tech but knowing what and knowing how are different. If global trustbusters stop Nvidia’s purchase of ARM that could also take the stock down, and China must approve the deal.
You don’t have to rush into Nvidia, in other words, but it’s one of those stocks you really should own. Find a price you’re comfortable with, then start accumulating it.

2021-07-20 00:00:00+00:00,Where Will TSMC Be in 5 Years?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-will-tsmc-be-in-5-years-2021-07-20,,,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) operates the world's most advanced chip foundries. It manufactures the industry's smallest and most power-efficient chips for chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), NVIDIA, and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).
As a linchpin of the global semiconductor industry, TSMC profits from the market's current insatiable appetite for new chips. Over the past five years, its stock price has more than quadrupled as faster wireless connections, the expansion of the data center and Internet of Things (IoT) markets, new 5G and AI applications, and more advanced electronic devices have all sparked feverish demand for new chips.
Image source: Getty Images.
TSMC has clearly been a great long-term investment, but can it maintain its momentum over the next five years? Let's take a fresh look at its technological roadmap and near-term challenges to decide.
How far is TSMC ahead of the competition?
TSMC started mass producing 5nm chips, which contain the smallest microprocessors in the world, in the second quarter of 2020. Samsung, its closest competitor, crossed that sizing milestone shortly afterward, but its 5nm chips still aren't as dense as TSMC's 5nm chips.
Denser chips pack more transistors into a smaller space, so leading ""fabless"" chipmakers like AMD, NVIDIA, and Apple still prefer to outsource their highest-end chips to TSMC instead of Samsung.
But TSMC and Samsung both remain far ahead of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which struggled to make the mass-production leap from 10nm to 7nm chips. Intel originally planned to launch its first 7nm chips in late 2021, but they've been postponed to 2023 following a series of manufacturing mishaps.
What's TSMC's roadmap for the next five years?
Looking back at TSMC's historic roadmap from the past 34 years, we'll see why Intel and so many other foundries have struggled to manufacture smaller chips.
Image source: TSMC.
Up until the end of the 20th century, each new node was much smaller than the previous one. But since then, it has become increasingly difficult and expensive to manufacture smaller and denser chips on a mass scale.
That's why many chipmakers gave up on becoming IDMs (integrated device manufacturers) like Intel, which designs and manufactures its own chips. Today, most IDMs -- like Texas Instruments and Skyworks Solutions -- manufacture larger chips instead of producing tiny high-end chips.
TSMC plans to start mass-producing 3nm chips in the second half of 2022. It expects these chips to provide 70% more logic density than its 5nm chips, as well as 15% more speed at the same power levels and a 30% power reduction at the same speeds.
Upcoming chips, including AMD's Zen 5 CPUs, Apple's new first-party processors, and Qualcomm's next-gen Snapdragons, will all be manufactured with TSMC's 3nm process. Even Intel, which recently doubled down on its domestic foundry plans, will outsource some of its chips to TSMC's 3nm supply lines. That's why TSMC's 3nm node has already been entirely booked through 2024.
To meet that demand and maintain its lead, TSMC plans to increase its capex from $17.2 billion in 2020 to roughly $30 billion this year, and collectively spend about $100 billion over the next three years. It's also already started developing 2nm chips, and mass production could kick off in 2026.
But what about the competition?
Based on these facts, the ongoing chip shortage and robust demand for new 5nm chips should support TSMC's sales growth through 2024. But TSMC should still keep an eye on the competition.
Samsung also plans to mass-produce 3nm chips in 2022, but it's expected to remain behind TSMC and Intel in terms of overall density. IC Insights expects Samsung's chipmaking capex to remain nearly flat year over year at $28.1 billion this year, so it doesn't seem intent on overtaking TSMC.
Intel remains an unpredictable contender since its foundry expansion plans could be supported by big subsidies in the U.S. and Europe. It's also reportedly interested in acquiring GlobalFoundries, AMD's former foundry partner, which would significantly accelerate those efforts.
Intel probably won't ever surpass TSMC in the ""process race"" to create smaller chips, but it could pick up third-party orders for lower-end chips at larger nodes. This could be a threat to TSMC, which still generated 59% of its revenue from older nodes (larger than 5nm and 7nm) last year.
So where will TSMC be in five years?
I believe TSMC will remain the world's top contract chipmaker over the next five years, despite its geopolitical threats and aggressive spending measures. I'm not sure if it can replicate its monstrous gains from the past five years through 2026, but the secular growth of the semiconductor market should propel its stock much higher and enable it to outperform the broader market.

July 19 (Reuters) - The Dow and the S&P 500 indexes sank more than 2% on Monday as investors sold off economically sensitive shares and travel stocks and sought the perceived safety of bonds on fears that a spike in COVID-19 cases would derail a broader economic recovery.
New infections surged in parts of Asia and England, while U.S. COVID-19 cases soared 70% last week, fueled by the Delta variant.
All 11 S&P sectors fell, with the so-called value stocks, including financial .SPSY, industrial .SPLRCI, materials .SPLRCM and energy .SPNY, dropping between 2.5% and 4.4%.
The banking sub-index .SPXBK sank 3.4%, tracking a fall in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR to mid-February lows. US/

2021-07-19 00:00:00+00:00,A Reduced Payout Could Be Coming for These High-Yield Dividend Stocks,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-reduced-payout-could-be-coming-for-these-high-yield-dividend-stocks-2021-07-19,,,"When investors look for dividend stocks, they should generally avoid companies in fading industries (like big tobacco), companies that regularly pay out over 100% of their earnings or free cash flow (FCF) as dividends, and companies that only pay high yields because their stocks have been crushed. Checking those three boxes will help you avoid some high-yield traps.
But investors should also be wary of companies with shifting priorities, stagnant businesses, and unusual dividend payout models. Here are three high-yield stocks that fit those three categories, respectively -- Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Xerox (NYSE: XRX), and Nintendo (OTC: NTDOY).
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Intel
Intel pays a forward yield of 2.5%, its dividends consumed just 29% of its FCF over the past 12 months, and the chipmaker has raised its payout annually for six straight years -- and its stock trades at just 12 times forward earnings. But it's cheap for obvious reasons.
A series of manufacturing missteps caused its internal foundry to fall behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) in the ""process race"" to create smaller chips in recent years. As a result, its rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) -- which outsources its production to TSMC -- now sells more advanced chips than Intel.
Intel's previous CEO, Bob Swan, was a former CFO who prioritized cost-cutting measures, big buybacks, and continuous dividend payments instead of resolving the company's pressing R&D issues. Swan also considered outsourcing more of its chips to third-party foundries like TSMC.
But Intel replaced Swan with Pat Gelsinger, an engineering veteran and former CEO of VMWare, earlier this year. Instead of abandoning Intel's foundry business, Gelsinger doubled down on expanding the company's U.S. plants with a $20 billion investment. Intel is also reportedly interested in buying GlobalFoundries, AMD's former foundry partner, for $30 billion to accelerate those efforts. But it will require a lot more spending for Intel to catch up to TSMC.
TSMC remains roughly two chip generations ahead, and it is gearing up to spend $100 billion over the next three years to boost its overall capacity. Therefore, investors shouldn't be surprised if Intel reduces its dividend -- which consumed $5.6 billion in cash last year -- to save its core business.
2. Xerox
Xerox pays a forward yield of 4.4%, and it spent just 53% of its FCF on those payments over the past 12 months. The stock trades at just ten times forward earnings. However, Xerox hasn't raised its dividend since 2017, and its two core businesses could be in serious trouble.
Xerox's equipment sales, which primarily consist of printers, copiers, and their related supplies, have declined in recent years due to lengthy upgrade cycles, the rise of paperless offices, and competition from generic ink and toner suppliers. As a result, its post-sale business, which generates revenue from installation, maintenance, financing, and add-on service fees, has also withered.
Activist investor Carl Icahn tried to push Xerox to buy HP (NYSE: HPQ) last year, but HP resisted the hostile bid and Xerox gave up earlier this year. Meanwhile, Xerox's FCF growth remains tepid, especially if we exclude the cash it gained from exiting its Fujifilm (OTC: FUJIY) joint venture in 2019:
Source: YCharts
Analysts expect Xerox's revenue and earnings to rise 3% and 33%, respectively, this year against an easy comparison to the pandemic. But next year, its revenue is expected to dip 2% as it resorts to aggressive cost-cutting measures and buybacks to boost its EPS -- which might rise 18%.
Xerox probably won't cut its dividend anytime soon, but the secular decline of its core business suggests it would be smarter to reduce its dividend -- which consumed $230 million in cash last year -- and invest in fresh ways to grow its long-term revenue again.
3. Nintendo
Nintendo paid a trailing yield of 3.6% over the past 12 months. However, the Japanese gaming giant's semi-annual dividends fluctuate every year based on its operating and net profits.
Specifically, Nintendo's interim dividend equals 33% of its consolidated operating profit in the first half of its fiscal year, while its year-end dividend is based on the higher of two numbers -- 33% of its consolidated operating profit or 50% of the net profit attributable to its shareholders.
That payout structure has enabled Nintendo to pay consecutively higher annual dividends over the past four years. But all of that growth can be attributed to the launch of its popular Switch console in 2017.
Nintendo's revenue surged 34% in fiscal 2020, which ended in March, as its net profit jumped 88%. That growth was partly attributed to the pandemic, which drew more gamers to the Switch and popular games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
But this year Nintendo expects its revenue and earnings to decline 9% and 29%, respectively, as the pandemic passes, new consoles compete for attention, and the global chip shortage limits its production of new Switches. Nintendo's new Switch OLED console may cushion the blow when it arrives this October, but its lower profits will inevitably reduce its total dividends this year.

NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - A surge in Delta variant infections sparked a broad sell-off on Wall Street on Monday as investors feared renewed COVID-19 shutdowns and a protracted economic recovery.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session sharply lower, with the S&P and the Nasdaq suffering their largest one-day percentage drop since mid-May.
The blue-chip Dow had its worst day in nearly nine months.
The risk-off sentiment also sent U.S. 10-year Treasury yields sliding, pulling rate sensitive banks stock prices with them. The S&P 500 Banks index .SPXBK dropped 3.3%.
""Much of it is related to the Delta (variant),"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""There’s some concern too that maybe the economy is not going to open up as quickly as everyone thinks, and the big boom that everyone’s expecting is going to be more of a pop than a boom.""
The highly contagious COVID-19 Delta variant, now the dominant strain across the globe, has caused a surge in new infections and deaths, nearly exclusively among unvaccinated people.

""Global availability of the vaccine has been an issue from day one."" Nolte said. ""That’s been out there for a long time. This is the latest iteration of that. We still have a long way to go.""
Travel and leisure stocks plunged, with the S&P 1500 Airline index .SPCOMAIR shedding 3.8% and the S&P 1500 Hotel and Restaurant index .SPCOMHRL off 2.7%.
The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, a gauge of investor anxiety, gained 4.1 points to 22.50, its highest closing level in two months.

All 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 closed deep in negative territory. Energy shares .SPNY, weighed down by plunging crude prices, fell 3.6%, their worst day since March.
Second-quarter earnings reporting season is under way, with 41 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 90% have beaten consensus estimates, according to Refinitiv.
Among high-profile names, Netflix NFLX.O, Twitter TWTR.K, Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N, United Airlines UAL.O and Intel INTC.O, along with a host of industrials from Honeywell HON.N to Harley-Davidson HOG.N are due to post results this week.
Analysts now see year-on-year S&P 500 earnings growth of 72% for the April to June period, substantially higher than the 54% annual growth forecast at the beginning of the quarter, per Refinitiv.
International Business Machines Corp IBM.N beat quarterly revenue estimates based on the strength of its cloud computing segment. Its shares were up over 3% in after-hours trading.
Zoom Video Communications Inc ZM.O announced a $14.7 billion all-stock deal to buy cloud-based call center operator Five9 Inc FIVN.O. The teleconferencing services provider's shares dropped 2.1%, while Five9's jumped 5.9%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 5.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.52-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 21 new highs and 252 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.02 billion shares, compared with the 10.17 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - Stocks on Wall Street fell as much as 2% on Monday, with the Dow posting its worst day in nine months, as a rise in worldwide coronavirus cases and increasing U.S. deaths drove investors out of risky assets, crushing bond yields and share prices.
Oil prices plunged more than 6%, driven down both by worries about future demand and by an OPEC+ agreement to increase supply.
U.S. Treasury bond yields tumbled to five-month lows, with the yield on benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR sinking 12.2 basis points to 1.177%, close to the session's low of 1.176%, a level last seen in February.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended trading sharply lower, with the S&P and the Nasdaq suffering their largest one-day percentage falls since mid-May.
Rising COVID-19 cases, spurred by the Delta variant, fueled fears of a resurgence, with the average number of infections per day tripling in the past 30 days in the United States, according to an analysis of Reuters data.
Deaths, which can lag weeks behind a rise in cases, rose 25% last week from the previous seven days with an average of 250 people dying a day.
""The markets suffered a summer swoon today with COVID fears again at the forefront of investors' minds,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.
""Despite the negative tone weighing on markets, we remain optimistic that the economy is on a strong footing and, although the path will be uneven, the trend is still toward increasing growth and higher corporate profits.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 725.81 points, or 2.09%, to 33,962.04, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 68.67 points, or 1.59%, to 4,258.49 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 152.25 points, or 1.06%, to 14,274.98.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 1.63%.
Investors are also worried about the specter of elevated inflation, which the market has long feared.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday acknowledged that prices for some items such as vehicles have increased but said that his administration would remain vigilant over inflation and the havoc it could wreak on the economy.
""Fear of stagflation will be a major concern for investors if a resurgence in COVID infections causes economies to slow while consumer prices continue an upward trajectory,"" said Peter Essele, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network, in an e-mailed statement.
COVID-19 outbreaks are occurring in parts of the country with low vaccination rates. About one in five new cases is in Florida, and the vast majority of people hospitalized for COVID are unvaccinated.
""The big concern for the market is whether we are going to see a slowdown in the global economic recovery, and this could be the overriding force which results in a bad period for equities in the weeks ahead,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at brokerage AJ Bell.
Travel and leisure stocks sank, with the S&P 1500 Airline index .SPCOMAIR shedding 3.8% and the S&P 1500 Hotel and Restaurant index .SPCOMHRL off 2.7%.
The greenback climbed to a more than three-month peak against a basket of major currencies. But the dollar is off highs as the yen and Swiss franc advanced with the decline in risk appetite.
FOREVER CHANGED?
Oil prices fell as OPEC+ agreed to boost output, causing concerns about a crude surplus if an economic slowdown comes to pass. The decline was the largest since late March. O/R
U.S. crude CLc1 recently fell 7.39% to $66.50 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was at $68.65, down 6.71% on the day.
Economists at Bank of America downgraded their forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to 6.5%, from 7% previously.
""Despite rising vaccination rates, a return to pre-Corona normality seems questionable,"" Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX and commodity research at Commerzbank, wrote in a research note.

While investors seek direction amidst conflicting data on the economic recovery, the world of tech continues to expand. With this expansion, I could see some of the top software stocks in the stock market today being in focus. After all, you could argue that software is the lifeblood of most, if not all tech around us today. This would be the case as the programming that directs most electronics is based on software. Because of this, the software industry’s growth runway could virtually grow as long as tech continues to evolve. Now, regardless of how the market fares, there are plenty of options for investors to choose from.
For instance, the fintech industry relies heavily on software to operate, to say the least. Evidently, the likes of PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Square (NYSE: SQ) provide contactless transaction services through software. Across the globe, consumer demand for both companies’ offerings continues to rise amidst the pandemic. Likewise, both PYPL stock and SQ stock are already sitting on gains of over 200% since their pandemic era lows. If that wasn’t enough, Square is also looking to create a “decentralized finance business” focusing on Bitcoin. Given the recent attention around the blockchain software that encompasses the cryptocurrency, Square appears keen to expand its horizons.
At the same time, there are countless other relevant software stocks in our tech-reliant world today to consider investing in. Looking towards the health care industry? The likes of Veeva (NYSE: VEEV) continue to serve biotech companies via its cloud-computing wares. Should you be keen to invest in digital acceleration trends? Some would consider customer relationship management company Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). All in all, the stock market seems to have plenty to offer in terms of software stocks. Could one of these be a top pick now?
Best Software Stocks To Watch This Month
Intel Corporation  (NASDAQ: INTC)
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)
Zoom Video Communications Inc. (NASDAQ: ZM)
Intel Corporation
Intel is a multinational technology company that is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. It is an industry leader and creates world-changing technology. The company has been investing heavily in its chip design and software. Last month, it showcased multiple groundbreaking network deployments and unveiled its Intel Network Platform at the MWC 2021 virtual event. It also announced new additions to its leading product portfolio for 5G and edge, reaffirming its position as the leading network silicon provider. INTC stock closed Monday’s trading session at $54.64 a share.
Recently, the company received an $85 price target from Baird. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra reiterated an Outperform rating on the company. The analyst also notes that Intel is in talks to buy GlobalFoundaries. GlobalFoundaries is a semiconductor manufacturer and the deal with Intel could be worth $30 billion. Intel’s CEO Pat Gelsinger is focusing on growing the company’s foundry operations and building chips for other companies. Also, by buying GlobalFoundaries, it would give Intel more manufacturing capacity and a larger customer base.
Last week, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.347 per share on the company’s common stock and the dividend will be payable on September 1, 2021. It has also been firing on all cylinders as it announced a slew of new products last month.

Next on this list is Microsoft. The company has also been actively helping businesses transform and adopt digital tools with its cloud technology and co-innovation approach. Earlier in the year, the company announced industry-specific cloud solutions with security and privacy built-in. MSFT stock currently trades at $277.01 apiece as of Monday’s close and has been up by over 25% year-to-date.
Last week, Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) and Microsoft announced that they are teaming up to offer virtual care integration for health systems and hospitals. In detail, Teladoc Health’s Solo platform for hospitals and health systems will be integrated into the Microsoft Teams environment. This would strengthen physician and patient access to best-in-class virtual health care. Together, they will be able to deliver integrated, enterprise solutions that will help make the overall experience of virtual care more efficient. The collaboration will also deliver a seamless and unified experience for health care providers, leveraging leading data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning expertise from both companies.

Zoom Video Communications Inc.
Another major name in the software space now would be Zoom Video Communications Inc. For the most part, this was more true than ever at the early phases of the pandemic. While most people were homebound and disconnected, Zoom’s services stepped up to the plate. Even now, the company’s services remain vital as certain parts of the world continue to fight the pandemic. Additionally, fears over another wave of coronavirus are circulating. In turn, I can imagine that investors would be keeping an eye on ZM stock as well. With the company’s shares trading at  $354.20 at the end of Monday’s trading session, could it be worth buying at these levels?
While that remains to be seen, Zoom seems to be keen on staying relevant in the cloud communications industry now. As of yesterday, the company will be acquiring cloud contact center provider Five9 in an all-stock transaction worth $14.7 billion. This would mark the tech industry’s second-largest U.S. deal this year. With the addition of Five9, Zoom would be bolstering its Zoom Phone cloud phone system by optimizing its lines further. Not to mention, Zoom will also have access to Five9’s pool of clients which cater to billions of customers annually.
While most would expect the distance communication giant to slow down amidst vaccine rollouts, Zoom continues to build its portfolio. Notably, it is doing so with post-pandemic relevance in mind. Time will tell if the company can make the most out of this massive play. Should things go as planned, would you consider ZM stock worth watching?

July 19 (Reuters) - The Dow sank more than 2% on Monday as investors sold off economically sensitive shares and travel stocks and sought the perceived safety of bonds on fears that a spike in COVID-19 cases would derail a broader economic recovery.
New infections surged in parts of Asia and England, while U.S. COVID-19 cases soared 70% last week, fueled by the Delta variant.
All 11 S&P sectors fell, with the so-called value stocks, including financial .SPSY, industrial .SPLRCI, materials .SPLRCM and energy .SPNY, dropping between 2.0% and 3.9%.
The banking sub-index .SPXBK sank 3%, tracking a fall in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR to mid-February lows. US/

The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX snapped a three-week winning streak on Friday, with only defensive sectors, perceived to be relatively safe during times of economic uncertainty, posting small gains.
On Monday, the technology-heavy Nasdaq index .IXIC outperformed the broader market as investors again flocked to the growth-linked stocks that led Wall Street's recovery from its coronavirus-lows last year.
""This is a way for investors to hedge the risk of COVID-19,"" said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors in Newport Beach, California.
""We know the tech stocks will tend to do better when there's less stability, as they are less sensitive to consumers increasing their spending on services and going out.""
Still, by 12:07 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.14%.
By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI sank 815.67 points, or 2.35%, and was on track for its worst session since October 2020, while the S&P 500 .SPX slipped 1.72% and was set for its biggest one-day percentage fall since May.
Economically sensitive small caps .RUT and transports .DJT were down 0.7% and 1.6% respectively.
The CBOE volatility index .VIX, dubbed Wall Street's fear gauge, jumped to a two-month high.
Shares of travel-related companies, which had just begun to climb after suffering steep losses during pandemic-driven lockdowns last year, fell again on Monday. The S&P 500 Airlines sub index .SPLRCAIR slumped 2.9%.

July 19 (Reuters) - Semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries said on Monday it will build a second factory near its in Malta, New York, headquarters, and spend $1 billion to boost output to address the global chip shortage.
GlobalFoundries, owned by the United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co, makes radio-frequency communications chips for 5G, chips for high-reliability manufacturing for automotive customers, and other specialized semiconductors.
The new factory will be at GlobalFoundries' ""Fab 8"" site in upstate New York, where its headquarters moved from California earlier this year, it said at an event announcing the plans.
The factory will double the site's chipmaking capacity and add 1,000 jobs, with funding from private-public partnerships, including federal and state investments.
GlobalFoundries plans to spend $1 billion immediately to boost the existing factory's output by 150,000 wafers per year. Wafers are the silicon discs on which semiconductors are made in bulk, and each one can contain thousands of chips.
""This chip shortage has been in the making for a decade and a half,"" Chief Executive Thomas Caulfield said at the event attended by U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat.
The news came after a bill containing $52 billion for semiconductor manufacturing passed the U.S. Senate this summer. It awaits action in the U.S. House of Representatives.
""We don't just want to create four, five or six more fabs, though we do want to do that. We need the whole ecosystem,"" Raimondo said at the event.
Mubadala is planning to take GlobalFoundries public in an initial public offering, sources have told Reuters. The Wall Street Journal last week reported that Intel Corp INTC.O was exploring acquiring GlobalFoundries for $30 billion.
A person familiar with the matter told Reuters there are no active discussions with Intel yet, and Mubadala is focused on taking GlobalFoundries public as planned.
Mubadala declined to comment.
